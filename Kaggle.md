# Papyrus: A dataset for multilingual keyphrase generation

Papyrus is a dataset collected from Université de Montréal institutional repository, and consists in triplets pairs of title, abstracts, and keyphrases.
The task is to learn to generate the keyphrases using the information from the abstract and title. Due to its multilingual nature, papyrus comes in 4 flavors:

- Papyrus-e: Generate english keyphrases from english abstracts
- Papyrus-f: Generate french keyphrases from french abstracts
- Papyrus-m: Generate keyphrase in any language, from an abstract in that same language
- Papyrus-a: Generate keyphrases in many languages, from a concatenation of abstracts in these same languages

Train, dev, and test splits are given and the same documents are in each split through all datasets, which allows for interesting comparisons of the performance between the various tasks.
The original github repository, containing the raw data and all preprocessing scripts, are at https://github.com/smolPixel/French-keyphrase-generation
