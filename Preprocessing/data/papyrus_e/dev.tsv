0	Représentation et fétichisation des femmes trans racisées dans les médias audiovisuels	This master's thesis focuses on the representation and fetishization of trans women of color in audiovisual media. This study first describes the evolution of trans-feminine representation from the 1950s to recent years. Trans women of color were virtually invisible in the early decades. The thesis distinguishes anti-assimilationist representation from integrationist representation. The film Paris Is Burning (1991, Livingston) announces a change and a new reality in media. The impact of the New Queer Cinema documentary is still significant to this day. The television series Pose (Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk, Steven Canals, FX, 2018-2021) pays homage to director Jennie Livingston's film almost thirty years later. The thesis examines the feminist, intersectional and queer theory of the 1990s to understand these studies' evolution. This analysis questions the subversion of gender roles and the impact of performance and performativity in trans* media images.

1	Du désir dans l’écriture (ailleurs, une rencontre) ; suivi de Peut-être que dehors	The essay Du désir dans l'écriture (ailleurs, une rencontre) proposes a quest for decompartmentalization – carried out in a pandemic context of confinement – for textual forms that require a rethinking of the categories defining (and limiting) the modes of existence and circulation of cultural objects. This reflection is articulated, among other things, through a reading of La nuit juste avant les forêts, a work by Bernard-Marie Koltès that is irreducible to what is called “theater” and that nevertheless invites the sharing of an experience: despite the endless flow of words drawn in one direction, the word overflows its medium (the page, the stage) and a true communion catches whoever is there, outside the diegesis, to welcome it. By approaching the text beyond its mediation, this thesis proposes an intuitive contribution, based on research-creation, to the thought of communication (and its impossibility). As an extension of the theory, Peut-être que dehors embodies this quest for a living word in practice. The artistic and meditative proposal takes the form of a series of fragments that render in a fragmented way a narrative of traumatic memory, made of holes and blanks. The textual configuration reflects on the one hand the stammering of saying what is usually kept silent, and on the other hand the space that is missing to breathe and heal. In conditions of solitude, of isolation, the voice of writing questions what it takes to create trust and encounter, community perhaps, with whoever receives the words.	interpellation , Bernard-Marie Koltès , La nuit juste avant les forêts , word , between , text , experience , calling , creative writing , utopia	en	26483.0
2	Agresseurs sexuels sadiques : profil psychodéveloppemental, et hétérogénéité du modus operandi	To date, there has been no consensus in the literature on the characteristics of the sadistic sexual aggressor. This has been largely the result of the limitations of studies of this phenomenon (e.g., idiosyncratic definitions of sexual sadism, heterogeneous samples, temporality fixed at adulthood). In an effort to address these limitations, we identified the distinguishing features of sadistic (n = 69) and nonsadistic (n = 137) sexual aggressors against adult women, all of whom were incarcerated in Quebec (Canada), using the Severe Sexual Sadism Scale (SESAS), an empirically validated measurement instrument for sexual sadism, as well as other variables. Bivariate (chi-square) analyses revealed that sadistic and nonsadistic sexual aggressors of adult women differed in several ways, including developmental (e.g., victimization before age 18), psychological (e.g., personality, psychopathology), sexological (e.g., deviant sexual fantasies), and criminological (e.g., modus operandi). To determine whether sexual sadism is a heterogeneous phenomenon, latent class analyses were conducted on the SESAS items. These analyses revealed that sexual sadism is not heterogeneous, manifesting itself differently depending on the characteristics of the sexual aggressor. The above results and their theoretical and clinical implications are discussed.	SESAS , Sexual sadism , Rapist , Latent class analysis , Developmental	en	26466.0
3	La gestion des bris de condition par les professionnels travaillant dans les centres résidentiels communautaires	This thesis aims to understand the decision-making process regarding the management of breach of condition for parolees in the community. More specifically, this study seeks to understand how the relation built between the parolee and his supervisor intervene in the decision-making process. The research also aims to explore how the organisational context and the sociopolitical context have an impact on the management regarding the breach of condition. To proceed, we used a methodology based on a qualitative approach. Accordingly, we conducted nine (9) semi-directed interviews with professionals supervising parolees and managing breach of condition in the community. Results from the interviews are divided in two categories. The first category includes the dimensions related to the interpersonal context. This context includes the representations of the participants regarding the parolees and the parole itself. These dimensions are operationalised in a key moment of this process, which is the disciplinary meeting. The second category describes the dimensions related to the organisational context. These dimensions include the community approach, the decision-making framework and the socio-political context around the management of the breach of condition. Our analyses illustrate how the decision-making process is related to the interrelation between multiple dynamics from which an expert knowledge is produced. Those dynamics are formed around the relation between the parolee and the professional, the knowledge from the organisational context, the dynamic from within the clinical team and the relation with the correctional service. The management of breach of condition also lies on the tension between the organisation’s philosophy, the representations of the participants and the discourses from the socio-political context. This context includes the political mainstream, the administrative context and the mediatic events that intervene on the expert knowledge produced by the professionals in which their discretionary power lies in the decision-making. Finally, we went back to our objectives and open the study on recommendations for future research.	Reintegration , community supervision , experience , work , risk assessment	en	26464.0
4	Zinc and Zirconium catalysts in rac-lactide polymerization	The phenoxy-imine ligand bearing heteroatom-containing N and O were prepared from condensation of paraformaldehyde, 4-(tert-butyl)-2-tritylphenol with di-(2-picolyl)amine. LZnN(SiMe3)2 was prepared by reaction of Zn(N(SiMe3)2)2 and the ligand. The complex has been studied by X-ray diffraction and NMR. Application of this complex in rac-lactide polymerization gave atactic PLA via a catalytic-site mediated chain-end control mechanism. Pyridylaminophenol ligands were prepared from phenol (2,4-di-tert-butylphenol, 2,4-di-cholorolphenol, 2,4-di-methylphenol), pyridine-2-ylmethylamine and formaldehyde (LH2 = (2,4-X2C6(OH)H2(5-CH2)2N(CH2C5H4N), X = Me or Cl). Reaction of Zr(OnPr)4 with 2 equiv of LH2 gave L2Zr. L2Zr were mixtures of C2-symmetric isomers, which was confirmed by NMR, DFT and X-ray diffraction studies. The only isomer for X=Me was the cis-isomer while the major isomer for X=Cl was the trans-isomer. All complex were active in rac-lactide polymerization at 140 °C and heterotactic PLA was obtained. L2Zr followed an activated monomer mechanism with benzyl alcohol as co-initiator.

5	Le cerveau «immature» : genèse et diffusion d’un nouveau discours social sur les jeunes délinquants aux États-Unis	This dissertation investigates the role of neuroscientific knowledge about the adolescent brain in the contemporary mutations of the field of juvenile justice in the United States. More specifically, it analyzes the socio-historical dynamics whereby the theory of adolescent brain immaturity came to play a key role in three Supreme Court rulings which, between 2005 and 2012, made the death penalty and life imprisonment unconstitutional for juvenile offenders. Located at the intersection of the sociology of science and the sociology of the penal field, this dissertation examines this “legal triptych” in light of the history of the juvenile justice system in the United States. I argue that the contemporary debates surrounding the age of criminal responsibility are the latest manifestation of the symbolic struggles that various fractions of the dominant class have historically waged around the definition of the “problem” of juvenile delinquency.  Following a socio-historical perspective, this dissertation traces the oppositions and alliances between scientists, philanthropic foundations, learned societies, government agencies, elected politicians, and legal actors who have shaped the trajectory of the field of juvenile justice in the U. S. One key focus of the dissertation is to examine the “work of symbolic manipulation” (Bourdieu, 2001) of the “new reformers”, an heterogenous alliance of agents from the dominant class who, at the turn of the 21st century, constructed and disseminated a new social discourse locating the causes of juvenile delinquency in the brain of adolescents. To address this focus, I formulate a critique of the epistemological foundations and political uses of this discourse. I give an account of the power relations, notably of age, class and race, that this discourse of immaturity helps to reinforce, despite the progressive ambitions of its promoters. The analyses presented in this dissertation are based on a diversified material combining judicial archives, scientific articles, grey literature and 37 semi-structured interviews conducted with scholars, judges, members of philanthropic foundations, of activist groups and of government agencies. The heterogeneity of this material provides the means to track how the discourse of immaturity shifts from the laboratory to the courtroom or from the U.S. Congress to correctional institutions. It allows me to account for the specific field logics that generate the action of these agents, as well as the cross-cutting logics that lead them to ally themselves to act politically in order to “save” juvenile offenders.	neurosciences , adolescent brain , neuroscience , neurolaw , penal field , U.S. Supreme Court , juvenile justice , field theory	en	26440.0
6	Dynamique des communautés bactériennes et effet du glyphosate lors du compostage de biomasse lignocellulosique	"Composting is an anthropic process based on the natural decay of biomass that exploits the enzymatic activity of microorganisms under the control of several environmental factors. Due to their composition and low moisture content, lignocellulosic residues are particularly suitable for composting and serve as a structuring element, which confers them an important role in the process. Although mostly of plant origin, the organic matter (OM) directed towards composting sites is highly diversified, as are the types of contaminants it can contain. The impact of these contaminants, such as glyphosate, on the biodegradation process and their persistence in the environment remain to be investigated. The objective of this thesis is thus to report on the effect of the composition of the lignocellulosic biomass and the presence of glyphosate on the evolution of the physicochemical parameters and the recruitment of bacteria during composting, while ensuring the follow-up of the transformation of the vegetable organic matter and the degradation of glyphosate during the process.  Two field studies were conducted to measure the effect of stem age and winter storage on the transformation of wood chips, and to study the dynamics of bacterial succession involved in the carbon and nitrogen cycle during the composting of plant residues. The results obtained revealed a difference in the composition of 2-year-old and 3-year-old stems from shrub willow (Salix sp.), with the younger ones containing more extractable compounds and the more mature ones richer in structural sugars. These differences were reflected in a higher and faster temperature rise in the younger chip pile. A decrease in extractives, retention of structural sugars, and an increase in the proportion of lignin demonstrate the importance of the soluble carbon source for the initiation of wood decomposition and recalcitrance of lignocellulosic elements. The second experiment revealed a very high diversity of bacteria responsible for the decomposition of cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin during the thermophilic phase of composting. This phase, during which intense activity took place, had fewer species, but they were very abundant, a trend that reversed as the organic matter matured. The observed dynamics reflect a functional redundancy of the communities, which seems to evolve according to the temperature, oxygen level and nature of the available substrate.  A third experiment conducted in a controlled environment demonstrated the negligible impact of glyphosate on microbial activity and the evolution of physicochemical parameters during composting. Glyphosate was almost or completely degraded after composting, while the main product of degradation, aminoethylphosphonic acid (AMPA), was not detected. The impact of glyphosate on bacterial communities was also negligible, while species richness at different sampling times was the same when comparing the control treatment and the treatment containing ""pure"" glyphosate. The beta-diversity analysis found no significant difference between the communities present in the control and glyphosate treatments, while a few bacteria were differentially abundant between the two treatments, the vast majority being less abundant in the glyphosate treatment.  This thesis has thus highlighted the importance of the initial nature of the organic matter on microbial activity as well as on the recruitment and dynamics of bacterial communities during composting, while the presence of glyphosate was shown to be a weak determinant of decomposition processes and species abundance. This information should help to optimize the treatment of organic matter by composting and to better assess the potential risks associated with composting contaminated biomass."

7	Environnement physique et environnement social : conséquences physiologiques de la sélection des habitats	Habitat selection is an important behaviour that relates individuals to the environmental conditions in their habitat, and is generally studied to infer population-level patterns of distributions. Habitat selection varies among individuals and there is growing evidence that individual differences often exceed population differences in habitat selection. On the one hand, if habitat selection is adaptive, it could be hypothesized that individuals would select habitats that would maximize their fitness. On the other hand, environmental conditions in habitats can have physiological consequences, which can be amplified or masked by the social environment. Therefore, the general objective of this thesis was to better understand the determinants and physiological consequences of habitat selection.  We created and compared the predictive capacity of habitat selection models for smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu integrating individual variability. Our results show that by integrating individual variability, we could identify variables influencing individual-, group-, and population-level habitat selection. Models that included variables referring to presence of shelter had the best predictive capacity. Further, we identified groups of individuals defined by their habitat selection. Nevertheless, variation in habitat selection among individuals was higher than that among groups.  Presence of shelter was the main correlate of habitat selection for smallmouth bass. We then we tested whether presence of shelter could influence smallmouth bass metabolic traits estimated during respirometry trials. In presence of shelter, resting metabolic rates (RMR) were lower than in absence of shelter for smallmouth bass from a lake population. There was no difference in RMR for smallmouth bass from a river population. Further, dominant individuals showed reduced recovery time (RT) in presence of shelter, while no difference was observed in subordinate individuals. We investigated how social group size and availability of shelter could influence metabolic rate. This project was conducted on Eurasian minnow Phoxinus phoxinus, a highly social fish. Fish held in smaller groups had higher standard metabolic rate as compared to that of fish held in larger groups. Presence of shelter during respirometry trials was associated with reduced metabolic rates, regardless of group size fish were held in. Our results suggest that social group size may directly influence energy demands of individuals, highlighting the importance of understanding the role of group size on variations in physiological traits associated with energy expenditure. Our results highlight the importance of considering the physical and social environment to better understand the physiological consequences of habitat selection.

8	Nouvelles perspectives sur les algèbres de type Askey–Wilson	This thesis is divided in three parts which all orbit around the same theme: the study of algebraic structures related to the algebras of Askey–Wilson type. In the first part we obtain two interpretations that are dual in the sense of Howe for the algebras of Askey–Wilson type. Meanwhile, the other two parts are concerned with generalizations of these algebras. In the second part, we study degenerations of the Sklyanin algebra, which are built out of generators that are more fundamental than those of the Askey–Wilson algebra. In the last part, generalizations of the Askey–Wilson type algebras to higher rank are studied. In the first part, dual interpretations are obtained for the Racah, Bannai–Ito, Askey–Wilson, Higgs, Hahn, \(q\)-Higgs and dual \(-1\) Hahn algebras by invoking Howe duality.  The way that this Howe duality operates is made explicit through the examination of a dimensional reduction procedure.  A 2D superintegrable superconformal quantum mechanics model, whose symmetry algebra is the one of dual \(-1\) Hahn type, is also introduced and solved. In the second part, we study algebras that are generated by contiguity and ladder operators that encode properties of families of orthogonal polynomials.  We show that these operators belong to the Sklyanin–Heun class of operators, which can be defined for various grids.  We also show how their algebraic relations correspond to those of degenerations of the Sklyanin algebra.  Then, we show how various families of para-polynomials support finite-dimensional irreducible representations of these degenerate algebras. From the linear, quadratic, exponential and Askey–Wilson grids, we are respectively led to the para-Krawtchouk, para-Racah, \(q\)-para-Krawtchouk and \(q\)-para-Racah polynomials. Later, we connect the para-Krawtchouk polynomials (and other families of orthogonal polynomials) to tridiagonal representations of the deformed Jordan plane. In the final part, we explore higher rank generalizations of the Racah and Askey–Wilson algebras. To that end, their realizations in terms of intermediate Casimir elements are studied.  The role of the braided \(R\)-matrix is understood as follows: it connects various intermediate Casimir elements through conjugation. We obtain an isomorphism between the Kauffman bracket skein algebra of the four-punctured sphere and the algebra generated by the intermediate Casimir elements in \(U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)^{\otimes3}\).  This leads to a diagrammatic interpretation of the conjugation by the braided \(R\)-matrix mentioned in the above.  Lastly, a presentation of the centralizer \(Z_n(\mathfrak{sl}_2)\) of \(U(\mathfrak{sl}_2)\) in \(U(\mathfrak{sl}_2)^{\otimes n}\) by generators and relations is obtained and we show that this centralizer is isomorphic to a quotient (which we provide explicitly) of the higher rank Racah algebra \(R(n)\).

9	Jeux édifiants, vertu et émotion : une éthique vidéoludique	What we feel when playing video games indicates something about us and transforms our person. Determining the ethical value of a video game hence requires to pay special attention to its emotional experience. In this doctoral thesis, we are interested in emotions transmitted by narrative video games and in virtues they put into practice. During the course of this examination, we will reflect on the place of video games in our lives and will provide conceptual tools to evaluate in detail the following examples: Dishonored (Arkane Studios, 2012), Frostpunk (11 bit studios, 2018), Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice (Ninja Theory, 2017), Neo Cab (Chance Agency, 2019), Outlast (Red Barrels, 2013), Spec Ops: The Line (Yager, 2012) and Vampyr (DONTNOD, 2018).  Our work is divided in three parts. The first one presents a theory of the emotional experience of video games. We defend that an emotion occurs at the encounter between a conceptual perception and a concern, and that video games orchestrate their emotional experience within a progression structure. The second part revisits the debate on “morally engaging” video games and on transgressive game content. In order to take into account the role of emotion, we introduce a virtue ethics according to which video games act as a training ground where our emotional dispositions are constituted. The third part is dedicated to the analysis of potentially edifying video games, which communicates virtues. We explore more particularly how courage and fear as well as justice and anger are connected in these games.	Video games , Ethics , Virtue , Psychology	en	26413.0
10	The politics of female friendship in contemporary speculative fiction	This project examines how politics and friendship are actualized in speculative fiction across different media in the twenty-first century. This thesis discusses how these interpersonal relationships affect the social sphere and the status quo of the fictional worlds in question. To guide the discussion, I use the concept of relational autonomy, which recognizes the interconnectedness of both autonomous individuals and the community at large, and ethics of care, which understands morality as relational and contextualized. I use these two frameworks in tandem to discuss how friendships are conducive to political participation. The first chapter presents an overarching discussion of Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale (1985) in its legacy to the feminist speculative fiction genre. Following, in the first section, I focus on notions of autonomy in relation to Renée Nault's graphic novel adaptation of Atwood’s novel (2019) and contrast it with Kelly Sue DeConnick and Valentine de Landro’s comic Bitch Planet (2013-2017). In the second section, I focus on the ethics of care as a process that can foster friendships with political implications by analyzing Hulu's TV adaptation of The Handmaid's Tale and BBC America's Orphan Black. SF offers the freedom to test different political ideas and to understand how society might react in extreme scenarios. These thought experiments reflect our own political struggles and shortcomings; ultimately, they might point at better ways to solve current problems.

11	Polyphonies féminines : exister et résister à travers l’hybridité poétique et sa traduction : Amelia Rosselli, Toni Maraini, Dahlia Ravikovitch et Yona Wallach	This thesis analyzes the poetry of Amelia Rosselli (1930–1996), Toni Maraini (1941), Dahlia Ravikovitch (1936–2005), and Yona Wallach (1944–1985) from the angle of protest. The main aim of this research is to study the subversive potential of poetic hybridity, as it shows in the work of these women poets. Through their writing, in fact, they rebel against the dictates of the patriarchal system. The context of these works are post-war Italy (Rosselli and Maraini) and the founding of the State of Israel (Ravikovitch and Wallach), both periods marked by militarist virilism and heroic values. According to my hypothesis, such virilism is one of the reasons why the poetic expression of these women is conceived as a battle. Each in their own way, the authors aspire to a social revolution, which focuses on the status of women and their writing. Which shapes does this battle take, and how is it reflected in the poetry of these authors? How is their writing expressed as a space for negotiation within the language of the fathers? Starting from the notion of hybridity, this thesis investigates the idea of a protest expression emanating from the interstices of the dominant discourse (Bhabha). This work is divided into three main parts. Firstly, I show how women appropriate and alter male language as a tool of dissent, thus creating a renovated language. Secondly, I focus on the appropriation and ingestion of the corpus of men: both in the sense of literary material (intertextuality), and as body stricto sensu (cannibalism). Finally, I analyze how the woman-subject conquers and hybridizes space and time, which have been normally defined by male privilege. The act of translation is directly connected with the process of hybridization. Translating, in fact, resolves in a new cannibalization of the corpus, which is then moved to another space-time dimension.  By approaching the texts in the original languages (Italian, French, Hebrew), as well as their translations (English, French, Italian), I show how the translation acts as a sounding box, amplifying the original intention of battle. Thanks to these new interpretive trajectories, focusing on the subversive dimension of these authors’ poetry, this work highlights the transformative power of substituting fixed categories imposed by patriarchal society with a more fluid vision of the world. Thus, the hybrid writing of women has the potential to transform the written page into a revolutionary space from which a new paradigm can emerge.

12	Some characteristics and arguments in favor of a science of machine behavior analysis	Researchers and practitioners recognize four domains of behavior analysis: radical behaviorism, the experimental analysis of behavior, applied behavior analysis, and the practice of behavior analysis. Given the omnipresence of technology in every sphere of our lives, the purpose of this conceptual article is to describe and argue in favor of a ffth domain: machine behavior analysis. Machine behavior analysis is a science that examines how machines interact with and produce relevant changes in their external environment by relying on replicability, behavioral terminology, and the philosophical assumptions of behavior analysis (e.g., selectionism, determinism, parsimony) to study artifcial behavior. Arguments in favor of a science of machine behavior include the omnipresence and impact of machines on human behavior, the inability of engineering alone to explain and control machine behavior, and the need to organize a verbal community of scientists around this common issue. Regardless of whether behavior analysts agree or disagree with this proposal, I argue that the feld needs a debate on the topic. As such, the current article aims to encourage and contribute to this debate.	Artifcial intelligence , Behavior analysis , Machine learning	en	26399.0
13	Polyphenol-peptide interactions in mitigation of Alzheimer’s disease : role of biosurface-induced aggregation	Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common age-related neurodegenerative disorder, responsible for nearly two-thirds of all dementia cases. In this review, we report the potential AD treatment strategies focusing on natural polyphenol molecules (green chemistry) and more specifically on the inhibition of polyphenol-induced amyloid aggregation/disaggregation pathways: in bulk and on biosurfaces. We discuss how these pathways can potentially alter the structure at the early stages of AD, hence delaying the aggregation of Aβ and tau. We also discuss multidisciplinary approaches, combining experimental and modelling methods, that can better characterize the biochemical and biophysical interactions between proteins and phenolic ligands. In addition to the surface-induced aggregation, which can occur on surfaces where protein can interact with other proteins and polyphenols, we suggest a new concept referred as “confinement stability”. Here. on the contrary, the adsorption of Aβ and tau on biosurfaces other than Aβ- and tau-fibrils, e.g. red blood cells (RBCs), can lead to confinement stability that minimizes the aggregation of Aβ and tau. Overall, these mechanisms may participate directly or indirectly in mitigating neurodegenerative diseases, by preventing protein self-association, slowing down the aggregation processes, and delaying the progression of AD.

14	Examining negative online social reaction to police use of force : the George Floyd and Jacob Blake events	Dealing with use of excessive force by the police has historically been a struggle in the United States. The 1992 protests in Los Angeles following the death of Rodney King are one example of public response to an instance of excessive use of force. More recently, the death of George Floyd led to widespread protests against excessive use of force and the current model of policing in general. The increasing popularity and availability of social media over the past decade have made it a powerful tool for mobilizing citizens and provided a place for protest. This study looks at the negative reactions of social media users to police use of force in the United States based on analysis of two significant instances: the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and the shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha. Using quantitative, forensic linguistics, and advanced topic modelling methodologies, three prominent aspects of policing identified in the literature – excessive use of force, racial bias, and legitimacy – were analysed from 14 days of tweets following each event. Analyses deal with trends in frequency, case similarities, and topic modelling. The results show important differences in negative online reaction to the two events, particularly regarding excessive use of force: those following the Floyd death focused on the technicalities of the intervention, while those responding to the Blake death focused on its aftermath. Analysis of tweets related to racial bias and police legitimacy revealed similar patterns, with users repeating criticisms such as differential treatment according to race and the need for changes in the policing model. The results also suggest that perceptions of excessive use of force and racial bias are deeply intertwined. Implications and issues are discussed.

15	Insights on the effect of water content in carburizing gas mixtures on the metal dusting corrosion of iron	Constituents of syngas, such as water, carbon monoxide and sulfides, can cause the degradation of the steel pipes they move through, leading to carbon dusting and corrosion. In spite of considerable attention to this process, many questions remain about its origin. We conduct reactive molecular dynamics simulations of multi-grain iron systems exposed to carburizing gas mixtures to investigate the effect of water content on metal dusting corrosion. To simulate carbon monoxide (CO) dissociation followed by carbon diffusion, we employ an extended-ReaxFF potential that allows accounting for both the high C atoms coordination in bulk iron as well as the lower C coordination at the iron surface and interfaces. The reactions happening in the sample at different water con- centrations and at different time frames are explored. We demonstrate that the presence of water on a clean Fe surface promotes different catalytic reactions at the beginning of the simulations that boost the C, H, O diffusion into the sample. At later stage, the formation of oxide scale leads to an elevated concentration of H2O/OH molecules on the surface due to the decrease in Fe affinity to dissociate water. This results into blocking the Fe catalytic sites leading to lower C and O diffusion to the bulk of the sample.

16	Comprendre les enjeux d’implantation de l’approche Integrated Psychological Treatment et l’adapter aux besoins de la clientèle atteinte de schizophrénie suivie en milieu carcéral et en psychiatrie légale	The Integrated Psychological Treatment is a cognitive-behavioral group approach developed in general psychiatry for individuals with schizophrenia. In recent years, IPT drew the attention of clinicians in correctional and forensic psychiatric settings. The abilities targeted were deemed relevant to address the needs of their clientele with schizophrenia. However, pilot projects revealed implementation issues compromising the sustainability of the approach in those settings (e.g., difficult interdisciplinary collaboration, limited possibilities to practice skills). Few implementation studies have been conducted in correctional and forensic psychiatric settings regarding psychosocial approaches. Moreover, a gap exists in standards of care compared to general psychiatry. The aim of this thesis is to identify the factors that need to be considered in the implementation of IPT in correctional and forensic psychiatric settings and to define the components that need to be adapted to meet the needs of the clientele with schizophrenia. Two projects were conducted. First, an implementation analysis was carried out with two cases: a correctional institution and a high security forensic psychiatric hospital. Stakeholders involved in the implementation were interviewed (IPT facilitators, patients, unit managers, unit staff, etc.). Results showed that IPT was deemed relevant for the clientele and could be delivered in secure settings. However, several issues specific to secure settings were identified (i.e., the complex legal and clinical picture of the clientele, the difficulty of working in interdisciplinarity, conflicts between security requirements and rehabilitation needs and the lack of recognition of IPT in national correctional programming). Following this project, a multiphase mixed method was carried out to develop immersive videos, an innovative solution to foster generalization of learning while addressing deficits contributing to violence (i.e., social cognition). The development phase integrated a participative approach and involved patients (n=7) and practitioners (n=7). Five scenarios were created. They sought to elicit self-referential and intentionality biases. The validation phase involved patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (n=7) and people without a known mental disorder (n=7). Results showed that it is possible to create immersive scenarios that have all the relevant attributes to foster a generalization of learning in situations leading to violence (i.e., ambiguous, realistic, generating a sense of presence and eliciting anger). Overall, this thesis highlights the factors that facilitate and hinder the implementation of IPT in correctional and forensic psychiatric settings. The adaptation of the approach must continue. Solutions such as immersive videos may facilitate a successful transformation of IPT in secure settings and support the rehabilitation of their clientele with schizophrenia.

17	Characterization of microvascular stress and cell death responses triggered by renal ischemia-reperfusion injury and their roles in progressive fibrosis	Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a crucial clinical event, with increasing incidence and mortality. Among various pathogenesis of AKI, ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is an important etiology, especially in the renal post-transplant scenario. The complex of programmed cell deaths (PCD) developed in IRI-induced AKI has been proven in a number of investigations. Renal tubular epithelial injury has been considered as the major contributor in AKI and multiple programmed tubular epithelial cell (TECs) deaths have been demonstrated in the literature. However, renal microvascular endothelial injury is attracting more attention as an important inducer of microvascular dysfunction and renal progressive fibrosis. Some investigators, including our team, have reported the development of renal endothelial apoptosis in the condition of ischemia. Apoptosis, a commonly known programmed cell death, has been elucidated in both renal TECs and microvascular endothelial cells (ECs) post-IRI and the activation of caspase-3 functions as the key effector of caspase-dependent apoptosis. To verify the importance of apoptosis in IRI- induced AKI, we applied the in vivo murine renal IRI model in wild-type and caspase-3 KO mice, with clamping the renal artery for 30 minutes (mild AKI model) or 60 minutes (severe AKI model). In regard to the mild AKI model, our result demonstrates that caspase-3 deficiency prevents ECs apoptotic death in all phases of AKI, attenuating microvascular rarefaction, collagen deposition, and renal fibrosis, while maintaining physical endothelial permeability in the long-term. Meanwhile, caspase-3 deletion aggravates tubular injury in the short-term by promoting TECs necroptosis but ameliorates long-term tubular injury through preserved peritubular capillaries (PTCs) function. Furthermore, caspase-3 deficiency also demonstrated a protective effect against renal microvascular rarefaction, progressive renal fibrosis, as well as enhanced endothelial permeability in the severe AKI model. Conclusively, our findings determine the crucial effect of microvascular endothelial apoptosis as an inducer of renal microvascular dysfunction, microvascular rarefaction, and progressive renal fibrosis in the pathophysiology of mild and severe AKI induced by IRI. Additionally, our results demonstrate the predominant importance of microvascular endothelial injury over tubular epithelial injury in predicting renal function loss at long-term post-IRI.

18	Transcriptional regulation in the dinoflagellates	Dinoflagellates are a large family of unicellular eukaryotes found in marine and freshwater ecosystems and are important primary producers in marine ecosystem. They are famous for several distinctive behaviors including forming harmful algal blooms called “red tides”, emission of bioluminescence in the ocean, and contributing to the formation of coral reefs. They have an unusual genome structure with large amounts of DNA and permanently condensed chromosomes throughout all stages of the cell cycle. The chromatin lacks observable nucleosomes and has a liquid crystal structure. Some genes are encoded in multiple repeats located in tandem arrays producing virtually identical proteins without any known conserved elements detected in the upstream promoter regions or intergenic spacers. These unique features make it difficult to understand how gene expression is regulated. This thesis describes two experimental tests for the hypothesis that transcriptional regulation is difficult and is not the primary means of regulating gene expression in dinoflagellates.  Dinoflagellates show a paucity of transcription factors, and of these, cold shock domain proteins (CSPs) account for the majority of potential DNA binding proteins in the transcriptome. Here, the potential of dinoflagellate CSPs from free-living Lingulodinium polyedra and reef-forming Symbiodinium kawagutii (recently renamed to Fugacium kawagutii) to act as sequence specific transcription factors was tested. These studies using four different CSPs showed a preference for RNA over both single and double stranded DNA using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). A second approach, testing for specific sequence binding by three cycles of selection and amplification binding (SAAB) did not enrich any consensus motif for any of the four proteins. We conclude dinoflagellate CSPs are more likely to function as RNA binding proteins than as transcription factors.  Expression of many genes in many dinoflagellate species has been reported to be regulated by light. This was tested for three genes whose expression was reported to be light-regulated in Symbiodinium kawagutii. The availability of a genome sequence for this species suggested that it might be possible to identify potential regulatory elements in the promoter of these genes. However, Northern blot analysis was unable to confirm differential expression of these three genes over a 24 hour light-dark cycle. Furthermore, RNA-Seq of samples taken at the end of the day and night also indicated these three genes were not light-induced. In total, only seven genes were found to be differentially expressed at dawn and dusk using RNA-Seq in triplicate with a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.1. All were of lower abundance at the end of the light period on a 12:12 L:D cycle suggesting possible repression by light. Three of these seven, picked at random, were examined using qPCR analysis. Only two of the three had lower abundance at the end of the day by this technique, and the fold difference was less than what was observed with RNA-Seq.  We conclude from this that there is little light regulation of gene expression in this dinoflagellate species. Taken together, the studies described here support the hypothesis that dinoflagellates do not rely on regulation of genes at the transcriptional level to the same extent as other organisms.

19	Phytoremédiation d’un sol contaminé par des contaminants organiques et inorganiques	The large number of contaminated sites in Quebec (Canada) and all around the world is a major public problem because of the toxicological risks they present for human and environmental health. In the municipality of Varennes (Quebec, Canada), located on the south shore of the Island of Montreal, the activities of a former petrochemical plant (Pétromont Inc.) have led to the accumulation of moderate to high concentrations of traces elements (TEs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), aliphatic petroleum hydrocarbons (C10-C50) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) on the land. In 2010, a short rotation intensive culture (SRIC) of willow has been established on the site, in order to conduct a field-scale phytoremediation experiment. Although this plantation of Salix miyabeana was established with a remediation view, no significant effect was reported on the concentration of soil contaminants during the first years of growth. Plant-based remediation processes can be difficult to predict in the fiel and require improvement in order to increase their effectiveness. Fertilization with organic amendments, as well as manipulating the plant microbiome, are two agronomic techniques commonly employed in traditional crop management, in order to increase biomass production and improve overall plant health. These approaches can also influence the mobility and bioavailability of some compounds in the soil. Since such modifications are known to have the potential to significantly improve the efficiency of plants in removing or transforming soil contaminants, these two agronomic techniques are of growing interest in the field of phytoremediation. This doctoral research aims to improve scientific knowledge in the field-scale phytoremediation application by addressing some aspects that affect these two agronomic approaches. Inside the already established willow plantation, a first study was carried out to assess the impact of soil organic amendment on the phytoremediation efficacy of the two willow cultivars (‘SX61’ and ‘SX64’). The soil of some experimental plots was covered with ramial chipped wood (RCW) combined or not with spent mushroom substrate (SMS) of Pleurotus ostreatus. After three growing seasons, the results showed that the addition of SMS to the RCW had no effect on the growth of the willows, as well as on their effectiveness in removing or reducing the concentration of contaminants on the site. The results nevertheless suggest that RCW helps immobilize some PAHs in the soil, in addition to increasing the efficiency of willows to phytoextract Zn. The presence of willows appears to have significantly reduced the natural attenuation of C10-C50 on the site. In addition, the concentrations of PCBs, Cd, Ni and ten PAHs, showed seasonal oscillations, which suggests that the evapotranspiration inside the willow plantation mobilized some contaminants towards the rooting zones. Thus, the concentration of certain contaminants may tend to increase within a dense willow plantation over time. A second study was carried out inside the same plantation, in order to verify if the increases in concentration observed previously could be linked to the evapotranspiration that takes place inside a willow plantation. In order to eradicate the effect of plant transpiration, willows were harvested in certain plots of the plantation. The concentrations of organic and inorganic contaminants were followed over time (24 months) and compared with those observed in the unharvested plots. The results obtained showed that the removal of the willows limited the accumulation of certain contaminants on the soil surface, as observed in the uncut plots. These results suggested once again that the short rotation intensive culture of willows can lead to the migration of certain contaminants towards the roots and thus increase their concentrations on the soil surface near the root zones. Very few studies have reported results that seem to contradict the multiple purification benefits that are usually put forward in phytoremediation. However, such effects on contaminant mobilization could be relevant and suitable in a risk management context. The third and final study presented in this thesis explores the microbial communities associated with the roots of the two willow cultivars established on the experimental site for several years (six years). Root and rhizosphere microbial communities of Salix spp. have been studied in contaminated environments, but most of studies have been carried out on relatively young hosts. Therefore, little information exists regarding the microbial communities associated with older willows established in contaminated environments. The characterization of fungal, bacterial and Archean communities has shown differences in composition between the two willow cultivars, as well as between their compartments (i.e., roots and rhizosphere). Some taxonomic groups, belonging to each of the three domains, caught our attention, either by their abundance, or by their ecological functions already known to be potentially beneficial for the plant survival, or for increasing the degradation and extraction of various contaminants. This study therefore provides valuable information that can be used to improve certain microbiome engineering approaches that promote the establishment, survival, growth and phytoremediation performance of Salix spp. in contaminated environments. All the results presented in this thesis have fueled various reflections on the interest of using soil organic amendments and characterizing the root and rhizosphere microbiome of willows in order to improve the practices and implementation of phytoremediation with willows. This thesis also highlights a phenomenon of contaminant migration, influenced by the presence of fast-growing woody plants, which represents an obstacle for the evaluation of phytoremediation performance approaches with willows.

20	Towards computationally efficient neural networks with adaptive and dynamic computations	Over the past few years, artificial intelligence has been greatly advanced, and deep learning, where deep neural networks are used to attempt to loosely emulate the human brain, has significantly contributed to it. Deep neural networks are now able to achieve great success based on a large amount of data and sufficient computational resources. Despite their success, their ability to quickly adapt to new concepts, tasks, and environments is quite limited or even non-existent. In this thesis, we are interested in how deep neural networks can become adaptive to continually changing or totally new circumstances, similarly to human intelligence, and further introduce adaptive and dynamic architectural modules or meta-learning frameworks to make it happen in computationally efficient ways. This thesis consists of a series of studies proposing methods to utilize adaptive and dynamic computations to tackle adaptation problems that are investigated from different perspectives such as task-level, temporal-level, and context-level adaptations.     In the first article, we focus on task-level fast adaptation based on a meta-learning framework.   More specifically, we investigate the inherent model uncertainty that is induced from quickly adapting to a new task with a few examples. This problem is alleviated by combining the efficient gradient-based meta-learning with nonparametric variational inference in a principled probabilistic framework. It is an important step towards robust meta-learning that we develop a Bayesian few-shot learning method to prevent task-level overfitting.    In the second article, we attempt to improve the performance of sequence (i.e. future) prediction by introducing a jumpy future prediction that is based on the adaptive step size. It is a critical ability for an intelligent agent to explore an environment that enables efficient option-learning and jumpy future imagination. We make this possible by introducing the Hierarchical Recurrent State Space Model (HRSSM) that can discover the latent temporal structure (e.g. subsequences) while also modeling its stochastic state transitions hierarchically.    Finally, in the last article, we investigate a framework that can capture the global context in image data in an adaptive way and further process the data based on that information. We implement this framework by extracting high-level visual concepts through attention modules and using graph-based reasoning to capture the global context from them. In addition, feature-wise transformations are used to propagate the global context to all local descriptors in an adaptive way.	deep learning , deep neural networks , adaptive neural networks , adaptive computation , dynamic computation , few-shot learning , learn-to-learn , attention mechanism , feature modulation , concept reasoning , temporal abstraction , artificial intelligence , machine learning , meta-learning , modulation de feature , abstraction temporelle	en	26274.0
21	Les relations monétaires franco-allemandes et l’UEM (1969-1992) : des ambitions aux réalités	In 1969, in a well-established European Economic Community (EEC) under the neo-Gaullist presidency of Georges Pompidou, Germany stood as a model for France, looking for an effective industrial policy and a recovery of its rank on the international scene. Since the mid 1960s the international monetary system had been weakened by the growing US debt. France wanted to be the leader of the economic and monetary union (EMU). This political decision was a means to improve its economy confronted with the instability of the international monetary system. As pointed out by Jacques Rueff, « L’Europe se fera par la monnaie ou ne se fera pas. »  During this period, from the relaunch of the EMU (December 1969) to the Maastricht Treaty (February 1992), French economic action was based on a strong political will defined to reinforce the relationships with the Federal German Republic, and then the reunified Germany.  The Franco-German monetary relationships aimed to promote a strong and independent Europe and to restore an exchange rate stability. The “golden standard” stability myth was viewed and understood differently in France and Germany. If recent historical studies have been partially devoted to the consequences of European monetary policies (essentially in France) on economic and monetary integration in the EEC, they focused on the 1974-1981 or 1981-1986 periods. The creation of the EMU was a dynamic process running from December 1969 to February 1992. Franco-German monetary relationships included two levels of decision-making. First, on the political level, there was the presidency, the chancellery, the European Commission and the ministers. Second, its counterpart, economic power. The latter requires analysis of the role played by central banks in the definition and application of monetary policies. This dichotomy illustrates the progressive transition between the political level and the economic level during the 1980s. The decline of politics and the primacy of economics were analyzed differently in France and Germany. Political and economic objectives and expectations were contrasted and divergent.  This study demonstrates that the EMU dynamic was an economic process where politics gave way to economics. Monetary relations were asymmetric. The real interlocutor of French political authorities was German economic power, represented by the Bundesbank. The Franco-German tandem was a political myth broken by world economy liberalization. For Germany, the EMU was a device to define a European Germany in a federal Europe. In France, it represented an illusory means to restore French primacy for conservative and liberal governments and a way of compensating a failing ideology for socialist governments. The EMU provided monetary stability, but the dream of a powerful and independent Europe vanished with the Maastricht treaty. Even as it rejected the idea of European political union defended by the German diplomacy, France paradoxically laid the foundations of a German Europe.

22	Des désirs qui orientent : une analyse phénoménologique des identifications et désidentifications lezbiqueer dans l’espace montréalais	Through a critical phenomenological perspective using walking interviews (Ahmed 2006, Lee 2015, Weiss et al., 2019), this thesis explores different meanings associated with the sexual orientations of lesbian, bisexual, queer, fluid and pansexual women in the Montreal context. This approach is based on the experiential sharing of 21 lezbiqueer women with various positionnalities, co-constructing meaning through the trajectories we followed and the photographs submitted by the participants. Sexual identifications questions are linked to spatial questions (Jones and Garde-Hansen 2012, Longhurst and Johnston 2010, Collie 2013, Browne and Ferreira 2015, Podmore 2006 and 2019) through an analysis of both the content of the interviews and the way we walked during these interviews. The three parts of the thesis address migratory trajectories (the experience of arriving in Montreal as a lezbiqueer person), the spaces and identifications of lezbiqueer communities in Montreal from 1980 to today, and the visibilities and sensitivities perceived by lezbiqueer women in public spaces.

23	Effet d’un enseignement explicite de lecture active d’un énoncé mathématique sur les résultats en résolution de problème chez des élèves tout-venant de 3ème année	In elementary school problem solving is a common difficulty for students because it requires multiple skills that go beyond the field of mathematics. As a result, interventions to support students are varied and include, among other things, improving the semantic understanding of the statement. An example is the Moved by Reading model, developed in the United States by Glenberg, Willford, Gibson, Goldberg, and Zhu (2012). It is a reading strategy that encourages the student to imagine the action of the statement by manipulating objects or images, real or mental, to promote an active representation of the problem to be solved. This model has improved problem-solving outcomes for grade 3 and 4 students after only a few days of intervention. The authors point out, however, that the students responded well to the material specifically created for this research, but that it is necessary to determine whether the application of the model would encounter limitations if it were used with texts not specifically written for the experiment. The objective of our research study was therefore to test this model in an ecological context, i.e. from the problem statements used by teachers in the 3rd year of primary school, in a Francophone environment. Fourteen French-speaking grade 3 students, randomly divided into two groups, participated in this research study. They were all evaluated as a pre-test assessment before the intervention. The study took place at two different times consisting of 3 consecutive days each, 4 weeks apart. The research took place in two stages. At time 1, students in group A benefited from the explicit teaching of Moved by Reading of statements, while students in group B were placed in control condition, i.e. without intervention. At time 2, the groups were reversed. Although the specific impact of the intervention on students results in problem-solving is difficult to demonstrate at this stage, the results of this research suggest that interventions valuing explicit teaching of Moved by Reading could be proposed from teaching materials already used by teachers.

24	Optical pH sensor based on carbon nanomaterials and metal redox chemistry	Most pH sensors operate under potentiometric conditions using a simple two-electrode scheme.  More generally, a conventional meter measures the electrical potential of the solution using a glass electrode (pH) against another electrode (reference), whose electrochemical potential is known and insensitive to pH. Modern pH sensors are robust, accurate and low cost, but they are limited by the macroscopic electrode size. They also require electrical contacts and they are often affected by errors associated with the contamination of the small electrode liquid junctions. This thesis targets pH measurements at nanoscale interfaces and explores the miniaturization of the pH sensor for local and remote (optical) measurements. By taking advantage of a non-destructive optical technique based on Raman spectroscopy and of the redox chemistry of metals, this work aims to develop a remote pH sensor based on carbon nanomaterials, namely the single walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) and the graphene in the form of a single layer.  By making use of the highly sensitive Raman response of metallic SWCNTs, we devised a pH responsive optical probe consisting of a SWCNT in direct contact with a platinum redox couple. When placed in a buffer solution, the Pt-SWCNT probe shows strong Raman shifts of the nanotube G-band as a function of pH, which is ascribed to charge transfer doping of the SWCNT reference electrode. Referenced potential measurements are demonstrated using a nanoscale version of the Pt-SWCNT electrode, along with the accurate monitoring of pH in solutions of different ionic strengths. Controlled experiments at a constant ionic strength show pH measurement across the full range between 1 to 12 with a best accuracy of ±500 mpH unit. This study also explores the influence of different transition metals (Pt, Ru and Pd), of semiconducting vs. metallic SWCNTs, and supporting substrates on pH sensing. A model based on electron transfer between the redox metal system and the SWCNT is proposed and tested using electrical conductance measurements. Due to the outstanding properties of graphene, such as a semi metallic behavior and its relatively inert surface, graphene was selected as a second nanomaterial to further investigate the Raman-pH sensing. From the study with SWCNTs, which determines optimal response with the Pt/PtO redox couple, we explore the Raman response of graphene coated with a thin layer of Pt in different buffer solutions of pH between 1 and 12. The spectra show clear evidence of charge transfer and doping of graphene in contact with the platinum redox couple. Significant Raman shift with pH is noted in the region of the G-band and also in D-band, which are consistent with the behavior found with the metallic Pt-SWCNT system. An analysis of the Raman shift provides a better understanding of the doping behavior observed for different pH. The analysis provides an estimate of the potential and confirms the Nernstian behavior of the pH sensor.  Redox pH sensing at the nanoscale using carbon nanomaterials solves the main limitations highlighted above, namely coverage of the full pH range and a clear miniaturization of the sensor down to the nanometer scale. Although the accuracy requires further improvement, this work demonstrates for the first time an optical pH sensing scheme that is analogous to a conventional pH sensor equipped with a built-in internal reference.	pH sensor , Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes , graphene , Pt redox couple , Raman spectroscopy	en	26248.0
25	Les effets du processus de parrainage sur les dynamiques conjugales et les parcours de vie	This thesis focuses on the effects of the sponsorship process on marital dynamics and life courses. Based on a qualitative and interdisciplinary research approach, 20 participants, 7 men and 13 women, who had a sponsorship experience as a sponsor or a sponsored spouse, were interviewed. In this thesis, we explore the effects on conjugal dynamics in two key moments: 1) from the beginning of the sponsorship application process to obtaining the permanent residence visa, and 2) during the sponsorship undertaking of three years. We also document the experiences of a marital separation that occurs during the sponsorship undertaking. The vertical and cross-sectional analysis method used in this thesis made it possible for us to report on the diversity of pathways by articulating the experience of the sponsorship process, in particular with migration trajectory, marital composition, gender and ethnicity. If, at first glance, it seemed obvious that sponsorship creates inequality in couples by positioning the sponsored person under the financial responsibility of his or her sponsor, it turned out that the analysis of conjugal dynamics was more complex. Finally, in the light of the results of the study, we propose a typology of typical pathways that reflects both the diversity of pathways and levels of influence that the sponsorship process can produce on conjugal dynamics.

26	Early lifestyle determinants of adiposity trajectories from childhood into late adolescence	Background: Childhood obesity is a major risk factor for mortality and morbidity as children with obesity tend to remain obese into adulthood. Among Canadian children, 27 % have overweight or obesity, which is a serious public health concern. Objectives: The main objectives of my research are to (1) examine the associations between physical activity in pre-puberty or early puberty and obesity trajectories across childhood and adolescence; (2) examine the associations between sedentary behaviors in pre-puberty or early puberty and obesity trajectories across childhood and adolescence; and (3) to examine associations between dietary intake in pre-puberty or early puberty and obesity trajectories across childhood and adolescence. My hypothesis is that lower physical activity, more time spent in sedentary behaviours and unhealthy diets (e.g., higher sugar-sweetened beverage consumption, lower fruit and vegetable intake) in childhood (pre to early puberty) will be associated with adverse patterns of obesity into adolescence. Methods: This study uses data from the Quebec Adipose and Lifestyle Investigation in Youth (QUALITY) study. This cohort includes 630 Caucasian children aged 8-10 years, recruited at baseline based on a parental history of obesity. Of these, 377 were re-assessed at 10-12 years and at 15-17 years. Sedentary behavior and physical activity using 7-day accelerometry, self-reported screen time and dietary intake with three 24-hr diet recalls were measured. Weight and height were measured at each time period and transformed to body mass index (BMI) z-scores using WHO (World Health Organization) Standards. Group based trajectory modeling was used to identify longitudinal trajectories of z-BMI. Multinomial logistic regressions were used to examine associations between lifestyle behaviors at 8-10 years and distinct obesity trajectory groups, while adjusting for age, sex, tanner stage and parental education. Results: Six distinct z-BMI trajectory groups were identified: Stable-Low-Normal-Weight (5.7%), two Stable-Normal-Weight groups that were subsequently combined (33.0% and 24.8%), Stable-Overweight (19.8%), Stable-Obese (8.8%) and Overweight-Decreasers (7.9%). For every additional vegetable and fruit serving at baseline, the likelihood of being in the Overweight–Decreasers group increased by 26% (OR 1.26, 95% CI: 1.06, 1.49) compared to those in the Stable-Normal-Weight group. For every additional hour of sedentary behavior at baseline, the likelihood of belonging to the Overweight-Decreasers group increased by 51% (OR 1.51, 95% CI: 1.03, 2.22) as compared to Stable-Normal-Weight group. In terms of physical activity, every additional 10 mins of Moderate to Vigorous Physical Activity (MVPA) at baseline was associated with a lower likelihood of belonging to the Stable-Obese group (OR 0.75, 95% CI: 0.61, 0.91) and to the Overweight-Decreasers group (OR=0.78, 95% CI: 0.62, 0.98) compared to the Stable-Normal-Weight group. Conclusion: Stable trajectories of z-BMI from childhood to late adolescence were found, with the exception of one decreasing trajectory from overweight in childhood to normal weight in adolescence. The latter had more favourable dietary intake of fruits and vegetables at baseline, however, they also had lower MVPA and more sedentary behavior.

27	État des connaissances sur les fauteuils roulants motorisés intelligents (FRMIs) et recommandations pour la poursuite de leur développement : un examen de la portée	Background: The level of social participation among wheelchair users can be affected by factors such as accessibility, as well as their individual clinical profile, which can limit their full involvement in meaningful activities of daily living. To meet their needs in terms of mobility and social participation, different prototypes of intelligent powered wheelchairs (IPW) are being developed, in order to improve the mobility of people with physical, cognitive or sensorial impairments, who have difficulties using standard powered wheelchairs. Objective: The aim of this study was to map the existing literature on the nature of studies carried out on IPWs to better understand how the existing IPWs meet the needs of powered wheelchair users, and to better guide the ongoing development of IPWs.  Methods: A scoping review was conducted in accordance with the six stages of Arskeys and O’Malley’s (2005) framework which was later enhanced by Levac et al. (2010). All studies available until September 2020, written in English or in French, were included.  Results: A total of 41 studies were included in the scoping review. The results suggest that the various technologies integrated into IPWs could meet some of the needs of powered wheelchair users (PWu), could help improve mobility, provide independence, and promote social participation of some PWu. Moreover, additional results were identified: (a) other technologies, that could provide more independence and comfort to users, and (b) other clinical uses of IPW. An important limitation of the literature is the lack of experimental studies that could help assessing the efficiency of IPW. The point of view of caregivers is also less reported in the literature.  Conclusion: Further studies should be considered to improve the functioning of the existing prototypes of IPW.

28	Maternal depression and children’s cognitive development : the reasons and conditions of their associations	Context: Cognitive development is an important building block of health and wellbeing because it equips individuals with the necessary skills to increase control over and improve their health as they age. To ensure healthy cognitive development, we need to better understand how the early childhood environment influences development. Maternal depression in early childhood is a prevalent (11-25%) public health problem and a robust risk factor for poor cognitive outcomes in the child. However, there remain important gaps in our understanding of the longitudinal mechanisms through which it influences children’s cognitive outcomes. Understanding why and for whom this association exists can inform the development of interventions to promote healthy child development.  Objectives: The overall aim of this dissertation is to examine mediating and moderating factors of the association between maternal depression and children’s cognitive development using the Developmental Model for Understanding Mechanisms of Transmission as a framework. Specific objectives – each corresponding to a research paper forming the body of this dissertation – are to: (1) summarize existing evidence on mediators of the association between maternal depression and children’s cognitive development; (2) examine the mediating role of children’s school experiences in the association between maternal depression and academic performance, including the moderating role of child’s sex in these associations; (3) examine the role of gene-environment mechanisms in the association between maternal depression and children’s cognitive school readiness; and (4) perform a meta-analysis of the moderating role of child’s sex in the association between maternal depression and cognitive outcomes across childhood and adolescence. Methods: Systematic review and meta-analytic methods were used to address objectives 1 and 4. For objective 2, data from the Québec Longitudinal Study of Child Development were used. Maternal depression was self-reported (between child’s ages 5 months and 5 years); peer victimization and school engagement were parent, teacher, and child-reported (6-10 years); and academic performance was assessed when children were 12 years. Data from the Québec Newborn Twin Study were used for objective 3: self-reported maternal depression (6 and 18 months) and assessment of children’s cognitive school readiness (5 years). Structural equation models, adjusted for confounders where necessary, were used to estimate associations in both cohorts.  Results: The studies in this dissertation show that (1) only a handful of studies have examined mediators of the association between maternal depression and cognitive development, with most identifying maternal cognitions, behaviours, and affect as a mediator; (2) school engagement mediates the association between maternal depression and academic performance in girls only; (3) genetic contributions to children’s cognitive school readiness decrease – while environmental contributions increase – as the level of maternal depression increases; and (4) sex moderates the association between maternal depression and cognitive development, with boys at higher risk of poor cognitive outcomes.  Conclusion: These findings suggest that addressing maternal cognitions, behaviours, and affect can help mitigate the negative effect of maternal depression on children’s cognitive outcomes at the population level. They also suggest that boys are more negatively affected by maternal depression, and that for girls, addressing the impact of maternal depression on their school engagement may lead to improved cognitive outcomes. Further research on additional mediators and moderators can help strengthen our understanding of the association between maternal depression and children’s cognitive development.

29	Utilisation en grossesse des antidépresseurs et les risques maternels associés : focus sur le diabète gestationnel et la dépression postpartum	Depression affects about 20% of women of childbearing age and about 5% to 15% of pregnant women. Anxiety disorders, often concomitant with maternal depression, are in the order of 15% during pregnancy. In recent years, gestational use of antidepressants has increased, despite the associated risks to mother and child reported in the literature. Maternal risks such as the risk of gestational diabetes and postpartum depression have been little studied with often contradictory results. In addition, data on the evolution over time of the prevalence of depression / anxiety and the use of antidepressants during pregnancy are very limited in the literature. The Quebec Pregnancy Cohort (QPC) was used for this research and the thesis was organized in three parts. In a first part, we carried out a descriptive study to determine the prevalence and the trends of use of antidepressants and maternal depression / anxiety during pregnancy. over the period from 1998 to 2015. We observed that the prevalence of antidepressants use during pregnancy has tripled, ranging from 2.2% in 1998 to 6.2% in 2015, while the prevalence of maternal depression / anxiety has increased by 1.3 (from 5% in 1998 to 7% in 2015).  The second part consisted of carrying out a study using the nested case-control design to assess whether the gestational use of antidepressants was associated with an increased risk of gestational diabetes. We have found that the use of antidepressants is associated with an increased risk of gestational diabetes (aOR = 1.19, 95% CI: 1.08-1.30) and particularly for venlafaxine (aOR = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.09-1.49) and amitriptyline (aOR = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.25-1.84). The third part consisted of a survival analysis to determine whether different trajectories of antidepressant use during pregnancy in women depressed before pregnancy could affect the risk of postpartum depression. Our results show that women exposed continuously during pregnancy (aHR = 1.69; 95% CI: 1.01-2.84), those exposed in the second / third trimester (aHR = 2.56; 95% CI: 1.33-4.90), and those with intermittent exposure (aHR = 2.41; 95% CI: 1.59-3.66) have a higher risk of postpartum depression than depressed pregnant women, not exposed during gestation. Conversely, those exposed only in the first trimester (aHR = 1.35; 95% CI: 0.81-2.25) were less at risk of postpartum depression compared to unexposed women. In conclusion, antidepressants are increasingly used in pregnancy and we have observed a moderate increase in the risk of gestational diabetes associated with their use, mainly for venlafaxine and amitriptyline. Regarding their real-life efficacy in preventing postpartum depression, we found no decreased risk for users in a cohort of women with prenatal depression. Nonetheless, despite some methodological limitations, these results reinforce the need for a personalized treatment approach for each pregnant woman with depression, in order to make the best choices for her health and that of the unborn child.

30	Fréquence et prédicteurs de cancer occulte en accident vasculaire cérébral ischémique	Introduction: Cancer promotes thromboembolism through inflammation and hypercoagulability, and an ischemic stroke may be the first sign of an undiagnosed (occult) malignancy. The frequency and predictors of occult cancer in people with acute ischemic stroke, however, remains unclear. We first sought to summarize the existing published data regarding the frequency and predictors of cancer after an ischemic stroke in a systematic review. We also conducted a retrospective matched cohort study to compare the incidence of cancer in people who experienced an ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) to that of people without stroke, using data from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging. Methods: For our systematic review, we searched seven databases from January 1980 to September 2019 for articles reporting malignant tumors and myeloproliferative neoplasms diagnosed after an ischemic stroke (PROSPERO protocol: CRD42019132455). For our matched cohort study, we used data from the comprehensive sub-group (n=30,097) of the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging, a large population-based cohort of individuals aged 45-85 years when recruited (2011-2015). We built a retrospective cohort with individual exact matching for age (1:4 ratio). We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate hazard ratios of new cancer diagnosis with and without a prior stroke/TIA. Results: For our systematic review, we screened 15,400 records and included 51 articles. The pooled cumulative incidence of cancer within one year after an ischemic stroke was 13.6 per thousand (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.6 to 24.8), higher in studies focusing on cryptogenic stroke (62.0 per thousand; 95% CI, 13.6 to 139.3 vs 9.6 per thousand; 95% CI, 4.0 to 17.3; p- value=0.02) and those reporting cancer screening (39.2 per thousand; 95% CI, 16.4 to 70.6 vs 7.2 per thousand; 95% CI, 2.5 to 14.1; p-value=0.003). The incidence of cancer after stroke was higher overall compared to people without stroke. Most cases were diagnosed within the first few months after stroke. Several predictors of cancer were identified, namely older age, smoking, involvement of multiple vascular territories, as well as elevated C-reactive protein and d-dimers. For our cohort study, we respectively included 920 and 3,680 individuals in the stroke and non- stroke groups. We observed a higher incidence of cancer in the first year after stroke/TIA that declined afterwards. The hazard of new cancer diagnosis in the first year after stroke/TIA was significantly increased (hazard ratio=2.36; 95% CI, 1.21 to 4.61; p-value=0.012) as compared to age-matched non-stroke participants after adjustments. The most frequent primary cancers in the first year after stroke/TIA were prostate (n=8, 57.1%) and melanoma (n=2, 14.3%). Conclusion: We observed in both studies of our research project that the frequency of incident cancer after an ischemic stroke is low overall, but higher as compared to people without stroke. The frequency of new cancer diagnosis after stroke is also higher in cryptogenic stroke and after cancer screening. Several predictors may increase the yield of cancer screening after an ischemic stroke. The pooled incidence of post-stroke cancer is likely underestimated due to methodological issues in most studies of our review. Larger prospective studies with systematic ascertainment of cancer after stroke are needed to produce more valid and precise estimates of post-stroke cancer risk and guide randomized controlled studies of cancer screening in people with acute ischemic stroke.

31	Le récepteur au thromboxane A2 régule la motilité des cellules de cancer du sein triple négatif à travers les protéines ezrine, radixine et moésine	Cell migration is an important mechanism for various cellular processes such as embryogenesis and cicatrization. Likewise, it controls pathological processes including the invasion of malignant cells and the formation of metastases. Metastasis is a very complicated process. The acquisition of invasive migratory power by a malignant cell as well as its metastatic potential is regulated by the cytoskeleton which is dynamically modified and controlled by intracellular signaling pathways. However, metastatic cells physiology and the cascades causing their metastases are not clear yet. Ezrin, Radixin and Moesin (ERMs) proteins have an important role in organizing the cytoskeleton at the cell cortex and they are key determinants of cell motility. Thus, a deregulation at this point may lead to an aberrant cell migration. Hence, the involvement of ERMs in various aggressive and invasive cancers. ERMs are regulated downstream of several cellular actors in particular membrane receptors. Several studies have reported that the thromboxane A2 receptor (TXA2R), a G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) promotes metastasis. It has been described especially in the context of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), one of the deadliest cancers in women. GPCR have a central role in almost all physiological functions and constitute the largest family of drug targets. Interestingly, the two laboratories of Dr Sébastien Carréno and Dr Michel Bouvier, have discovered that the TXA2R activates ERM proteins through the GTPase RhoA. In this research project, we have identified a new signaling pathway linking the TXA2 receptor to ERMs via RhoA and the kinase SLK. This pathway is involved in the migration of triple negative breast cancer cells. Thus, we demonstrated that moesin and SLK acted downstream of the receptor to promote the speed and directionality of TNBC cells migration. We discovered that the directed cell migration downstream of TXA2R is due to a polarization of moesin at the leading edge. We also observed that moesin is responsible for actin filaments polarity at the leading edge following an activation of the receptor. So, this work has revealed a new signaling cascade important for the migration of aggressive triple negative breast cancer cells which could be a new target for anti-metastatic therapies.

32	Mobilité scolaire au secondaire et décrochage scolaire : rôle du cycle scolaire et de la période annuelle	Theoretical considerations suggest that school mobility in high school can disrupt adolescent adjustment and lead to dropping out of school, especially when it occurs at particularly challenging times academically or developmentally. Namely, disruptions could be amplified when mobility occurs during the school year, while teaching routines are set, and when it occurs towards the end of the secondary school years, when social circles are well established. The goal of this thesis was to verify, based on a sample of adolescents (N = 545) aged between 14 and 18 years old (M = 16.5), whether a possible link between mobility and dropout would indeed be moderated by its timing, by considering: (1) the time of the year, i.e., whether school mobility occurs during a school year or the summer break, and (2) the school level, i.e., whether it occurs at the beginning or at the end secondary school (1st or 2nd cycle). Beyond potentially confounding factors, the results show that high school changes are associated with a greater risk of dropping out, with particularly strong links for school mobility occurring during a school year compared to mobility occurring during the summer months, and for school mobility occurring during the second cycle of secondary school, compared to that occurring in the first cycle. The discussion underscores the importance of temporality for understanding the impacts of school mobility, both in practical and research terms.

33	"De la cité divine à la cité humaine : l'éducation de l""irrationalité dans la République et les Lois"	This dissertation examines the role that the two irrational aspects of the human soul, the epithumetikón and the thymoeidês, play in the Platonic City. What interests us is determining whether irrationality can be educated within the framework of the educational program granted by the city or not. To assess this, we will examine Plato’s educational philosophy as outlined in both the Republic and the Laws to clarify whether appetites and affections can be educated. Thus, our analysis seeks to answer the following two questions: (i) if the irrational aspects of the soul are potential candidates for education, what kind of education would this be? Furthermore, (ii) what would be the effect of such an education? Although both the Republic and the Laws outline a paideia that pursues the same goal (namely, to breed virtuous citizens), when analyzing the characterization of this educational program in each dialogue, it seems that irrationality only plays a determining role in the Laws. Therefore, we will claim that while the Platonic educational program possesses a certain methodological unity (for it aims to form the best possible citizens), the latter operates differently in both dialogues: while in the Republic Plato focuses on the “divine” aspect of education (the training of the best leaders), in the Laws he is keener on providing a popular education, one tailored to immediate human needs. A paideia that can indeed appeal and entice the large mass of ordinary citizens who make up Magnesia to follow the law willingly. Following this line of thinking, we will conclude that despite these methodological particularities, music and gymnastics are not only the primary way for educating irrationality, but also the very same foundation of the platonic educational program.

34	Mechanical characterization of rigid discrete interlocking materials	Rigid discrete interlocking materials (DIMs) are a class of materials that distinguish themselves by the unique way in which they deform: in DIMs, elements (connected through interlocking) can move freely within a range defined through contacts with neighbouring elements. This results in a biphasic deformation behaviour unique to these structures where no resistance is provided to deformation or a hard stop to deformation is met. It is yet unclear how the set of discrete and continuous parameters describing a DIM influences this biphasic behaviour. Likewise, we lack tools to properly characterize it. To that effect, we present a method which takes inspiration from homogenization and handles contacts by leveraging the definition of implicit surfaces, specifically tori, making up our elements. By defining an adequate energy function, we can minimize intersection between elements while deforming the DIM in an arbitrary way using standard optimization approaches. We explore the deformations that planar sheets of DIM can be subjected to and investigate how the coupling of constraints in two orthogonal directions affects these deformations. Our results give insights on how the tuning of various parameters describing the DIM affects these deformations.

35	L’exposition Zeugma, le Grand oeuvre drolatique de Gérard Garouste présentée du 15 mars au 15 avril 2018	Gérard Garouste is recognized as a contemporary French painter, sculptor, and the founder of the humanitarian association La Source. Our brief seeks to reveal the place of personal discourse in its interpretation of myths. We present the exhibition of March-April 2018, Zeugma the Great Drolatic Work, in order to highlight the obvious relationship between man and artist to redefine in his works the close link between his art, his illness, and his history. Our view of the exhibition is based on the question of myth, and precisely its function in human development, in order to understand its application in the Garoustian myth. To do this, we take as support the process of mythification of Gérard Bouchard in order to analyze the issues underlying the creation of a myth within the framework of our corpus. We introduce the three major works of the exhibition in order to study their structural composition and demonstrate their complementarity. In addition, using the concept of collective memory and its autobiography, we analyze the way in which the corpus arises from an individual search for identity as evidenced by the exhibition.

36	L'allégorie de la justice transitionnelle: résistance à l'oubli et construction du récit mémoriel en Uruguay post-dictatorial	In the 1960s, Uruguay endured an economic crisis that quickly turned into a conflict between the National Liberation Movement-Tupamaros (MLN-T) and the state then ruled by Juan María Bordaberry of the Colorado Party. The radicalization of the MLN-T and the rise of State repression granted growing power to the Armed Forces, leading to the coup d'État of June 27, 1973 followed by the establishment of a civic-military dictatorship. The next twelve years were marked by repression, censorship, violence and numerous disappearances. Like other Latin American Cold War dictatorships, Uruguay joined Operation Condor: a South American network led by the United States with the goal of tracking down and annihilating political opponents.   The 1985 elections marked the end of the dictatorship and return of democracy. However, in the aftermath of the victory of Julio María Sanguinetti of the Colorado party, a struggle erupted in the heart of society over who was to blame for the country’s fall into authoritarianism, state repression and violence. On the one hand, the Armed Forces were accused of abuse of power and crimes against humanity. On the other, some defended the military as though they had saved the country from the “subversive” threat.    This study analyzes Uruguay’s transitional process which, unlike its Latin American counterparts, has not included a formal mechanism for the search for truth upon the return of democracy. Uruguay rather chose to amnesty the Tupamaros detained during the dictatorship, all the while promulgating the Law of Caducity which granted impunity to the military. By collecting different perspectives on the recent past through art and cultural productions produced by civil society after le return du democracy, this thesis studies the evolution of memorial speeches as they are expressed in public spaces. Our goal is to better understand how memorial discourses emerge in a country where democratic remedies have confirmed impunity.

37	Les enfants de Caïn : la complexité du meurtre dans l’œuvre d’Honoré de Balzac	The literary work of Honoré de Balzac testifies to a deep knowledge and reflection of the judicial system. Violence and crime, certainly not the brightest sides of humanity, are nevertheless an integral part of society. Since Balzacʼs ambition is to show human nature as it is, he agrees to depict murder without euphemisms. Far from entirely rejecting the bloody romantic aesthetic, he describes crime as a fundamentally ambivalent action, meaning that he neither absolutely condemns it nor openly defends it. We find in Balzac what very few writers, and even fewer philosophers, can account for : the very complexity of life itself. Balzacʼs social commitment invites us to think about his way of putting murder in fiction in relation to the sociological and historical context of his works. In Balzacʼs reflections on murder, four important themes constantly recur : money (economic aspect), youth, family (social aspects) and remorse (moral aspect). The philosophical dimension of La Comédie humaine justifies the choice of an equally philosophical reading of Balzacʼs work. The murders of four short stories belonging to the Études philosophiques (El Verdugo, LʼAuberge rouge, Les Marana and Un drame au bord de la mer), ensure a multiple reflection on themes such as justice, law, family name, honour, guilt and the shift from an old society to a new money-dominated society.

38	Pièces d'eau ; suivi de Lisibilités de la trace dans The Obituary de Gail Scott	The creative work pièces d’eau is a collection of poetic prose texts that tease out fractures between the terms through which a place is made intelligible and the sensory information they seek to designate. The pieces each invoke forms of life constituting an externality to the architectural, patrimonial and economic development of place. Whether they proceed from a hagiographic impulse, a fractional knowledge, a struggle to form sentences, or a hysteric certainty, the pièces d’eau of the title are indisposed, involuntary documents of the progress of which they are the refuse. The essay, Lisibilité de la trace dans The Obituary de Gail Scott, addresses legibility as an epistemological, historiographic and aesthetic notion. Reading traces calls for a constantly renewed engagement with material at the edges of legibility. In The Obituary, the deployment of an aesthetic articulated around the paradigm of the trace mobilizes a deep ambivalence with regards to processes by which the past becomes legible in the present. Written across the aporias of historiographic thought, Scott’s poetic and narrative work in this novel beckons a reappraisal of the political imaginary of knowledge and of the literary modalities that define our sensate engagement with the past.	trace , lisibilité , prose poetry , literary aesthetics , historiography , poetics , legibility	en	26037.0
39	Syncrétisme visuel et textuel : transmutation du sacré dans Useless Magic de Florence Welch ; suivi de Je veux la sauge, le feu et toi	Useless Magic combines multiple visual elements from hand scripted notes to doodling, including collage and photography. This heterogenous combination calls for an intermedial study in order to render well the interference between the text and the visual. This book also relies on syncretism pulling together diverse sources of inspiration. By doing so, it enables the coexistence of a plurality of images which serve Florence Welch’s process of self-representation. The analysis of the themes by the intricate system of symbols will allow the clarification of self-representative postures, which will reveal how the subject expressed here is dedicated to revealing a sacred self.  I Want Sage Fire and You follows a similar intermedial and syncretic approach in order to utilize the cultural figure of the witch as a way to self-proclaim a sacred and monstrous yet beautiful feminine subject. This poetry collection paints the witch as a historical and mythical figure of feminist empowerment. This figure is declined in three phases, which will be expressed poetically and visually: the priestess, the poison-mistress and the enchantress. All three will appear in the form of an artist sketchbook inspired by Useless Magic. This sketchbook will allow me to re-write, re-build and re-member the witch according to questions of feminine emancipation. This collection will use poetry and visual expressions as tools to build a temple-like space where a bewitching invocation can resonate.

40	Un investissement des plus attachants : la perspective des Québécois(ses) amateurs de la photographie animalière	The relationship between human beings and their natural environments has been explored in various research fields using different research traditions. This qualitative research thesis draws on both social science literature and the natural sciences to better understand what connects human beings to elements of their natural environment. It focuses specifically on photography and the notion of the amateur. Using the sociology of attachment as a conceptual framework and the notions or serious leisure and amateurs, I interviewed 13 wildlife photographers in order to explore 1) the role of photography in the attachment relationship between photographers and wildlife species, and 2) how the elements of the framework of attachments (object, device, collective and human body) overlap with each other for these individuals who practise photography as a serious leisure activity. My analysis reveals a cycle of engagement in which the more amateur photographers invest (emotionally and in terms of time and money) the more attached they become to practising wildlife photography. This commitment and the value they attach to the natural allows them to potentially become engaged as concerned citizens in a context of ecological crisis. Finally, despite the amateur photographers’ strong appreciation of nature and the natural, the thesis invites us to reflect on how distinctions between the artificial and the natural may become blurred, particularly where digital photo treatment is concerned.	amateur , attachment , wildlife photography , wildlife species , ecological crisis , attachment	en	26027.0
41	Cannabidiol : exploring new synthetic pathways for late-stage functionalization	The increasing interest around the therapeutic possibilities offered by cannabinoids was the motivation for the project described in this Master’s thesis. The efficient synthesis of various CBs has become critical to deepen the understanding of the mechanisms behind the medical properties of cannabinoids as well as for the development of novel drug treatments. Cannabidiol is of particular interest as the molecule exhibits anti-inflammatory, and anticarcinogenic properties. This work aims to explore different routes to enable the late-stage functionalization of cannabidiol in order to easily access derivatives of the natural compound. The first part of this work focuses on developing a route enabling the functionalization of the cannabidiol precursor utilizing the affordable and commercially available starting material 1,3-Dimethoxybenzene. The proposed six-step approach relies on a Diels-Alder reaction to generate the bicyclic adduct of cannabidiol. Several routes were then explored to obtain the functionalization of the precursor namely a Hartwig-Miyaura borylation and a bromination of the aromatic ring. The second part of this project focuses on the functionalization of cannabidiol relying on the Weinreb amide functionality. This work led to the development of an efficient and sustainable route for the synthesis of olivetol, a key fragment for the large-scale production of cannabidiol within the pharmaceutical industry. The method relies on a four-step approach relying on a Weinreb amide synthesized using the affordable 3,5-Dimethoxybenzoic acid. The synthesis of the Weinreb amide followed by the formation of the corresponding ketone, subsequent Wolff-Kishner reduction, and finally demethylation of the substrate allowed to generate the desired product. The versatility of the approach allows for variations in functionalization, enabling potential formation of various olivetol derivatives.

42	Entre locals et incomers : « Where is the community? » : appropriation collective d’une île écossaise et conflit social	The Scottish land tenure system is one of the most unequal in Europe. Most of the territory is owned by a minority of landowners. In the early 1990s, some rural communities in the Highlands and Islands created the first Community Land Trusts (CLT) and thus developed new forms of local governance based on direct democracy. These small local revolutions culminated in the consolidation of a national land reform in the early 2000s. At first glance, this contemporary legal upheaval fosters competition between two interest groups : landowners and crofters (Scottish peasants). The objective of this dissertation is to put this binary vision of social conflict into perspective. My ethnographic research carried out on the island of Great Bernera in the Outer Hebrides was focused on intra-community conflict in this new political and legal context. My analysis concentrate on the contradictions of a model of democratic governance based on the principle of the Rule of Law with the constraints of the old local normative system characterized by relational, identity and cultural logics. I present the testimonies of a group of residents who consider themselves “locals” and who value cultural and genealogical criteria as founding principles of a community. This vision contradicts the point of view of foreigners (“incomers”) who, by the culmination of the project of collective appropriation of the island, hope for the realization of a political social community.

43	Ossements humains dans l’outillage maya : chaîne opératoire et provenance d’un dépôt osseux d’Ucanal, Petén, Guatemala	The ancient bone industry in the Maya region is currently not well understood due to the poor preservation of bones in the area. The excavations conducted of Structure J-2 and the plaza nearby at the site of Ucanal in Petén, Guatemala unearthed a large deposit dated to the Late Classic period (700-810 AD) containing   primarily bone production debris. The number of bone fragments from the production debris deposit at Ucanal is among the highest recorded in the Maya area, second only to the L4-3 deposit found at Dos Pilas, Guatemala. The bone debris included a large quantity of worked human bones (ca. 20%) that were mixed with animal bones. The crafting of bone objects from human remains in the Maya area is poorly documented and primarily identified through artistic representations and finished objects found in elite tombs. This thesis specifically examined the human remains found in the bone production deposit from Ucanal. Firstly, analysis of the production process, using the principle of la chaîne opératoire, documented only small differences between the treatment of human bone and non-human mammal bone. Secondly, analyses of the organization of production indicated that bone working occurred within an elite residence where all stages of production were undertaken in the same context. Finally, strontium and oxygen isotope analyses of human teeth from the deposit revealed that the individuals whose bones may have been worked into tools possessed isotopic values local to the region, suggesting that they were not born at significant distances from the site as one might expect for war captives or foreigners.

44	Goût du vin antique : enrichissement lexical et censura vini	"This study will start from two fundamental principles. Firstly, it will consider the taste of wine as a complex construction which, through the exercise of tasting, convokes at the same time the sight, the ability to perceive flavours, and the olfactory memory. Secondly, it will conceive taste as the aesthetic and discriminatory relationship that one can maintain with an object. To that extent, the argumentation will explore aspects of tasting in the ""broad Antiquity"" by systematically comparing Greek literature with Latin literature. Because the vocabulary used to talk about wine is as sensory (bitter, sweet) as it is extrasensory (robust, full-bodied), we will propose in this study a new reading of the sources to see how the Ancients characterized the wine they tasted. All of this, while demonstrating how color, harmony, tastes and textures play a role in the understanding and development of the taste of wine. The comparison of Greek and Latin sources will try to show that a real refinement of vocabulary is perceptible during the first and second centuries, in connection with the constitution of a more specialized sphere of tasters. The exercise will therefore be carried out without forgetting the necessary basics of agriculture to understand the fundamental principles of winemaking. Taken together, suggesting that the flavor terminology and agricultural techniques of antiquity are capable of capturing complexities similar to those of today. The examination of the sources will also aim to demonstrate that with the undeniable enrichment of this vocabulary, a real exercise in social distinction for the Roman elite in tasting situations is taking shape. Through a dialectic specific to wine, we will try to see that from the vine to the cellar and then from the cellar to the table, the practice of tasting in a social environment both includes and excludes, builds and deconstructs, honors and mocks."	vin , sens , Wine , Winetasting , Sense , Taste , Vocabulary , Antiquity , Oenology	en	26010.0
45	Développement, mise à l’essai et évaluation d’une formation en ligne destinée aux infirmières débutantes sur les soins aux grands brûlés pédiatriques	Nurses working with pediatric burn care patients require to be properly trained to provide optimal burn care. However, it was found that novice nurses from this service do not have sufficient knowledge regarding burn wound care to provide efficient care for this specialized clientele. Therefore, an urgent need exists to train novice nurses to care for pediatric burn patients. This pilot study aimed to: (i) develop and pilot a pediatric nursing burn care e-learning training for novice nurses; and (ii) assess the feasibility and acceptability of this educational intervention as well as evaluate the intervention’s preliminary effects on novice nurses’ knowledge on pediatric nursing burn care. The frameworks that supported this study included the “Burn Nurse Competencies” from the American Burn Association (2017b) to develop the theoretical content of the intervention as well as the “Multimedia Principles ” from Clark and Mayer (2016) to design the e-learning training. A pragmatic quasi experimental one-group (n=16) pretest-posttest design was conducted from March to July 2020 at a pediatric burn care unit at the CHU Sainte-Justine Pediatric University Hospital. Feasibility, acceptability and preliminary effects of the e-learning training were assessed by a pediatric nursing burn care knowledge level questionnaire and a satisfaction survey. Statistical analyzes included descriptive statistics and tests-t for paired samples. In regards to feasibility, all participants completed the entire study with the e-learning platform. A significant difference was observed between the knowledge level mean score of novice nurses pre-training (58.6% ± 14.5) compared to post-training (87.7% ± 8.7) (p<0.001). Results showed that novice nurses’ mean score on satisfaction was 95.5% (3.8 ± 0.2) post-intervention, indicating a high satisfaction level. This new evidence-based pediatric nursing burn care e-learning training appeared feasible and satisfactory by novice nurses as well as indicating a preliminary effect on knowledge improvement regarding pediatric burn care.

46	"Effectiveness of interprofessional manikin-based simulation training on
teamwork among real teams during trauma resuscitation in adult emergency
departments : a systematic review"	This systematic review synthesizes the relevant evidence about the effectiveness of interprofessional manikin-based simulation training on teamwork among real teams during trauma resuscitation in adult civilian emergency departments. A systematic literature search was conducted in MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, EBM reviews, PsycINFO, and Web of Science with no time limit. Only experimental and quasi-experimental studies were included. Effects of the simulation intervention on teamwork were categorized according to a modified version of the Kirkpatrick's model. From the 1120 studies found, 11 studies were included for synthesis. All studies showed immediate improvement in teamwork after training, but divergent results were found regarding skills retention. Although this review focused on interprofessional manikin-based simulations in real trauma teams, the results are similar to previous systematic reviews including different types of simulation. This raises significant questions regarding the importance of simulation design characteristics to improve teamwork in trauma care.

47	Impact de la culture organisationnelle sur l'ergomanie	The main goal of this thesis is to study of the influence of organizational culture on workaholism. Workaholism is an addiction to work that requires working excessively and compulsively. The existing literature on the subject has enabled us to distinguish workaholism leading to burnout from workaholism not leading to burnout. We have developed a typology of workaholics’ profiles which classifies workers along two continuums: the vertical axis represents the degree of workaholism (we will here contrast individuals showing no sign of addiction to highly addicted individuals). The horizontal axis provides information on the degree of burnout. It leads to four groups of workers: relaxed workers, tired workers, non-toxic workaholics and toxic workaholics. The data comes from the SALVEO study conducted in Canada by the Équipe de Recherche sur le Travail et la Santé Mentale (ERTSM). The data was collected between 2009 and 2012 in 63 workplaces with a response rate of 71.3%, equivalent to 2,162 employees. First, performed descriptive analyzes of our population in order to know the fundamental characteristics of the entire SALVEO sample. Then, we performed bivariate analyzes to determine the absence or presence of a significant linear relationship between the variables. We have then performed multivariate analyzes of our variables in order to obtain the net effects of our variables on the workaholic profil. These have shown that rational culture associates positively with workers with toxic workaholism and, conversely, group culture associates negatively with workers with toxic workaholism.	surengagement , Workaholism , organizational culture , burnout , over commitment	en	25968.0
48	Diversity from farm to plate : nutrition and food relationships among agroecological farmers in Ecuador	Concerned with agricultural practices that harm human and environmental health, networks of farmers in Ecuador have organized around agroecology as a more sustainable alternative. This comes at a time in which a nutrition transition has driven Ecuador’s rural population to unprecedented levels of overweight and obesity, even while micronutrient deficiencies persist, thus creating a double burden of malnutrition. Through agroecology-based alternative food networks (AFNs), farmers and their allies have increasingly recognized the linkages between healthy agricultural practices and healthy food consumption. A breadth of literature explores how agriculture interventions can improve nutritional outcomes, such as by promoting production diversity, increasing incomes and empowering women. Agroecology has much potential to act on these pathways. However, because agroecology often spreads as a social movement rather than as a systematic intervention, empirical research assessing linkages between agroecology and farmers’ dietary practices is lacking.   This thesis explores how the production practices and social capital promoted through agroecological AFNs may be associated with unique dietary practices that hold potential to support nutritional health in the face of both obesity and micronutrient deficiencies. To do so, this research implemented a participatory approach and sequential, exploratory mixed method design including ethnography, key informant interviews, focus group discussions and a cross-sectional survey comparing agroecology AFN participants and their non-participant farming neighbours. Findings show that AFN participants out-performed their neighbours on multiple indicators of dietary nutrient adequacy and moderation. Analyses further suggest that agroecological AFNs support these dietary outcomes by strengthening production diversity and social capital, which in turn promote the consumption of foods from own-production and from the social economy (e.g. barter) as well as promote the consumption of traditional foods.  These results empirically demonstrate how agroecology can act on agriculture-nutrition pathways to enable healthy diets. Given the largely self-spreading nature of the global agroecology movement, agroecology may present an endogenous resource for supporting rural nutritional well-being.	agroecology , nutrition , Ecuador , Indigenous populations , agriculture , alternative food networks , health , agrobiodiversity , social capital , dietary diversity , Autochtones	en	25948.0
49	Histoire(s) des traductions et des retraductions du Popol Vuh	The Popol Vuh is a literary work with mythological and historical dimensions that comes from the Mayan-Quichean culture of Guatemala. Written around 1550 in the Quichean language using the Latin alphabet according to Spanish phonetics, the text has been translated and retranslated many times since the beginning of the 18th century. These versions differ in many ways: bilingual or unilingual edition, composition of the paratext, title, division into chapters, precision of the transfer, literary style, strategy for translating character names and toponyms, etc. Moreover, the paratext of these different versions suggests the existence of an emulating transhistorical dialogue between their successive translators, particularly into Span-ish, French and English. In order to better understand these phenomena, this dissertation intends to describe the history of translations and retranslations of the Popol Vuh into Spanish, French and English and to offer an explanation of the characteristics of this history. To do so, we have adopted a Ber-manian theoretical framework (Berman, 1990, 1995) and a methodology adapted to the field of study of the history of translation and to our object of study (Berman, 1995; Lépinette, 1997; Pym, 1998). We began by compiling a catalog of translations and retranslations of the Popol Vuh into Spanish, French, and English as a starting point for tracing, through their par-atext, the main lines of the transhistorical dialogue between the authors of the different ver-sions of the Popol Vuh in these languages. Once the main interlocutors were identified, we proceeded to a descriptive and comparative analysis of the approaches taken by the translators of the versions identified as the most relevant in the history of translations and retranslations of the Popol Vuh, namely the versions by Ximénez (c. 1703), Brasseur (1861), Raynaud (1925), Recinos (1947), Edmonson (1971), Chávez (1978), Tedlock (1985) and Sam Colop (2008). This analysis includes for each version the study of its paratext and a translation sam-ple, in this case the episode of Vucub-Caquix's death. The methodology we have adopted, which takes into account the profile, horizon and translat-ing position of the translating subject, and which sheds light on the analysis of the translated text thanks to its paratext, enables us to put forward explanations of the characteristics ob-served for each version of our corpus. Thus our dissertation reveals that the versions of the Popol Vuh vary with their context in the broadest sense, but above all with the vision of the Quichean text specific to the circle in which each translator evolves, just as they vary accord-ing to each translator's intention. We have also confirmed that the approach adopted by the translators of the Popol Vuh seems to be increasingly source-oriented, even if they are careful, particularly in the paratext, to continue to help the target readers in their discovery of a literary work that is the fruit of a universe that is foreign to them, the accessibility of the work remain-ing a priority in the various translation projects analyzed. Our dissertation is a case study whose methodology could be tested for the study of the cycle of retranslations of other ancient Native American texts. Furthermore, it also invites us to ques-tion the role of translation in the literary journey of these texts.	Popol Vuh , history , translation , retranslation , paratext	en	25944.0
50	Traitement neuronal des voix et familiarité : entre reconnaissance et identification du locuteur	The human ability to recognize and identify speakers by their voices is unique and can be critical in criminal investigations. However, the lack of knowledge on the working of this capacity overshadows its application in the field of “forensic phonetics”. The main objective of this thesis is to characterize the processing of voices in the human brain and the parameters that influence it. In a first experiment, event related potentials (ERPs) were used to establish that intimately familiar voices are processed differently from unknown voices, even when the latter are repeated. This experiment also served to establish a clear distinction between neural components of speaker recognition and identification supported by corresponding ERP components (respectively the P2 and the LPC). An essential contrast between the processes underlying the recognition of intimately familiar voices (P2) and that of unknown but previously heard voices (N250) was also observed. In addition to clarifying the terminology of voice processing, the first study in this thesis is the first to unambiguously distinguish between speaker recognition and identification in terms of ERPs. This contribution is major, especially when it comes to applications of voice processing in forensic phonetics.  A second experiment focused more specifically on the effects of learning modalities on later speaker identification. ERPs to trained voices were analysed along with behavioral responses of speaker identification following a learning phase where participants were trained on voices in three modalities : audio only, audiovisual and audiovisual interactive.  Although the ERP responses for the trained voices showed effects on the same components (P2 and LPC) across the three training conditions, the range of these responses varied. The analysis of these components first revealed a face overshadowing effect (FOE) resulting in an impaired encoding of voice information. This well documented effect resulted in a smaller LPC for the audiovisual condition compared to the audio only condition. However, effects of the audiovisual interactive condition appeared to minimize this FOE when compared to the passive audiovisual condition. Overall, the data presented in both experiments is generally congruent and indicate that the P2 and the LPC are reliable electrophysiological markers of speaker recognition and identification. The implications of these findings for current voice processing models and for the field of forensic phonetics are discussed.	perception multimodale , P2 , N250 , LPC , Speaker identification , Voice identification , Speaker recognition , Multimodal perception , Voice learning , Voice acoustics , Speech acoustics , Event-realted potentials (ERP) , Multimodal , Forensic phonetics	en	25929.0
51	Role of the orphan nuclear receptor steroidogenic factor 1 in mouse reproductive function	The orphan nuclear receptor steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1 or NR5A1) is an indispensable modulator of adrenal and gonadal development, playing key roles in sex determination, hypothalamic development, pituitary function and steroidogenesis. Yet, studies to date of SF-1 in reproductive biology mostly focus on embryonic and immature mammalian models. The overall objective of this thesis was to determine the role of SF-1 in key events of mature male and female mouse reproductive function. This transcription factor is expressed in a variety of organs, mainly those of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, as well as in multiple cell types of the gonads. Therefore, we generated four conditional KO (cKO) mouse models employing Cre-recombinase and floxed alleles of SF-1 (SF-1f/f) to identify its role in different cell types of the testes and ovaries of mature mice.  Our first study presents an analysis of female mice from the progesterone receptor (PRCre/+;Nr5a1f/f) cKO model, where SF-1 depletion is specific to gonadotropes in the pituitary gland as well as granulosa cells of the peri-ovulatory follicle and luteal cells of the corpus luteum. This research highlighted new in vivo roles for SF-1 in ovulation and luteinization, and provided further evidence that SF-1 is a mediator of gonadotropin synthesis and secretion. PRCre/+;Nr5a1f/f cKO females were infertile, due in large part to the reduced secretion of FSH and LH, caused by the pituitary phenotype. Exogenous gonadotropin treatments and ovarian transplantation experiments allowed us to circumvent the pituitary dysfunction to demonstrate that SF-1 in granulosa cells regulates the transcription of cumulus expansion and follicle rupture genes to induce ovulation. In addition, we showed that the absence of SF-1 in ovaries of mature mice can lead to female infertility, independent of the pituitary phenotype. Moreover, the data showed that, though SF-1 expression is reduced in mouse corpus luteum, its Cre-mediated depletion in luteal cells abrogates progesterone production. No reproductive phenotype was observed in PRCre/+;Nr5a1f/f cKO males.  Results from our second study demonstrated that SF-1 plays an essential role in mature testicular function. The P450 17α-hydroxylase (Cyp17Cre/+;Nr5a1f/f) cKO male mouse, where the SF-1 depletion is specific to Leydig cells, were fertile, though showed reduced testis size with disrupted seminiferous tubules and impaired spermiogenesis, in addition to reduced expression of steroidogenic genes. While the aromatase (Cyp19Cre/+;Nr5a1f/f) cKO males were fertile and showed reproductive capacities comparable to control males, the Cyp17Cre/++Cyp19Cre/+; Nr5a1f/f cKO (dKO) model were either infertile or showed significantly impaired fertility. The dKO males displayed severe testis cord dysgenesis and impaired spermatogenesis caused by the depletion of SF-1 in both Leydig and Sertoli cells, suggesting that Sertoli cells can compensate for the absence of SF-1 in Leydig cells and vice versa. These data provide strong evidence that SF-1 is required for normal testicular steroidogenesis, spermatogenesis and male fertility, though whether the regulation of these functions is direct or indirect remains to be elucidated. Interestingly, the females of the three cKO mouse lines studied in this second article were fertile and the depletion of SF-1 in granulosa cells of antral follicles or in theca cells produced minor effects on their steroidogenic capacities. Collectively, the research presented in this thesis contributes to advance our understanding of the role of SF-1 in the regulation of essential reproductive events in the pituitary, ovary and testis of mature mouse gonads. The mouse lines generated for this project will serve as valuable tools to elucidate the mechanisms underlying SF-1 regulation of gonad function and present novel directions for the investigation of this nuclear receptor.

52	The impact of the estrous cycle on the vaginal microbiota and its association to pregnancy rates in dairy cows	A great deal of research has been done on the four phases of the estrous cycle in cows, yet very few studies exist regarding their vaginal microbiota. This study explored the various differences in the vaginal microbiota in pregnant and non-pregnant multiparous Holstein dairy cows. This information will allow us to see what a healthy vaginal microbiota looks like in pregnant cows and to someday try to achieve similar microbiomes in other cows to aid in fertility issues on farms. The objective of this study is to investigate variations in microbiota populations during the estrous cycle and their possible association with pregnancy rates using next generation sequencing of the V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene. Twenty-one multiparous Holstein cows on the same farm underwent artificial insemination (AI) after estrous detection. Vaginal swabs were collected four times, on days: 1 (before AI), 3, 15, and 19. Ultrasonography performed at day 31 confirmed that 9 cows became pregnant. A clear predominance of certain phyla was found, with Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria making up over 80% of the vaginal microbiota composition throughout, with notable variations between individuals. Differences in beta-diversity (community composition) that were proven statistically significant were between the estrus- proestrus phases in non-pregnant cows (P=0.028) and between the estrus and diestrus phase in pregnant cows at (P=0.043). These findings are a clear first step in identifying possible beneficial vaginal microbiota in pregnant cows that may help to determine how to proceed in manipulating other cows’ vaginal microbiota that have suffered from reproductive failure in the past.

53	L’impact de la norme portant interdiction du harcèlement psychologique ou moral au travail sur les droits de direction de l’employeur. Une étude de droit comparé : Québec, France, Belgique	Our project aims to measure the impact of the prohibition of psychological harassment at work on the company's management rights in Quebec (art.81.18 and seq., L.n.t). Moreover, as in this area other countries have distinguished themselves as pioneers by the introduction of a legislative framework prohibiting bullying at work and for the sake of having a more global vision of the phenomenon, we have found it useful to approach the subject under a comparative law approach, simultaneously analyzing French, Belgian and Quebec law.   Indeed, to counter violence in the workplace, legally, Belgium and France have banned acts of harassment and their repetition, by amending and adding penal provisions in their respective labor laws. Quebec has moved in the same direction by amending its labor standards act. All these standards have in common the establishment of a protection regime for employees who are victims of psychological or moral harassment. The basis of this protection is to a large extent the promotion of fundamental human rights in the domestic legal order. For example, in European law, workplace bullying is considered to be a form of discrimination that undermines the principle of equal treatment in employment and occupation.   However, we know that the main raison d'être of labor law as emphasized by Pierre Verge and Guylaine Vallée, is to limit the power that the employer has over the employee, which manifests itself through his rights of direction. These rights effectively grant the employer a wide margin of maneuver in the conduct of its business. He can thus «affect changes in company structures or work organization, modify production processes, implement and use new technologies, reduce production and labor force, etc. »   He can also take any disciplinary measure, including dismissing any employee who does not comply with his orders. As we can see, in several areas related to the management of his organization, the employer has long decided freely.   Thus, raising the question of psychological or moral harassment at work seems to question the power that the employer has to freely regulate his business.  Our objective in approaching the subject is to understand the justifications underlying this intervention of the state in a field that until then was not specifically targeted by the law and the impact of this prohibition on the rights of direction so as to confirm or refute our hypothesis of a dynamics of internal normative change of the company impelled by this prohibition. To achieve this, we will use the method of jurisprudential and doctrinal analysis inflected by a socio-legal perspective. This will enable us to understand whether there has been a change in the nature of management rights in light of the new situation. If so, how, and in what measure (s)? If not why?

54	L’influence sociale sur Instagram : l’influence contrôlée des usagères et usagers ordinaires	This master's thesis explores how social influence of influencers on Instagram is received. There are more than 1600 influencers working on social media, in many fields such as fashion, sports or art in Quebec. Several works in communication observe this Web phenomenon with regard to their marketing strategies or from the point of view of the communicator. In contrast, I analyse the reception of content from these influential people by ordinary people on Instagram, whom I refer to as ordinary users. To do this, I conducted 11 semi-structured interviews with young adults between 18 and 25 years old in which I asked them questions about their use of the platform, their relationship with influencers, and how they think they react to the influence. In light of these interviews, I identified different types of social influence on Instagram. Social influence on Instagram is therefore made up of two other types of influence: controlled influence and unperceived influence, which are themselves broken down into marketing and non-marketing influence. However, controlled influence stood out in most interviewees' speech, i.e. they know they are being influenced but can choose to submit to it or not.. Controlled influence shows a tension ‘‘dialectic of powers’’ on Instagram between influencers and their followers (Breton & Proulx, 2006).

55	Regulation of the RNA/DNA helicase Sen1 by proteasome-mediated degradation	Sen1 is an RNA/DNA helicase involved in protecting the yeast genome by resolving RNA/DNA hybrids and in the transcription termination of short non-coding RNAs. Despite the widespread cellular demand for Sen1 action, its cellular abundance is very low, suggesting that mechanisms regulate Sen1 protein levels in the cell. We have confirmed that Sen1 is degraded via a proteasome-dependent pathway. This mechanism depends on the catalytic activity of Glc7, a protein phosphatase that was previously shown to dephosphorylate Sen1 in vitro, and to interact with Sen1 through an ‘RVxF’ motif. Our working hypothesis is that Glc7 controls Sen1 protein levels via dephosphorylation of a phospho-degron. Interestingly, a potential site in the N-terminal region of Sen1 (serine 863) that may work as a phospho-degron has been identified in a proteome-wide analysis of phosphorylation and ubiquitylation cross-talk. In order to identify Sen1 phosphorylation sites enriched in the absence of Glc7, we conducted immunoprecipitation of Sen1 followed by mass spectrometry. This analysis identified one phosphorylation site within Sen1 at serine 1505 that could act as a potential degron site. Note that this site has also been reported in previous phosphoproteomic studies on yeast. Furthermore, the interaction between Sen1 and Glc7 and the importance of the RVxF motif (by mutation of residue F2003) for this interaction was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation. Surprisingly, prevention of this interaction does not affect the stability of Sen1 or cell growth. Overall, we have identified a small group of Sen1 phosphorylation sites with potential biological relevance. Our findings also confirm that mutating the RVxF motif of Sen1 impairs the interaction with Glc7 in vivo. These data further our understanding of Sen1 protein regulation by Glc7 in yeast cells that may provide clues to the role of senataxin, human orthologue, in neurodegenerative disorders.

56	Development and validation of the treatment expectations in chronic pain scale	Objectives: To develop and examine the psychometric properties of the Treatment Expectations in Chronic Pain (TEC) scale, a brief measure of treatment expectations of chronic non-cancer pain treatment.  Design: A cross-sectional study design was used.  Methods: After conducting a literature review and expert discussions, a preliminary version of the TEC scale was developed. Cognitive interviews with 10 clinicians and 14 patients were conducted to examine the scale's face validity and item wording. Last, two hundred and five patients on the waitlist for a multidisciplinary pain treatment centre completed a battery of self-report questionnaires to examine the TEC scale's reliability and construct validity. Mokken scale analysis was conducted to select the final items. Reliability (Cronbach's alpha and Guttman's lambda2 ) and construct validity (Pearson correlations) were assessed.  Results: The final scale was composed of nine items that each measured ideal and predicted expectations about process and outcome of treatment. Mokken scale analysis showed the presence of two subscales: ideal and predicted expectations. The TEC scale had good internal consistency (α = 0.876-0.869) and adequate discriminant validity as assessed by its low correlation with measures of depression, anxiety, and quality of life (r = -.038 to .114). The scale had however low correlation with a theoretically related measure of optimism (r = .240).  Conclusion: The TEC scale is a reliable scale measuring pain treatment expectation. Further evaluation of its psychometric properties is needed. The scale has the potential to deepen our understanding of the role treatment expectations play in chronic non-cancer pain treatment response. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Expectations play a role in pain perception and the response to pain treatment Patients' expectations about pain and its management are associated with treatment satisfaction The absence of a validated tool to measure treatment expectations in chronic non-cancer pain prevents further exploration and understanding of the role of expectations in the context of multidisciplinary pain treatment . What does this study add? A new, reliable 9-item scale measuring treatment expectations among chronic non-cancer pain patients attending specialized multidisciplinary pain clinics .

57	Clinical reasoning underlying acute care occupational therapists' assessment of rehabilitation potential after stroke or brain injury : a constructivist grounded theory study	Introduction In acute care hospitals, clinicians are expected to rapidly provide recommendations regarding patients' rehabilitation potential and candidacy for postacute rehabilitation. Some studies have investigated factors influencing referral to rehabilitation, but few have examined clinical reasoning underlying referral decisions. This study aimed to investigate what occupational therapists were thinking about (factors influencing reasoning), how they reasoned (thought processes) when evaluating stroke or traumatic brain injury patients' rehabilitation potential, and how they decided on referral to postacute rehabilitation.  Methods Using a constructivist grounded theory approach, the clinical reasoning of 10 acute care occupational therapists working in a large Canadian city was examined. Participant recruitment, data collection, and analysis were performed simultaneously following theoretical sampling procedures. Therapists' thoughts on patients' rehabilitation potential were collected twice (during chart consultation and initial patient assessment) using think-aloud protocols and semi-structured interviews. Constant comparison, memoing, and diagramming methods were employed during coding to help categorisation and conceptualisation.  Findings Numerous patient, clinician, and organisation-related factors were found to influence clinical reasoning. Occupational therapists interpreted these factors in an attempt to (1) predict recovery, (2) estimate rehabilitation potential, and (3) determine rehabilitation candidacy. They used two types of thought processes: (1) building a representation of patients' rehabilitation potential (involving eight steps including gathering and interpreting factors); (2) activating bottom-up and top-down scripts (comparing the expected impact of impairments on activity performance to behaviours observed during activity performance). Furthermore, an algorithm was developed describing how occupational therapists decide on referral to postacute rehabilitation.  Conclusion Findings can be used to teach students and novice occupational therapists how to identify and interpret key factors in the assessment of stroke or traumatic brain injury patients' rehabilitation potential. Results also provide insight on cognitive processes that can be taught for efficient assessment of rehabilitation potential and decision-making regarding referral to postacute rehabilitation.

59	A methodological scoping review of the integration of fMRI to guide dMRI tractography. What has been done and what can be improved; a 20-year perspective	Combining MRI modalities is a growing trend in neurosciences. It provides opportunities to investigate the brain architecture supporting cognitive functions. Integrating fMRI activation to guide dMRI tractography offers potential advantages over standard tractography methods. A quick glimpse of the literature on this topic reveals that this technique is challenging, and no consensus or “best practices” currently exist, at least not within a single document. We present the first attempt to systematically analyze and summarize the literature of 80 studies that integrated task-based fMRI results to guide tractography, over the last two decades. We report 19 findings that cover challenges related to sample size, microstructure modelling, seeding methods, multimodal space registration, false negatives/positives, specificity/validity, gray/white matter interface and more. These findings will help the scientific community (1) understand the strengths and limitations of the approaches, (2) design studies using this integrative framework, and (3) motivate researchers to fill the gaps identified. We provide references toward best practices, in order to improve the overall result's replicability, sensitivity, specificity, and validity.

60	Engagement scolaire en milieu défavorisé : le cas de classes du primaire où sont utilisées les technologies à l’école.	This research had for objectives to evaluate and compare the evolution of pupil engagement in underprivileged schools where ICTs were used in the classrooms by the construct validation of an English survey. From a translated and validated version in French of the MacArthur Engagement School Survey, it was possible to describe relatively positively the school engagement level of 230 ffth- and sixthgraders participating in that study. For that purpose, we used hierarchical linear modeling analysis. Over the course of six months, the results show that the quality of pupils’ engagement vary according to the socioeconomic level of their school.

61	Exploring the usability of the Andragogical process model for learning for designing, delivering, and evaluating a workplace communication partner training	Purpose: This study explores the usability of the andragogical process model for learning to develop, deliver, and evaluate training to improve communication between adapted transport drivers and people living with communication disabilities, and to identify the successes and limitations of the model in this context. Design/Methodology/Approach: Two aspects were considered to explore the usability of the andragogical process model for learning: 1) comparison between the elements of the model and the designing, delivering, and evaluating processes of the training; and 2) an appreciation evaluation. Findings: The model was useful to systematically design, deliver, and evaluate a workplace training that was appreciated by the learners, even though most of the model’s elements were modified to meet the constraints of the trainer and the organization. Assessing the needs for learning, establishing a human climate conducive to learning, and choosing appropriate training methods emerged as key elements that contributed to a successful appreciation of this training. Originality: This study is one of the few that examines the possibility of a systematic application of the andragogical process model for learning to workplace training. Its results suggest that the model could be considered for application by non-professional trainers or external trainers from a workplace, but that organizational constraints must be considered when using it.

62	Trajectories and predictors of functional capacity decline in older adults from a Brazilian Northeastern hospital	Background and Purpose:  Older adults face increased risk of loss of functional capacity both before and during hospitalization, so identifying older adults at risk for loss in functional capacity during hospitalization would help researchers and clinicians make informed decisions. This study aims to evaluate functional changes from preadmission (baseline) until discharge of hospitalized older adults and identify predictors of loss in functional capacity.  Methods:  This is a prospective cohort study conducted at a tertiary care hospital in Natal, Brazil, and enrolled all consecutive patients aged 60 years and older between January 1, 2014, and April 30, 2015. Independent variables included personal characteristics, instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) (evaluated by the Lawton and Brody scale), cognition (evaluated by the Leganés cognitive test), depression (assessed by the Geriatric Depression Scale—15), and in-hospital mobility (evaluated by the Short Physical Performance Battery). The dependent variable functional capacity was assessed by the Katz scale. These instruments were applied at 2 different times: upon admission (within first 24 hours) and at discharge (12-24 hours before). Functional trajectories were defined as the course of functioning from preadmission until discharge using functional capacity data. A multivariate analysis with generalized estimating equation estimated the longitudinal changes in functional capacity.  Results and Discussion:  The final sample consisted of 1191 older adults and 53.9% were less than 70 years of age. Regarding changes in functional capacity, 52.5% of the older adults presented worse functional capacity at discharge than at baseline. Being dependent for IADL instrumental daily living activities, the presence of depressive symptoms, low levels of cognition, and in-hospital mobility were risk factors for greater loss in functional capacity during a hospitalization event.  Conclusion:  Hospitalization events may be catastrophic for functional capacity in older adults in Brazil. Functional, cognitive, and emotional status and in-hospital mobility must be carefully assessed at hospital admission and monitored during hospitalization. Effective strategies for preventing loss in functional capacity in older people must improve in the Brazilian hospital system.	Aged , Functioning , Hospitalization , Mobility limitation	en	25799.0
63	"De ""skid"" à hacker compétent : l’apprentissage social chez les pirates informatiques"	Computer crime is no longer a new phenomenon. However, several authors agree to say that the concept of hacker is in constant transformation, which undoubtedly contributes to the fear and the fascination that they continue to exert, both in popular culture, but also among researchers. Indeed, over the years many researchers have attempted to understand and study them, and the validity of social learning theory has been demonstrated time and time again in connection with cyberdeviance. However, none of these studies were not based on direct contact with active hackers. As a matter of fact, none were based on interviews with hackers. Therefore, there is an important gap in the scientific literature on this subject.  Hence, the objective of this study will be to understand how hackers learn the skills essential to their activities in contact with others, the influence of those around them in the real and virtual world, as well as the role of imitation in these learnings. To do this, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 17 active hackers, recruited on discussion forums dedicated to hacking activities. The analysis of these interviews made it possible to identify major trends in terms of the role played by peers within hacker communities, in terms of knowledge sharing, the way in which this knowledge is transmitted, the importance of the community, as well as the role of mentors in their learning process. Akers’s social learning theory served as the theoretical framework for this study.	Imitation , Mentor , Social learning , Hackers , Peer influence , Forums	en	25765.0
64	Prior history of feeding–swallowing difficulties in children with language impairment	Purpose This study updated and extended our previous investigation (Malas et al., 2015) of feeding–swallowing difficulties and concerns (FSCs) in children with language impairments (LI) by using more stringent inclusion criteria and targeting children earlier in the care delivery pathway.  Method Retrospective analyses were performed on the clinical files of 29 children (average age: 60 months, SD = 9.0) diagnosed as having LI using standardized testing, nonstandardized testing and final speech-language pathologist judgment. The files of children born prematurely or with a history of anatomical, structural, neurodevelopmental, cognitive, sensory, motor, or speech disorders were excluded. Literature-based indicators were used to determine the prevalence of difficulties in sucking, food transition, food selectivity, and salivary control. Values were compared with the general population estimate of Lindberg et al. (1992).  Results A significantly higher percentage of histories of FSCs (48%) were found in the files of children with LI when compared with the population estimate (χ2 = 13.741, df = 1, p < .001). Difficulties in food transition (31%) and food selectivity (14%) were the most frequent. Data confirm and extend our previous findings and suggest that a previous history of FSCs may characterize children with LI early in their care delivery pathway.

65	Signs of spatial neglect in unilateral peripheral vestibulopathy	Background and purpose In this study, the question of whether egocentric representation of space is impaired in chronic unilateral vestibulopathies was examined. The objective was to test current theories attributing a predominant role to vestibular afferents in spatial cognition and to assess whether representational neglect signs are common in peripheral vestibular loss.  Methods The subjective straight-ahead (SSA) direction was investigated using a horizontal rod allowing the translation and rotation components of the body midline representation to be dissociated in 21 patients with unilateral vestibular loss (right, 13; left, eight) and in 12 healthy controls.  Results Compared to the controls, the patients with unilateral vestibulopathy showed a translation bias of their SSA, without rotation bias. The translation bias was not lateralized towards the lesioned side as typically found for biases reported after unilateral vestibular loss. Rather, the SSA bias was rightward whatever the side of the vestibular loss. The translation bias correlated with the vestibular loss, as measured by caloric response and vestibulo-ocular reflex gain, but not with the subjective visual vertical or the residual spontaneous nystagmus.  Conclusion The present data suggest that the dysfunctions of neural networks involved in egocentred and allocentred representations of space are differentially compensated for in unilateral vestibular defective patients. In particular, they suggest that asymmetrical vestibular inputs to cortical regions lead to representational spatial disturbances as does defective cortical processing of vestibular inputs in spatial neglect after right hemisphere stroke. They also highlight the predominant role of symmetrical and unaltered vestibular inputs in spatial cognition.	Vestibular loss , Spatial neglect , Subjective straight ahead	en	25747.0
66	Assessment methods in sexual rehabilitation after stroke : a scoping review for rehabilitation professionals	Purpose: The aim was to identify and describe the assessment methods used by rehabilitation professionals to evaluate sexuality for individuals post-stroke, as well as the domains of sexuality addressed.  Methods: Seven databases were selected for this scoping review. Articles needed to meet these inclusion criteria: published studies with a sample of ≥ 50% stroke clients and describing a quantitative or qualitative assessment method that could be used by rehabilitation professionals. This study was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines and domains of sexuality were categorized using the ICF core set for stroke.  Results: Of the 2447 articles reviewed, the 96 that met the selection criteria identified a total of 116 assessment methods classified as standardized assessment tools (n = 62), original questionnaires (n = 28), semi-structured interviews (n = 16) or structured interviews (n = 10). Sexual functions were predominantly assessed using standardized tools, while intimate relationships and partner's perspective were generally addressed more by original questionnaires and qualitative methods. A stepwise approach combining relevant assessment methods is presented.  Conclusions: Individually, these diverse assessment methods addressed a limited scope of relevant domains. Future research should combine quantitative and qualitative methods to encompass most domains of sexuality of concern to post-stroke individuals.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONMost of the studies reviewed here used quantitative methods to assess sexuality, rather than qualitative methods, and mostly used standardized assessment tools.Few assessment methods covered all domains related to sexuality.Qualitative methods and standardized assessment tools were shown to be complementary, therefore emphasizing the added value of mixed methods in assessing sexuality after a stroke.Among the methods that were reviewed, certain would be more suitable for the identification of the need to address sexuality (e.g., Life Satisfaction Checklist-11) and others to assess more thoroughly sexuality (e.g., Change in Sexual Functioning Questionnaire (CSFQ-14)).

67	Are the supporters of populist parties loyal voters? Dissatisfaction and stable voting for populist parties	Scholars of electoral behaviour regularly link political dissatisfaction to two types of behaviour: voting for populist parties and unstable voting behaviour. It is therefore not surprising that the electorates of populist parties are generally assumed to be rather volatile. In this article, we argue that this is not necessarily the case – in particular in a context of increasingly strong and viable populist parties. We make use of data from the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems project to show that voters for populist parties are neither more nor less volatile than voters for mainstream parties. Political dissatisfaction among voters for populist parties even increases the likelihood of stable voting for populist parties. The supply of populist parties further conditions the stability of the populist vote, as voters in systems with established populist parties are more likely to vote stably for populist parties. Finally, we find that in a context of strong and stable populist parties, the effect of political satisfaction on vote switching is somewhat reduced.

68	Longitudinal associations of cannabis, depression, and anxiety in heterosexual and LGB adolescents	Cannabis use is linked to symptoms of depression and anxiety, particularly among sexual minorities.This study examines the relationships between cannabis, and depression and anxiety symptoms at 13,15, and 17 years using cross-lagged models in a predominantly White (n= 1,430; 92%) subsample of1,548 participants from the Quebec Longitudinal study of Child Development. Multigroup analyseswere conducted to examine the models according to sexual orientation. Demographic covariates wereincluded as control variables, as well as alcohol, cigarette, and other drug use to examine cannabis spec-ificity. The full sample revealed small bidirectional associations, which remained significant once con-trol variables were included in the model: cannabis at 13 and 15 years predicted anxiety symptoms at 15and 17 years respectively, and depression symptoms at 15 years predicted cannabis at 17 years. The ini-tial association between cannabis at 13 years and depression symptoms at 15 years was accounted forby other drug use at 13 years. Substantial differences were found between heterosexual participants andsexual minorities: LGB participants presented a substantially larger positive association between depres-sion symptoms at 15 years and cannabis at 17 years, as well as a negative association between anxietysymptoms at 15 years and cannabis at 17 years. Both of these relationships remained significant whenaccounting for control variables. These results suggest that the relationships between cannabis, anddepression and anxiety symptoms are bidirectional across adolescence, albeit small. Sexual minoritiespresent particularly large associations that may represent self-medication efforts for depressive symp-toms between 15 and 17 years.

69	Estimation de la mortalité attendue à long terme des maladies chroniques : une comparaison de différentes méthodes d’analyse	Long term mortality associated to medical conditions is rarely known with accuracy. Despite this, mortality assessment is essential in certain field of activity, such as life insurance and medical expertise. Constant Relative Risk (RR) methodology is the most used method although often leading to superficial and conservative estimations. We then decided to compare two mortality estimation methods, the constant Excess Death Rate (EDR) and the Proportional Life Expectancy (PLE). We analyzed long term mortality of several chronic medical conditions, such as cancers and coronary artery diseases, and we compared those results with those from the three distinct estimation methods. Thus, we were able to determine which methodology is the most accurate. Our results show that constant EDR and PLE are superior to constant RR to better estimate the mortality. The longer the follow-up is, the better those methods are. Finally, factors like age and the kind of the medical condition seem not to have an important impact when it comes to identify the most suitable method. Constant EDR and PLE should be recommended for mortality assessment in medical insurance underwriting and for life expectancy evaluation in medical expertise.

70	Preuves comportementales de capacités olfactives améliorées chez les personnes sourdes	Sensory deprivation, and particularly hearing impairment, is an excellent theoretical model for studying the phenomena of neuroplasticity in the human brain, as well as the adaptive behaviors available in order to support the daily lives of individuals deprived of a sensory modality. To adapt to their handicap, deaf individuals rely daily on their other senses that have remained intact. Evidence from literature has consistently supported superior visual and tactile performance in congenitally deep deaf individuals. In this study, we explored complete olfactory skills in congenitally deaf individuals. For this, we evaluated the olfactory capacities of 11 congenitally deaf individuals through psychophysical tasks relating to the processes of detection, identification, discrimination and localization of odors, in comparison with 11 hearing individuals. The Sniffin’Sticks test and an olfactometer were used to identify potential differences in olfactory performance between the two groups. The results demonstrated that hearing deprivation leads to superior performance in terms of olfactory modality in congenitally deaf individuals compared to hearing individuals.

71	Validation externe des critères de gravité du saignement intracrânien chez les patients avec un traumatisme crâniocérébral léger	Background: There is variability in the management of patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) and abnormal findings on their initial head computed tomography (CT). The main objective of this study was to validate the value of the Important Brain Injury (IBI) criteria, introduced by the Canadian CT-Head Rule, in predicting the need for surgical intervention. The secondary objective was to evaluate the usefulness of IBI criteria to predict admission to a tertiary care hospital. Methods: This is a post hoc analysis of a prospective cohort of adult patients presenting to the ED of one tertiary care, academic center, between 2008 and 2012, with MTBI and an abnormal initial head CT. Neurosurgical intervention and tertiary center admission were at the discretion of the treating physician. The sensitivity and specificity of the IBI criteria were calculated with their 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). Results: A total of 678 patients (male = 65.9%, mean age = 62.5 years) were included, of whom 114 (16.8%) required neurosurgical intervention. All patients requiring neurosurgical intervention met IBI criteria on their initial head CT (sensitivity of 100% [95%CI 96.8-100]). However, only 196 (28.9%) patients who did not require neurosurgical intervention were correctly identified using these criteria (specificity of 34.8% [95%CI 30.8-38.8]). The IBI criteria had sensitivity of 78.3% (CI 74.6-81.7) and specificity of 55.9% (CI 47.4-64.2) to predict admission to a tertiary care center. Conclusion: The IBI criteria for MTBI identified all patients who required neurosurgical intervention, but did not show a high specificity. They were less sensitive, but more specific, in predicting admission to a tertiary care center.	validation , mild traumatic brain injury , guidelines , management , neurosurgical intervention , head computed tomography , validation	en	25666.0
72	Inhibiteurs de PARP : leur rôle potentiel en monothérapie et en combinaison en cancer du sein triple-négatif	Fourteen Canadian women die every day from breast cancer. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has a poor prognosis. Numerous efforts are made to offer these patients targeted therapies such as poly (adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) to improve survival and minimize chemotherapy-related toxicity. It is not well understood which subset of TNBC patients will benefit from PARPi; and if different sequencing strategies of PARPi and chemotherapy can improve therapeutic efficacy and decrease toxicity.  We previously derived a 63-gene signature predicting response to PARPi with a high overall accuracy. Our objectives are 1) to evaluate the clinical implications of the 63-gene signature; and 2) to determine the optimal sequence of administration of talazoparib and carboplatin in vivo in BRCAWT TNBC. First, we evaluated the mutational frequency of the 63 genes in different clinical settings using two publically-available datatsets. Second, we compared three cohorts of orthotopic xenografts: A) talazoparib first, combined with carboplatin on day 3; carboplatin first, followed by talazoparib B) one day later; and C) seven days later.  We found that the mutational frequency was high in breast cancer subtypes of poor prognosis. Mutated luminal B patients had a lower survival than non-mutated patients. We also found that tumoral and metastatic inhibition were similar between cohorts A and B, but cohort B had less toxicity.   In conclusion, there is potential for PARPi efficacy in luminal B and poor prognosis tumors. Second, pretreatment with carboplatin may be an effective approach with less toxicity.

73	Situations de violences sexuelles en milieu universitaire : une étude exploratoire descriptive des motifs de (non-)dévoilement et (non-)dénonciation, des réactions sociales et des retombées	Sexual violence on university campuses (SVUC) is a problem in the broader social context of violence against women (Comité permanent de la condition féminine, 2017). Sexual violence can have a significant impact on the people who experience it and these consequences can be influenced by the way in which friends, family, professionals and institutions respond when these situations are disclosed or reported (Campbell et al., 2009; Ullman, 2010). This research is part of a larger study intitled Enquête Sexualité, Sécurité et Interactions en Milieu Universitaire (ESSIMU) : Ce qu’en disent étudiant.es, enseignant.es et employé.es (Bergeron et al., 2016). Using an online survey distributed in six Quebec universities, ESSIMU collected accounts of SVUC situations from 2057 respondents including 332 respondents reporting 357 SVUC situations described as (not) disclosed or (not) reported, which were analyzed in the present qualitative research. This descriptive research seeks to explore the experiences of disclosure, reporting, nondisclosure and not reporting through a thematic analysis of the reasons for disclosing and reporting, social reactions, outcomes and reasons for not reporting or disclosing. The thematic analysis made it possible to describe the reasons for which the students, employees and teachers who experienced situations of SVUC disclose, report or do not. The situations analyzed show that when they disclose, it is mainly informally to members of their social network or to colleagues. There are also people who disclose or report to formal providers such as people in authority or university resources. Reactions received after disclosure or reporting are mostly positive reactions such as responses of emotional support, but negative reactions, including reactions that minimize or invalidate the person’s experience or feelings are also reported. The results are placed in relation with key concepts identified in the literature review, including reasons for (not) disclosing or (not) reporting and social reactions. Recommendations for research and intervention are given.	plainte , Sexual violence , University , Disclosure , Report	en	25633.0
74	« De véritables débits de poisons » : analyse des référendums de prohibition dans les provinces canadiennes entre 1898 et 1921	The historical results of different referendums and plebiscites held in Canada since the Confederation revealed a high level of opposition between the provinces. Quebec particularly distinguishes itself from the rest of the country during these referendums. Indeed, this province was the only one to oppose conscription, the prohibition and to hold two referendums to secede from Canada. Our understanding of the origins of these differences in the Canadian provinces, and Quebec in particular, is still vague today. It is important to look back in time to see these distinctions at the beginning of the 20th century by studying the multiple issues linked to alcohol and prohibition. This thesis aims to explain the relationship between socio-demographic variables and prohibition plebiscite results. Temperance movements have been founded in the mid-19th centuries in Canada and the United States, with unequal success. Canadian temperance movements never really succeed to extend their influence nationwide, but it was successfully introduced in communities later by the Scott Act (1878). The national referendum of 1898 revealed a strong opposition to prohibition in Quebec. The origins of these regional disparities, between the province of Quebec and the rest of Canada, and at the community-based level in Quebec, has yet to be explained. Which factors account for these differences? In the following analysis, several different variables like ethnic origins, rural and urban proportion, and gender are used to explain the support or opposition toward prohibition. With the data analysis of the Canadian census (1901, 1921), the plebiscite results and the Quebec Liquor Commission annual report (1921-1922), ordinary least squares models (OLS) and generalized linear models (GLM) will be used to analyze multiple variables in support of prohibition. The attitudes of Catholics and French-speaking communities outside Quebec will be analyzed during the New Brunswick (1920) and Nova Scotia plebiscite (1920). A link with the actual political attitudes about the legalization of cannabis tends to show that these distinctions persist through time concerning public health issues in Quebec.

75	Étude exploratoire sur les effets de l’impulsivité et de l’incertitude sur les performances d’apprentissage et de renversement de l’apprentissage chez l’humain	Individuals differ in how they each generally behave across time and contexts, as well as in their ability to acquire new information, and flexibly adjust their behavioral responses when a change in contingencies occurs. Still today, the proximal and ultimate causes of these differences are not well understood. In recent years, some advocate that divergent risk-reward trade-offs linking fast/proactive-slow/reactive behavioral types to fast/inflexible-accurate/flexible cognitive styles could partly explain the maintenance of these differences. However, it seems that there is a discrepancy in the literature about the existence and nature of such a speed-accuracy trade-off. One explanation could be that the link between personality and cognition is moderated by different factors. Thus, we propose here an exploratory study on how impulsive actions, impulsive choices, and expected uncertainty may interact altogether on learning and reversal learning performances in humans. To assess their impulsivity, participants had to fill out the Barratt impulsiveness scale questionnaire and to complete both a stop signal task and an experiential discounting task. Then, their learning and reversal learning performances were measured in a new reversal learning task, under different levels of reinforcer uncertainty. Results show that learning and reversal learning performances patterns linked to action impulsivity depend on expected uncertainty and choice impulsivity. In addition, they also support the idea that these dimensions of impulsivity are not maladaptive per se, which may provide another line of explanation for the maintenance of variation in impulsivities and flexibility.	performances cognitives , individual differences , personality , flexibility , cognitive performances , speed-accuracy trade-off , learning , reversal learning , uncertainty , impulsivity	en	25625.0
76	Optimisation des marais filtrants pour l’abattement du pesticide chlorantraniliprole du ruissellement agricole	Over the past decades, a wide variety of emergent pesticides, such as chlorantraniliprole (CAP), have been introduced despite the lack of in-depth knowledge of their ecotoxicological risk. Treatment wetlands (TWs) are environmentally friendly and sustainable technologies that have shown great potential to mitigate common agricultural pollutants, such as pesticides in runoff. The objective of this study was to optimize the use of the horizontal subsurface flow treatment wetlands (HSSF TWs) by determining a) the effect of biochar amendment to the substrate and b) the performance of three species of macrophytes (Phragmites australis subsp. americanus, Scirpus cyperinus and Sporobolus michauxianus) in CAP removal from agricultural runoff. The removal efficiency was calculated using the mass balance method in mature HSSF mesocosms fed with synthetic agricultural runoff containing CAP for a period of one month. Mesocosms with the addition of biochar were very effective in removing CAP (90-99%) and remained so throughout the experimental period. This efficiency is likely due to the high adsorption capacity of biochar, although this mechanism has not been directly measured. In contrast, CAP removal in mesocosms planted without biochar was low and limited and there was no difference between species, although there were differences in their above-ground biomass and their evapotranspiration (ET) rate. However, the planted mesocosms acted as buffer zones, reducing the CAP mass of the influent and slowly releasing it into the discharge. The ET rate of S. cyperinus and P. australis was higher than that of S. michauxianus, resulting in a better buffering effect. This study suggests that adding biochar to the HSSF TW substrate is promising for CAP attenuation in agricultural runoff, but their long-term effectiveness remains to be investigated. Nevertheless, TWs should be used as a complementary tool, as part of wider actions aimed at reducing the pressure of pollutants on aquatic ecosystems.	pesticides , macrophytes , Phragmites australis subsp. americanus , Scirpus cyperinus , Sporobolus michauxianus , chlorantraniliprole , Horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetland , Macrophyte species , Biochar , Phragmites australis subsp. americanus , Scirpus cyperinus , Sporobolus michauxianus , Substrate enhancement , Mass balance , Evapotranspiration rate , Hydraulic retention time	en	25622.0
77	Les liens entre la rémunération intangible et le roulement volontaire dans le secteur des TIC au Canada	The purpose of this thesis is to study the links between the intangible reward and voluntary turnover components in the information and communications technology (ICT) sector in Canada. Using Blau’s social exchange theory (1964) and Balkin and Bannister’s resource dependance theory (1994), and the empirical-literature, this thesis proposes two general hypotheses as well as seven sub-hypotheses. The first general hypothesis suggests that intangible reward is associated with lower voluntary turnover. Regarding the seven sub-hypotheses, they come from this first general hypothesis. These are the seven components of intangible reward that are analyzed in this thesis, which are the number of hours worked per week, on average, the possibility of a part-time work schedule, the average number of hours in the normal work week, the presence of a compressed work week, the presence of a summer schedule, the possibility of teleworking and the presence of structured training programs. The second general hypothesis suggests that the number of intangible reward practices offered is associated with a lower voluntary turnover. The cross-sectional data used in this study come from companies operating in the ICT sector in Canada. In partnership with TECHNOcompétences, data collection was carried by Normandin Beaudry’s firm, from January to April 2016. One hundred twenty five surveys were distributed to as many organizations. These surveys were completed by human resources directors from these organizations. Ten of the organizations did not report any data regarding voluntary turnover. Thus, the data of 115 questionnaires were used and analyzed within the framework of this study. The two general research hypotheses are invalidated. Indeed, for the first hypothesis, none of the seven sub-hypotheses (1a to 1g) could be confirmed. The results were not significant. Regarding the second hypothesis, the relationship is not significant, also invalidating the Hypothesis 2. In conclusion, this thesis reiterates the importance for human resources managers and their organizations to offer diversified intangible reward practices that are adapted to the workforce reality that makes up the labor market. It also aims to recall the need to have a complete global compensation offer, where intangible and tangible rewards are complementary.	TIC , Intangible rewards , Voluntary turnover , ICT	en	25620.0
78	Compensatory and protective factors against violent delinquency in late adolescence : results from the Montreal longitudinal and experimental study	Purpose To identify compensatory/protective factors in pre-adolescence and in mid-adolescence against late adolescence violent delinquency in a sample of kindergarten males from low socioeconomic environments. The selected factors concerned modifiable elements of their family (parental supervision), school (school engagement), and personal life (perceived legitimacy of legal authorities).  Methods Participants were from the Montreal Longitudinal and Experimental Study, a prospective longitudinal study of 1037 kindergarten boys from disadvantaged neighborhoods. We used latent profile analysis to identify at-risk and non-at-risk behavioral profiles in kindergarten and regression analyses to test the putative compensatory/protective factors against late adolescence violent delinquency.  Results We identified three at-risk behavioral profiles in kindergarten (i.e., Low, Moderate, and High aggressive–disruptive). Perceived legitimacy of legal authorities, parental supervision and school engagement were identified as compensatory and/or protective factors in pre-adolescence and mid-adolescence against violent delinquency in late adolescence. The relative influence and the specific role of these factors depended, however, on the developmental period examined (pre-adolescence vs. mid-adolescence).  Conclusions Interventions for high risk kindergarten children that aim to foster positive social bonds with the community (including legal authorities), family and school probably need to start early in elementary school and continue until late adolescence to prevent violent delinquency during adolescence.

79	L’intégration en emploi des personnes ayant un trouble du spectre de l’autisme : évaluation d’un programme de soutien à l’emploi et exploration des facteurs soutenant l’intégration en entreprise	Individual with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have a much lower employment rate than the general population. Difficulties experienced during social interactions are some of the main factors hindering their job search and their job retention. However, many adults with ASD have characteristics that are valued by the labour market. Our study evaluates the implementation and the outputs of the employment program at Action main-d’œuvre (AMO), a community organization located in Montreal, offering employment services for individuals with ASD who do not have an intellectual disability. More specifically, we examined the characteristics of their clients, the services offered, the outcomes of the program and the satisfaction with their services. In addition, we aimed to understand the integration process into a new job of employees supported by AMO and what factors influenced the success of this integration. To understand the program implementation, outcomes and customer satisfaction at AMO, we recruited 37 participants receiving AMO services as a first step. These participants completed questionnaires at the start of their access to the services, as well as after 6 weeks of employment or after 6 to 9 months of unsuccessful job search. In addition, we consulted their files at AMO during the 12 months following the start of their participation in the study. When a participant who had found a job gave us permission, we invited their employer to complete a questionnaire on their satisfaction with AMO’s services and their appreciation of their employee. Eleven employers agreed to participate in the study.  The first article of this thesis shows that the participants had autism manifestations of all possible levels: mild, moderate or severe. In addition, 38% of participants had adaptive abilities below the normal range. A large proportion of the participants (62%) had high levels of anxiety. Our results indicated that 62.1% of the participants obtained paid employment. However, only 59.2% of participants who found a job remained employed. The time spent on employed participants varied widely, from 0 to 21 contacts according to the files of the clients. Counsellors also had to work with other professionals to support participants’ complex needs in other areas of their lives, such as social workers and special educators. Satisfaction with services was high, both among participants with ASD and among employers. To understand the process of integrating an employee with ASD into an organization and the contribution of organizational factors to this process, we wrote nine case studies based on interviews with 18 other participants. According to criteria ensuring the diversity of the cases studied, we first recruited a sample of 4 managers in collaboration with AMO. Subsequently, we recruited another sample of 5 clients, as well as their counsellor, and their manager (for 4 of these clients). In our second article, we found that the quality of the relationship between the supervisor and his employee was the most important dimension explaining the success or failure of the integration process for employees with ASD. This dimension was important at all stages of the process, from hiring and until the employee was in a situation of inclusion or was no longer employed. This finding can be understood with the leader-member exchange theory (LMX), which explains how the quality of the supervisor’s relationship with each of his subordinates contributes to positive results for himself and for each employee. The quality of this relationship was influenced by the action of the employment counsellor (also named job coach) who facilitated communication between the supervisor and the employee. The type and intensity of support varied depending on the unique communication and social interaction challenges of each employee. The results of these two articles demonstrate the diversity of AMO’s clients and their support needs as well as the usefulness of the services in supporting them in finding employment. The less favorable job retention results and our understanding of the factors influencing job integration demonstrate the importance of providing support to clients with ASD in the longer term.	leadership , autism , employment , leadership , leader-member exchange , mental health , supported employment	en	25603.0
80	"Étude de la violation CP dans des processus au LHC 
qui brisent la conservation du nombre leptonique"	"This thesis is dedicated to the study of CP violation in these processes ūd→tb̄ e⁻ μ⁻ et W⁻→ l-1 l-2 (q′¯ q)⁺.   There are experiments which search to identify these processes at the ""Large Hadron Collider"" (LHC). The outcome of the observation of these decays would imply violation of lepton number conservation, ∆L = 2. If the neutrino is a Majorana particle, it is its own antiparticle and we can observe processes that violate the conservation of the lepton number, ∆L = 2. The neutrinoless double beta decay (0νββ), is a process which is characterized by ∆L = 2, occurs when the neutrinos are Majorana particles. If we observe 0νββ-like processes at the LHC, there is also the possibility of looking for CP violation. Measuring this type of CP violation would give us information about New Physics that could not be easily obtained using other methods. There are three types of CP violation, namely: direct, indirect and kinematic (triple product). This research presents studies concerning direct and triple product CP violation. The first paper is devoted to triple products in the process: ūd→tb̄ e⁻ μ⁻. In addition, the model considered does not involve a Majorana neutrino. Using MadGraph, we have numerically studied and evaluated the CP violation for the two mentioned processes for three types of accelerators: high luminosity HL-LHC (14 TeV), high energy HE-LHC (27 TeV) and for a future FCC-hh collider (100 TeV). We found that the triple product is not measurable at the HL-LHC, may be measurable at HE-LHC, and is certainly measurable at FCC-hh. In the second article, we investigated to see how to generate CP violation with right-handed neutrinos. The second article is on the study of direct CP violation the decay W⁻→ l-1 l-2 (q′¯ q)⁺   by involving two neutrinos N1and N2. It is also observed that the value of CP asymmetry can be measured with an accuracy of 3σ and as 0.1% ≤ ACP ≤ 10%."

81	Traducteurs et traductions imprimées à la cour anglaise de la reine Henriette Marie (1625-1642)	At the English Court of Queen consort Henrietta Maria (1625–1642), translation was used as a political tool, partly to impose the queen’s linguistic, cultural and Catholic heritage on Calvinist England. Her court was a veritable hub of imported literature, as well as French and Catholic culture. During the reign of her husband, Charles I, the queen’s patronage attracted male and female translators who sought her protection by publishing English versions of literary genres that were trending in France at the time (such as pastorals, dévot literature, or plays). However, the place of translation in the literary activity that made her court so remarkable has never been systematically studied. The purpose of this project is therefore to offer a comprehensive analysis of the role played by translators and translation in the literary culture of Henrietta Maria’s English Court. In this thesis, translation is defined as a practice instigating cultural, political and social ties in the transnational history linking England and France.  My research draws on scholarship pertaining to the cultural and ideological aspects of translation in Stuart Court culture and builds on recent studies on the intersection between translation and print in early modern Europe. I study patterns of patronage, literary production, and text circulation; then I probe the political, social, religious, and print networks involved in the production of translations associated with the Queen’s court and extending well beyond its social or geographical boundaries. Specifically, I examine early 17th-century English and French court culture, the place of translation within this culture, and the impact of print culture and material history on the selection and circulation of translated texts. By studying the cultural and literary history from the perspective of materiality and agency, I recreate the political, cultural and ideological networks that operated between Great Britain and continental Europe. This article thesis begins with two chapters written in French in which I specify the context and chosen approach, and which are followed by four case studies written in English. Through an analysis of translations that are printed outside of Great Britain, the case study in chapter 3 highlights the significance of transnational cultural networks in early modern England and helps us understand the production and circulation of printed translations in 17th-century Europe. Chapter 4 consists of an exploration of the concepts of agency and patronage in translation history and culminates with the case of Thomas Hawkins, a translating agent with ties to the queen’s court and continental Jesuit Colleges. The fifth chapter addresses the role of women and Catholic recusant literature at the court of Henrietta Maria. In it, I investigate the participation of women in the creation and distribution of translations, notably as patrons, translators, and printers. In the final chapter, I explore transnational networks of cultural exchange between England and Europe with, as a starting point, a Catholic treatise written by French author Jean Puget de la Serre, which was printed in Brussels though dedicated to Henrietta Maria and Charles I. Together, these chapters offer a comprehensive analysis of the role played by translators and translation in the literary culture of Henrietta Maria’s English Court. The thesis is followed by the corpus of translations linked to the English Court of Queen Henrietta Maria and printed between 1625 and 1642 that I have established. The corpus continues to expand as I pursue this research, and currently comprises 78 titles. The approach I have selected for this project is both top-down and bottom-up: I use macrohistoric analysis methods to investigate power structures, institutions, and patronage; then, to establish a comprehensive overview of the roles of translators at the queen’s Court, I analyze paratexts, texts, and the correspondence of translators in printed books. The synergy between these approaches lends originality to the project and ensures an accurate representation of the actions of translating agents at the English Court of Henrietta Maria. My work contributes to research in translation history by providing some much needed insight into early modern translators, their practices, and the networks in which they were involved.

82	Epidemiological study of Coxiella burnetii in dairy cattle and small ruminants in Québec, Canada	The bacterium Coxiella burnetii (C. burnetii) can infect a wide range of animals, most notably ruminants where it causes mainly asymptomatic infections and, when clinical, it is associated with reproductive disorders such as abortion. It is also the etiological agent of Q fever in humans, a zoonosis of increasingly important public health concern. A cross-sectional study was performed to estimate the apparent prevalence and spatial distribution of C. burnetii positivity in dairy cattle and small ruminant herds of two regions of Québec, Canada, and identify potential risk factors associated with positivity at animal and herd levels. In dairy cattle herds, individual fecal samples and repeated bulk tank milk samples (BTM) were collected. In small ruminant herds, serum and feces were sampled in individual animals. ELISA analyses were performed on serum and BTM samples. Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) was done on fecal and BTM samples. An animal was considered C. burnetii-positive when at least one sample was revealed positive by ELISA and/or qPCR, while a herd was considered C. burnetii-positive when at least one animal inside that herd was revealed positive. None of the 155 cows had a qPCR-positive fecal sample, whereas 37.2 % (95 % CI = 25.3–49.1) of the 341 sheep and 49.2 % (95 % CI = 25.6–72.7) of the 75 goats were C. burnetii-positive. The apparent prevalence of C. burnetii-positive herds was 47.3 % (95 % CI = 35.6–59.3) in dairy cattle herds (n = 74), 69.6 % (95 % CI = 47.1–86.8) in sheep flocks (n = 23) and 66.7 % (95 % CI = 22.3–95.7) in goat herds (n = 6). No spatial cluster of positive herds was detected. At the individual level, the only significant association with positivity in multivariable regressions was higher parity number in small ruminants. At the herd level, the use of calving group pen, the distance to the closest positive bovine herd, and small ruminant herd density in a 5 km radius were associated with dairy cattle herd positivity, whereas small ruminant herds with more than 100 animals and with a dog on the farm had greater odds of C. burnetii positivity. Our study shows that the infection is frequent on dairy cattle and small ruminant herds from the two studied regions and that some farm and animal characteristics might influence the transmission dynamics of the C. burnetii infection.

83	Perceived risks and benefits of hippotherapy among parents of children currently engaged in or waiting for hippotherapy : a pilot study	Objective: Explore the perceived risks and benefits of hippotherapy among parents of children currently engaged in or waiting rehabilitation using hippotherapy. Method: Phenomenological qualitative exploratory pilot study. An interview guide validated by experts was used to conduct the interviews. Summaries were written to capture first impressions. One team member coded the transcripts and the coding was validated by the research team through discussion until consensus was reached. Results: The average age of the participants (n = 4) was 37.3 ± 6.6 years. The few risks they perceived related to physical injuries. Lack of knowledge of contraindications, lack of fear, minimization of risks, and risk-attenuation factors also emerged as important themes. Benefits accounted for a large part of the content of the interviews and were grouped under 13 themes, including motor and postural control, enjoyment and the development of a special relationship. Conclusion: Minimization of the perceived risks compared to the numerous perceived benefits could create clinical issues such as the client putting self at risk of injuries (e.g., bites, falls, and kicks) if not cautious enough or complications insufficiently prevented, which suggests the need to develop educational activities for an informed consent to this type of rehabilitation.

84	Perspectives des professionnels de la santé face au don d'organes après décès cardiocirculatoire suivant un retrait de traitement chez un patient apte ou une aide médicale à mourir	In the summer of 2014, the case of a conscious patient, respirator dependent, who requested a withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy and expressed the wish to donate his organs shook the Quebec organ donation and transplantation community. It was the beginning of an important reflection on the acceptability of organ donation in conscious and competent people who have chosen to stop vital treatment.  This reflection was timely as the Quebec government was preparing its End-of-Life Care Act, which would make medical assistance in dying (MAID) legal. Since it was clinically possible for some patients to donate organs following MAID, it was likely that the legalization of this practice would increase the number of conscious patients wishing to donate their organs when they would have chosen to die. The literature on the ethical issues raised by this type of organ donation was then almost non-existent and, at the time the research project began, practice guidelines did not exist in Quebec and Canada. It therefore became imperative to identify these ethical issues and to analyze them in order to contribute to the guidance of these new practices. There was also no study describing the perspectives of health professionals regarding such donations.  The objectives of this doctoral project were (i) to identify the ethical issues raised by organ donation in a conscious and competent patient requesting withdrawal of life sustaining therapy or MAID; (ii) to analyze these issues using ethical theories; (iii) to obtain and understand the perspectives of health professionals on the issues raised by organ donation in these particular contexts; (iv) finally, to compare the perspectives of professionals to the policies that have been adopted in Quebec since its inception. We therefore conducted a qualitative exploratory study through interviews with organ donation professionals likely to be involved in the organ donation process by a conscious patient who has requested withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy or MAID. Our sample included physicians and nurses in intensive care, operating room or involved in organ donation in two Montreal hospital centers that are very active in organ donation (CHUM and Hôpital Sacré-Cœur) and at Transplant Québec.  We identified ethical issues through a literature review and by analyzing the perspectives of professionals. The main ethical issues are related to respect for patient autonomy, information to be provided to potential donors, conscientious objection by professionals, the possibility for recipients to refuse organs procured after MAID, the acceptability of organ donation following a confidential MAID, the dead donor rule, the acceptability of directing an organ to a specific recipient designated by the donor and the acceptability of choosing MAID in order to make organ donation possible. We first analyzed these ethical issues using Norman Daniels' wide reflexive equilibrium model and then incorporated participants' perspectives on the various issues using the normative empirical - reflexive equilibrium model into our analysis. Based on our results, we can conclude that : (i) organ donation for competent patients requesting MAID or withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies was generally ethically acceptable within the legal context in effect at the time of our research; (ii) patients requesting MAID and suffering from a disease compatible with organ donation should be informed of the possibility of organ donation; and (iii) conscientious objections should be respected as long as they do not compromise patients' access to care; iv) recipients should be offered the opportunity to refuse organs procured after MAID when they are placed on the waiting list; and v) a patient who wishes to donate his or her organs following MAID that he or she wishes to keep confidential should be informed of all the implications related to the specific context of the procurement and should consent to a breach of confidentiality in order to minimize the risk of undermining public trust in organ donation.  Some of these conclusions are contrary to current policies.  Our study has contributed to a better understanding of the ethical issues raised by organ donation in these new contexts. In addition, we identify issues that require further reflection and possibly a revision of the guidelines in place.  Many questions remain and new ones arise as changes to the MAID eligibility criteria are foreseen (MAID outside of the end-of-life context, in cases of mental illness or by advanced request).	medical assistance in dying , organ donation , ethics , withdrawal of life sustaining therapy , qualitative research , reflexive equilibrium	en	25539.0
85	Industrial air pollutant emissions and respiratory health effects in children	Asthma is a main chronic childhood disease. It has been associated with exposure to outdoor air pollutants from remote regional and traffic sources. Pollutant mixtures from industrial sources and their effects may not be the same as those from traffic and regional sources. Yet contrary to associations between pollutants from these sources and asthma in children, associations with community exposures to industrial air pollutant emissions have not been systematically assessed. Furthermore, although substantial reductions in industrial emissions of fine particles (PM2.5) and sulphur dioxide (SO2) have been noted in industrialized countries over the past decades, associations between the geographic and the temporal variations of industrial air pollutant emissions and the variation of asthma morbidity in children have been understudied.   In this dissertation, we aimed to investigate the association between asthma morbidity and industrial air pollutant emissions in children. We first assessed the association between exposure to industrial air pollutant emissions and asthma in children based on available evidence. We then assessed the associations between the spatial and the temporal variations in industrial air pollutant emissions and the spatial and temporal variations in asthma morbidity in Québec.   For the first objective, we searched bibliographic databases to identify studies on the association between children's exposure to air pollution from industrial point-sources and asthma-related outcomes, including: asthma, asthma-like symptoms, wheezing and bronchiolitis. Where possible, we performed random-effects meta-analyses of results. For the second and third objectives, we conducted spatial and temporal ecological analyses based on data for small geographic areas (n=1386) in the province of Québec. For the second objective, we related industrial emissions of PM2.5 and SO2 obtained from the National Pollutant Release Inventory and other variables such as regional levels of PM2.5, median annual household income and the percentage of the population of children exposed to Environmental Tobacco Smoke (ETS) to the total count of asthma hospital admissions in children younger than 13 years of age per small area (data from the database MED-ÉCHO: Maintenance et exploitation des données pour l'étude de la clientèle hospitalière), for the years 2002 to 2011, with negative binomial General Additive Models. For the third objective, we related industrial emissions of PM2.5 and SO2, as well as other environmental and sociodemographic variables mentioned above, to the yearly numbers of asthma onset cases in children aged <13 years from the database QICDSS (Québec Integrated Chronic Disease Surveillance system) over the years 2002 to 2011, with fixed effects negative binomial models (statistical models for panel data). In these models, regional PM2.5 levels were from satellite data, the median income from the census, ETS was from a pan Canadian survey and traffic related air pollution was estimated with kilometers of major roads in small areas.  The systematic review highlighted that half of the selected published studies used a cross sectional study design, ecological binary proximity was the main exposure method used in 15 out of 36 articles, while asthma outcomes were diverse but mainly collected by questionnaires and healthcare services. The pooled odds ratios (ORs) from the meta-analysis from case-crossover studies with hospitalisation for asthma and bronchiolitis in children younger than 5 years old was 1.02 (95%CI: 0.96-1.08; I2 = 56%) per 10 ppb increase in the daily mean concentration of SO2; for PM2.5, the pooled ORs was 1.02 (95%CI: 0.93-1.10; I2 = 56%) per 10 μg/m3 increase in the daily mean concentration. In cross-sectional studies on the prevalence of asthma and wheezing in children, pooled ORs in relation to residential proximity to industries were 1.98 (95%CI: 0.87-3.09; I2 =71%) and 1.33 (95%CI: 0.86-1.79; I2= 65%), respectively. Results of the spatial and temporal ecological analyses suggested that industrial emissions of PM2.5 and SO2 were not related to asthma morbidity. The relative risk (RR) for asthma hospital admissions from the multivariate spatial model was 1.0009, per increase of one ton of PM2.5 (95%CI: 0.9982-1.0037); the RR for SO2 per increase of one ton was 0.9999 (95%CI: 0.9997-1.0001). Additionally, the RR for new asthma onset cases in children from the multivariate temporal models were 0.99 per 1000 tons of SO2 (95%CI: 0.99-1.00) and also 0.99 per 100 tons of PM2.5 (95%CI: 0.98-1.00). Nonetheless, there was a 3.29% decrease in the rate of cases (95%CI: 2.44-4.14) per 1 ug/m3 decrease in the regional PM2.5 levels.  Overall, our results suggest that industrial air pollutant emissions have limited influence on asthma morbidity. This is in contrast with what would be expected based on the published literature that report effects of air pollution from sources other than industries. The results suggest that better exposure assessment and better study designs should be adopted in future studies to assess the association between asthma morbidity and industrial air pollutant emissions in children.

86	Conception d’une formation en ligne sur l’évaluation en simulation des apprentissages d’étudiants en sciences infirmières dans un programme par compétences	The use of clinical simulation in nursing education is on the rise. In addition to being a teaching method, simulation is used to assess student learning. In a competency-based approach, this type of assessment involves making a judgment on the quality of the students' performance using direct observation. According to best practices in simulation, simulation educators must be trained to assess during simulation. However, existing courses on students’ learning assessment during simulation lack flexibility and accessibility. Furthermore, asynchronous e-learning courses that can be taken in an autonomous manner are more suited to nurse educators’ training needs. As part of a Master of Nursing Internship, a three-hour asynchronous e-learning course on students’ learning assessment during simulation, was designed for tutors working as raters at a simulation centre in Quebec. The ADDIE Model (Ghirardini et al., 2012) structured the design of the e-learning course : learning needs analysis, design, development, implementation and evaluation. The Rater Cognition Framework (Gauthier, St-Onge et Tavares, 2016) was used to design and develop the course’s content, and the Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning (Mayer, 2009) guided it’s technopedagogical aspects. The tutors who tested the course perceived that it met their learning needs. Their global satisfaction regarding the e-learning course was high and they were very satisfied with its flexibility, accessibility, and interactivity. This appears to be the first e-learning course in French on students’ learning assessment during simulation. This course could be taken specifically by faculty simulation educators or by clinical preceptors who assess students’ learning by directly observing their performance.

87	Interaction entre l’effet différentiel du sexe et l’effet modérateur du soutien social perçu sur la santé mentale des travailleurs en Protection de la Jeunesse victimes de violence au travail	Background. Workplace violence is part of the people working for Youth Protection's daily lives due to the vulnerable population served. The exposure of workplace violence is linked to psychological consequences such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and depression. Among the factors that influence the development of the different mental health symptoms, social support is known to be one of the strongest predictors of PTSD. Most recent studies also reveal the importance of measuring social support's quality (positive or negative) to understand how it can impact workers. Finally, some studies also show that workplace violence reactions might vary depending on the victim's gender.  Objectives. The main objective of that study is to measure if the quality of social support impacts the development and evolution of the symptoms of PTSD, anxiety and depression. The secondary objective is to explore if the sex of the participants can moderate the association between social support and the previously measured symptoms.  Methods. A sample of 150 Youth Protection workers answered self-reported surveys that examine their evolution four times over 12 months. Mixed linear models have been used to analyze the development of PTSD, anxiety's and depression's symptoms according to the quality of social support and then the sex of the participants.  Results. First, positive social support wasnegatively linked to depression's symptoms. Workers who perceived their social support being positive had fewer symptoms. For negative social support, it was linked to PTSD, anxiety and depression. Finally, the difference between men and women was only measured for PTSD. Men had more symptoms than women, although they benefit more from positive social support than women.  Conclusion. This study confirms the importance of measuring the quality of social support on workplace violence victims to understand its impact on psychological consequences better. Also, the sex seems to be a moderator only for PTSD's association with workplace violence.

88	Le jeu de policiers-voleur sur différentes classes de graphes	This thesis studies the game of cops and robbers and consists of three articles, each considering a specific class of graphs. In the first chapter, notation and basic definitions of graph theory are introduced. Al- though each article has an introduction citing the relevant concepts and results, the first chapter of this thesis also contains a general introduction to the game of cops and robbers and presents some of its major results. The second chapter contains the paper written with Seyyed Aliasghar Hosseini and Peter Bradshaw on the game of cops and robbers on abelian Cayley graphs. We improve the upper bound on the cop number of these graphs by refining the methods used previously by Hamidoune, Frankl and Bradshaw. The third chapter presents the paper concerning the cop number of 2K2-free graphs. More precisely, it is proved that 2 cops can always catch the robber on these graphs, proving a conjecture of Sivaraman and Testa. Finally, the fourth chapter is the paper written with Samuel Yvon which deals with graphs of cop number 4. We show that such graphs have at least 19 vertices. In other words, 3 cops can always catch the robber on any graph with at most 18 vertices, which answers in the negative a question by Andreae from 1986. An important part of the proof is by computer; this thesis thus has an appendix containing the code used.

89	Exploring the prosodic and syntactic aspects of Mandarin-English Code switching	Code-switching (CS) is one of the most common natural behaviors among bilinguals. Linguists have been exploring the constraints behind CS to explain this behaviour, and while syntactic constraints have been the focus for decades, prosodic constraints were only studied more in depth recently. As a less common language pair in CS research, studies on Mandarin-English CS are limited for both constraints. Thus, this study explores the prosodic constraints and syntactic patterns of this language pair with a natural CS database. Prosodically, this study applies the information-based approach and its fundamental unit, Intonation Unit (IU), to conduct the analysis. The result of 10.6% bilingual IU (BIU) proves to be reliable and offers solid evidence that bilinguals tend to code-switch at IU boundaries. This supports the pioneer work of Shenk (2006) from the unexplored Mandarin-English language pair. In addition to this, the study develops solutions to deal with the subjectivity problem and the database appropriateness problem in this approach to strengthen the validity of the results. Syntactically, this study investigates the syntactic patterns at switching points on the Mandarin-English language pair using data collected from a rarely investigated bilingual community. Based on the results, a syntactic pattern specific to this language pair was observed and this study suggests it disrupted the final results. This study conducts an analysis with the results of both the prosodic aspect and the syntactic aspect. When the interfering results are eliminated, a more solid outcome can be observed which provides greater support to the prosodic constraint argument.

90	Les nuages sombres comme métaphore de la peste dans l'art vénitien de la Renaissance	"The plague raged in Venice from 1348 to 1797, striking in successive deadly waves. Countless votive images produced as ""spiritual remedies"" brought solace to the faithful terrified of the ongoing scourge. However, in the retables directly related to the plague, we observe the frequent presence of dark clouds. This pattern, which has gone largely unnoticed, is studied here for the first time in detail and associated with contemporary medical theories regarding the aerial spread of the disease. The dark cloud is first examined as an iconographic motif and placed in the context of Venice's health and sanitary situation in the 15th and 16th centuries, as well as the ancient literature on the plague that influenced the humanist thought of the Venetian Renaissance. Furthermore, we examine the theoretical function of the dark cloud, as a ""figure"" (E. Auerbach and L. Marin), as a ""pictorial graph"" (H. Damisch) and as a ""detail"" (D. Arasse). The use of these different theoretical models allows us to reconsider the presence and possible meanings of the dark cloud as a metaphor for the plague. The thesis concludes with a typology test of the plague cloud."	Renaissance , Venice , Renaissance , Plague , dark clouds , images of plague	en	25463.0
91	Julius Caesar in Gaul and Germania : strategy, tactics, and the use of aggressive diplomacy as a tool for war	While Caesar and his writings have been thoroughly studied for the past two centuries, it is time to make use of a new approach pioneered by Arthur M. Eckstein to study him. In his Mediterranean Anarchy, Interstate War, and the Rise of Rome Eckstein argues that Rome opportunistically conquered Italy and the Eastern Mediterranean through a series of defensive wars or “invitations”. What is novel about this approach is its use of political science paradigms, with a heavy emphasis on the concept of the realist anarchy. As such, using Eckstein’s framework and applying it to Caesar’s Bellum Gallicum this thesis shows that Caesar, contrarily to traditional historiography, did not conquer Gaul out of sheer bellicosity and personal ambition, but rather, as a result of a direct invitation from Rome’s Gallic allies to defensively interfere on their behalf in an act of bellum iustum. To do so, we will demonstrate that a state of anarchy exists in Gaul in accordance to Eckstein’s wider Mediterranean system. After which, a detailed analysis of Caesar’s De Bello Gallico will outline the specific instances in which Caesar opportunistically used this pre-existing anarchy to his advantage, before finally delving into the specificities of the “invitations” along with an analysis of Caesar’s use of aggressive diplomacy. To achieve this, we used first and foremost, Caesar’s commentaries as the primary sources, while Eckstein’s aforementioned work gave us the interpretative concepts and theoretical basis we needed; additionally, we drew on multiple supplementary primary sources and the surrounding relevant scholarship. After we demonstrated that Gaul was an anarchic system, we successfully applied Eckstein’s model, and its results clearly showed that the Gauls’ bellicosity against each other blinded them to the Roman danger, which Caesar used to systematically intervene, filling the power vacua left behind in his wake. This model is important because it provides us with an alternate explanation to the Roman conquest of Gaul, using one of history’s sister disciplines, political science. With this approach’s viability proven, it opens the door for vast other studies, in this as of yet, unexplored direction.	relations diplomatiques , Anarchism , Diplomatic relations , Rome Foreign relations (510-30 B.C.) , Caesar.

92	L’engagement politique dans la collaboration polyphonique des publics à travers de l’i-Doc transmédia	Documentary practice finds new media beyond the cinema screen. Through these different channels, the documentary opens online and offline spaces for the construction of meaning through collaborators, the audience included. The transmedia documentary project Who is Dayani Cristal? was chosen to understand the resources of a project aimed at activism, in this case on migration issues. Within the framework of this research, this project will be analysed as an i-Doc through a multimodal methodology which make possible the discernment about the construction of meaning by the creators of the project as well as by the collaborators who participate in it. This co-construction of meaning mobilizes values that bring together participants who are not necessarily in the same geographical context, but they become a community within the framework of the polyphonic collaboration of this transmedial documentary. Through modal meanings and their functionalities throughout a non-fictional interactive project for political purposes, open spaces encourage co-creation of meaning providing the circumstances for audiences to engage in social change. Thus, the transmedia documentary and its interactive nature can motivate the meeting of participants who become aware of the need to act and mobilize themselves through a kind of political mimesis.	documentary , transmedia , interactive , non-fiction , cinema , new documentary practices , multimodal , audiovisual , political communication , activism	en	25445.0
93	Une poéticisation du langage dans les performances musicales nord-occitanes : l'accessoire-bohème, le capital-intellectuel et le marqueur-local	"Beginning in 2019 an ethnographic field in Auvergne (and peripheral regions of the Massif Central in Southern France), several current themes of Endangered Languages - theme increasingly central in contemporary studies of linguistic anthropology - will be presented and discussed. The Auvergnat language is a North-Occitan dialect located in a marginal area of the Occitan cultural area, as well as the centralized French space, which makes it in many ways the ""patois of patois”. It is classified by UNESCO among the most endangered languages in Europe. Basing my research work on the question of linguistic usage, I discuss the registers, representations and socio-cultural formations made possible by activity that is both political and poetical. Intellectuals and academicians of normativity, folklorists of the romanticism of last speakers and, above all, natural speakers, the ""great absentees of the discourse on language"", meet in these linguistic and cultural settings. The fieldwork reported here focused on village festivals, Occitanist political and associative meetings, and urban anarchist or worker cafes in which the Auvergnat language is spoken. This to evoke the contribution of disruptive practices and concerns for linguistic revitalization to the romantic and political potential of Auvergnat Occitan. This study concentrates on the Panoccitanism represented by the performativity of militant and artistic linguistic usages: these manifestations of creation and hybridization which form a revitalized language, a new language, defying the strong monolinguism dominating France. This study has been supplemented by a comparison with the Occitan dialects of Piedmont (Italy), thus making it possible to highlight the influences of a linguistic policy on the use and representation of a language and a culture."

94	Exploration de la diversité crânienne récente et passée en Afrique centrale : analyses via la morphométrie géométrique tridimensionnelle	The biological diversity of the African continent impels us to explore the multiple sources of variation that shape human morphology. Morphometry, a complementary tool to genetics, explores current and past diversity. Therefore, by exploring various factors (phylogeny, geography, climate, history) this research aims to re-examine the morphological variation in Central Africa, a key geographical region for understanding the history of the continent. Thus far, craniometric studies have been carried out with two-dimensional methods on complete crania, and rarely included fragmentary archaeological collections. The aim of this research is also to overcome this problem, by analyzing the whole cranium versus the temporal bone. The latter has the advantage of an exceptional state of preservation and provides information of phylogenetic nature.  Therefore, a sample of 147 crania from Central Africa was selected. Recent individuals (137 complete crania) originating from various localities spread over a geographical area of 760,000 km2. The archaeological sample (11 temporal bones) originates from two sites: Shum Laka, Cameroon (7,000 – 3,000 BP) (n=2); and Upemba Depression, R.D.C (1,3000 BP) (n=9). After creating a 3D models database using photogrammetry, 3D geometrics morphometrics was performed to analyze separately crania and temporal bones. Results demonstrate a weak influence of sexual dimorphism on morphology and raise four points: I) The analysis of current cranial morphology reflects various phylogenetic (ethnicity), environmental (geography, climate), and possibly histological (movement of populations) aspects. II) The morphology of the temporal bone also reflects a high inter-population variation. However, because distances between groups are relatively short, this could be explained by the fact that the temporal bone reflects mostly phylogeny. III) A continuity of some morphological traits of the temporal bone through time has been detected, particularly in the Iron Age group (Upemba Depression). IV) Finally, a possible anatomical adaptation to environmental pressures (diet, economy) was observed, especially in the shape of the mandibular fossa of the temporal bone, changing from a circular form during the LSA to an ellipsoid form in recent times.

95	Semantics of the gendered body at the IOC’s Medical Commission between 1967 and 1972	"This thesis focuses on gender testing in high-level sport. More specifically, those conducted by the International Olympic Committee (IOC). I begin with a historical contextualization of the various classifications of the body biomedical and social sciences have put forward. Then, through a content analysis of the minutes, correspondences, and studies read by the Medical Commission between 1967 and 1972, I highlight six categories of discourse on the body. These are divided into two types of categories: first the ways in which the body and sex differences are talked about; then, the relationship between the body and the members of the Medical Commission. The three types of discourses relating to the body are: “the polymorphic nature of the body"", ""the body as dimorphic"", and ""the abnormal body"". Discourses on the relationship between the abnormal body are: ""the body as scientific object"", “the body as abstract category”, and ""the body as an object of ethical concern""."

96	Les facteurs contraignant et facilitant la participation des infirmières la formation continue numérique	E-learning education is widely used in the health care sector for medical education, as well as in the nursing education. Online education has established itself as an essential teaching method for the continuing education of nurses due to its accessibility and flexibility. Several studies report the experiences of health professionals pertaining to the use of e-learning training, but very few studies have addressed the issue of participation as a whole. This qualitative exploratory study aims to explore the factors that facilitate and constrain the participation of nurses in online continuing education according to the perspective of nurses. The model of Non Adoption, Abandonment, and Challenges to scale up, Spread, and sustainability of Health and Care Technologies (NASSS) (Greenhalgh, and al., 2017) served as the theoretical foundation in the development of the semi-structured interview guide. This study was conducted with eleven nurses working in one hospital centre. A thematic analysis of the data was performed using the method of Miles and Huberman (2003). The results of this study highlight three main categories: the advantages perceived by the participants, the essential support of the clinical setting and the components of e-learning. The results of this study will help to understand the challenges faced by nurses for participating in online continuing education.

97	Traitement interne et externe des dialogues interreligieux et interculturels par les organismes à but non lucratif (OBNL) aconfessionnels œuvrant auprès des populations confessionnelles réfugiées et/ou vulnérables au Liban	This action research is looking at the context of non-confessional non-profit organizations (NPOs) working with refugee and vulnerable populations in Lebanon. At a time when humanitarian organizations, international and local, favor this non-denominational status, it seems relevant to study the way in which they enter into dialogue with populations in dire needs, whose cultural and religious identities are sometimes more pronounced due to their often traumatic displacements. Based on an ethnographic method, we followed four NPOs – two Lebanese (Amel and Arcenciel) and two internationals (Jusoor and IECD Lebanon) – for almost a year, in their actions among these populations. Adopting a position of participant observer to be at the heart of their relationships and interactions, we followed the forms of interreligious and intercultural dialogues that came to life, both between the members of these NPOs and in their relations with the populations with whom they work. In order to sharpen our analysis, we also considered the cultural origin of these NPOs to establish their impact on the forms of dialogue they developed. In the final part of this thesis, we try to combine the strong points we found of the Lebanese non-confessional NPO model, in its treatment of these forms of dialogues, with an interworldview dialogue approach developed by Brodeur (2019), to extract a model for the treatment of interreligious and intercultural dialogues feasible for NPOs working in a West Asian context, that includes training on managing these types of dialogues and populations subject to discrimination, recruiting a diversity representative of the field, and identifying similarities and common values among different groups of actors. Based on an interdisciplinary conceptual framework and a qualitative survey bringing together seventeen semi-directed individual interviews, this thesis aims modestly to provide further avenues of research to this transitional question of the treatment of interreligious and intercultural dialogues by non-confessional NPOs.	dialogue , in-group , ONG , out-group , pluriscope , education , identity , intercultural , interreligious , intervisional , interworldview , Lebanon , NGO , non-confessional , nonreligious , NPO , power dynamics , refugees	en	25421.0
98	Stratégies de légitimation des États de facto : l’industrie touristique en « République moldave de Pridnestrovie »	"This paper is interested in the study of tourism and its industry as a strategy for internal and external legitimization in de facto states. Using the particular case of Transnistria, we used a mixed analysis based on official data and policies as well as photographic observations obtained directly on the field. Tourism industry provides a ""two-in-one"" strategy, serving both identity and state formation and is aimed at both internal and external audiences. Our results highlight the usefulness of this strategy for legitimization purposes while establishing the existence of close links between the public and private tourism sectors. While the public sector is mainly focused on justifying the existence of the de facto state and its distinct identity, the private sector acts as a liaison with the outside world, and according to financial and economical gain. Despite the existence of some opposition between both sectors of the tourism industry, we argue that they are complementary and that they serve the Transnistrian state in its quest for internal and external legitimization."

99	Vers une actualisation des espaces d’habitation destinés aux personnes aînées : étude comparative des milieux de vie en faveur du bien-être des résidents	This research focuses on the built environment, and more specifically on ways to design spaces that are conducive to the aging of the developing elderly. Currently, Canada, like the rest of the world, is subject to demographic aging. It has been estimated by the WHO (2016b) that 20 to 24% of the Canadian population will be aged 60 and over in 2015. These figures predict that at least 30% of the Canadian population will be 60 years of age or older in 2050. With a more active lifestyle and a desire to remain integrated into the community, they advocate for progressive housing models that are close to family, friends and community. However, it is noted that the most common housing models are not necessarily the most popular among future seniors, who wish to age in conditions different from those of their parents. In the context of the aging population, it seems important to work on updating housing models, responding to the wishes of future seniors with changing aspirations. This change in the representation of aging questions the definition of seniors' well-being and the way in which the built environment of housing models supports their aspirations.   This research is in keeping with the phenomenological tradition, on the one hand, through its emphasis on understanding the lived reality of seniors and, on the other hand, through its desire to identify the essence of well-being through spatial and architectural parameters. The observation of the phenomenon of living influenced the construction of the methodological strategy based on the conduct of semi-directed interviews with inhabitants, designers and resource persons as well as the direct observation of two housing complexes for seniors.  The results from the field allow the identification of spatial and architectural parameters that have an impact on the well-being of seniors. Nevertheless, the plurality of old age makes it difficult to generalize the needs and aspirations, as the housing reflects the specificities of each individual. As a result, the importance of choice and the design of living environments offering control to the inhabitants are to be recommended.	inclusion , interior design , aging , well-being , inclusion	en	25382.0
100	Le design comme compétence de la conduite à projet en contexte de crise : le cas du projet Visières	Humanity is experiencing a period of systemic crisis. The crisis of spring 2020 revealed many disfunctions and established a climat of uncertainty over different sector of activity. To respond to this climat of crisis, new postures and practices are required; and design is no exception. In order to explore the dynamics of response to a crisis and the role of design, this research project is investigating the role of design in the conduct of project in a context of crisis. The key ability of design to act and react to any events, situations, actions that emerges during the conduct of a project in a time of crisis.   This research is looking into answering the question: “How does design dynamize the conduct of project in a context of crisis and at which level?” In order to answer this question, theories of strategic design, project management and the dynamics of trust and cooperation are presented. The main objective of this research is to identify and understand the competency of design intervenes the conduct of project and the associated practices. This research looks to answer those questions through the case study of a crisis. Interviews and observations were conducted through the participation in the project Visières. The project Visières is a self-organizing response to the shortage of protective medical visor during the spring crisis of 2020. The course and the evolution of the project act as a showcase of the role of design in the conduct of project in times of crisis. The strategic design perspective is used to explore the position of design and its competency of adaptation as a key actor in societal transformation and emergency relief. The results of this research on the specific competency of design to act and react to events of a project promotes that the design practice of « bricolage » is the most suited to conduct a project in a context of crisis. Also, to support the success of the project, the practice of « bricolage » requires an agile environment, an agile organization and agile organizational practices.	design , bricolage , fab lab , social dynamics , self-organizing project , systemic , strategic design	en	25381.0
101	Dopaminergic mechanisms underlying the expression of antipsychotic-induced dopamine supersensitivity in rats	Antipsychotic treatment can produce a dopamine-supersensitive state, potentiating the response to dopamine receptor stimulation. In both schizophrenia patients and rats, this is linked to tolerance to ongoing antipsychotic treatment. In rodents, dopamine supersensitivity is often confirmed by an exaggerated psychomotor response to d-amphetamine after discontinuation of antipsychotic exposure. Here we examined in rats the dopaminergic mechanisms mediating this enhanced behavioural response, as this could uncover pathophysiological processes underlying the expression of antipsychotic-evoked dopamine supersensitivity. Rats received 0.5 mg/kg/day haloperidol via osmotic minipump for 2 weeks, before treatment was discontinued. After cessation of antipsychotic treatment, rats showed a supersensitive psychomotor response to the D2 agonist quinpirole, but not to the D1 partial agonist SKF38393 or the dopamine reuptake blocker GBR12783. Furthermore, acute D1 receptor blockade (using SCH39166) decreased the exaggerated psychomotor response to d-amphetamine in haloperidol-pretreated rats, whereas acute D2 receptor blockade (using sulpiride) enhanced it. Thus, after discontinuation of antipsychotic treatment, D1- and D2-mediated transmission differentially modulate the expression of a supersensitive response to d-amphetamine. This supersensitive behavioural response was accompanied by enhanced GSK3β activity and suppressed ERK1/2 activity in the nucleus accumbens (but not caudate-putamen), suggesting increased mesolimbic D2 transmission. Finally, after discontinuing haloperidol treatment, neither increasing ventral midbrain dopamine impulse flow nor infusing d-amphetamine into the cerebral ventricles triggered the expression of already established dopamine supersensitivity, suggesting that peripheral effects are required. Thus, while dopamine receptor-mediated signalling regulates the expression of antipsychotic-evoked dopamine supersensitivity, a simple increase in central dopamine neurotransmission is insufficient to trigger this supersensitivity.

102	Nonspecific interactions in biomedical applications	Nonspecific interactions play a major role in the microscale functioning of biological units. Exploiting these interactions in design and application of biomedical systems has been beneficial in different branches of biomedicine. In this review, recently designed biomedical systems that function mainly, or partially, based on nonspecific interactions, including but not limited to electrostatic, hydrophobic, and steric interactions, are discussed. The focus will be on the application of these interactions in biolubrication, bioadhesion and antifouling, drug delivery, and tissue engineering. The information gathered in this review can be helpful in guiding the readers in the direction that the field has been following in the past few years.

103	Attitudes et comportements alimentaires chez un groupe d'adolescentes athlètes exerçant un sport de type esthétique à un haut niveau : l’influence des pressions de l’environnement sportif et de l’identité athlétique	Adolescent female athletes participating in high performance aesthetic sport are considered at risk of developing inappropriate eating behaviors and attitudes towards food and body image (IEBA) as they are exposed to the socio-cultural pressures that the majority of female non-athletes experience and at the same time, they face pressures centred on appearance and performance in their sport. Many athletes would be tempted to modify their bodies or control their weight by adopting IEBA's in order to achieve the ideal body and to optimize their athletic performance. However, the results of studies comparing the prevalence of IEBA between athletes and non-athletes are contradictory. Several authors suggest that methodological differences between studies may explain the divergent results, including the presence of heterogeneous samples. In order to overcome some of the current limitations observed in the scientific literature on the subject, a homogeneous sample of 197 adolescent girls between the ages of 12 and 19 was composed of 122 non-athletes and 75 athletes participating in high performance aesthetic sports, with the aim of evaluating and comparing IEBA among them. This study had three objectives. The first objective is to describe and compare the intensity of IEBA and the degree of identification with athletic identity measured in a group of adolescent female athletes to those assessed in a control group. The second objective is to examine the contribution of sport-specific pressures on the variability in the intensity of drive for thinness, bulimic behaviours, body image dissatisfaction (IEBA) among the group of athletes. Then, the third objective, which is exploratory in nature, is to verify whether athletic identity acts as a moderating variable in the relationship between pressures from the sport environment and IEBA. The Eating Disorder Inventory-3 (EDI-3) and the Body Shape Questionnaire (BSQ) were used to assess the intensity of IEBA. The pressures female athletes experience in their sport environment were measured using the Weight Pressures in Sport for Female (WPS-F) questionnaire and athletic identity was assessed using the Athletic Identity Questionnaire (AIQ). The results of the study indicate that there is no significant difference between the two groups in terms of the intensity of the IEBA. However, the group of athletes differed in their degree of identification with athletic appearance, which was significantly higher. Furthermore, the results reveal that pressures in sport environment contribute to explain the variability in IEBA among the athlete group. Finally, athletic identity is not a moderating variable in the relationship between sport environment pressures and IEBA. Results are discussed and hypotheses are raised to explain them.

104	Le vécu des femmes cherchant à évoluer à titre de gestionnaire en organisation : exploration des barrières et des facilitateurs à leur avancement	In Quebec, women represent 47.6 % of workers, but only 35.3 % of managers at all levels (Statistics Canada, 2020). Therefore, several studies, mainly quantitative, have been conducted to determine the barriers and facilitators to the advancement of women in management in organizations. This study is part of this line of research by seeking, through a qualitative approach, to gain an in-depth understanding of women's experiences with the interpersonal and organizational barriers and facilitators they encounter when they seek to advance to management positions (objective 1). A second research objective is to verify the replicability and validate the results of research on the subject with women first-level managers in Quebec. To this end, 14 semi-structured interviews were conducted and then analyzed using Paillé and Mucchielli’s (2012) thematic analysis method. The results indicate that the participants faced 10 interpersonal barriers and 14 interpersonal facilitators as well as 10 organizational barriers and 8 organizational facilitators. Thus, the majority of the elements identified in the literature are corroborated by this study (10/15). In addition, several barriers and facilitators that were not documented by the researchers emerge from the interviews (20/35). The study thus highlights new elements to be explored in future studies and underscores certain aspects specific to the Quebec economic context (e.g., elements specific to SMEs). The importance of organizational culture, work climate and skills development for the advancement of women is an important practical outcome to consider in organizations according to the results.

105	"Pour une pensée préhumaine : humanités numériques, éditorialisation
et métaontologie"	Is it possible to overcome the opposition between a radical constructivism and a naive dogmatism -- as it has recently been reformulated, notably by Quentin Meilassoux, in terms of the opposition between correlationism and realism? This article proposes the idea of an original mediation which is not that of human thought. According to Meilassoux the mediation of being can only be embodied in individuals. By questioning this idea, this text tries to think a material and embodied mediation which manifests itself in a particular way in the technique. The reflection on the digital, the editorialization and the digital Humanities becomes the pivot to think a ”prehuman” mediation, which allows moreover to solve the problem of the ancestral ones that was at the foundation of Meillassoux’s analyses.

106	Perceptions of behavior analysis in France : accuracy and tone of posts in an Internet forum on autism	Applied behavior analysis (ABA), which is often used as the basis for designing interventions for people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), is highly misrepresented and underutilized in many countries. One country where ABA remains particularly difficult to access is France. One potential problem is that parents often rely on online resources such as social media to identify interventions for their children. Many of these sources of information do not accurately portray ABA, or even openly disapprove of the science. To examine this issue, we used a data-mining methodology to extract, categorize, and analyze 897 messages on ABA published in a popular French internet forum based on their type, tone, and accuracy. Although messages were generally accurate and approving of ABA, our results showed that one in three messages fully or partially disapproved of the science, and one in four messages contained some inaccurate information. Our analyses also indicated that parents were more likely to approve of ABA than individuals with ASD. Finally, we found that the number of approving messages published in the internet forum decreased with time, especially over the last five years. Together, these results support the relevance of developing systems-level approaches to dispel misconceptions about ABA in languages other than English.

107	Molecular-level study of photoorientation in hydrogen-bonded azopolymer complexes	To optimize azobenzene-containing materials for applications such as rewritable waveguides and holographic data storage, it is imperative to understand the effect of the azobenzene structure on the photoresponse of the material. Supramolecular materials, in which a complexed photoactive azobenzene controls the motion or other properties of a passive polymer, are uniquely convenient for studying the impact of specific chemical modifications. Here, we use polarization modulation infrared structural absorbance spectroscopy (PM-IRSAS) to hydrogen-bonded supramolecular azobenzene complexes using poly(4-vinylpyridine) (P4VP) as a model polymer. We show that changing the tail group from hydrogen (AH) to cyano (ACN) induces greater angular redistribution of the chromophores and, remarkably, provokes P4VP pyridine ring orientation. Increasing the degree of complexation decreases the saturated orientation of both AH and ACN, whereas for P4VP/ACN it increases the pyridine orientation as well as the orientation stability of both components. These results explain the contrasting photoinduced birefringence behavior previously observed for these complexes and identify azo-azo intermolecular interactions as the main reason. To our knowledge, this is the first molecular-level spectroscopic analysis of the contrasting contributions of azobenzenes to the photo-orientation of supramolecular azopolymer complexes and the first report of the large impact of small molecular changes on the capacity of azo dyes to transfer light-induced orientation to a photopassive polymer.

108	2021 ISHEN guidelines on animal models of hepatic encephalopathy	This working group of the International Society of Hepatic Encephalopathy and Nitrogen Metabolism (ISHEN) was commissioned to summarize and update current efforts in the development and characterization of animal models of hepatic encephalopathy (HE). As defined in humans, HE in animal models is based on the underlying degree and severity of liver pathology. Although hyperammonemia remains the key focus in the pathogenesis of HE, other factors associated with HE have been identified, together with recommended animal models, to help explore the pathogenesis and pathophysiological mechanisms of HE. While numerous methods to induce liver failure and disease exist, less have been characterized with neurological and neurobehavioural impairments. Moreover, there still remains a paucity of adequate animal models of Type C HE induced by alcohol, viruses and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease; the most common etiologies of chronic liver disease.

nurses’ clinical reasoning"	Virtual simulations and serious games are e-learning interventions with the potential to enhance nurses' clinical reasoning. However, distinctions in the design principles of each intervention remain ambiguous. Clarifications are needed to distinguish both interventions and ease the articulation between their design principles and the development of clinical reasoning. In this study, we examine the overlapping and unique design principles of virtual simulations and serious games.

110	Rôle de la modulation de la phosphatidylsérine dans l’activation des cellules T	T lymphocytes protect us against pathogens by orchestrating the adaptive immune response. T lymphocytes possess a specific surface receptor, the T cell receptor (TCR), which conveys the stimulation signal towards the cytoplasm for the initiation of the T cell activation cascade. The TCR is a multimeric complex composed of the TCRαβ, CDεγ, CD3εδ and CD3ζζ dimers. The TCRαβ chains recognize the pathogenic antigens while the CD3 chains initiate the T cells signaling cascade through the phosphorylation of their cytoplasmic tails. It is not yet understood how the TCR activating signal is transmitted through the membrane from the TCRαβ chains towards the cytoplasmic tails of the CD3 chains. In resting T cells, the CD3ε and CD3ζ chains are associated to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane (PM). The cytoplasmic tails of CD3ε and CD3ζ are rich in basic amino acids, which allow electrostatic association with acidic phospholipids at the PM. Phosphatidylserine (PS) is the most abundant acidic phospholipid and is exclusively distributed towards the cytoplasmic PM leaflet. During T cell activation, the CD3ε and CD3ζ cytoplasmic tails have to dissociate from PS for their phosphorylation. The membrane dissociation of a large number of CD3 chains is essential for the amplification of T cell activation. A mechanism of CD3ε and CD3ζ chain dissociation that has been proposed in the literature is through intracellular calcium elevation. A robust calcium influx is generated following T cell stimulation. In addition to its essential role in regulating T cell activation, it has been proposed that calcium ions neutralize the PM acidic phospholipids for CD3 chain dissociation. Calcium is also an essential cofactor for the activity of many enzymes, such as the phospholipid scramblase TMEM16F. TMEM16F redistributes PS at the PM following intracellular calcium mobilization, resulting in a reduction of inner leaflet PS. We propose that calcium regulates CD3 chain dissociation through TMEM16F activity. Our study demonstrates that calcium-dependent PS redistribution by TMEM16F is required for CD3ε membrane dissociation in the Jurkat T cell line. Reduction of TMEM16F expression by shRNA targeting (shTMEM16F) prevents massive CD3ε chain dissociation following 8 T cell stimulation. The shTMEM16F cells show a reduction in the phosphorylation of TCR-proximal signaling molecules. In contrast, expression of a constitutively active mutant of TMEM16F increases PS redistribution, CD3ε chain dissociation and phosphorylation of TCR-proximal signaling molecules. Our study demonstrates that PS redistribution by the calcium-dependent TMEM16F scramblase regulates CD3 chain dissociation for the amplification of T cell activation. In addition, we have confirmed T cell activation defects in shTMEM16F murine primary T cells during an immune response. In conclusion, our study demonstrates the role of PS regulation by TMEM16F in T cell activation. We showed that we could modify the level of T cell activation by modulating the concentration of PS at the inner leaflet of the PM. Our results thus have important implications for the development and improvement of immune receptor-based cancer immunotherapies.

111	TGF-beta superfamily and limb regeneration : TGF-beta to start and BMP to end	Axolotls represent a popular model to study how nature solved the problem of regenerating lost appendages in tetrapods. Our work over many years focused on trying to understand how these animals can achieve such a feat and not end up with a scarred up stump. The Tgf-β superfamily represents an interesting family to target since they are involved in wound healing in adults and pattern formation during development. This family is large and comprises Tgf-β, Bmps, activins and GDFs. In this review we present work from us and others on Tgf-β & Bmps and highlight interesting observations between these two sub-families. Tgf-β is important for the preparation phase of regeneration and Bmps for the redevelopment phase and they do not overlap with one another. We present novel data showing that the Tgf-β non-canonical pathway is also not active during redevelopment. Finally, we propose a molecular model to explain how Tgf-β and Bmps maintain distinct windows of expression during regeneration in axolotls.

112	Essays in empirical labor, housing and social network economics	"This thesis explores the following two topics : (i) determinants of labor force participation at older ages in the US ; (ii) the role of social network in the earnings of recent immigrants in Canada. Specifically, Chapter 1 provides estimates of the causal effect of local house prices on the labor supply decisions of older workers in the US during the 1994-2004 housing boom period using data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). Local house prices are instrumented by plausible exogenous spatial and time-varying credit supply shocks. The estimates suggest that the housing boom accounted for about two thirds of older men labor force exit during the studied period. Chapter 2 responds to the question : are people in good health more likely to stay in the labor market when unemployment rises? This work provides empirical estimates of the relative impact of local unemployment shocks on the labor force participation of US older workers with heterogeneous health conditions. This study documents that most of the labor force exit of older workers during the Great recession can be attributed to poor health conditions measured before the recession. Finally, Chapter 3 analyses the effect of living in a neighborhood where the majority of the residents belongs to visible minority groups on the earnings of permanent residents who landed in Montreal, Vancouver and Toronto in 2001. Overall, this research documents a negative effect of ethnic clustering on the earnings of recent immigrants in Canada and explain it by the ""referral effect""."	enclave ethnique , immigration , Retirement , Labor supply , House prices , Social security , Health , Ethnic enclave , Social network , Immigration	en	25269.0
113	La génétique au service de la conservation de la tortue des bois (Glyptemys insculpta)	Conservation biology is a rapidly expanding field of research due to the accelerating loss of global biodiversity. To better understand the processes and threats to the persistence of small populations and the effects of anthropogenic factors on biodiversity, genetic approaches are frequently used in conservation. Genetic analyzes can, for example, inform us about long-term trends, population diversity and reproductive strategies of a species. The wood turtle (Glyptemys insculpta) is a species endemic to North America that is endangered according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. As part of my thesis, my objective was to characterize the genetic diversity of this threatened species in Canada. In order  to better understand the impact of reproductive strategy and landscape structure on population diversity, I analyzed the genetics of wood turtle populations at several spatial and temporal scales. First, parentage relationships were reconstructed in a population of wood turtles to estimate the frequency of multiple and repeated paternity. The results of my work suggest that sperm storage in females and multiple reproduction with the same partners for more than one breeding season could explain these phenomena. These reproduction strategies could in this case be induced by the low density of the study population, or by fidelity to the overwintering site where the majority of copulation events take place. Subsequently, I assessed the genetic diversity of wood turtle populations. I wanted to understand the effects of the landscape configuration and geographic dispersion events on the diversity of populations. Using a landscape genetics approach, my analyzes show that the division of populations by watershed explains a large fraction of the genetic diversity between populations. These results also confirm that watersheds represent management units conducive to the protection of wood turtle populations. Finally, network analysis was used to better understand the gene flow dynamics among populations located on the north and south shores of the St. Lawrence River. More specifically, the north shore is characterized by a robust network of isolated populations, whereas the populations on the south shore present more of a metapopulation structure. Using population graphs, hypothetical scenarios were compared to explore the node selection process using the BRIDES algorithm. The results of these analyzes made it possible to point out specific populations of wood turtles, considering their importance for network connectivity. This could have not been predicted by using genetic diversity and distinctiveness estimates, node-based metrics, and node removal analysis for these populations. Thanks to genetics, this thesis brings new knowledge on the wood turtle, the reproductive strategies of both sexes, the gene flow, the connectivity  and the influence of the hydrographic network on population diversity. These results allow us to have a better understanding of the processes affecting the genetic diversity of this species in order to better protect it. All analyses performed for this thesis are directly applicable to other long-lived species with overlapping generations.	conservation , Glyptemys insculpta , BRIDES software , watersheds , connectivity , gene flow , long-lived species , landscape genetics , clustering analysis , parentage analysis , paternity , population prioritization , network analysis , population graph , freshwater turtles , wood turtles	en	25265.0
114	Étude de la tomodensitométrie spectrale quantitative et ses applications en radiothérapie	X-ray computed tomography (CT) is an imaging modality that produces a tridimensional map of the attenuation of X-rays by the scanned object. In radiation therapy, CT provides anatomical and quantitative information on the patient that is required for treatment planning. However, CT has some issues, notably (1) a limited accuracy in the estimation of quantitative physical parameters of the patient, and (2) a sensitivity to biases caused by beam hardening artifacts. Finally, (3) in the case where contrast-enhanced CT is performed to help treatment planning, a second scan with no contrast agent is required for dose calculation purposes, which increases the overall dose to the patient. Those 3 problems limit the efficiency of CT for some treatment modalities more sensitive to uncertainties, such as proton therapy.  Spectral CT regroups a set of methods that allows the production of multiple X-ray attenuation maps evaluated over various energy windows. The additional energy-weighted information that is obtained allows better material characterization. The potential of one spectral CT modality, dual-energy CT (DECT), is already well demonstrated for radiation therapy, while an upcoming method, spectral photon counting CT (SPCCT), promises more spectral information with the help of energy discriminating detectors. Unfortunately, SPCCT suffers from increased noise and poor conditioning. This thesis thus investigates the following question: is there a benefit to using more, but lower quality energy-resolved information for radiotherapy? The question is studied in the context of the three problems discussed earlier.  First, a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator is introduced for post-reconstruction tissue characterization for denoising purposes in spectral CT. The estimator is validated experimentally using a commercial DECT. The noise level on the proton stopping power is reduced, on average, by a factor of 3.2 with the MAP estimator. The estimator also generally con- serves the quantitative accuracy of estimated physical parameters. For instance, the stopping power varies on average by 0.9% with respect to the conventional approach. Then, the MAP estimation framework is adapted to the context of contrast-enhanced imaging. Numerical results show clear benefits when using SPCCT for virtual non-contrast imaging compared to DECT, with a reduction of the RMS error on the proton stopping power from 2.7 to 1.4%. Third, the developed tools are validated experimentally on a micro-SPCCT from MARS Bioimaging, which uses the Medipix 3 chip as a photon counting detector. Small benefits in the accuracy of physical parameters of tissue substitutes materials are obtained. Finally, a new parametrization of the attenuation coefficient for pre-reconstruction imaging is pro- posed, whose ultimate aim is to correct beam hardening artifacts. In a simulation study, the proposed parametrization eliminates all biases in the estimated physical parameters of human tissues, which is an improvement upon existing parametrizations. However, no ad- vantage has been obtained with SPCCT compared to DECT, which suggests the need to incorporate MAP estimation in the pre-reconstruction framework using an iterative reconstruction approach.

115	La vie économique dans le roman québécois (1956-1983) : représentations, histoire et pratiques	This thesis proposes an analysis, through the prism of the imaginaire social, of literay works that represent economic life, from the industrial boom that marked the post-war period to the 1980s. Combining cultural history and sociocriticism, we study the representations of economic life, their conditions of possibility, production and circulation. Our work focuses in particular on the ideological and political dimension of the working classes and of fictitious workers among marginal authors (Jean-Jules Richard, Pierre Gélinas, Germain Archambault, Maurice Gagnon and Élisabeth Vonarburg) and others who are better known (Claude Jasmin, Jacques Ferron, Jacques Renaud, Francine Noël). As the figure of the writer, the worker is a “complex normative focus” (Hamon, 1984). By crossing the analysis of different cultural productions with the reading of specific novels, the thesis questions the supposed disinterest of Québec literature for economic life.  We first attempt to rethink the categories and oppositions of literary history: realism, regionalism, “documentary” and the social novel. An analysis of the discourse of writers and critics in periodicals sheds light on the different definitions of the social role of literature and of the writer circulating in the 1950s discourse. The contrasting reception of social novels indicates the average literary quality of some of those literary works but a certain enthusiasm for social representations. Articulating history, politics and industrial work, the novels of Pierre Gélinas and Jean-Jules Richard offer a marginal point of view on the workers' strikes of the time informed by a communist sensibility. In their works, as in those published in the review and in Éditions Parti pris, the representations of women offer, by their complexity, a significant perspective on economic life. The exploration of marginality and mobility in the publishing house's publications creates the figure of the taxi driver, a modern-day coureur des bois. The last chapter focuses on the figure of the housewife and on the issue of housework. By studying Francine Noël's Maryse and Élisabeth Vonarburg's Le Silence de la Cité, we reassess the presupposition that realism is the preferred form of economic representation.

116	L'été au Parc Belmont ; suivi de, Cartographies du père	L’été au Parc Belmont is a collection of fragments that combines narrative prose, family archive photographs, handwriting and drawings. In this story, the narrator is investigating her father’s identity. The narrator gathers all the information she can ﬁnd and remains the sole enunciator of the story in her attempt to exhume the paternal past. The plot unfolds in an overwhelming, melancholy and non-linear temporality; between the father’s childhood along the Rivière des Prairies, his adolescence in Cartierville and his adulthood in a suburban town, the narrator’s investigation periodically bursts in. The use of family archives in the form of photographs and videos problematizes the relationship between text and image. Thus, photographs are used in various ways : photos which appear in the text without being directly referred to, photos which are given an elliptical or falsiﬁed ekphrasis, photos accompanied by diverted legends, etc. Cartographies du père oﬀers a reﬂection on the links between topography and biography in contemporary literary texts. In this essay, I am studying a corpus that is both Québécois and American, as well as narrative and graphic. The study focuses on three authors : Alison Bechdel (Fun Home : A Family Tragicomic, 2006), Hervé Bouchard (Harvey ou Comment je suis devenu invisible, 2009) and Catherine Mavrikakis (La ballade d’Ali Baba, 2014). Beyond the relationships between transmission and locales, the texts of my corpus are linked by the father’s death, an unsurpassable loss, an event that is yet to be investigated by the narrators. While this essay focuses on the way in which these texts thematize paternal absence –namely through the diﬃculties and shortcomings of the transmission resulting from this loss – it is also questioning the ways in which the authors represent various locales, play with the space of the page, mobilize mapping tools and describe routes. For these heirs, the reconstruction of a family event or history necessarily involves a reconstruction of the setting, whether it be the Pennsylvania countryside, the Bouillon family home or the road between Montreal and Key West. The analysis of the reconstruction of the locale informs the reader of the relationship that the heir maintains with the father ﬁgure. Cartographies du père also oﬀers a reﬂection on the act of remembering and talking about another person and on the inevitable ﬁctional shifts that this action provoke.

117	L'urbanisme et le mouvement : discours d'une discipline naissante de 1849 à 1916	This research started as the result of an observation: a recent appearance of the question of 'transportation' in the context of urban education and its rapid replacement by that of 'mobility'. This is a surprising observation, especially given the obvious links between the city and ‘transportation’ or ‘mobility’ issues: infrastructures, networks, circulation spaces, transport of people and goods, etc. Surprising to a greater degree when reading the founding authors of the discipline; their writings show that they all address these matters. Therefore, I wonder: where did ‘transportation’ go during the 20th century?  A preliminary assumption is that the period of 1920 was a pivotal moment in the creation of a technicist thought, especially in the face of the automotive threat. This period will lead to the birth of traffic engineering which is given the task to adapt the city to circulation necessities following theoretical propositions that conform with the epistemological imperatives. Does Urban Planning not have any? As a discipline that longs for a  science status since the second half of the 19th century, what does the emerging Urban Planning realm say about ‘transportation’ and where does it stand in this regard? This research tackles the previous question through the concept of ‘movement’, which is understood as technics, practices and representations to avoid the cultural and axiological baggage associated not only with ‘technic’, but also with the concepts of ‘transportation’ or ‘mobility’. Therefore, this work focuses on the textual discourses as being the place where norm and meaning are expressed, the point being to enter the epistemological realm that establishes the relationship between Urban Planning and ‘movement’. The purpose of this research was first, to theoretically position the question of ‘movement’ in the emerging Urban Planning discipline. Second, I suspected that the theoretical propositions of the first ‘urban planners’ where embedded in deep epistemological references about movement. Discourse analysis was used on seventeen ‘normative texts in Urban Planning’ written between 1849 and 1916. In addition, a historiographic study was conducted, through which five moments are revealed. These moments are associated with different meanings of movement between the 17th century and the 1930s. The result of this analysis leads to the fact that ‘movement’ clearly occupies a central place in the Urban Planning discourse between 1849 and 1916 : it prompts discussions about methods as well as the essence of this emergent science. The selected texts also appear like witnesses of the changing meaning of ‘movement’ through traces of former identified moments. To some extent, the analysis also concludes that Urban Planning does not convey a clear and epistemologically valid solution to the 20th century’s urban problems : early urban planners have proved to be very prudent and full of nuances in a positivist and technicist context. This constitutes a clue as to why the planning propositions could not compete with the traffic engineering solutions.	transport , circulation , urban planning , transportation , epistemology , urban planning history , history of movement	en	25225.0
118	Comparaison sonore de 4 films inspirés du même roman : “l'invasion des profanateurs” (1955)	This Thesis is a sound comparison between four movies inspired by the same novel : The Body Snatchers (1955) by Jack Finney. I talk about the audio technology that each movie used and how it has contributed in the evolution of the musical style, the foley, and the sound design. At first, I compare the 4 movies in a general way : the musical themes, the use of the foley to scare the audience, the Jump Scare, and the sound design. Then, I chose 4 common scenes that I analyze more in details. This thesis gives a partial view of the evolution of sound in science fiction movies.	science-fiction , sound design , Film music , Science fiction	en	25220.0
119	Étude du changement de l’architecture du sommeil chez la personne âgée après un sevrage aux benzodiazépines couplé à la thérapie cognitivo-comportementale pour insomnie	Background: Benzodiazepines (BZD) and related drugs are consumed chronically by a large part of the elderly population with chronic insomnia. However, this use in this population is criticized for the risk of associated side effects. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is the first-line treatment for insomnia because of its efficacy and safety.  Objective: The objective of this project is to assess changes in sleep quality, macroarchitecture and sleep microarchitecture after withdrawal from BZD in the elderly with chronic insomnia. Then, we study the effect of CBT-I coupled with withdrawal on the same variables of interest. We hypothesize that weaning will be accompanied by an improvement in the subjective sleep quality  (decrease in Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and increase in sleep efficiency (SE)) and a modification of certain distinct variables: sleep spindle and stage N3 (increase in the percentage at stage N3 and decrease in the density of sleep spindles). In addition, we hypothesize that these changes will be more pronounced with CBT-I coupled with weaning.    Methods: 41 participants (mean age: 69.39 ± 6.88 years) were randomized into 2 groups; stratified for age, duration and dose of BZD and relatives consumed: the weaning+CBT-I group (N = 23) and the weaning group (N = 18). All participants complete a 16-week weaning plan with follow-up, and at the same time, only the therapy group receives CBT-I. Data acquisition is carried out before and after weaning from questionnaire (ISI), sleep diary (SE) over a period of 14 days, and by polysomnographic recordings (stage N3 and density of sleep spindles).   Results: 60.98% of participants (weaning+CBT-I group: 60.87%; weaning group: 61.11%) succeeded in completely stopping their medication after withdrawal. A decrease in ISI (F(1.40) = 4.36, p = 0.04) and in sleep spindle density (F(1.36) = 7.18, p = 0.01) was observed after weaning. Finally, CBT-I coupled with weaning showed a greater increase in SE (Sleep Diary; F(1.35) = 6.75, p = 0.01) compared to the control group.  Conclusion: The weaning plan with follow-up makes it possible to obtain complete weaning in a majority of participants, without any significant worsening of their quality of sleep being observed. The addition of CBT-I during withdrawal from BZD and related products resulted in a greater improvement in self-reported sleep quality (Sleep Diary: SE).

120	Développement d’un instrument d’évaluation de l’environnement des personnes ayant un trouble du spectre de l’autisme	Introduction: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is prevalent in 1% of the world's population. Within individuals living with ASD, some environmental elements (e.g., noise, light, distribution) are just some disruptive factors; the manifestations may persist throughout life. Therefore, it is important to assess the environment in order to provide interventions for adults living with ASD, improving their quality of life. Purpose: To develop tool for assessing the environment of adults living with ASD. Methods: This study was developed in two steps: 1) Exploration of environmental factors that impact young people living with ASD with parents and 2) Consultation of potential users about the first version of the HoPE - ASD version.  Results: The HoPE-ASD version was developed on the basis of the Model of Competence, explaining the person-environment relationship, considering the human and non-human environmental components that have an impact on adults living with ASD (e.g., sensory elements, related to the safety and functionality of spaces, stability, visitors or trusted persons). During the consultation of potential users (occupational therapists), some modifications related to the content, mode of administration, format and applicability of the instrument were suggested. Conclusion: The HoPE-ASD version could fill a gap in the clinical and scientific practice of occupational therapists working with adults living with ASD. Thus, environmental interventions adapted to this population will be promoted.

121	Clarification of the role of the TBC1D24 gene in human genetic conditions	Pathogenic variants in the TBC1D24 gene are associated with genetic disorders, the majority of which are transmitted in an autosomal recessive manner. The phenotypes are variable in terms of clinical presentation and severity. The most severe forms cause epileptic encephalopathy (EIEE16) or DOORS syndrome which is marked by deafness, abnormalities of the nails and fingers, intellectual deficit and convulsions which are often difficult to control. Other forms of epilepsy include EPRPDC (Rolandic epilepsy with paroxysmal exercise-induce dystonia and writer's cramp), FIME (familial infantile myoclonic epilepsy), and PME (progressive myoclonus epilepsy). A specific missense variant is associated with autosomal dominant deafness (DFNA65) which develops in adulthood. A review of the literature of the published phenotypes observed in individuals with pathogenic variants in the TBC1D24 gene is presented here with recommendations for the clinical management of these patients. In addition, a group of eight patients with intellectual disability and epilepsy who share a microdeletion on chromosome 1613.3 containing the TBC1D24 gene were characterized in order to define a new genetic syndrome. The critical region contains TBC1D24, ATP6V0C and PDPK1. The significantly similar phenotype shared by the eight individuals suggests that haploinsufficiency for TBC1D24, ATP6V0C and PDPK1 causes a new genetic syndrome. Knowledge of the genes essential for the phenotype in this cohort helps in the identification of new candidate genes for intellectual disability and epilepsy.

122	Association entre la stéatose hépatique non alcoolique et les hyperchylomicronémies familiale et multifactorielle	Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a disorder caused by hepatic triglyceride accumulation. It ranges from hepatic steatosis to steatohepatitis with fibrosis. Obesity and other elements of the metabolic syndrome, such as hypertriglyceridemia and type 2 diabetes, are risk factors for NAFLD, which affects between 20% and 29% of Canadians. These statistics are alarming, especially knowing that there is still no treatment for this condition and considering the increasing prevalence of obesity. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) hydrolyzes triglycerides contained in very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) and chylomicrons. LPL is often down-regulated in the metabolic syndrome and some patients may present triglycerides level higher than 10 mmol/L, as multifactorial chylomicronemia syndrome (MCS). Chylomicronemia also characterizes total LPL deficiency, known as familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS). FCS and MCS are two dyslipidemias associated with severe hypertriglyceridemia, which is associated with increased risk of recurrent acute pancreatitis. Whereas FCS is monogenic, MCS is polygenic and directly related to the metabolic syndrome with a significant influence of the environment. Results of the present study compare the expression of NAFLD in FCS and MCS patients. NAFLD was assessed using transient elastography performed in 18 FCS and 18 MCS patients matched for age and sex. Controled attenuation parameter (CAP) score ≥ 280 dB/m, suggesting NAFLD expression, were observed in 50% of FCS and 83.3% of MCS. The difference between degrees of hepatic steatosis in both groups is significant with a p-value of 0.036. In addition, only 22.2% of FCS with NAFLD are obese compared to 71.4% for MCS (p = 0.001). It is also interesting to note that FCS patients have NAFLD even in the presence of a very low body mass index (BMI<18 kg / m2). Besides, CAP score in FCS was negatively correlated with the number of acute pancreatitis (p=0.004). Our study shows that NAFLD was frequently observed in FCS and MCS but occurred independently of BMI and could be associated with a lower occurrence of acute pancreatitis.

123	Perceptions de communautés québécoises à l’égard des ressources comestibles du fleuve Saint-Laurent	Context: The Saint-Lawrence hosts a great variety of edible resources, but they are largely unknown. Quebeckers currently consume mostly imported seafood products whereas the few marine species that are commercially fished in Quebec are mainly exported. However, it is reasonable to assume that habitants along the Saint-Lawrence River have a closer relationship with edible marine resources and a vision for promoting them which deserves to be heard. Manger notre Saint-Laurent (Sustenance from our Saint-Lawrence) is a research-action multidisciplinary project aiming the promotion of edible local marine resources in the Saint-Lawrence. Objectives: (1) Critical analysis of the participatory process used in four communities in Quebec for Manger notre Saint-Laurent, and (2) Analysis of results generated. Methods: Four partner communities have been identified as actors in this project: Cap-Chat, Sainte-Thérèse-de-Gaspé, the Magdalen Islands and the Wolastoqiyik Wahsipekuk (Maliseet Viger) First Nation. A group of 10 to 14 participants from various backgrounds was recruited from each community. The Nominal group technique was used and transcripts were qualitatively analyzed.  Results: All communities combined, winning strategies to increase supply were increasing local distribution networks and facilitating sustenance fishing. Winning strategies to increase demand were discovering the products through tasting and cooking, protecting cultural history of fishing, and marketing and educating about the products. Emergent species (sea urchins, algae, seals) particularly interested participants. The most popular target groups were youth and the community as a whole. Qualitative analysis revealed the important cultural ties to fishing in all communities. Also, critical analysis of the method revealed aspects like the importance of correctly recruiting participants, of having an experienced facilitator, and the usefulness of qualitative analysis. Conclusion: Our sample of Saint-Lawrence coastal communities created consensus around many resources that should receive more availability and more promotion, and around target groups that should include everyone in a community while targeting youth. This study is a first step in a research project that will lead to Quebeckers getting Sustenance from our Saint-Lawrence.	fish , seafood , qualitative research , participatory , stakeholder , community , Saint-Lawrence , Magdalen Islands , Maliseet Viger	en	25179.0
124	Validation of synthetic lethal hits of microtubule targeting agents	Microtubules, key components of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton, are highly dynamic polymers of tubulin implicated in a wide variety of cellular processes. Their essential roles in the cell cycle have made them a valid target in cancer therapy. Despite the clinical efficacy of microtubule targeting agents (MTA), their use is hampered by side effects. We sought to identify genetic vulnerabilities that can be exploited to decrease the required dose while maintaining efficacy, and therefore reduce side effects. In collaboration with the Tyers laboratory at IRIC, we carried out a genetic screen based on synthetic lethality with antiproliferative agents, including MTAs. We have selected genes whose knockout sensitized cells to MTAs. I have confirmed that the knockout of GNA13, SEPHS1, DLGAP5, and QRICH1, DLGAP5, sensitize NALM6 cells to docetaxel and vincristine respectively. However, no knockout of these genes increased the sensitivity to docetaxel in U2OS cells. In addition to its effect with docetaxel, GNA13 stood out as being a particularly exciting target. GNA13 knockout increased the frequency and severity of chromosome segregation errors in U2OS cells. This increase was not corrected following treatment with UMK57, a molecule known to reduce the rate of chromosome segregation errors. Interestingly, the GNA13 knockout also increased the frequency of chromosome segregation errors in non-cancerous and chromosomally stable RPE1 cells. This suggests that GNA13 does not require transformation nor chromosomal instability as prerequisites for exacerbating chromosomal instability. Overall, these results open up a new avenue of anticancer therapeutic strategies, namely, the treatment of cancers presenting mutations in QRICH1, DLGAP5, GNA13, and SEPHS1 with lower doses of MTAs. In particular, GNA13 is frequently mutated in certain lymphomas. In addition, the results obtained demonstrate that GNA13 knockout exacerbates chromosomal instability and, therefore, could be involved in carcinogenesis.

125	Le rôle médiateur du biais d’attribution d’intention hostile dans la relation entre l’agressivité et la personnalité antisociale : une étude des potentiels reliés aux évènements	Every day, around the world, aggressive behaviors are committed against individuals, causing physical, psychological and financial harm. In response to provocation, these assaults are said to be reactive and can be fuelled by cognitive biases of attributing hostile intent and antisocial personality styles. Filling a gap in the scientific literature, the purpose of this study is to evaluate hostile intent bias and its role in the relationship between antisocial personality and reactive aggression. To this end, participants were asked to complete questionnaires assessing personality, cognitive processes and aggression. Then, while recording their brain activity, they were asked to read scenarios of social interactions and to attribute intent to behaviors described as ambiguous and provocative. We analyzed the N400, an event-related potential component associated with the presentation of unexpected hostile or non-hostile intentions after each scenario. Pearson correlation and multiple linear regression analyses were performed to examine the validity of our mediation model. The results show that the N400 is stronger in the presentation of unexpected non-hostile intent than in the presentation of unexpected hostile intent in the centro-parietal regions. Antisocial personality and violation of hostile expectations were positively related to reactive aggression. Antisocial personality predicted reactive aggression even with the addition of hostile expectation violation (Z = .30, p = .76) or non-hostile expectation violation (Z = -.32, p = .75) as a mediator. In sum, the mediating role of intention attribution bias is unconfirmed and further studies are needed to better understand the link between antisocial personality and reactive aggression.

126	Évaluation de la mise en œuvre du programme d’activités parascolaires musicales La classe enchantée	Extracurricular activities are increasingly recognized as a context that promotes youth positive development, especially for those living in disadvantaged areas. However, the effectiveness of these interventions varies from one program to another, based on their implementation context, and according to youth characteristics and commitment. This study is part of the evaluation of the La classe enchantée (EC), an extracurricular music program offered since 2017 to 4th graders attending a multi-ethnic Montreal school located in a disadvantaged area. The EC specifically aims to positively influence youth development through collective music learning as well as through a democratic access to the program. In order to better understand the functioning and optimal conditions for implementing this innovative initiative, the present study aimed as a general objective to evaluate the implementation of the program. More specifically, our objectives were to describe the program and identify the obstacles and facilitators related to its implementation, as to identify the essential implementation components promoting youth engagement and positive development. Data were collected over two years among four groups of actors, namely the participants, their parents, the music teachers, and the program management team. Data were mainly collected from interviews. We relied on the psychoeducational model to draw a detailed portrait of the implementation of EC using descriptive and thematic analysis. Among the main factors associated with the program implementation, funding instability has emerged as a constant barrier for the management team. Our results also highlight the importance of the teachers and the relationship they create with their students, but also their experience with the clientele, which was decisive for the creation of an efficient learning climate. Finally, the management team skills as well as the addition of internal coordination stand out as being particularly important to allow program promoter to effectively adjust to obstacles and better meet student needs. The study also highlights important insight regarding the relevance of the psychoeducation model as an implementation tool as well as broader recommendations on the implementation of extracurricular activity programs.	extracurricular activity program , positive youth development , implementation assessment , psychoeducation , music	en	25136.0
127	Oscillations torsionnelles magnétohydrodynamiques auto-excitées dans les Jupiters chaudes	Hot Jupiters are exoplanets with unique features. Due to their proximity to their host stars, they show remarkable non-symmetry. This proximity with the star causes tidal locking, meaning one side of the planet is always exposed to intense radiation from its host and the other side is immersed in a perpetual night. This geometry means there is a difference of temperature ranging from 200 K up to 2000 K between the day and night side. This gradient in temperature induces zonal winds that can reach the order of 1 km/s to redistribute heat to the night side. The hot spot is the hottest spot of the planet and is a telltale of these strong winds. Observations and hydrodynamic numerical simulations show that zonal winds on these planets go eastward. However, two recent observations are showing westward winds. These planets are CoRoT-2 b and HAT-P-7 b. The most common explanation to this contradiction is that the magnetic field, which is interacting with the partially ionized atmosphere, can reverse these winds. It was previously shown that a magnetic diffusivity varying in space can locally generate magnetic fields when its gradient aligns correctly with the electric current density. We present here a one-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic model with a temperature-dependent magnetic diffusivity in the equatorial plane in the context of hot Jupiters. The simulations develop growing torsional alfvénic oscillations due to the non-linear coupling of the magnetohydrodynamics and the temperature partial differential equations and the temperature-dependent magnetic diffusivity. We explore the parameter space and study their influence on the oscillations. We have also developed a local model in order to derive analytical equations characterizing these waves and compare its results with the results of the one-dimensional model. We end by calculating the corresponding periods and longitudinal displacement of the one-dimension model oscillations for a Jupiter-sized planet. The periods correspond to an interval from 225 to 473 days and the displacements range from a few degrees up to 40°. This means that the oscillations could be observed with a few orbits.

128	De la théorie des jeux à l’exobiologie : l’émergence de la coopération comme phénomène critique	The emergence of complexity, and of life more speciﬁcally, is still one of the most intractable conundrums for modern science. Recent work emphasized the relevance of statistical physics and critical phenomena theory’s contribution to those questions — especially of self-organized criticality theory — just as much as the role of biochemical cooperation in life’s ﬁrst moments. Moreover, the description of the mechanisms by which life could have appeared is of particular interest for astrophysics, because our comprehension of those mechanisms inﬂuences how biosignatures are analyzed in the context of the search for life elsewhere in the Universe. The analysis presented here concerns a model in game theory that allows to study cooperation phenomena — implemented in spatial context as to emulate the dynamics of a system in which life could have appeared. An analysis of the model’s parameter space reveals that it displays phase transition and self-organization of spatial structures phenomenon, those elements being adjuvants to the emergence of cooperation between a priori egoist players, in a context that is initially not favorable to the emergence of cooperative behavior. The results obtained here thus seem to support the idea that both biochemical cooperation can emerge through phase transition phenomena, and that the underlying lattice iterated prisoner’s dilemma model used here behaves like a self-organized critical system.	complexity , origin of life , self-organized criticality , statistical physics , critical phenomenon , cooperation , prisoner’s dilemma , phase transition	en	25125.0
129	L’application des mathématiques aux phénomènes naturels chez Leibniz	This thesis explores Leibniz’s solution to the problem of how mathematics are useful to our understanding of the world, i.e., to our understanding of corporeal phenomena and their relations. In the first chapter, it focuses on how abstract mathematical notions enter in our most immediate understanding of the world. Here, the aim is connecting the pervasiveness of mathematics to the peculiar way by which the individuality of phenomena manifests itself to us. After some metaphysical remarks on Leibniz’s conception of individuation, we study spatial position in the light of the new leibnizian geometrical analysis : Analysis Situs. Spatial position provides us with a way to further distinguish between individual phenomena whose qualities relevant to their real individuation remain ignored. In the sole light of spatial individuation, phenomena are ideal and indeterminate. This situation renders them susceptible to mathematical treatment without further elaboration. In the second chapter, we turn our attention to the question of why mathematical methods in philosophy of nature are epistemologically superior in Leibniz’s eyes. We explore Leibniz’s reason to espouse a mechanical philosophy which comprise indispensable mathematical notions. Leibniz believes that mechanical philosophy is the most intelligible explanation of nature and we mean to assess how mathematics enter this picture. We try to show that the mathematical aspects of mechanical philosophy make it more intelligible by virtue of mathematics’ peculiar mode of reasoning. This mode of reasoning is valid as well as most suited for our finite minds. It provides necessary arguments through incomplete notions. It also encourages the discovery by assisting the imagination with controlled and sensible support that makes knowledge more evident.

130	Prime number races	Under the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis and the Linear Independence Hypothesis, Rubinstein and Sarnak proved that the values of x which have more prime numbers less than or equal to x of the form 4n + 3 than primes of the form 4n + 1 have a logarithmic density of approximately 99.59%. In general, the study of the difference #{p < x : p in A} − #{p < x : p in B} for two subsets of the primes A and B is called the prime number race between A and B. In this thesis, we will analyze the prime number race between the primes p such that 2p + 1 is also prime (these primes are called the Sophie Germain primes) and the primes p such that 2p − 1 is also prime. To understand this, we first present Rubinstein and Sarnak’s analysis to understand where the bias between primes that are 1 (mod 4) and the ones that are 3 (mod 4) comes from and give a conjecture on the distribution of Sophie Germain primes.

131	La corporéité des rapports de pouvoir dans un exercice de co-création médiatique : voir autrement	Among our current hetero-normed society (Butler 1990), visual representations are always tainted with prescribed and gendered cultural codes that are impossible to get rid of. These images actualize and convey power relations (Foucault 1973) that we unconsciously incorporate through our personal identifications and artistic practices.   This master's degree in film studies aims, on the one hand, to contribute to the development of a critical and situated (Haraway 1988) research-creation methodology (Boutet 2018) as an academic research exercise by questioning power relations, and, on the other hand, to offer an alternative to nude photography through the conception of an ephemeral light and sound installation.  My research question includes a political approach and a research methodology. On the one hand, how does a collaborative autoethnographic research-creation (Chang, Hernandez and Ngunjiri 2012) allows us to rethink the power relations within an artistic practice in order to create images of a female body without reproducing some heteronormative reflexes? On the other hand, how does a critical and self-reflexive feminist queer approach can develop strategies of resistance and consequently avoid the gendered cultural codifications of its context?   I argue that by dematerializing the body though a light and sound ephemeral installation practice, based on a collaborative methodology, it would be possible to offer resistance to the heteronormative reflexes currently involved in the visual representation of a female body. This artistic form that intentionally stands out from a traditional visual storytelling would thus become a way of resisting the Male Gaze (Mulvey 1993).   My project is a methodological inquiry that investigates the intuitive and qualitative approach of collaborative autoethnography as an inclusive method that allows us to question the ethics of representation. Within the framework of a research-creation methodology, the creative process is regarded as an academic research and allows me to include my other parallel artistic practices into a protean master’s thesis.

132	La Promenade Masson : une étude de l'évolution du paysage alimentaire	The increase in the cost of housing is a phenomenon observed in several Canadian cities and Montreal is no exception. Even within the Quebec metropolis, this growth is taking place in certain boroughs such as Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie. Indeed, the increase in the cost of housing is significant and leads researchers to speak of residential gentrification. This study deepens the reflection of this process of socio-economic transformation of the district by integrating the commercial aspect of gentrification. Indeed, for several years now, the commercial development of Promenade Masson has been oriented towards offering better quality, more refined and more upscale products. Through various initiatives, merchants are even going so far as to offer a shopping experience to the consumer to create an emotional link between the consumer and the business. This is what leads us to consider the food landscape as a dynamic and complex space that is in keeping with David Harvey's tripartite conception of space. Thus, we approach the food landscape by considering its absolute, relative and relational dimensions. Following this contextualization, we question the link between commercial gentrification and the evolution of the food landscape. This research project also identifies 1) the social, demographic and economic evolution of the neighbourhood between 1996 and 2016; 2) the evolution of the food stores on Promenade Masson since the 2000s and 3) the mobilization of the food landscape by consumers.

133	Caractérisation de l’impact des interactions chimiques sur la variabilité interindividuelle de la toxicocinétique des composés organiques volatiles, et portée sur une approche appliquée de dosimétrie inverse	"Human biomonitoring consists in the measurements of chemicals or their metabolites in biological matrices. These biological data are often interpreted by comparison with so-called bio-equivalent values to the toxicological reference values (TRV) which have for the most part been defined through the use of animal models in a context of simple chemical exposure. However, biomonitoring data can result from multi-routes co-exposures to multiple chemical such as Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), which can give rise to toxicokinetic interactions in the human body. Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling approaches have been developed to study these interactions. But, their impact on the interindividual variability (IV) of the toxicokinetics of individual substances, and the evaluation of the toxic risk of chemical contaminants, that may result from multi-routes exposure, have only been sparsely studied. Further, the scientific literature suggests an approach for the direct reconstruction of external chemical exposure from blood measurements of VOCs’ parent compounds. This is generally done for 70-kg adults by the use of appropriate PBPK models, combined with a probability calculation approach, in a process called “reverse dosimetry”. But the uncertainties associated with estimates of external exposure made using this approach from biological spot measurements collected during health surveys have hardly been studied. The current doctoral research aims to characterize the impact of multi-routes chemical co-exposures on the interindividual variability of toxicokinetics, in order to account it for in the development in this thesis of applied approaches of reverse dosimetry. First, we built multi-routes probabilistic PBPK models for two mixtures (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and m-xylene (BTEX) on one hand, and trichloroethylene and vinyl chloride (TCE-VC) on the other hand) for human subpopulations of different ages (including one of adults). These models were coupled with Monte Carlo simulations in order to explore the impact of multi-routes co-exposures on the IV of the toxicokinetics of individual compounds at ‘low’ or ‘high’ exposures. Variability indices (VIs) were calculated as the ratio of the 95th percentile value of the distribution of an internal dose in the other subpopulations studied to the 50th percentile value of the same distribution in adults. In a second step, we refined the existing reverse dosimetry approach by developing probabilistic inhalation PBPK models for Canadian subpopulations (of different age, body weight and size) whose blood toluene measurements were collected during the third cycle of Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS-3), in order to reconstruct their corresponding external exposure. Finally, we have developed an individual reverse dosimetry approach to estimate external exposure to toluene from urinary measurements of one of its metabolites (S-benzylmercapturic acid or BMA) reported in Canadian individuals. Two techniques were tested here for this estimation: estimating toluene exposure from spot measurements of urinary BMA of a full day obtained in each individual and estimating exposure from an individual measurement of urinary BMA performed on 24-h urines. The individual approach allowed us to propose a method to quantify the uncertainty, that means the possible error, on the estimates of external exposure made by reverse dosimetry from spot measurements from health surveys. This doctoral study revealed that the impact of multi-routes co-exposures on IV of toxicokinetics may depend on the compounds in the mixtures and the level of exposure to these substances. For example, the variation obtained on the amount of substance metabolized by CYP2E1-based VIs based is about -9 to -5% and -38 to -33% for benzene respectively for 'low' and 'high' exposures simulated to the mixture. For VC and TCE, it is respectively about -17 to -13% and -20 to -11% for ""high"" exposures, and zero for ""low"" exposures to the mixture. The exposures to toluene in air estimated by reverse dosimetry in this thesis (median between 0.004 and 0.01 ppm) are well below the maximum guideline values recommended by Health Canada for chronic exposure and suggest an exposure of Canadian studied via indoor air. The uncertainty mentioned above varies between 15 and 23% in the context of our work. The present doctoral study has contributed to improving the assessment of the toxicological risk of VOCs."

134	Law enforcement and disruption of offline and online activities : a review of comptemporary challenges	The digital world represents a new frontier for law enforcement operations. The virtual nature of online communications creates challenges regarding legal frameworks and sovereignty that are exacerbated by the inherent context of the digital world, the current state of policing expertise and resources and the detection and reporting rates of cybercrimes. This book chapter presents an informed review of the current state of ‘what works’ in policing both offline and online, providing at each step the context needed to understand how new technologies impact police operations. Our conclusion suggests that new models of policing are indeed needed to effectively police the digital world and that cooperation through nodal governance could improve the ability of police agencies to regulate cyberoffenders.

135	Highly active, entirely biobased antimicrobial Pickering emulsions	We present the development of surfactant‐free, silica‐free and fully biobased oil‐in‐water antimicrobial Pickering emulsions, based on the self‐assembly of b ‐cyclodextrin and phytoantimicrobial oils (terpinen‐4‐ol or carvacrol). Undecylenic acid (UA), derived from castor oil, can be used as bio‐based drug to treat fungal infection, but is less effective than petroleum‐based drugs as azole derivatives. To maximize its antifungal potential, we have incorporated UA in fully biobased Pickering emulsions. These emulsions are effective against fungi, Gram‐positive and Gram‐negative bacteria. The carvacrol emulsion charged with UA is +390 % and +165 % more potent against methicillin‐resistant S. aureus (MRSA), compared to UA and azole‐based commercial formulations. Moreover, this emulsion is up to +480 % more efficient that UA ointment against C. albicans . Finally, remarkable eradication of E. coli and MRSA biofilms was obtained with this environmental‐friendly emulsion.	Biobased formulation , Pickering emulsion , Antimicrobial , Antibiofilm	en	24938.0
136	Health science communication strategies used by researchers with the public in the digital and social media ecosystem : a systematic scoping review protocol	Introduction The optimisation of health science communication (HSC) between researchers and the public is crucial. In the last decade, the rise of the digital and social media ecosystem allowed for the disintermediation of HSC. Disintermediation refers to the public’s direct access to information from researchers about health science-related topics through the digital and social media ecosystem, a process that would otherwise require a human mediator, such as a journalist. Therefore, the primary aim of this scoping review is to describe the nature and the extent of the literature regarding HSC strategies involving disintermediation used by researchers with the public in the digital and social media ecosystem. The secondary aim is to describe the HSC strategies used by researchers, and the communication channels associated with these strategies. Methods and analysis We will conduct a scoping review based on the Joanna Briggs Institute’s methodology and perform a systematic search of six bibliographical databases (CINAHL, EMBASE, IBSS, PubMed, Sociological Abstracts and Web of Science), four trial registries and relevant sources of grey literature. Relevant journals and reference lists of included records will be hand-searched. Data will be managed using the EndNote software and the Rayyan web application. Two review team members will perform independently the screening process as well as the full-text assessment of included records. Descriptive data will be synthesised in a tabular format. Data regarding the nature and the extent of the literature, the HSC strategies and the associated communication channels will be presented narratively. Ethics and dissemination This review does not require institutional review board approval as we will use only collected and published data. Results will allow the mapping of the literature about HSC between researchers and the public in the digital and social media ecosystem, and will be published in a peer-reviewed journal.		en	24935.0

138	Association between recurrent dreams, disturbing dreams and suicidal ideation in adolescents	Disturbing dreams and recurrent dreams have both been linked to a wide range of psychological difficulties in children. There is growing evidence that the experience of frequent disturbing dreams is associated with suicidal ideation in adults but studies in young adolescents have been limited and the results inconsistent. In addition, the possible relationship between suicidal ideation and recurrent dreams has yet to be studied. We thus investigated the relation between disturbing dreams, recurrent dreams and suicidal ideation in a sample of young adolescents. Self-report measures of disturbing dream frequency, recurrent dream frequency, and suicidal ideation were collected at age 12 years and again at age 13 years from 170 children from a prospective population-based birth cohort. While the rate of disturbing dreams and recurrent dreams dropped between ages 12 and 13, the rate of self-reported suicidal ideation increased between the ages of 12 and 13 years. Analyses taking sex and age into account revealed that young adolescents who reported having had suicidal thoughts over the past year had significantly greater frequencies of disturbing dreams and of recurrent dreams than adolescents who had not thought about suicide. These findings highlight the potential clinical value of assessing disturbing and recurrent dreams as part of the screening process for suicidal ideation in young adolescents.

139	Effects of experimental thermocline and oxycline deepening on methylmercury bioaccumulation in a Canadian Shield lake	Environmental disturbances like deforestation or climate change may influence lake thermal and oxic stratification, thereby modifying cycles of contaminants such as mercury (Hg). In a lake naturally separated into three basins, the thermocline and oxycline of an experimental basin were deepened by 4 and 3 m, respectively, to study the effect on the methylmercury (MeHg) accumulation. This treatment decreased hypolimnetic MeHg concentration by approximately 90%, zooplankton concentrations by 30 to 50%, and in some fish by 45%. A multiple linear regression indicated that oxycline depth significantly influenced hypolimnetic MeHg concentrations, with no significant effect of thermocline depth, anoxic water volume, interface area of oxic-anoxic water, and sediment area in contact with anoxic water. Fish MeHg decline varied, with a greater response by low oxygen-tolerant bullhead. Increased pelagic primary and secondary production likely caused zooplankton and fish MeHg decreases via algal and growth dilution. Environmental changes leading to oxycline deepening are therefore predicted to cause a decrease in MeHg bioaccumulation in similar Canadian Shield lakes. If associated ecosystem impacts related to the deepening treatment are deemed acceptable, then this experiment provides a potential remediation method for small lakes confronted with MeHg accumulation.		en	24914.0
140	La place du bonheur dans la doctrine de la vertu	The reader of the Critique of Practical Reason is often puzzled by Kant’s claim in the Analytic that happiness must not play any role in the motivation to act according to the moral law, whereas the Dialectic unexpectedly reintroduces the topic of happiness as a reasonable expectation from the part of the virtuous moral subject. In fact, both Fichte and Schopenhauer had reservations about this move. In this paper I argue that the three explanations usually provided in order to make sense of the hope for happiness are questionable: 1) the ontological dualism (intelligible/sensible), 2) Kant’s religious prejudice (F. Schroeter), and 3) a concession made by Kant to the weakness of human nature (L. W. Beck). I give another explanation, based on Kant’s conception of practical reason.

au Québec : une étude de cas"	‪This article presents the study of a specific case within the phenomenon of home education: that of Jewish orthodox religious communities in Quebec (Canada), the Haredim, who recently opted for this form of education as part of an agreement with the Attorney General of Quebec. This case study fits into the field of education governance and its analysis is conducted from an applied ethics perspective. It aims to assess the strengths and weaknesses of this decision against ethical evaluation criteria derived from a reference framework relevant to the problem. On the basis of this analysis, it appears that this educational practice could meet the objective of ensuring that children have access to a more acceptable basic education, while protecting their right to an education that is adapted to their culture and community.‪	Family education , Education policy , Judaism , Governance , Home education , Right to education	en	24896.0
142	L'absolu et le relatif : le statut des concepts modaux dans le discours transcendantal	This paper deals with the three modal categories : possibility, necessity and contingency, as they are used not so much at the level of experience as at the level of the transcendental discourse that describes the conditions of the “possibility” of this experience. We notice for instance that the principles of the Analytic of the CPR are without doubt conditions sine qua non for experience, that is: “necessary,” but also that the implementation of those among the principles that are called dynamic is “contingent.” What does that mean? One can also examine the recourse by Kant to the adjective “supreme” (oberst, B 136) to characterize the two ultimate principles of human knowledge: 1- the subjection of all the manifold of intuition to the formal conditions of space and time and 2- the subjection of this manifold to the transcendental apperception. Can the word supreme here have another meaning than “absolute”?	Kant , Modal categories , Transcendental discourse , Supreme principle	en	24879.0
143	Entre nature et liberté : le rôle des Lumières kantiennes	The transition from §83 to §84 of the Critique of Judgment is without doubt a turning point in the architectonic of this work, whose goal is among others to bridge the gap between nature and freedom. If the final aim (letzter Zweck) assigned by nature to humanity as an empirical species is the development of culture (§83), we must admit that the latter enables one to attain any kind of ends, but without regard for the ultimate aim (Endzweck) that has to be reached by humanity seen from the noumenal point of view: morality (§84). In this paper, I interpret Kantian Enlightenment as a mediation between nature and freedom, or more precisely between culture and morality. Aufklärung must then be understood as a critique of culture based on a theoretical autonomy that is fully assumed by the individual, an autonomy however that must be distinguished from the autonomy of the will.

144	The multifaceted proprotein convertases PC7 and furin : identification of new substrates and physiological relevance	The proprotein convertases (PCs) are responsible for the maturation of precursor proteins and are involved in multiple biological processes. Over the past 30 years, the PCs have had great translational achievements, but the physiological roles of PC7, the seventh member of the family, are still obscure. Searching for new PC7 substrates, a quantitative proteomics screen for selective enrichment of N-glycosylated polypeptides secreted from hepatic HuH7 cells identified two type-II transmembrane-proteins of unknown function(s): Cancer Susceptibility Candidate 4 (CASC4) and Golgi Phosphoprotein of 130 kDa (GPP130/GOLIM4). The chapters II and III of this thesis will focus on the investigation of CASC4 and GPP130 shedding by PC7 and Furin, and their corresponding physiological functions. In chapter IV we pursued the PC7 KO mice behavior phenotyping. Concentrating on CASC4 in chapter II, its mutagenesis characterized the PC7/Furin-shedding site to occur at KR66↓NS, in HEK293 cells. We further defined PC7 and Furin activity and demonstrated that CASC4 shedding occurs in acidic endosomes and/or trans-Golgi Network. Since CASC4 has been reported in breast cancer studies, we generated MDA-MB-231 cells stably expressing CASC4 WT and we showed a significant reduction of migration and invasion, caused by an increased number of paxillin-positive focal adhesions. This phenotype was reversed in cells overexpressing an optimally PC7/Furin-cleaved CASC4 mutant, or upon overexpression of CASC4 N-terminal domain. In accord, breast cancer patients’ datasets show that high CASC4 and PCSK7 expression levels predict a significantly worse prognosis compared to high CASC4 but low PCSK7 levels. In chapter III, we demonstrated that GPP130 is also cleaved by PC7 and Furin at similar and distinct motifs (H67RSRLEK73↓SL and K274PTR277↓EV) within acidic endosomes or at the TGN. GPP130 is predicted to be trafficking cargos and is responsible for the binding and retrograde trafficking of the Shiga toxin. In addition, GPP130 was recently reported to be implicated in cell proliferation in head and neck cancer cells. Our analysis from cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics has shown that the GPP130/GOLIM4 gene is amplified in up to 35% of the patients with lung cancer. During this chapter we also showed that GPP130 knockdown in A549 cells slightly increases cell proliferation. We are currently investigating that GPP130 transports important cargos that would influence cell proliferation. Finally, during the chapter IV of this thesis we have pursued the characterization of the PC7 KO mice anxiolytic phenotype that was previously described, and we investigated a possible protection from diet-induced obesity anxiety-like behavior. Interestingly, we have shown that the PC7 KO mice have a tendency to be less affected by the saturated high-fat anxiogenic diet. Also, we showed that the PC7 KO mice have an impaired stress-coping response that will need further investigations. In conclusion, we identified new PC7 substrates to better understand its biology but we also investigated more deeply known substrates, such as BDNF in the PC7 KO mice to fully grasp the physiological functions of this enigmatic proprotein convertase.

145	Dynamique spatio-temporelle des forêts dans l’écotone boréal-tempéré en réponse aux changements globaux	The main objective of my thesis was to understand and quantify the combined effect of recent climate change and disturbances on forest community dynamics in the boreal-temperate ecotone over the past decades. To do so, I analysed the evolution of forest composition, transition dynamics and recruitment dynamics in Quebec from 1970 to 2018. In the first chapter, I showed that natural and anthropogenic disturbances were the main drivers of forest compositional change, i.e. temporal β diversity. Despite the prevalence of disturbances, analysis of community ecological traits revealed a thermophilization of forests across Québec, i.e. an increase of warm-adapted species at the expense of cold-adapted species. This thermophilization was further amplified by moderate disturbances, leading to a new question: if disturbances can favour such a community reorganization, could they catalyse a permanent shift to alternative states? The second chapter provided answers to this question with an analysis of forest transition dynamics in Québec based on a four-state model, i.e. boreal, mixed, temperate and pioneer. Transition dynamics was primarily influenced by disturbances and secondarily by climate and edaphic conditions. Major disturbances mainly triggered transitions to the pioneer state, while moderate disturbances promoted transitions from mixed to temperate states. In the long run, moderate disturbances may catalyse a faster northward shift of the temperateboreal ecotone under climate change. However, contrary to my expectations, temperate species recruitment played a negligible role in this dynamic compared to mortality and growth processes. The first two chapters were focussing on the evolution of mature tree communities. However, to understand forest dynamics, a detailed analysis of regeneration dynamics is necessary. Such a study was conducted in the third chapter where I highlighted northward shifts of several kilometres for the saplings of Acer rubrum, Acer saccharum and Betula alleghaniensis in undisturbed forests. However, under the influence of moderate disturbances, only Acer spp. had migrated and there were no shifts under the influence of major disturbances. In contrast, I found no evidence of migration for the saplings of Fagus grandifolia. Although partial cutting increased recruitment success of all four species, it did not result in larger northward range shifts, presumably because recruitment was constrained by short-distance dispersal, strong competition by boreal species, and unfavourable edaphic conditions. Overall, my results highlighted that forest communities in the temperate-boreal ecotone are already changing in response to recent climate warming and that disturbances are accelerating this response. While climate warming erodes the resilience of mixed forests, disturbances remove resident boreal species, thereby accelerating the successional process and facilitating the establishment of temperate species.		en	24831.0
146	Energy metabolism in species with Doubly Uniparental Inheritance (DUI) of mitochondria : investigating the functioning, maintenance and evolutionary relevance of a naturally heteroplasmic system	Mitochondria and their genome, the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), are usually transmitted only by the mother to both sons and daughters in metazoan (i.e. strict maternal inheritance, SMI). An exception to the general rule of SMI is found in around 100 species of bivalves, which are characterized by a doubly uniparental inheritance (DUI) of mitochondria. In DUI species, two highly divergent and sex-linked mtDNA lineages coexist. One mitochondrial lineage is maternally inherited (F-type) and is present in oocytes and somatic tissues of both female and male individuals. The other lineage is paternally inherited (M-type) and is present in sperm. In male somatic tissues both lineages sometimes coexist, a condition named heteroplasmy. Knowing that variations in mitochondrially-encoded genes might impact mitochondrial functions, and giving the strict association of M and F-type mtDNAs with different gametes, it is conceivable that the variation between the two DUI lineages might result in sex-specific bioenergetic adaptations with repercussion on reproduction. Despite providing an unprecedented opportunity for the mtDNA to evolve for male functions, the DUI system also brings the need for sperm mitochondria to preserve their genetic integrity, as well as for somatic cells to deal with heteroplasmy. The objective of my PhD was to link the mitochondrial genotype of DUI and SMI bivalve species to the phenotype. I explored the impact of sex-specific mtDNA variations upon a wide set of phenotypic traits, ranging from mitochondrial and cellular bioenergetics to sperm performance, investigating the adaptive value of DUI system in the light of reproductive fitness, mitochondrial selection, preservation and transmission.  The results stemming from this PhD project revealed a clear phenotypic divergence between DUI and SMI species, possibly reflecting the different selective pressures acting on their mitochondria as a result of their different mode of mitochondria transmission. Conversely to SMI species, the sex-specific evolution of DUI mtDNA variants results in the expression of different male and female bioenergetic phenotypes. At the level of mitochondrial functionality, M-type mitochondria exhibit a remodelled OXPHOS characterized by unusual respiratory control at the terminus of the respiratory chain. The general reorganization of DUI sperm bioenergetics also entails variation in the balance between the main energy producing pathways, including glycolysis, anaerobic glycolysis, fatty acid metabolism, tricarboxylic acid cycle, OXPHOS, as well as the antioxidant capacity. Finally, DUI sperm exhibit an unusual motility phenotype characterized by slow speed and high curvilinear trajectory, traits potentially associated with a higher reproductive success in sessile broadcast spawning marine organisms. They also completely rely on the energy produced by OXPHOS to sustain their performance, although maintaining the ability to switch to a more combined aerobic/anaerobic strategy of energy production after oocyte detection. Altogether, these results suggest that the mtDNA variation in DUI species might be adaptive, resulting in the expression of sex-specific bioenergetic adaptation with downstream effect on sperm performance, reproductive fitness, paternal mitochondria selection, preservation and transmission. The results also suggest that heteroplasmy has an impact onto the bioenergetics of male soma, and that a functional compensation between genomes might minimize any potential deleterious outcome.

147	Quand et comment exercer son autorité comme parent : le rôle socialisateur du lien problème-contrainte et du domaine social	Experimental studies focusing on the socialization role of parental authority exertion in persistent rule-breaking contexts involving non-personal issues have recently shown the advantages of using logical consequences over alternative strategies (mild punishments, reasoning and no-authority). Using an experimental vignette approach and a sample of 214 adolescents (Mage = 15.28 years), the present study extended these findings by comparing the same parental interventions in a hypothetical rule-breaking setting involving a multifaceted issue. Specifically, and based on research anchored in social domain theory, we evaluated how adolescents’ perceptions of the issue underlying the multifaceted transgression (personal vs. non-personal) moderated their beliefs regarding authority exertion strategies. When adolescents perceived the transgression as a non-personal issue, past results were replicated and enhanced. Adolescents perceived the logical consequence as at least as effective as the mild punishment to prevent future transgressions (i.e., more so than reasoning and no-authority) and as the most acceptable strategy. Furthermore, contrary to the mild punishment, they did not perceive the logical consequence as more autonomy-thwarting than reasoning. In contrast, adolescents who categorized the transgression as a personal matter rated the logical consequence less favorably, leaving reasoning as a preferred form of intervention. Implications for optimal parenting are discussed.	authority exertion , logical consequences , mild punishments , parenting , social domain theory	en	24825.0
148	Assessing early white matter predictors of syntactic abilities in post-stroke aphasia using HARDI-based tractography	The search for white matter predictors of language abilities in post-stroke aphasia has gained momentum in recent years. This growing interest has been driven by the emergence of the dual-stream framework where dorsal and ventral white matter bundles play an important functional role in language, as well as the advent of diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based tractography which allows the in-vivo investigation of white matter bundles and their structural properties. Structural characteristics, as well as the lesion load, of white matter bundles have been previously found to predict language impairments in the chronic phase. However, little is known about acute white matter predictors of syntactic abilities in chronic post-stroke aphasia.  Leveraging tractography to study white matter language bundles has been limited by several methodological challenges, such as the difficulty of reconstructing white matter bundles with a complex fiber architecture. A number of methodological advances have been introduced fairly recently to address these limitations, the most important of which is the advent of tractography based on High Angular Resolution Imaging (HARDI). However, the test-retest reliability of the reconstruction and structural properties of a state-of-the-art HARDI-based tractography pipeline has not been previously assessed.  The first article of the present thesis aimed to assess the test-retest reliability of the reconstruction and structural properties (fractional anisotropy, FA; mean, axial, radial diffusivity, MD, AD, RD; number of fiber orientations, NuFO; bundle volume; mean length of streamlines) of major white matter language bundles (arcuate, inferior fronto-occipital, inferior longitudinal, and uncinate fasciculi, AF, IFOF, ILF, UF) obtained using a state-of-the-art HARDI-based tractography pipeline. Most measures of structural properties showed good to excellent test-retest reliability. These findings have important implications for the use of such a pipeline for the study of white matter language bundles, as they increase our confidence that the reconstructions and structural properties obtained from the tractography pipeline are stable and not due to random variations in measurement. The second article of the thesis aimed to determine whether and which structural properties (FA, AD, bundle volume), as well as the lesion load, of the left AF and UF in the acute phase post-stroke (≤ 3 days), obtained with the same state-of-the-art HARDI-based tractography pipeline used in the first article, predict syntactic abilities in connected speech in chronic post-stroke aphasia (≥ 6 months). Forward multiple regressions revealed that the left AF’s volume predicted the percentage of verbs produced, the structural complexity of sentences, as well as verb-argument structure complexity. The left UF’s volume improved the prediction of verbs with a complex argument structure. These findings indicate that the bundle volume may be a good early predictor of syntactic ability in connected speech in chronic post-stroke aphasia. Overall, the findings of this thesis highlight the usefulness of a state-of-the-art HARDI-based tractography approach and its potential for the future development of early biomarkers that could improve the prognosis and personalized care of patients with chronic post-stroke aphasia. This would promote the optimization of patient care and the development of therapies for the benefit of patients and their families.

149	Advances in deep learning methods for speech recognition and understanding	This work presents several studies in the areas of speech recognition and     understanding.     The semantic speech understanding is an important sub-domain of the     broader field of artificial intelligence.     Speech processing has had interest from the researchers for long time     because language is one of the defining characteristics of a human being.     With the development of neural networks, the domain has seen rapid progress     both in terms of accuracy and human perception.     Another important milestone was achieved with the development of     end-to-end approaches.     Such approaches allow co-adaptation of all the parts of the model     thus increasing the performance, as well as simplifying the training     procedure.     End-to-end models became feasible with the increasing amount of available     data, computational resources, and most importantly with many novel     architectural developments.     Nevertheless, traditional, non end-to-end, approaches are still relevant     for speech processing due to challenging data in noisy environments,     accented speech, and high variety of dialects.      In the first work, we explore the hybrid speech recognition in noisy     environments.     We propose to treat the recognition in the unseen noise condition     as the domain adaptation task.     For this, we use the novel at the time technique of the adversarial     domain adaptation.     In the nutshell, this prior work proposed to train features in such     a way that they are discriminative for the primary task,     but non-discriminative for the secondary task.     This secondary task is constructed to be the domain recognition task.     Thus, the features trained are invariant towards the domain at hand.     In our work, we adopt this technique and modify it for the task of     noisy speech recognition.      In the second work, we develop a general method for regularizing     the generative recurrent networks.     It is known that the recurrent networks frequently have difficulties     staying on same track when generating long outputs.     While it is possible to use bi-directional networks for better     sequence aggregation for feature learning, it is not applicable     for the generative case.     We developed a way improve the consistency of generating long sequences     with recurrent networks.     We propose a way to construct a model similar to bi-directional network.     The key insight is to use a soft L2 loss between the forward and     the backward generative recurrent networks.     We provide experimental evaluation on a multitude of tasks and datasets,     including speech recognition, image captioning, and language modeling.      In the third paper, we investigate the possibility of developing     an end-to-end intent recognizer for spoken language understanding.     The semantic spoken language understanding is an important     step towards developing a human-like artificial intelligence.     We have seen that the end-to-end approaches show high     performance on the tasks including machine translation and speech recognition.     We draw the inspiration from the prior works to develop     an end-to-end system for intent recognition.

150	Comment le projet de laïcité de l'État québécois est défavorable aux femmes : l'urgence de briser une évidence	Given the persistence of patriarchy within the majority Quebec religious group, Catholicism, this thesis defends a counterintuitive idea: the affirmation of the secular nature of the Quebec state is harmful to women. Feminist analyses of political liberalism and its genealogy by Michel Foucault show that secularism has developed in the denial of the citizenship of women believers. The separation of religion and state and neutrality has created an area of lawlessness for women believers. The organization of liberal democracy, inspired by John Rawls in the Western culture, defended the notion of religious freedom. Analyzed from a postcolonial feminist perspective, religious freedom protects the privilege of men to exercise their domination in religious groups. For women, this freedom can be summed up in the possibility of leaving the group. It denies the agentivity of women believers and presupposes that living a religious affiliation is equivalent to renouncing the right to equality. It seems natural that women believers should refrain from using the legal tools that have advanced women's rights in other areas. In addition, the current debates on secularism on the management of religious diversity overshadow the practices of the Quebec state. This, whether through State feminism, associative law, the recognition of canon law by the judiciary or the organization of public services, provides instruments that support discriminatory practices against women. State intervention to enforce the right to equality in the religious sphere seems inconceivable in the legal tradition. However, it is possible to think otherwise about secularism by considering the State's commitments to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) and by noting the challenge to patriarchy by women believers within religious groups.	feminism , agency , catholicism , liberalism , Quebec state , law , citizenship , equality , CEDAW , secularism	en	24791.0
151	Les caractéristiques individuelles, de l'événement criminel et de l'enquête criminelle en matière d'homicides sexuels sériels et non-sériels	Over the last three decades, many theoretical models of sexual homicide have been proposed, which have made it possible to propose a profile of individuals. Although these models and profiles have suggested associations between the commission of one or more sexual homicides and a wide variety of factors—notably developmental, psychological, and crime-phase—none has produced a unified vision of sexual homicide that takes into account all factors. Moreover, these models and profiles, with the exception of that of the US Federal Bureau of Investigation, have been based on samples of individuals having committed a single homicide. As a result, although they propose explanations of the emergence of sexual homicide, current models and profiles are silent on the determinants of its repetition and cessation. Additionally, these models and profiles do not address post-homicide parameters, such as those related to the criminal investigation, since they do not take into account the sexual murderer’s life course following the commission of the homicide. For all these reasons, considerable uncertainty remains about why some individuals commit a series of sexual homicides while others commit only one. The principal objective of this thesis’s research was therefore to identify the distinctive characteristics of individuals having committed a series of sexual homicides, in order to proposed profiled of serial and nonserial sexual murderers. To this end, comparative analyses of serial sexual murderers (HSSs; n = 33) and nonserial sexual murderers (HSs n = 87) were conducted. The results indicate that the two groups of participants in this sample can be distinguished not only on individual factors and the manner in which the homicide was committed, but also on the failure of criminal investigators to apply best practices and rapidly resolve the homicides. Finally, this thesis’ research establishes a foundation for the development of theoretical models of serial and nonserial sexual homicide that explain the circumstances responsible for the emergence, repetition, and cessation of this phenomenon.

152	To salt or not to salt : three MALDI-TOF IMS protocols where (de)salting proved essential	Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI IMS) is currently the ionization method of choice for elucidating the spatial distribution of lipids on thin tissue sections. Despite the discovery of lipid friendly matrices such as 1,5-DAN for phospholipids and 2,5-DHB for triacylglycerols, there is a continued need to improve sensitivity. In the first study, we improved the overall sensitivity for phospholipids of entire fly Malpighian tubules microdissected in PBS with a two-step wash in glycerol followed by ammonium acetate that removed the bulk of the salt with minimal species delocalization and tubule displacement. We were able to detect phospholipids in both positive and negative ion modes and revealed an even distribution of most phospholipids along the length of this organ. We compared the method to the results from whole body fly sections acquired in dual-polarity mode at the same spatial resolution and found it to be more suitable for studying the tubules because of the complex three-dimensional structure of this organ within the fly. In the second study, we observed a marked improvement in ganglioside signals on mouse brain tissue sections with ammonium salt addition. Specifically, when the sample was first desalted in a low concentration ammonium formate solution, spray-coated with the same salt, coated with matrix and finally left in the freezer overnight before data acquisition, we observed an average overall improvement in ganglioside signal intensity by ten-fold and the number of species detected by three-fold. This method also did not affect the spatial distribution of the gangliosides, as high spatial resolution IMS results acquired at 20 µm showed no species delocalization. Finally, we sought to determine if salts could be employed directly as matrices. In this work, we tested silver-based metal salts and discovered that spray depositing silver nitrate alone is a viable method for the IMS detection of olefins, particularly cholesterol. With the optimized dry spray parameter, the overall deposition is homogeneous and composed of microscopic salt crystals that allow for high spatial resolution IMS down to 10 µm while maintaining acceptable overall signal quality comparable to that of previously published protocols. Overall, this thesis demonstrates we can manipulate the local salt distribution to influence the sensitivity and selectivity to target specific lipid subfamilies, opening the door for future research to understanding the role salts play during the laser desorption/ionization process.

153	Méthodes de synthèse de quinoléines et d’indoles polysubstitués : «la chimie traditionnelle modernisée»	The heterocycle chemistry is one of the most important fields in organic chemistry. Indeed, 65% of the literature in organic chemistry is about heterocycles. They are widely present in nature, essential to life and their applications are endless. Among them, the so-called privileged structures, attract particular attention. Privileged structures, of which quinolines and indoles are a part, play a crucial role in medicinal chemistry, for the production of libraries of therapeutic targets. Therefore, the development of new synthetic methods, simple, efficient and sensitive to environmental impact remains a challenge for chemists. Many synthetic methods require the use of o-acylated anilines, but these substrates are not easily available. The copper catalyzed addition reaction of a Grignard reagent on methyl anthranilate allows to form an o-acylated aniline, never reported before, with a quantitative yield. The latter will then serve as starting material for the synthesis of several privileged heterocycles including quinolines and indoles. The Friedlander reaction has been used for several centuries but suffers from the use of extreme reaction conditions which are harmful to the environment. It has therefore been modernized to give access to a series of eight trisubstituted quinolines, without solvent, strong acid or high temperatures. Furthermore, Heumann's process consists of the synthesis of indoles substituted in position by o-acylated anilines alkylation, followed by saponification and intramolecular cyclization steps. Patented by B.A.S.F. in 1895, this process quickly became obsolete due to low yields and difficult reaction conditions. Continuous flow chemistry has resurrected this process through the development of a more efficient and safer protocol. All in all, the work presented in this thesis contributes to the development of simple, effective methodologies, sensitive to environmental issues and leading to increasingly complex structures.

154	Die Entstehung der Illusion in den Paralogismen	We tend to underestimate the authentically productive role of reason in the Transcendental Dialectic of the Critique of Pure Reason. This paper provides an illustration of this role as it can be traced in the Paralogisms of Pure Reason, which themselves became possible on the basis of a negative fiction applied to the inner sense. The main point here consists in distinguishing the negative fiction from a mere logical “abstraction.” It is therefore important to make the difference between “Absonderung” and “Abstraktion.” The former is the source of the negative fiction, of a fiction that operates “praescindendo”, as Baumgarten writes about the “facultas fingendi.” In this sense, reason is an intellectual faculty of invention. This illustration is part of a larger project aiming at an interpretation of the Transcendental Dialectic based on a theory of schematism, which is somehow overshadowed by Kant’s critical intentions.

155	Ofending frequency and responses to illegal monetary incentives	Objectives We examine how responsive offenders are to illegal monetary incentives. We draw from rational choice theory, prospect theory, and models of labor supply to develop expectations regarding the relationship between criminal efficiency, which is the average earnings per offense, and frequency of offending.  Methods We use OLS, fixed effects, and first-difference estimators to analyze data from 152 incarcerated male inmates from Quebec, Canada to study within individual monthly changes in criminal efficiency and offending frequency.  Results There is an inverse relationship between criminal efficiency and frequency of offending, net of individual fixed effects, for market crimes, but not property crimes. We also find that the supply of crime is inelastic, meaning it is not highly sensitive to illegal wage changes.  Conclusions In the months that offenders have an average bigger pay-off per crime, they offended less frequently. We conjecture that this negative relationship could be explained by two mechanisms: an income effect and/or through reference dependence. However, we are not able to disentangle between the two mechanisms. Moreover, we note that criminal efficiency is likely endogenous and should be treated as such in future scholarship.

156	How to combine and analyze all the data from diverse sources : a multilevel analysis of institutional trust in the world	Scholars who want to perform cross-national comparative research rely on data provided by International survey projects, which study the same concepts in varying countries and periods using different question wordings and scales. In this article, we propose a process to combine and analyse the data pertaining to the same concept—institutional trust—when measures and sources differ. We show how we combined 1327 surveys conducted from 1995 to 2017 by 17 survey projects in 142 countries. The database comprises close to 2 M respondents and 21 M answers to trust questions. We use local regression to visualize the trends in trust for different institutions and sources of data in different parts of the world. We complete these analyses with a 4-level longitudinal analysis of repeated measures. These analyses lead to reliably conclude that institutional trust is a property of the institutions themselves and of the context in which they operate since there is much more variance within respondents than between respondents and more variance between countries than over time. This research contributes to the current debates in political trust research. Since the process presented here can be applied to other fields of research, the research also contributes to enhance the possibilities for comparative cross-national analysis.

157	Retrospective case control study of pet ferrets with cystine urolithiasis in Quebec, Canada : epidemiological and clinical features	Objective: To describe epidemiological and clinical features of cystine urolithiasis in pet ferrets. Methods: Retrospective case control study on medical records from four private clinics and one teaching hospital for pet ferrets diagnosed with cystine urolithiasis confirmed by spectrophotometry presented between July 2014 and July 2019 in Quebec, Canada; these cases were then compared to a reference population of 210 ferrets (controls) presented at the same facilities over the same timeframe. Results: Among the 36 identified cases, most affected ferrets were neutered males (32/36, 89%) and the mean age at presentation was 1.8 (± 1.0 standard deviation) year. Grain-free diets of six different brands were offered for at least three weeks prior to the presentation to 34/36 (94%) of the included cases. The ferrets that developed cystine urolithiasis were 57.9 times (Odds ratio [OR], 95% Confidence interval [95% CI]: 11.0, 304.8) more likely to receive a grain-free diet compared to the reference population. No significant difference in the values for the energy, protein, cysteine, and methionine contents were detected between the grainfree and the cereal-based diets offered to these pet ferrets. Among ferrets with uroliths, those with urethral calculi were 4.7 times (OR, 95% CI: 2.1, 10.4) more likely to develop an acute urinary tract obstruction. Conclusion: Although a definitive causation could not be drawn solely from these clinical cases, this case control study highlights a possible nutritional aetiology in the complex pathogenesis of cystine urolithiasis in ferrets.

158	Qualité nutritionnelle et santé cardiométabolique chez les survivants de la leucémie lymphoblastique aiguë	Context. Although they are a high-risk population, there is little information about how diet may influence the cardiometabolic health of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (cALL) survivors. Objectives. This study aims to explore the associations between diet quality index and cardiometabolic health indicators in this population. Methodology. Participants were recruited as part of the PETALE study (n=241, 49.4% males; median age: 21.7 years). Adherence to 6 dietary scores were calculated: MEDAS (14-point Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener), KIDMED (Mediterranean Diet Quality Index for Children and Adolescents), HDI-2018 (Healthy Diet Indicator), HEI-2015 (Health Eating Index), E-DII (Energy Adjusted Dietary Inflammatory Index) and FRAP (ferric-reducing antioxidant potential). Caloric intake from ultra-processed foods was determined based on the NOVA Classification. Multivariate logistic regressions, Student t-tests and Mann-Whitney tests evaluated the associations between diet, cardiometabolic and inflammatory outcomes. Results. We found that 88% of adults and 46% of children adhered poorly to the Mediterranean diet. In fact, less than a quarter of adults consumed at least 3 servings of legumes or fish per week, while more than a third of children ate pastries such as chocolate croissant at breakfast and 96% of them took sweets regularly. Also, 36.9% had poor adherence to the WHO recommendations, where more than 95% of all participants had a sodium consumption exceeding 2g per day. 76.3% had a diet to be improved according to the HEI-2015 score, which showed that the survivors of our cohort consumed an average of 7 servings of refined grain products per day and a daily intake of free sugars of up to 15% of total energy. On average, ultra-processed foods accounted for 51% of total energy intake. Having low HDL-C was associated with a more inflammatory diet (E-DII score) and higher consumption of ultra-processed foods. A higher E-DII score was associated with elevated HOMA-IR and consumption of ultra-processed foods with having high triglycerides. Participants with a better adherence to the HEI-2015 score had lower levels of circulating TNF-α. Adiponectin levels were higher in those who better adhered to the Mediterranean diet. Conclusion. Survivors of cALL have poor adherence to dietary recommendations, negatively affecting their cardiometabolic health and inflammatory status.	survivors , pediatrics , oncology , acute lymphoblastic leukemia , cardiometabolic complications , survivor nutrition	en	24722.0
159	Évaluation tridimensionnelle de la reconstruction du ligament croisé antérieur	The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) remains one of the most injured ligament of the knee. Mispositioning the tunnels remains a common cause of ACL reconstruction failure. A better biomechanical description of this phenomenon is therefore essential. Using the low irradiation biplanar stereoradiographic EOStm imaging system, our group developed a 3D reconstruction method allowing a precise morphologic description of the knee. With this system, the tridimensional positioning of the femoral tunnel can be evaluated in a novel, computerized, precise and reproducible coordinate system. With this referential, our group wish to assist orthopedic surgeons in the restoration of optimal biomechanics in ACL reconstructions.

160	Regulation of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor 1 (IP3R1) by microRNA-26a in atrial fibrillation	Background: The pathophysiology of atrial fibrillation (AF) has been characterized by changes in the cellular concentration of Ca2+ and related processes leading to the initiation and maintenance of the condition. Inositol trisphosphate-receptors (IP3Rs) are ligand-gated calcium channels for which overexpression in AF has been linked to cardiac remodeling. microRNA (miR, miRNA)s, small non-coding RNAs, are around 22 nucleotides in length and regulate gene expression by mRNA destabilization or inhibition of its translation. A growing body of evidence has emerged about miRNA's role in the pathophysiology of cardiac disorders, including AF-induced adverse remodeling. Objective: Our laboratory has shown that nuclear IP3R1 level is upregulated in the dog AF model, producing increased nuclear calcium loading. Hence, this study aims to investigate the role of miRNAs in the regulation of IP3R1 initiating and/or perpetuating AF in atrial cardiomyocytes of the dog AF model. Methods: We used AF dog model established by atrial-tachypacing for 600 bpm × one week; Langendorff-perfused hearts to isolate atrial cardiomyocytes for molecular experiments; screening miRs that target ITPR1 gene, encoding IP3R1, using online databases; RT-qPCR to measure ITPR1 mRNA expression and confirm the expression level of the screened miRNAs; western blot analysis to evaluate the protein level of IP3R1; dual-luciferase reporter assay, overexpression and knockdown of miRNAs in primary culture of isolated cardiomyocytes or appropriate cell lines; and Fluo-4 AM calcium fluorescence imaging to assess the potential role of the miRNA on Ca2+ handling. For miRNA manipulation experiments, cells were transfected with 1) non-coding miRNA (miR-NC, control group), 2) miRNA mimic, and 3) inhibitor of the miRNA (AMO). Statistical significance is calculated with Student's t-test or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey's multiple comparisons test using GraphPad Prism software version 6.00. Results: Our data indicated a rise in IP3R1 protein level with no apparent change in ITPR1 gene expression in left atrial cardiomyocytes from our dog AF model. Based on the computational analysis, miR-26a was predicted to target the ITPR1 mRNA. AF significantly downregulated miR-26a in left atrial cardiomyocytes. The dual-luciferase reporter assay in H9C2 cells showed that miR-26a directly acted on the 3′ untranslated region (3′UTR) of ITPR1 mRNA. In addition, miR-26a overexpression reduced the IP3R1 protein level and decreased the diastolic [Ca2+] in both nucleus and cytosol of the electrically-stimulated Ca2+ -transients, dog cardiomyocytes, while miR-26a knockdown reversed these effects. ITPR1 mRNA expression remained unaltered in isolated dog cardiomyocytes after transfection with the miRNA mimic and inhibitor. Conclusion: IP3R1 upregulation in AF is due to translation inhibition by miR-26a, which is downregulated in the atrial cardiomyocytes of the dog AF model. This change is associated with altered Ca2+ handling, reflected as enhanced nuclear diastolic Ca2+ levels. Our results suggest that miR-26a downregulation enhances the IP3R1 expression, contributing to pro-arrhythmic remodeling in AF.

161	Impacts de divers régimes d’élevage sur l’abondance des gènes de résistance et sur le microbiote cæcal de poulets de chair au Québec	The ever-increasing problem of antibiotic resistance makes routine use of antibiotics in animal production no longer considered as a reasonable and viable practice. Preserving the effectiveness of antibiotics represents a major challenge for public and animal health. The Chicken Farmers of Canada have developed and are implementing an Antimicrobial Use Reduction Strategy which ultimate goal is eliminating the preventive use of medically-important antibiotics in broiler chicken and turkey productions. While it is known that the reduction of antibiotics in broiler chicken farms is associated with an increase in the incidence of necrotic enteritis caused by Clostridium perfringens, to which a proportion of this bacterial population produces the enterotoxin who can also generates consequences for human health, very little is known about the real overall impact of an antibiotic use reduction strategy in complex ecosystems such as the bird intestine or the commercial broiler chicken farm. The main objectives of the present study were to quantify the abundance of antibiotic resistance genes, to assess the presence of Clostridium perfringens and his enterotoxin and to characterize the composition of the cæcal microbiota in broiler chicken flocks from six commercial farms located in Québec and submitted to either a short-term conventional or drug-free program (15 months) or a long-term conventional or judicious antibiotic use program (six years). Implementing an antibiotic-free program over a 15-month period did not reduce the abundance of many antibiotic resistance-encoding genes, whereas a judicious use of antibiotics over six years did. The short-term antibiotic withdrawal and the long-term judicious use strategy altered the cæcal microbiota composition, with Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae families being negatively impacted, in agreement with the lower production performance and with the increased C. perfringens populations observed for farms phasing out the use of antibiotics in a short-term antibiotic withdrawal. Adopting a long-term conventional rearing program on commercial broiler chicken farms selected for specific antibiotic resistance-encoding genes in many barns. This study highlights the potential impacts of different rearing programs in poultry production and will help guide future policies in order to reduce the use of antibiotics and ultimately reduce the phenomenon of antibiotic resistance.

163	Kant et les organismes non vivants	In this article, I question the position adopted by Peter McLaughlin and Reinhard Löw who tend to neglect in their commentaries the sharp distinction established by Kant between “organism” and “life.” In truth, the second part of the CJ deals specifically with the paradigmatic case of organism, and this in accordance with Kant’s intentions in this work. Therefore, properly speaking, the main topic here is not a philosophy of “bio-logy.” Organism is at most an “analogon of life” according to Kant. Furthermore I examine the reasons that lead him to reject two ways of explaining organism, namely “hylozoism” (contradictory) and the theory of the world-soul (anthropomorphic) in order to conclude that the only possible explanation for Kant is the supersensible realm.

164	Cannabidiol as a treatment for craving and relapse in individuals with cocaine use disorder : a randomized placebo‐controlled trial	Background and Aims Cocaine use disorder (CUD) is a significant public health concern for which no efficacious pharmacological interventions are available. Cannabidiol (CBD) has attracted considerable interest as a promising treatment for addiction. This study tested CBD efficacy for reducing craving and preventing relapse in people with CUD. Design Single site double‐blind randomized controlled superiority trial comparing CBD with placebo. Setting Centre hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal, Canada. Participants Seventy‐eight adults (14 women) with moderate to severe CUD participated. Intervention Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) by stratified blocks to daily 800 mg CBD (n=40) or placebo (n=38). They first underwent an inpatient detoxification phase lasting 10 days. Those who completed this phase entered a 12‐week outpatient follow‐up. Measurements Primary outcomes were drug‐cue induced craving during detoxication and time‐to‐cocaine relapse during subsequent outpatient treatment. Findings During drug‐cue exposure, craving scores (mean ± SD) increased from baseline by 4.69 (2.89) versus 3.21 (2.78) points respectively in CBD (n=36) and placebo (n=28) participants (CI = ‐0.33 to 3.04; p = 0.069; Bayes factor = 0.498). All but three participants relapsed to cocaine by week 12 with similar risk for CBD (n=34) and placebo (n=27) participants (Hazard Ratio =1.20, CI=0.65 to 2.20, p=0.51; Bayes factor = 0.152). CBD treatment was well tolerated and associated mainly with diarrhea. Conclusions Cannabidiol did not reduce cocaine craving or relapse among people being treated for cocaine use disorder.

165	Political conflict as moral conflict : multiculturalism and the nation in Germany (2015-2017)	This dissertation examines, from a Durkheimian perspective, political conflict in Germany around the issues of multiculturalism, immigration, and national identity within the context of the Refugee Crisis beginning in 2015 and ending roughly with the German Federal Election in September 2017. It identifies four moral ideals, or ideal visions of the German community, that motivated political actors during this period: the Autonomen ideal that rejects all forms of power and domination; the ideal of Verfassungspatriotismus (Constitutional Patriotism) of the SPD (and parts of the CDU); the ideal of the cultural or ethnocultural nation of much of the AfD (and the CSU and WerteUnion); and the ideal of the biological nation on the far-right. At the heart of each moral ideal is a sacred object that serves as a moral authority that legitimates certain moral prescriptions, and leads to a set of moral truths and moral judgments, the totality of which Émile Durkheim identifies as a moral fact. For the Autonomen and adherents of Verfassungspatriotismus the sacred object is the individual understood through the concept of human dignity. For others the sacred object is the German nation, understood either in an (ethno)cultural sense or a biological sense. As the dissertation argues, these different moral ideals are inherently profanatory to each other, such that the moral prescriptions inspired by one sacred object (human dignity) directly violate the sacred object of the other (the nation), and vice-versa. These ideals all compete with each other for power and influence within the German political sphere as a means to gain access to (or to dismantle) state power. The result is political conflict that takes place essentially within a moral framework. These conflicts occur in the legal domain, in battles over party leadership and membership, and through political violence; they touch on a number of key issues such as free speech, multiculturalism, and political extremism. This dissertation seeks to understand these conflicts through the prism of Durkheim’s concept of the moral fact and to develop a Durkheimian sociology of moral conflict. In this analysis, the dissertation draws on Randall Collins’ conflict theory, which Durkheim’s work also largely inspires.

166	Géographie du système alimentaire des Inuit du Nunavik : du territoire nourricier au supermarché	This thesis focuses on the transition of Nunavik’s food system and on the consequences of that transition for the region’s inhabitants. The thesis’s hypothesis is that the food system’s new territorial configuration changes the interactions between humans and the natural environment, and thus becomes incompatible with Nunavik’s ecosystems as well as Inuit culture and identity. Intensifying relations between the Inuit economy and the globalized economy put northern territories in a position of unequal exchange and dependency in relation to producers and suppliers from an exogenous agri-food sector that offers northern residents few opportunities to be heard. Food market sovereignty is thus severely restricted, which harms Inuit health and well-being. This thesis explores potential solutions for improving the food system’s resilience, such as developing community gardening projects and improving access to traditional foods. The data on which the four articles of this thesis are based was collected between October 2015 and March 2019 in the northern villages of Kuujjuaq and Kangiqsujuaq, in Nunavik. The variety of methods used, combining semi-constructed interviews, the development of mental maps, soil analyses and participatory workshops, made it possible to meet the triple challenge of interdisciplinarity, participatory action research, and terrain particularly difficult to access. The results illustrate that traditional foods from hunting, fishing and gathering activities remain major factors for the Inuit in their interactions with the natural environment and in their well-being, although those activities now represent only a small fraction of the food supply. Loss of mobility and the adoption of a new lifestyle, accompanied and made possible by the food system’s transition, have disturbed the interactions between humans and the natural environment on various levels. The greatest pressure exerted on the natural environment originates from human activities carried out elsewhere in the world and from an incompatible consumption model that generate numerous negative externalities on the environment and human health. One of the most significant contributions of this thesis is to have demonstrated the mechanisms by which nutritional, social, climate and energy issues are interrelated. The conclusion, pointing to the cumulative consequences of climate change, environmental contamination and colonization, summarizes the issues confronting Nunavik’s socio-ecological system.

167	Sourds et muets entre savoir et fiction au tournant des Lumières	At the intersection of the history of linguistic ideas and the history of representations, this thesis studies scholarly and fictional discourses on deafness between the final years of the Ancien Régime and the beginning of the Restoration (1776-1815). This period covers the years where the Abbé de L'Épée and the Abbé Sicard carried out their work. It matches the period of changes in the course of the history of the deaf people in France and how they were considered. The emergence of a specialist discourse on deafness, the setting up of institutions dedicated to the collective education of deaf people and the development of sign language and their literacy, mark the beginning of the integration of deaf people into society. Educators and philosophers are not the only ones to talk about deafness; the deaf people and their education also entrhal novelists and authors of short fiction. The sentimental novel seized the silent character and its sign language, sometimes separating him from deafness. Without doubt, the novelists have been interested much more by muteness than deafness, because the former enabled them to question the social function of speech. In their works, the novelists use contrast to reveal the malfunction of speech caused by the Revolution. The aim of this thesis is twofold. First, we put speech on deafness back in the scholarly context of the times and explain how it helps us understand the linguistic, anthropological and philosophical changes of this period. Secondly, through the history of the representations, we show how knowledge and fiction meet in the process of metaphorization of the idea of deafness of the end of the eighteenth century.

168	Les primates non humains ont-ils une théorie de l’esprit ? =	Theory of mind, the ability to attribute mental states to oneself and to others, is a multifaceted phenomenon as there are different kinds of mental states (intention, knowledge, belief, etc.). Is theory of mind present in other animals, particularly in nonhuman primates, or is it unique to humans? This question has been investigated for almost 40 years and, despite some methodological difficulties and controversies (e.g. mindreading vs. behavior-reading), important advances have been made since the early 2000s. In fact, we now know that great apes behave according to others’ goals, intentions, visual perspective, and knowledge, and, to a lesser extent it seems, to others’ auditory perspective. Furthermore, recent studies suggest that these hominids also understand false beliefs, albeit implicitly, a capacity that was previously thought to be found only in humans. Understanding false-belief is central to theory of mind as it requires one’s to realize that mental states are internal representations rather than direct reflections of reality, and can therefore be inaccurate. Future investigations should explain the discrepancies between these recent studies and previous ones which reported negative results, and should also clarify the nature of the difficulties experienced by great apes when it comes to reality-incongruent mental states. Although noteworthy efforts have been made, research is still mostly centered around great apes, especially chimpanzees, so much so that we still know very little about theory of mind abilities in other primates. Visual and auditory perspective-taking have nevertheless been reported in some Old World monkeys, as well as their understanding that knowledge is acquired through these sensory modalities. Some work has also shown ability to attribute goals and intentions to others in New World monkeys. Thus, what seemed to be a difference of kind between humans and other primates now appears to be mainly one of degree.

169	Effects of an interactive Web training to support parents in reducing challenging behaviors in children with autism	Many children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) engage in challenging behaviors, which may interfere with their daily functioning, development, and well-being. To address this issue, we conducted a four-week randomized waitlist control trial to examine the effects of a fully self-guided interactive web training (IWT) on (a) child engagement in challenging behaviors and (b) parental intervention. After 4 weeks, parents in the treatment group reported lower levels of challenging behaviors in their children and more frequent use of behavioral interventions than those in the waitlist groups. Furthermore, within-group analyses suggest that these changes persisted up to 12 weeks following completion of the IWT. Our results highlight the potential utility of web training, but our high attrition rate and potential side effects prevent us from recommending the training as a standalone treatment.

171	Contribution du Globus Pallidus et du noyau Entopédonculaire dans le contrôle de la locomotion et du mouvement d’atteinte chez le chat	This thesis addresses the issue of how the basal ganglia contribute to the control of three important motor activities: i) the control of non-obstructed locomotion, ii) the control of visually-guided gait modifications and iii) the control of visually-guided reaching movements.  A major impetus for this work comes from previous studies from this laboratory that have detailed the activity of several cortical areas that we postulate are involved in the planning of gait modification. Many of the cells recorded in these studies show similar discharges regardless of which limb is the first to step over the obstacle (limb-independent). This signal therefore has to be transformed into a limb-dependent signal to determine, amongst other issues, which limb will be the first to step over the obstacle. We propose that the basal ganglia are involved in this transformation and that it might make a contribution both in selecting which limb will be the first to step over the obstacle as well as determining temporal aspects of the resulting step. To test this hypothesis, we recorded activity from the pallidum (i.e. globus pallidus and entopedoncular nucleus) of five cats trained to walk on a treadmill and to step over a moving obstacle attached to that treadmill.  We showed that a large proportion of pallidal neurons modulated their discharge according to the locomotor rhythm. Many of these neurons discharged before the onset of the step over the obstacle, but only for the contralateral limb to the recording site, compatible with a bias toward selecting that limb. In addition, other cells discharged with brief bursts of activity before and during the step and might contribute to providing temporal information about the upcoming step. The majority of cells showed changes related to the swing phase of the contralateral limb but some cells discharged with respect to the activity in several limbs leading us to suggest a possible contribution to the regulation of the sequence of activity in the four limbs.  To determine whether the same cells contributed to discrete reaches, neuronal activity was recorded from the same cells after the transfer of the cat from the treadmill to an adjacent apparatus. Most cells discharged during both behaviours and in some cases the discharges during gait modification and reaching were very similar. In particular, cells discharging during the swing phase of locomotion also discharged during the transport phase of the reach. In other cases, the activity was more disparate, suggesting a context-dependent control over the activity and perhaps the existence of separate circuits for the control of different movements.  The reaching task allowed us to correlate the discharge with preparatory postural adjustments that precede movements. Only a few cells showed a better correlation with APAs in comparison with the movement, suggesting a preferential role of the pallidum in focal movements rather than in the preceding postural activities.  In conclusion, our results suggest that the activity in the pallidum is tightly correlated with different aspects of motor activity, suggesting that the pallidum is well placed to integrate and transform cortical signals and participate in the precise control of limb displacement. It was noteworthy that the strongest and most frequent changes in activity were increases rather than decreases. We discuss the possibility that these increases in activity might sculpt thalamocortical activity rather than releasing the thalamus from inhibition.	pallidum , globus pallidus , locomotion , entopeduncular nucleus , basal ganglia , reaching , pallidum , locomotion , globus pallidus	en	24591.0
172	Les facteurs de risque maternels, la santé pondérale et cardiométabolique des jeunes, et l’importance des habitudes de vie	Maternal and children’s health are major worldwide public health concerns. The current thesis aimed to explore the impact of maternal health during pregnancy on children’s and adolescents’ health and included three original research projects. The first study found that a prenatal exposure to independent or combined suboptimal gestational factors (SGF : gestational diabetes mellitus, hypertensive disorders during pregnancy, maternal smoking during pregnancy) was positively associated with obesity and cardiometabolic risk factors in children around puberty, and these associations were sex-dependent. The second study found that children exposed to one SGF display a similar physiological response in terms of mechanical efficiency and substrate oxidation at rest and during exercise (submaximal and maximal) in comparison with non-exposed children. The third study of the thesis found that light-intensity physical activity reduced the adverse impact of prenatal exposure to combined SGF on high density lipoprotein-cholestrol levels in boys. A sleep duration within the range of the current Canadian recommendations for sleep did not mitigate the risk of high waist circumference (children) and obesity (girls) in a context of exposure to maternal smoking during pregnancy. Furthermore, other lifestyle factors such as moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and a healthy diet (intakes of: fruits and vegetables, grains, and dairy products), did not mitigate the adverse impact of a prenatal exposure to independent or combined SGF on children’s risk of obesity and cardiomeatbolic outcomes. Taken together, these results suggest that it is important to continue maternal SGF prevention and management programs to provide optimal health for children. Moreover, future studies should also develop and evaluate the impact of lifestyle habits interventions to design future prevention strategies during childhood and adolescence to reduce obesity and cardiometabolic risk factors in this population.

173	Rethinking incarcerated women's leisure as subjected to coercive and normative prison missions	Leisure is commonly understood as contributing to well-being; this is especially appealing when considering multiply marginalized populations such as incarcerated women. However, leisure is not impervious to cooptation by less benevolent social processes. In this conceptual analysis, I argue that incarcerated women’s leisure must be rethought as a component of its environment and by extension, as subjected to coercive and normative prison missions. After broadly delineating incarcerated women’s leisure, I determine that some characteristics of leisure can be compatible with these prison missions. I then examine individual, organizational, and social benefits and issues with leisure in women’s prisons. I link these practices to reduced coerciveness and increased normativity. I conclude by suggesting that ensuring incarcerated people’s well-being through leisure is not in itself an end, but a means to achieve prison’s coercive and normative ends. I discuss implications for scholars, practitioners, and advocates.	Leisure , Sports , Arts , Programs , Prison , Women , Normative , Coercive	en	24571.0
174	Le savoir expérientiel des enfants aux prises avec des allergies alimentaires	Families with a food-allergic child often mention unmet education needs. Recognizing the experiential knowledge from living with the illness and entrusting the patient with greater responsibilities could better the health care and respond to the families’ needs. However, experiential knowledge is not well documented in children with chronic health conditions.  Therefore, the objective in our study was to explore the experiential knowledge of children under 13 years old living with food allergies as recounted by them and their families to include their views in clinical practice. Thirty-three participants were interviewed including 14 children between eight and twelve years old and 19 parents. Interviews were analyzed using a general inductive approach.  Our study shows that the development of experiential knowledge in food-allergic children starts in childhood. Children’ experiential knowledge is mostly acquired by applying teachings and experiencing reactions. The different illness perspectives between the child and his parents explain the distinctive properties of the children’s experiential knowledge. In food-allergic children, experiential knowledge promotes self-management skills and also senses of normality and balance thus contributing to better quality of life.  In conclusion, experiential knowledge of food-allergic children exists and should be recognized. This knowledge is distinctive from their parent’s and impacts positively the children’s self-management skills and their own illness perspective. Clinicians and parents would benefit of support and methods to understand and mobilize the food-allergic child’s experiential knowledge.

175	Behavioral and muscular deficits induced by Muscimol injection into the primate primary motor cortex during a reach-to-grasp task	Fine digit movements contribute to many different aspects of our daily life and require appropriate muscle coordination. The main pathway through which M1 sends motor commands to spinal motor neurons is via the corticospinal tract. The rhesus macaque, like humans, have this direct corticomotoneuronal pathway of M1, making it a useful model to study this system. Although the effect of M1 inactivation on the control of the hand in term of behavioral changes has been studied in monkeys, little is known of how muscle activation patterns of the upper limb during reaching and grasping in monkeys becomes altered. The goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of a partial inactivation of the primary motor cortex (M1) in rhesus macaques on both behavioral performance and muscle activations. To do so we performed intra-cortical injections of Muscimol, a GABA agonist, to inactivate the hand area of M1. Monkeys performed a reach-to-grasp task that required a precision grip to retrieve a food pellet from a well. Electromyographic (EMG) activity of the proximal and distal muscles of the contralateral upper limb were recorded and quantified relative to the behavioral performance. We found that depending on the severity of the impairment, the Muscimol injection could induce several different movement abnormalities, such as decrease in the success rate, loss of independent finger movements, longer duration of the first flexion of the index finger, and use of alternate types of grasp to retrieve the food pellet. In cases of severe impairment, monkeys displayed all these movement abnormalities concurrently. In addition, we observed that behavioral deficits were associated with muscle discoordination. Indeed, EMG analysis revealed that the latencies and the muscle activation patterns were altered during the reach, hand preshaping and the grasp phases of the movement. These inappropriate EMG activities were visible on both proximal and distal muscles of the upper limb. In cases of mild impairment, monkeys had fewer behavioral deficits, but still showed some changes in the temporal muscle activation patterns. In contrast to the severe cases, the muscle activation patterns were more preserved. Interestingly, in the mild cases, the muscle activation patterns were altered if a rotation of the forearm was required by the task. Thus, we found that behavioral and muscular activation changes were dependent on the severity of the impairment and/or the difficulty of the task (i.e. required a rotation of the forearm).

176	Caractérisation des approches de stimulation tactile suite à une lésion nerveuse périphérique avec allodynie à la main : une étude de cas et une revue systématique	Context: Peripheral nerve lesions can lead to mechanical allodynia (MA), that is a neuropathic pain provoked by touch. MA can limit patients’ activities and life habits. Tactile stimulations are promising approaches to treat MA. However, to our knowledge, there is no study that has investigated how such approaches can be integrated into a multimodal rehabilitation program. In addition, there is no synthesis of current knowledge on the tactile stimulation approaches for treating MA.  Objectives: 1- To describe the integration of a tactile stimulation approach in a multimodal rehabilitation program; 2- To identify existing tactile stimulation approaches and to assess evidences of the use of these approaches to MA in the hand following a peripheral nerve lesion.  Method: 1- Case report. 2- Systematic review on tactile stimulation approaches.  Results: The case report shows an abolition of MA and an improvement of incapacities in a patient with a complex regional pain syndrome who participated in a multimodal rehabilitation program including a tactile stimulation approach. The systematic review identified two tactile stimulation approaches (desensitization and somatosensory rehabilitation of pain). Those approaches do not differ in their level of evidence in the treatment of MA following a peripheral nerve lesion.  Conclusion: The two approaches can be used by clinicians to treat MA. The choice of these approaches should be based on clinical reasoning and patients’ characteristics.

177	Développement d’un nouveau modèle de criblage tridimensionnel pour la découverte de médicaments épigénétiques contre le cancer du poumon	Small molecule development in oncology mainly involves high-throughput drug screenings and preclinical validation studies using cancer cells grown in two-dimension (2D). However, classical cell culture methods poorly reflect tumor biology and cell epigenome. Here, our objective is to develop a 3D model that displays key epigenetic features of solid tumors in order to identify new actionable targets. First, we determined culture conditions for long-term expansion of adenocarcinoma spheroids to allow cell adaptation and the occurrence of specific epigenetic features triggered by 3D condition. Our results demonstrate that cells cultivated in 3D spheroids exhibit significant phenotypic and epigenetic changes as compared to 2D monolayers. Notably, we observed numerous expression changes of key epigenetic regulators, all taken place at a different time-point of the 3D cell culture. We observed a decrease in the expression of the KAT3A/KAT3B complex as well as BRG1. HDAC6 expression also increased in 3D. Then, we asked whether epigenetic changes triggered by 3D culture would modify drug sensitivity. We performed a screening of 154 epigenetic drugs on cancer cells cultivated in 2D and in 3D at two different time points. 60% of epigenetic drugs showed significant anticancer activity against 2D monolayers. Interestingly, A549 cells in 3D spheroids became gradually resistant over time. Against 3D spheroids cultivated for 10 days, only 9% of epigenetic drugs in the drug library showed anticancer activity. Against 3D spheroids cultivated for 24 days, only a single epigenetic compound called MS023, a selective agent against type I PRMTs, reduced cell viability significantly. This sensitivity is correlated with an increase of arginine methylation observed within spheroids.  Taken together, we show that 3D spheroids trigger a time-dependent epigenetic context that increases lung cancer cells sensitivity to type I PRMT inhibition. 3D spheroids of well-characterized cancer cell lines will improve our understanding of tumor biology and drug discovery and can overcome the high false discovery rate associated with 2D classical models. 	High Throughput Screening , Lung Cancer , Epigenetics , 3-dimensional Models , Pharmacology , Drug discovery	en	24521.0
178	Les rôles de genre professionnels en lien avec la charge allostatique et le fonctionnement psychosocial de travailleurs d'hôpital psychiatrique	Gendered inequalities in workplace stress are linked to sex-specific health trajectories that are poorly understood. Measuring these gendered inequalities are challenging but an essential endeavor to better explain individual differences in occupational health. The aim of this exploratory, retrospective study was to investigate pathways linking layers of individual-level (e.g., sociocultural gender-roles) and macro-level (e.g., occupational gender-roles) gender factors to measures of allostatic load (23 biomarkers), workplace stress (e.g., job strain, effort-reward imbalance) and mental health (e.g., depressive symptoms, burnout symptoms, trauma symptoms) in a sample of psychiatric hospital workers (N=192). We propose a practical web-based survey approach to measure macro-level gendered occupational factors for retrospective analyses that could also be integrated in novel experimental designs. Our findings show that individual-level masculine gender-roles were positively associated with psychological demands and social support. Masculine and feminine occupational gender-roles were positively associated with decisional latitude and overcommitment. Both individual masculine and feminine gender-roles had protective effects on depressive symptoms and burnout symptoms but only individual masculine gender-roles had protective effects on trauma symptoms; however occupational gender-roles had no effects on mental health. No associations were found with allostatic load. Moving beyond an individual’s gender-roles, our study demonstrates the utility of measuring occupational gender-roles to delineate challenging associations between subjective stressors and health outcomes that should be applied in analyses for future studies of sex differences in occupational health.

179	Origine, composition et destinée de la matière organique dissoute et ses interactions avec les communautés de procaryotes dans la mer du Labrador	Oceanic prokaryotes are key players in the carbon cycle by consuming dissolved organic mat-ter (DOM) produced by primary producers. As this organic matter is highly complex with varying degree of bioavailability, prokaryotic communities are highly diverse and diﬀerent taxa target certain types of organic compounds. By consuming this organic matter, prokary-otes reintroduce this carbon into the food web, a critical energy ﬂow in oligotrophic gyres. However, this consumption is not perfect and they release a lot of carbon as CO2 through respiration, but also as recalcitrant DOM. Thus, they contribute to carbon sequestration in aquatic ecosystems. The objective of this thesis is to characterize DOM bioavailability and its inﬂuence on the composition and metabolism of prokaryotic communities in the Labrador Sea, described as one of the Earth’s climate system tipping elements. More precisely, we quantify for the ﬁrst time how the spatial abundance distribution of prokaryotes inﬂuences ecosystem metabolism and organic matter association in the surface waters of the Labrador Sea. Lastly, we look at how DOM produced at the surface is transformed and sequestered following the Labrador Sea winter convective mixing. The oceanic carbon budget is still unbalanced. In order to better understand its carbon sources and bioavailability, we characterize DOM bioavailability across the aquatic contin-uum, from lakes to the open ocean. Using a meta-analysis, our results show that the propor-tion of labile organic matter, i.e. readily available for prokaryotes, is similar at around 6% in all aquatic ecosystems. However, the proportion of semi-labile organic matter, i.e requiring transformations to be consumed by prokaryotes, is highly related to terrestrial connectivity. The only ecosystems that did not follow these patterns were in a phytoplankton bloom pe-riod and had a high proportion of labile and semi-labile organic matter as their counterparts at equilibrium. Finally, we estimated that semi-labile organic matter could sustain 62% of prokaryotic biomass in lakes and coastal zones. Second, we evaluated the inﬂuence of DOM on prokaryotic metabolism and community composition. In order to determine organic matter composition, prokaryotic community composition and metabolic rates, we did three oceanic cruises in the Labrador Sea onboard the Hudson ship. By using spatial abundance distribution modelling of prokaryotes, we identiﬁed strong associations between groups of this novel approach and organic matter composition. We also proposed a framework to bridge the gap between prokaryotic diversity, microbial ecology, and biogeochemistry among methods and across scales. Lastly, we compared how prokaryotic communities from diﬀerent oceanic strata could se-quester carbon. When they consume organic matter, prokaryotes release a small amount in recalcitrant forms. Through this iterative process, called the microbial carbon pump, prokaryotes contribute to carbon sequestration by creating highly recalcitrant compounds that resist further degradation for hundreds of years. We have shown that all prokaryotes enable the microbial carbon pump, but that prokaryotes from deeper strata are more eﬃ-cient. Our results also conclusively show that the rare prokaryotic taxa are key players in the microbial carbon pump. This thesis contributes to better understand the carbon cycle in the Labrador Sea and in all aquatic ecosystems. We proposed a novel framework to relate biogeochemistry, prokaryotic diversity and microbial ecology which has been a challenge for decades. Moreover, we con-clusively showed for the ﬁrst time that the iterative process of the microbial carbon pump is related to prokaryotic succession. We also show that it happens in all oceanic strata, but that rare prokaryotes from the deep ocean are more eﬃcient to sequester carbon. Better understanding how DOM composition inﬂuences prokaryotes is of prime importance as they are the main drivers of the oceanic carbon cycle.

There is little information on the factors promoting or aggravating diabetes management. This research aims to evaluate the dietary practices of diabetics and their nutritional management by health professionals in Benin. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 252 diabetics aged 18 years and older followed at the Centre National Hospitalier Universitaire (CNHU) and the Cotonou insulin bank. Questionnaires, 24-hour recalls and glycated hemoglobin measurements were collected among the diabetics. Semi-directed interviews were also conducted with 18 health professionals. Statistical analyses were used to test for associations between dietary practices and diabetes management, and an analytical grid was used to qualify their nutritional management by health professionals. Overall, individuals monitored at the CNHU managed their diabetes better than those at the insulin bank. There is a significant difference in diabetes management by age and occupation. Dietary practices are mainly based on home-cooking, but dishes suffer from diversity. Few diabetics have good management of their diabetes and they receive poor nutritional management that varies from one diabetes centre to another. This study highlights the need to better study the dietary practices of diabetics, to standardize nutritional care and to recruit nutritionists in the diabetes services in Benin.

181	Modulation de l'activité du récepteur aux acides biliaires FXRa par les récepteurs de la famille EGFR/ErbB	Bile acids are natural components of the gastrointestinal tract. An increase of bile acid levels in the intestine is associated with the carcinogenesis of the digestive system. Bile acid homeostasis is maintained by the nuclear receptor FXRα which regulates the expression of specific genes involved in metabolism such as SHP, FGF19 and CYP-7A1. In this way, FXRα acts as a transcription factor following bile acids binding, allowing its transcriptional activation. On the other hand, several studies established the central role of FXRα activation in liver carcinogenesis. EGFR/ErbB receptors are a family of tyrosine kinase receptors that can be regulated by bile acids. Overexpression of EGFR/ErbB receptors is associated with several cancers. Thus, the project aims to examine the impact of EGFR/ErbB receptors signaling on FXR transcriptional potential. We identify that EGFR/ErbB activation by their ligands HRG and EGF and by the expression of the constitutively active mutant ErbB2-V659E inhibits FXR transcriptional activity and expression of its target genes in liver cells. We demonstrate that this process is dependent on the MAPK signaling pathway. We also show that FXR activation decreases proliferation of liver cancer cells while activation of ErbB2 increases this cellular response. Thus, this study identifies a new mechanism of the deleterious impact of EGFR/ErbB receptors overactivation on liver cancer cells proliferation, involving the inhibition of the transcriptional potential of the bile acid receptor FXRα.

182	Établissement d’un nouveau modèle de souris pour étudier les cellules valvulaires interstitielles : ADAMTS19-Cre-ert2	BACKGROUND: Valvular heart disease (VHD) occurs in ~2% of the general population, often resulting in reduced or disturbed blood flow. We recently identified two unrelated families with recessive inheritance patterns of progressive polyvalvular heart disease in absence of any clear syndromic phenotype. Exome sequencing revealed homozygous, rare, loss of function (LOF) alleles in both families for the gene ADAMTS19. The relation between ADAMTS19 mutation and aortic stenosis were confirm via an ADAMTS19-LacZ KO/KO mouse model. This model also shows that ADAMTS19 is specific of VICs during valve development. The ADAMTS protein family includes 19 proteases that are involved in matrix remodeling, and tissue homeostasis in development and disease. However, the role of ADAMTS19 specifically during valve development remains unknown. We aim to characterize ADAMTS19 expression using a BAC transgenic ADMTS19-CRERT2 mouse. HYPOTHESE/OBJECTIVE We hypothesize that the BAC used to make the ADMTS19-CRERT2 mouse contains all the regulatory elements to express it and also that its expression will be specific to the VICs. The objective is to establish the ADAMTS19- CREERT2 and therefore to create a new tool to study VICs in vivo. METHODS/RESULTS: In silico analysis of the human and mouse ADAMTS19 genomic regions showed a high level of conservation. Thus, to analyze ADAMTS19 expression patterns during mouse development, we obtained a BAC transgenic mouse model containing a tamoxifen inducible Cre (CreERT2) that is expressed under the influence of the human ADAMTS19 promoter and surrounding genomic region. We crossed males from several lines created in parallel with Rosa-tdTomato reporter females to generate offspring in which expression of the fluorescent tdTomato reporter is activated in ADAMTS19-expressing cells upon tamoxifen administration. Surprisingly, whole mount imaging of embryos induced at E13.5 and isolated at E16.5 revealed strong, but distinct labelling patterns in offspring from different ADAMTS19CreERT2 sublines. Whereas one line exclusively labelled VICs, consistent with ADAMTS19 in situ RNA expression data from the Eurexpress database, another line specifically labelled cells in atrial and ventricular, but not VICs. A third line seems to label only a subset of cells in the pulmonary artery. Labeling of ADAMTS19-positive VICs is consistent with ADAMTS19 affecting valve development and VHD. In addition, we observed exclusive ADAMTS19-dependent labelling in atrial and ventricular cells or in a subset of pulmonary artery cells in two different sublines. CONCLUSION: The distinct expression patterns in offspring from different ADAMTS19-Cre-ERT2 lines indicates that although regulation of ADAMTS19 is conserved between human and mouse, expression in VICs versus other cells may be dependent on mutually exclusive regulatory mechanisms.

183	An RNAi screen to identify factors that control the binding of polycomb group proteins to the chromatin across the cell cycle	A critical part of cell identity is the establishment and maintenance of gene expression patterns. Polycomb group proteins (PcG) act on chromatin to maintain gene repression through cell cycles (epigenetically). However, during mitosis, chromatin structure is greatly altered by transcription repression, chromatin condensation, and the release of many transcription factors. A question then arises: how can PcG proteins maintain their function through mitosis? During interphase, PcG proteins are bound to their chromatin targets. During mitosis, most PcG proteins are released from chromatin, but a small fraction remains bound to chromatin. According to the mitotic bookmarking hypothesis, this fraction acts as a set of markers to guide the recruitment of PcG proteins at the end of mitosis to maintain the gene expression profile. However, we do not know how this recruitment takes place, nor do we know how a fraction of PcG proteins is retained on chromatin. To address these questions, an RNAi screen was established to identify factors that control the binding of PcG proteins to chromatin across the cell cycle. Although a confirmation is necessary, factors identified from interphase cells were enriched in proteins co-purifying with the tested PcG protein and in helicases while mitosis specific factors were enriched in Trithorax group (TrxG) protein related candidates.

184	The right to privacy through the development of smart technologies : how our personal health data is affected	The evolution of technology, notwithstanding its benefits, can negatively impact some of our fundamental rights as it develops faster than the latter. Indeed, this thesis aims to meet challenges generated by smart technologies and the impact they can have on the health of communities as well as on our fundamental rights. This thesis focuses on the legal constraints, present and to come, including the right to privacy, through the development and use of smart technologies that seize our personal health information. More specifically, this work seeks to analyze whether the benefits of accessing our information through smart technologies to improve the health and safety of populations outweigh the legal consequences. This work explores the potential of smart technologies, the interest in using them individually and collectively, especially in the public health sector, and the human rights violations their use can generate. Moreover, it looks at technological innovations that help improve State health systems to be able to better respond to future epidemics, particularly at the international level, such as at the WHO. These data, followed by other possible complications due to the increased use of intelligent technologies that restrict our privacy, will allow us to conclude whether such an intrusion in our right to privacy can be justified in a free and democratic society. Finally, this work examines the limits of the social acceptability of the invasion of privacy in exchange for better health conditions so that States and supra-State bodies can make informed decisions, without violating constitutional rights. This work will help us understand the issues that our judicial system will inevitably face while proposing strategies for the prevention of diseases and other health problems through the use of smart technologies. One of the main proposed solutions is the creation of a national and international database at the WHO generated by the data of smart health devices.

185	Regards et perspectives sur l'arbitrage conventionnel au Québec	The Quebec Consensual Arbitration Law has been punctuated by various reforms from 1965 until now. The most significant legislative intervention was the Arbitration Act of 1986, which was strongly inspired from the UNCITRAL Model Law of 1985. Before this reform, the arbitration procedure of the Code of Civil Procedure was not very substantiated. At the time, this lack of accuracy resulted in a reluctant practice. Then, judges and legislators have consistently shown a favourable position to arbitration. The main developments in arbitration have highlighted the reasons why this mode for resolving disputes has been maintained over the years in the Code of Civil Procedure. Arbitration was even enshrined as part of the last reform the Code of Civil Procedure of 2016 as being a private justice, set up at the same level as the state justice. The achievements of the 1986 Act have been kept and supplemented. The codification of the objectives of civil procedure, of the guiding principles and the insertion of new procedural provisions applicable in arbitral and judicial matters, offers contributions and perspectives to be exploited, both for the arbitration process and for the after-award. The guidelines contribute to reinforce the adequacy of the arbitration procedure. As for the post-award, it is a question of dissuading the requests for annulment of the arbitral decisions that are dilatory or abusive, and of limiting substantial breaches of the procedure, in order to reduce the waiting times for execution of the arbitral awards.

186	La non-prolifération et le désarmement des armes nucléaires en droit international et le mécanisme de retrait des traités internationaux	Nuclear weapons, the apex of weapons of mass destruction, are unique in the facet that they have an unprecedented potential for destruction, as well as in the fact that nuclear strikes are indiscriminate. This type of weapon, which represents a real threat to humanity, must be regulated by a strong and complete international conventional regimen of non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament. Nonetheless, the latter suffers from deficiencies.  This master’s thesis focuses on the withdrawal mechanism found in this international legal field. The spotlight is more specifically directed on its cornerstone treaty, the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons of 1968 (NPT), and on the New Start Treaty of 2010, the only agreement which regulates the nuclear stockpiles of the nuclear superpowers, Russia and the United States of America. The analysis is enhanced by the study of the 2003 North-Korean withdrawal from the NPT and of the principles introduced by the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 1969.  A rather soft withdrawal mechanism, which relies largely on the discretion of the State party, is revealed, despite the threat to international peace and security a decision to withdraw represents. This deficiency, paired with inexistent follow-up measures, leaves the international community facing a highly dangerous situation.  The examination of the more substantiated withdrawal mechanism found in the European Union’s body of law, as illustrated by the Brexit, allows us to suggest possible solutions to strengthen the NPT withdrawal mechanism as well as potential follow-up measures to be implemented following the withdrawal of a State party.	nuclear weapon , nuclear non-proliferation , disarmament , international law , withdrawal mechanism , armes de destruction massive , weapons of mass destruction , Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons , European Union , Brexit , safeguards agreement	en	24448.0
187	Le respect du droit à la santé : analyse à partir du droit international de la personne et d'une comparaison entre les constitutions du Canada et du Brésil	The right to health is a well-established right in International Law. Many international treaties such as the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) and the Constitution of the World Health Organization, create a legal obligation on States who have ratified these instruments to protect and ensure the right to health. This thesis aims to examine the right to health in the international law and its application in domestic law by the Constitutions of Canada and Brazil. The first chapter of this thesis explores the meaning, the scope and the limits of the right to health in the international legal order. In the second chapter, we analyze the national Constitution of these two countries. We have concluded that the Canadian Constitution does not explicitly address the right to health. However, articles 7 and 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which ensure the right to life as well as the right to liberty and to non-discrimination, allow for the interpretation of the courts to guarantee the right to health. On the contrary, the Brazilian Constitution of 1988 has dedicated a whole section to Economics, Social and Cultural rights. Among these rights, the right to health is a very important right in the Brazilian Constitution as articles 196 to 200 ensure the right to health. Finally, through the case analysis of Canada and Brazil, this thesis shows that a constitutional provision on the right to health demonstrates a commitment on the part of the State to fulfill its obligations with respect to the international right to health. However, other strategies to implement this right can also be considered by the States, such as the use of international legal instruments as a source of interpretation.

188	Analyse de la variabilité de la fréquence cardiaque chez les femmes enceintes atteintes d'apnée obstructive du sommeil	Purpose: Sleep breathing disorders are common during pregnancy and are associated with adverse consequences for the health of the mother and the fetus. These can be caused by changes in sympatho-vagal balance (SVB), which can be estimated through heart rate variability (HRV) analyses. The aim of the study is to assess the HRV in pregnant women with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) at three time points. Methods: Seventeen pregnant women diagnosed with mild to moderate OSA performed 3 polysomnographic recordings (PSG): in the second trimester (PSG1), in the third trimester treated with a titrated oral appliance (OA) (PSG2) and 3-6 months post-partum. Data were analyzed in cumulative 5 minutes baseline interval samples (Baseline) and in cumulative 3 minutes interval samples before the onset of the OSA events (Event) for each sleep stages (NREM2, NREM3, REM) over the course of the night. Results: SVB (Low-/High-Frequency power ratio) was statistically significant for all cumulative PSGs per samples (Baseline sleep stages p < 0.01 and Event sleep stages p < 0.01 ; REM > NREM2 > NREM3). Significant diminution of apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) was observed at PSG2 (PSG1 vs PSG2; p < 0,01). In post hoc analysis, at PSG2 only, Event parasympathetic activity (Normalized High-Frequency % (Normalized HF %)) decreases significantly in NREM2 (p = 0.01) and NREM3 (p < 0.01) when compared to respective Baseline Normalized HF %. Conclusions: Results suggest normal shifts in SVB across sleep stages. Although AHI is reduced with the treatment of OA during pregnancy, the influence of the autonomic nervous system on respiratory events seems to remain mild.

189	Les facteurs influençant l’intégration socioscolaire des adolescents immigrants nouvellement arrivés à Sherbrooke du point de vue d’intervenants socioscolaires	Immigrant teenagers who just arrived in Quebec, even though they form a diverse group, live upheavals, losses and adventures related to their immigration. As they must integrate the school system upon their arrival while adapting to new cultural referents, the socio-educational integration of immigrant teens has an impact in their migration process. Schools must offer a structure of reception to encourage them to adapt to Quebec’s socio-cultural life. Various factors can influence positively or negatively immigrant teenagers in their integration process. This qualitative research aims to identify the factors that promote and those that negatively affect the socio-educational integration of immigrant teenagers newly arrived in Sherbrooke, a city that has been through transformations for several years in terms of immigration. It takes into account the experiences and the findings of the school staff. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews with seven professionals from the education system, with different status, who work with immigrant teenagers in the public high schools of Sherbrooke. The theoretical framework, related to the ecological perspective and used in tandem with the structural approach, was used in the qualitative analysis of the data collected. The results of this research shed light on the factors that facilitate and factors that negatively affect the socio-educational integration of immigrant teenagers. These factors of opportunity and risk are related to the individual himself, his family, his peers, his school as well as the structures at play in the process.	immigration , Sherbrooke , socio-educational integration , teens , high school , school staff	en	24427.0
190	L’influence de l’utilisation du territoire et des structures géomorphologiques sur la rétention d’azote, de phosphore et de carbone des ruisseaux	Streams are important sites of elemental transformations due to the relatively high contact rates between flowing water and biogeochemically reactive sediments. Increased urbanization typically results in higher nutrient and carbon (C) inputs to streams from their watersheds and increased flow rates due to modification in channel form, reducing within stream net retention and increasing downstream exports. However, less is known on how moderate urbanization might influence the joint processing of C, nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) in streams or the relative influence of changes in watershed and stream features on their fluxes. In this study, we performed mass-balances of different C, N, and P species in multiple reaches with contrasting land use land cover and geomorphic features (pools, riffles, runs) to determine the effects of geomorphology versus human influence on elemental fluxes in a pristine and a semi-urban stream. N was the most responsive of all elements, where nitrate concentrations were 3.5-fold higher in the peri-urban stream. Dissolved organic carbon was only slightly higher in the peri-urban site whereas total P not significantly different between streams. In terms of fluxes, nitrate behaved differently between the streams with net retention occurring in the majority of the reaches of the pristine site, whereas net export was observed in all of the reaches of the semi-urban one. We found a decrease in nitrate concentrations with an increase in excess deuterium of the water (d-excess), an indicator of how overall water retention capacity of the watershed favored N loss. Within the stream, the presence of pools, and reduced channel slope, which also increase water retention time, again favored N loss. Overall, nitrate was the most sensitive nutrient to slight urbanization, where higher export to stream was influenced by land use, but where geomorphic features were more important in driving retention capacity.

191	Differential susceptibility to the environment and borderline personality disorder	Evolutionary models of psychopathology can shed light on gene-environment interactions. Differential susceptibility to the environment means that heritable traits can have positive or negative effects, depending on environmental context. Thus, traits that increase risk for mental disorders when the environment is negative can be adaptive when the environment is positive. This model can be applied to borderline personality disorder, with predictors such as emotional dysregulation and impulsivity seen as temperamental variations leading to negative effects in an unfavorable environment but to positive effects in a favorable environment. This model may also be useful in conceptualizing the mechanisms of effective therapy for borderline personality disorder.

Although  negative interpretation biases are a fundamental element of cognitive models of depression, few  studies have examined the specific biases in information processing, mainly the hostile  attribution bias, found in hostile individuals who present depressive symptoms. Method: Using  pre-collected data from a sample of 72 (male=41,6%, female=58,3%) undergraduate and  community-based hostile (n=26) and non-hostile (n=46) adult participants, the authors aimed to  examine the association between depression and the hostile attribution bias by determining  whether depression level scores were uniquely related to electrophysiological measures of the  hostile attribution bias. Results: The hostile group showed higher measured levels of depression  and reactive aggression, compared to the non-hostile group. Also, depression scores were  significant predictors of the N400 effect in the non-hostile condition, while reactive aggression  was not, whereas in the hostile condition, the overall model was significant, with depression and  reactive aggression levels both showing strong trends towards significance. Limitations: A small  sample size limited the scope of our conclusions. Also, sample selection prevented the authors  from examining specific group differences regarding the hostile attribution bias in depressed and  non-depressed groups. Conclusion: This study highlights the importance of better understanding  the perception mechanisms that are associated with depression and to consider the application of  cognitive restructuring techniques to counter biased interpretation processes in settings where  depression and aggression intersect. This study also suggests that alternatives to self-evaluative  methodologies might be more useful when assessing automatic and implicit processes.

193	Exploration de l’expérience du deuil parental : une étude rétrospective auprès de parents dont l’enfant est décédé d’un cancer au CHU Sainte-Justine	Objectives: For parents, grieving the loss of a child from cancer is a complex and painful journey for which we do not understand all the issues, in particular, what influences psychological health and long-term quality of life and more specifically the situation of fathers. This study was conducted with parents two to twenty years after the death of their child. The objectives are 1/ to describe the quality of life, psychological distress, and bereavement symptoms of bereaved parents, 2/ to explore the influence of gender and time since death on psychological health test results, and 3/ to identify predictors of parents' current psychological health. Methods: A retrospective quantitative analysis carried out was conducted with 32 mothers and 14 fathers of children who died of cancer at Sainte-Justine UHC between 2000 and 2016 were recruited and completed a self-reported online questionnaire using Medical Outcomes Study Short Form (SF-12), Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI-18) and Inventory of Complicated Grief (ICG-19). Results: Parents’ symptoms of grief continue to be very present, even up to 18 years after death (58%). Mostly mothers recall very significant symptoms of grief. They report a significant change between the first year after death and now which is less true for fathers. Finally, the predictors of Quality of Life and distress provide us with information on vulnerability patterns: being a father, having high symptoms of grief, and short time elapsed since death. Conclusion: Understanding the differences between fathers’ and mothers’ grief is important for health professionals to better support both bereaved parents efficiently. The results suggest that a follow-up of bereaved parents is needed, even long after the death of their child.

194	La dynamique spatio-temporelle de l'attention dans la lecture	A vast number of studies examining the cognitive and neurobiological aspects of reading have been conducted in the past decades. However, the strategy underlying expert word identification and the way visuospatial attention is deployed across time and space remains unknown. The study from Blais et al. (2009) offered a significant advance to our knowledge in this regard. The present study extends this initial investigation by using a protocol which can specify how visual information is extracted in space and time during visual word recognition in neurotypical readers.  16 students were tested using an adaptation of the « Bubbles » technique. Participants read five-letter French words exposed for 200 ms and sampled in space-time by random signal-to-noise ratio  (SNR) variations which were independent for each letter position. Participants first completed a 150-trial practice session during which the maximum allowable SNR was adjusted in order to maintain accuracy at about 51% correct. Then, four experimental blocks of 150 trials each were completed. This was followed by a 75-trial practice block to readjust the maximum allowable SNR. Finally, four additional blocks of 150 experimental trials each were conducted.  Data analyses examined how the temporally varying signal/noise determined the response accuracy of participants. Classification images in the temporal domain were constructed for each participant by subtracting the weighted sum of the temporal profiles of signal/noise ratios of incorrect trials from those associated with correct responses. We also constructed classification images in the time-frequency domain which indicate the contribution of particular frequencies as a function of time to processing effectiveness. Individual classification images were transformed into Z scores to put them on the same scale, thereby allowing the calculation of group means. Statistical significance was determined by the application of the Pixel test.  The results suggest a serial processing of letter extraction information in which the order of letters is a function of the diagnostic value of that letter for word identification. These observations are inconsistent with a parallel processing model, which is the generally accepted account for the invariant latency of expert visual word recognition as a function of word length. These would seem to indicate a serial processing of letters within which several joint letters are still possible. The absence of word length effect in the serial processing would be explained by the number of letters (and/or the number of attention attachments required) which remains constant whatever the length of the word. However, this hypothesis still need to be substantiated by testing this protocol on words of different lengths.	attention , reading , visuospatial , parallel , serial , processing , word , length , effect	en	24388.0
195	Contraintes sur les diquarks scalaires à partir des processus à haute énergie	The Standard Model of particle physics explains with great success how fundamental particles interact. However, this model cannot explain some contemporary challenges of the domain, such as the large number of free parameters, the hierarchy problem or the identity of dark matter. To explain these phenomena, we need to search for physics beyond the Standard Model. In order to satisfy the existing constraints from experimental measurements, we can consider the addition of a single new particle to the Standard Model that couples to two quarks, a diquark. Its contribution to hadronic processes offers an opportunity to set limits on its parameters from contemporary experimental data. This would allow us to evaluate their potential and identify processes to which they can contribute. Among the possible diquark states, we find the scalar diquarks Dᵘ and Dᵈ, which have an antisymmetric coupling to pairs of right-handed up-type or down-type quarks, respectively. To obtain constraints on their mass Mᴰ and on their couplings to quarks (x^q, y^q), where q = u, d, is the main goal of this work. In order to do so, we start by considering direct searches in the production of dijet, the experimental signature of the decay of these particles. Afterwards, we probe the indirect influence of the Dᵘ diquark to the experimental measurements of the single-top-production cross section. Recent data for both of these processes from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is used to compare the theoretical predictions of these models and quantify their viability by providing new constraints on its parameters. We are able to improve the constraints found in the literature from |xᵘ| ≤ 14.4 to |xᵘ| ≤ 0.13–0.15 for Dᵘ and from |xᵈyᵈ| ≤ 0.022 to |yᵈ| ≤ 0.17 to |xᵈ| ≤ 0.15–0.17 for Dᵈ, both with masses of Mᴰ = 600 GeV. Other than that, the analysis of the data from single top production shows that the reduction of the pᵀ space can further improve these constraints.

196	Analyse SAXS de traces ioniques causées par bombardements d’ions d’or dans des échantillons de silicium amorphe	The following thesis aims to verify whether the formation of latent traces by heavy and fast ions passes through a liquid phase. Given the fact that the process of trace formation is too fast to be directly studied, our experience aims to measure after the fact elements that would be indicative of a merger. In this context, we will study whether there has been a redistribution of gold ions (initially present by doping in amorphous silicon samples) following the irradiation of the samples. This redistribution of gold could be explained by the phenomenon of refining the melted zone, which would occur during a rise in temperature during the creation of latent ionic traces predicted by the theoretical model of the thermal peak.  The samples studied are amorphous silicon membranes of 2 µm in thickness, doped with gold at different percentages (pure, medium and high) and irradiated with fast heavy ions of gold at 1.1 GeV or silver at 75 MeV.  No SAXS image was able to reveal the presence of latent ionic traces for samples irradiated with silver ions at 75 MeV. Although the stopping power of the latter is low (9.5 keV/nm), it exceeds the threshold observed for several other phenomena associated with traces. [2] [3] We would therefore have found a regime where there are effects of heavy and fast ions, but without a visible signature in SAXS.  In contrast, irradiated samples of gold ions demonstrated the presence of latent ionic traces via SAXS images. These images demonstrate a diffusion pattern characteristic of core-shell type traces. However, these results do not show differences in gold segregation according to the initial doping level. All samples (pure, medium and high doping) have a core radius of (2.5 ± 0.1) nm and a total radius of (9.9 ± 0.5) nm, which are values similar to those obtained in the literature. [4] On the other hand, the absence of a difference according to the doping could be explained by the fact that the resolidification after the fusion would be too fast, to the point where the gold would undergo solute trapping which would prevent the segregation. Another possible explanation would be that there would be no fusion at all during the formation of the trace.  First of all, this thesis deals with all the steps necessary for the design of the samples, namely their amorphization, the implantation of gold impurities, then the irradiation. Two categories of samples are discussed: the validation samples, then the actual samples that were studied. Subsequently, this thesis addresses the detection of latent ion traces, first with an AFM (which proved to be insufficient), then with SAXS measurements. Finally, a theoretical code to reproduce the experimental measurements obtained was developed based on the literature. It generates promising numerical results compared to the experimental data obtained.	HF , or , SAXS , form factor , gold , latent ion track , zone reﬁning , Amorphous silicon	en	24367.0
197	La prostitution : une mesure de la marchandisation de la personne?	This paper aims to explore the normative assumptions underlying the conceptualization of prostitution as a measure of the commodification of the person. I propose to question some of the theoretical assumptions underlying the conceptualization of prostitution as a form of commodification of the person. Insofar as prostitution is distinguished from other activities on the basis of this symbolic status, my research consists in questioning the theoretical bases of this normative characterization. Feminist literature on the subject of prostitution focuses on the issue of the criminalization of prostitution and its social stigmatization, but it is not reduced to a polarized debate between abolitionists and regulationists. I will first identify how the subject of prostitution has been problematized from different theoretical frameworks and present epistemic perspectives on the conceptualization of the problem of prostitution. I will then identify and analyze the normative paradigms that historically constitute prostitution as the measure of women objectification. Finally, I will focus on Carole Pateman’s definition of prostitution in The Sexual Contract. My aim is to identify in which extent the conceptualization of the prostitution contract as the symbol of body commodification is relevant to understand the power dynamics underlying this type of agreement. More specifically, I will study the normative assumptions underlying the distinction between the prostitution contract and other contractual forms of subjection.	prostitution , domination , Pateman , feminism , body commodification , Pateman , power relations , contract , sex work	en	24352.0
198	A game theoretical model for a collaborative e-learning platform on privacy awareness	Nowadays, with the increasing use of digital technologies, especially for teenagers, privacy education plays an important role in their lives. While several e-learning platforms for privacy awareness training have been implemented, they are typically based on traditional learning techniques. In particular, these platforms do not allow students to cooperate and share knowledge with each other in order to achieve mutual benefits and improve learning outcomes.  In other words, they lack student-student interaction. Recent research on learning methods shows that the collaboration among students can result in better learning outcomes compared to other learning approaches.  Motivated by the above-mentioned facts, and since privacy domain is strongly linked to the social lives of teens, there is a pressing need for providing a collaborative learning platform for teaching privacy, and at the same time, allows students to share knowledge, interact with each other, solve quizzes collaboratively, and discuss privacy issues and situations.  For this purpose, this work proposes “Teens-online”, a collaborative e-learning platform for privacy awareness. The curriculum provided in this platform is based on the Personal Data Protection Competency Framework for School Students.  Moreover, the proposed platform is equipped with a partner-matching mechanism based on matching game theory. This mechanism guarantees a stable student-student matching according to a student's need (behavior and/or knowledge). Thus, mutual benefits will be attained by minimizing the chances of cooperating with incompatible students.  Experimental results show that the average learning-related utility obtained by applying the proposed partner-matching algorithm is much higher than the average utility obtained using other matching mechanisms. The results also suggest that by adopting the proposed approach, each student can be paired with their optimal partners, which in turn helps them reach their highest learning outcomes.

199	Méta-enseignement : génération active d’exemples par apprentissage par renforcement	The motivating application behind this architecture is a discrete optimisation problem whose solution we aim to predict using neural networks. A main challenge of solving this problem by machine learning lies in the high (and variable) labelling cost associated to the various instances, which leads to an expensive and difficult dataset generation. We propose an active learning architecture, called meta-teaching, to address this problem. We show how we combine several models to solve the active learning problem, formulated as a metalearning problem, by using a reinforcement learning agent to actively generate new instances. Therefore, we use concepts from various areas of machine learning, including supervised learning, active learning, reinforcement learning and recurrent networks. In this exploratory work, we evaluate our method on a simpler problem, which is to classify poker hands in 10 predefined classes. We test our architecture on this toy dataset in order to simplify the analysis. Unfortunately, we do not achieve a significant advantage using our active generation architecture on this dataset. We outline avenues for further reflections, including the definition of the reward function. In future projects, using a more similar problem to our problem of interest having, among others, a variable labelling cost, would be interesting.

Since this subject unifies two areas of research, we explain each field for people working in the other domain. Consequently, we begin by introducing quantum computing and quantum circuits to machine learning specialists, followed by an introduction of machine learning to quantum computing specialists. To give context and motivate our results we then give a light literature review on quantum machine learning. After this, we present our model, its algorithms and its variants, then discuss our currently achieved empirical results. Finally, we criticize our models by giving extensions and future work directions. These last two parts are our main results. They can be found in chapter 4 and 5 respectively.

201	Towards better understanding and improving optimization in recurrent neural networks	Recurrent neural networks (RNN) are known for their notorious exploding and vanishing gradient problem (EVGP). This problem becomes more evident in tasks where the information needed to correctly solve them exist over long time scales, because it prevents important gradient components from being back-propagated adequately over a large number of steps. The papers written in this work formalizes gradient propagation in parametric and semi-parametric RNNs to gain a better understanding towards the source of this problem. The first paper introduces a simple stochastic algorithm (h-detach) that is specific to LSTM optimization and targeted towards addressing the EVGP problem. Using this we show significant improvements over vanilla LSTM in terms of convergence speed, robustness to seed and learning rate, and generalization on various benchmark datasets. The next paper focuses on semi-parametric RNNs and self-attentive networks. Self-attention provides a way by which a system can dynamically access past states (stored in memory) which helps in mitigating vanishing of gradients. Although useful, it is difficult to scale as the size of the computational graph grows quadratically with the number of time steps involved. In the paper we describe a relevancy screening mechanism, inspired by the cognitive process of memory consolidation, that allows for a scalable use of sparse self-attention with recurrence while ensuring good gradient propagation.

202	Impact d'un service de liaison pour fractures sur des issues cliniques et d'adhésion au traitement, incluant une analyse économique des trajectoires de soins	Introduction. Osteoporosis is an asymptomatic chronic disease until the development of osteoporosis-related fractures. Furthermore, the occurrence of a previous fragility fracture strongly increases the risk of subsequent fractures. Given the current suboptimal management of fragility fractures in usual clinical practice, several secondary fracture prevention strategies have been studied. However, continuous access to care is typically not central to these interventions as they mostly involve only one visit to a specialized healthcare professional. Objectives. This thesis had four main objectives derived from research questions focusing on the implementation of a high-intensity Fracture Liaison Service (FLS) with a systematic follow-up of two years. The first objective was to measure the performance of the intervention using key indicators. The second objective was to report on the utilization patterns of osteoporosis drugs. The third objective was to identify trajectories of compliance to follow-up care. The last objective was to evaluate the economic impact of trajectory groups of compliance to follow-up care with respect to usual care. Methodology. An FLS intervention called the Lucky BoneTM Program was approved as a prospective cohort study and implemented in two hospital-based outpatient orthopedic clinics. The intervention encompassed four components: 1) the identification of fragility fractures in women and men aged 40 years or older, 2) the investigation for bone fragility, 3) the initiation of treatment, 4) the integration of patients to a two-year systematic follow-up. Both clinical and administrative data were collected prospectively and retrospectively to measure the impact of the intervention. The first component of this thesis reported on the performance of the FLS. A cohort study design allowed for the measuring of key performance indicators (KPIs) such as the rates of bone mineral density (BMD) investigation, treatment initiation, and follow-up participation over two years, as well as the incidence rate of subsequent fragility fractures. A secondary outcome was to longitudinally measure the change in bone biomarker levels and questionnaire scores using mixed-effect models. The second component of this work aimed to measure patterns of osteoporosis drug use with a cohort study design by reporting 1 and 2-year persistence rates and compliance levels (compliance being defined as a proportion of days covered (PDC) > 0.8). The third component of this thesis consisted in the identification of trajectory groups of compliance to follow-up care using group-based trajectory modelling (GBTM). The fourth and final component iv of this thesis was a cost-utility analysis using Markov decision analytic models to evaluate the economic impact of trajectory groups of compliance to follow-up care with respect to a usual care in a simulated cohort. Results. Of the 532 fragility fracture patients that provided informed consent, 85.7% were female and the mean age was 63±11 years. First component: The FLS intervention yielded the following KPIs: BMD results were collected in almost 86% upon ordinance in the FLS, a prescription for anti-osteoporosis therapy was handed to > 86% of participants, 83.6% of subjects attended at least one follow-up visit (22.2% attended all visits) over two years, and the subsequent fracture incidence rate was of 2.6 per 100 person-years. Biomarker levels significantly decreased after six months in the FLS, supporting the inhibition of bone resorption induced by therapy. Questionnaire scores showed significant improvement of functional capacity over time (14%-64%). Second component: The one and two-year persistence rates were 66.4% and 55.6%, respectively. The proportions of patients with a one and two-year PDC > 0.8 were 64.2% and 62.5%, respectively. Third component: Through GBTM, three follow-up compliance trajectory groups were identified and consisted of high followers (HF, 48.4%), intermediate followers (IF, 28.1%) and low followers (LF, 23.5%). Fourth component: The incremental cost-utility ratios of the HF, IF and LF trajectory groups relative to usual care were $3,600, $22,000 and $74,000 per quality-adjusted life year gained, respectively. Conclusions. A high-intensity FLS intervention with a systematic follow-up of fragility fracture patients allowed ongoing access to care over a two-year period. This resulted in high rates of investigation and treatment initiation, a low subsequent fracture rate, but follow-up participation could be improved over two years. More than half of the patients were persistent and compliant to therapy after two years. Almost half the cohort had a high compliance to follow-up care trajectory and this behaviour was found to be very cost-effective compared to usual care. The main limitation of this research program was the lack of a control group to assess effectiveness. A large pragmatic randomized controlled trial is needed to support these results. Further research should focus on understanding behaviours related to compliance to care using patient-centered outcomes, especially considering the high risk of fractures over time.

203	Activity monitor placed at the non-paretic ankle is accurate in measuring step counts during community walking in post-stroke individuals : a validation study	Background: Different environmental factors may affect the accuracy of step-count activity monitors (AM). However, the validationconditions for AM accuracy largely differ from ecological environments.Objectives: To assess and compare the accuracy of AM in counting steps among poststroke individuals: during different locomotortasks, with AM placed at the nonparetic ankle or hip, and when walking in a laboratory or inside a mall.Design: Validation study.Settings: Laboratory and community settings.Participants: Twenty persons with chronic hemiparesis, independent walkers.Methods: First session: participants performed level walking (6-minute walk test [6MWT]), ramps, and stairs in the laboratory withAM placed at the nonparetic ankle and hip. Second session: participants walked a mall circuit, including the three tasks, with AMplaced at the nonparetic ankle. The sessions were video recorded.Main Outcome Measurements: Absolute difference between the steps counted by AM and the steps viewed on the video recordings(errors, %); occurrence of errors greater than 10%.Results: Median errors were similar for the 6MWT (0.86 [0.22, 7.70]%), ramps (2.17 [0.89, 9.61]%), and stairs (8.33 [2.65, 19.22]%)with AM at the ankle. Step-count error was lower when AM was placed at the ankle (8.33 [ 2.65, 19.22]%) than at the hip (9.26[3.25, 42.63]%, P = .03). The greatest errors were observed among the slowest participants (≤0.4 m/s) on ramps and stairs, whereassome faster participants (>1 m/s) experienced the greatest error during the 6MWT. Median error was slightly increased in the mallcircuit (2.67 [0.61, 12.54]%) compared with the 6MWT (0.50 [0.24, 6.79]%, P = .04), with more participants showing errors >10% dur-ing the circuit (7 vs 2, P = .05).Conclusions: Step counts are accurately measured with AM placed at the nonparetic ankle in laboratory and community settings.Accuracy can be altered by stairs and ramps among the slowest walkers and by prolonged walking tasks among faster walkers.Level of Evidence: III .		en	24243.0
204	« On se réapproprie le quartier ! » Le rôle des initiatives alimentaires communautaires dans l’affirmation du droit à la ville	This thesis explores the role of community food initiatives in the expression of the right to the city, as envisioned by Henri Lefebvre in 1968. We conducted a case study on Notre Quartier Nourricier (NQN) (Centre-Sud, Montreal) to verify if this project, articulated around the right to food, allows participants to reclaim their neighbourhood and participate more in community life. Our data collection, based on 17 semi-structured interviews and more than 100 hours of observation, revealing that by seeking to recover a certain reward on the local food system, NQN creates heterotopic places articulated around food production, distribution and transformation. These places become the support of rich social relations, outside of capitalist values. The feeling of belonging to the neighbourhood is thus reinforced, even created, which produces, among the participants in NQN, a desire to take part in neighbourhood life. In our opinion, NQN is thus building a « habiter nourricier », which promotes a certain reappropriation of the conditions of urban life. This « habiter nourricier » makes it possible to collectively claim a greater right to the city. From a theoretical point of view, combining the right to food with the right to the city gives a holistic look at the urban condition – marked by alienation and woven with dispossession stories –, and highlights the common roots of urban hunger and the constant restructuring of the urban space: capitalism.

205	L'écriture de la post-mémoire dans La femme qui fuit d'Anaïs Barbeau-Lavalette, suivi de La cartographie de l'absence	This master’s thesis is subdivided in two components : an essay and a novel. The essay focuses on postmemory, a concept elaborated in relation to historical traumas, as intimate memorial structure. The research shifts from historical traumas to personal traumas by basing their similarity on their event nature. The novel Suzanne by Anaïs Barbeau- Lavalette underlines the importance of postmemory in familial trauma. This story, fictionalized by linking true artefacts, sheds light on postmemorial work and on the resignification of events orchestrated by the post-generation of a traumatic event. The creation section of this work tells the story of a hypochondriac narrator who suffered the loss of her mother to breast cancer in childhood. The main character seeks to recover the lost memories of her mother but can only remember her by means of her imagination – only the child narrator still possesses the true memories. However, as the young girl no longer exists in the present time, the quest stumbles. Through the search for her mother, the narrator mostly uncovers her father’s and her own ghosts. The creative work attempts to embody the postmemory theory while questioning its limits.	mémoire , filiation , survivance , Memory , Postmemory , Trauma , Quebec literature , History	en	24208.0
206	Entre historia y memoria : Días y noches de amor y de guerra y Memoria del fuego de Eduardo Galeano	This master's thesis is about two works that the Uruguayan writer Eduardo Galeano wrote with the aim of “revealing the past of Latin America as it happened” and, in this way, giving representativeness and visibility to the historical experiences of the Latin American collective. The first work, Días y noches de amor y de guerra (1978) remembers the military dictatorships of the Southern Cone of the 70s, as well as those significant experiences that he had throughout his life, including the memory of those subjects whom he interacted with. The second is, the trilogy Memoria del fuego (1982, 1984 and 1986) in which he recreates five centuries of history from experiences considered by the author as subaltern. In this study we try, through a detailed analysis of the subjects highlighted by Galeano, as well as the narrative resources used, to see how the writer approaches the historical events that he narrates, paying special attention to the use he makes of his memory as well as the archival sources consulted. We believe that his life experiences and the regional context of social unrest and dictatorships have influenced the narrative articulation of these texts, going beyond their historical character, becoming at the same time literary, political, and, above all, personal documents.

207	Le mouvement dans le langage : une représentation littéraire de l'indicible	This master’s thesis explores the narratives poetics of what in French is called the indicible – a noun that, in English translation, hovers between the “unsayable” (i.e., that for which there is no precise or prehensible language) and the “unspeakable” (i.e.; that which concerns affects that are not easily expressed). As a thematic or affective content that slides between the inexpressible and unexpressed, the indicible generates various literary architectures of indirect story-telling. The goal of this thesis is to illuminate these innovative signifying structures. Accordingly, the analytical project that unfolds here is a necessary movement beyond and beneath the literal thematics of the texts. Within a range of possible interpretations, the text will reveal something of its original conception, its traumatic mark or primal scene. Language as an artistic medium is the essential focus of this work – language, or discourse, as a matrix informed by Jacques Derrida’s model of Différance is, above all, a theory of the movement of narrative or expository language in time. The very movement of discourse around a thematic project – that of bearing witness, of conceptualizing desire, or of mapping identity – is itself generative of the unsayable. Ironically, language is at once the matrix of representation’s limits and incapacities, and the medium of its unveiling and illumination. This mémoire explores three distinct narrative examples of the unsayable by way of three radically different texts : trauma and its temporalities (W, of the memory of childhood, by George Perec), the image-structure of the affects (Froth on the Daydream, by Boris Vian), and the gendered metamorphosis of the self (Orlando: a biography, by Virginia Woolf). Although these narratives vary in form, subject, and thematic content, they collectively dismantle the linear sequence of events and the familiar contours of space; they deconstruct the referential certainties of language; and they point to the limitations of traditional narrative codes in the encounter with reality and the real.	indicible , trauma , affect , corps , Perec , Vian , Woolf , comparative literature , unspeakable , language , movement , trauma , affects , gender , bodies , pluralism	en	24190.0
208	Féminicide autochtone au Canada : représentations médiatiques d'une violence passée sous silence	This present master thesis focuses on the sociological phenomenon of violence affecting Aboriginal women in Canada, specifically what may be apprehended through an intersectional perspective on violence Aware that the silence surrounding this phenomenon is just as violent as the situation itself, this thesis proposes tools for understanding and reading that allow everyone to better understand the ins and outs of the manifestation of this violence.  This analysis explores how the invisibility of these women in society takes shape, how it is expressed, and what it reveals about the Quebec and Canadian society. It was decided to address our problem through the written press media and the production of mediatic and journalistic discourses, which often reveal a particular ideology and themselves reflect a society in general.  Using a corpus of 200 articles with different themes, and in light of certain concepts related to discourse analysis, the results of our data will allow us to discuss the influence of these mediatic and journalistic discourses, and better understand the government issues, particularly Aboriginal ones, facing the country today. We will thus see how media power can play a significant role in society and how indigenous women are increa singly becoming part of an empowerment movement, enabling them to deconstruct the social barriers in which they have long been partitioned.

209	Development and studies of electrochromic and electrofluorochromic organic materials	Organic electrochromic materials have been a hot area of research during the past decades. These compounds that respond to an applied potential with a color change are said to be electrochromic. Their interest is mainly because of the easy synthesis, convenient mass production, and eco-friendly preparation compared to their inorganic counterparts. Typically, these compounds change only their color with an applied potential. To develop compounds that change both their color and their fluorescence with a potential applied for use in electrofluorescent devices remains a major challenge. In this study, a series of compounds containing triphenylamine (TPA) and benzothiadiazole (BZT) were evaluated. They were coupled with different end groups to tune the photophysical and electrochemical properties. These compounds were fully characterized by absorption spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, spectroelectrochemistry, and X-ray diffraction along with other techniques. This allowed us to examine the influence of their structure on the properties. It also allowed us to identify the ideal compounds of interest for use in functioning devices. The devices containing TPA and BZT are ideally ‘smart window’ applications. This is due to the electrochemical activity by TPA as well as the solid state fluorescence of the BZT core. To further improve the properties of devices, a passive device was the ultimate goal. This is in contrast to active devices where a potential must be applied continuously for the induced color to be consistent. Towards this goal, cathodic layers were prepared and investigated in a device and their use as an ion reservoir in a passive electrochromic / electrofluorescent device was tested. Preliminary results, showed that anthraquinone derivatives had ideal properties for the cathodic layers.	Benzothiadiazole , Anthraquinone , Electrochromism , Triphenylamine , Smart Window	en	24157.0
210	Un espace pour la langue : les institutions religieuses et le maintien des langues d’héritage à Montréal	Language shift from heritage languages to dominant, national languages among immigrant communities has been an important object of study in the sociology of language (Fishman 2006, 1968). The institutionally stabilized and ideologically sanctioned hegemony of the national language inevitably affects the use of all other languages, including those of allophone immigrant communities. Heritage language programs attempt to stay language shift by explicit language instruction often itself focused on a standard variety of the heritage language. However, explicit language socialization does not always foster a positive attitude towards heritage languages, since learners are solicited to “perform” linguistic competence, rather than use them as a means of emergent quotidian communication (Meek 2010, Das 2008).  My study focuses on the role of religious institutions in maintaining heritage languages in Montreal. I show that places of worship founded by and linked to an immigrant community generate spaces where the relationship between language and identity is not over-determined, allowing for flexible and heterogeneous engagements with the heritage language. The focus of activities in religious settings is geared towards fostering a sacred community, not language instruction per se. Such settings, in which language is not the goal but the medium of collective activity, provide conditions favourable to interactions in heritage language. This thesis is based on our ethnographic field research in five churches in Montreal, each characterized by a different conceptualization of the relationship between language and religion, and each linked to a distinct allophone immigrant community. My research shows the importance of institutions that emerge from immigrant communities in language maintenance.	language maintenance , language shift , heritage language , language and religion , indexicality	en	24145.0
211	Le projet GAP de la Turquie : au-delà du développement	The GAP or “South-Eastern Anatolia Development Project” in Turkey is one of the vast development projects in the world, consisting of the construction of 21 dams and 19 hydroelectric centers on the Euphrates and Tigris rivers.   However, this project posed many controversies during the last decade both at the national level, with the Kurdish question, and at the regional level, because of the issue of sharing water with neighboring countries, notably Syria and Iraq. Nevertheless, this subject was debated in most cases exclusively from the perspective of the Kurdish conflict issue. The objectives of my dissertation are to understand the use of the GAP project by the Turkish government in the national and political constructions of Turkey in 1930 and 1980 with the aim of sovereignty and national power. This analysis is carried out in a more general framework of geopolitics and political history. Drawn on work of geopolitics and power, and especially on theories of national construction, this dissertation focuses mainly on the evolution of the GAP project, as well as its instrumentalization in the national construction of 1930 and the political and national reconstruction of 1980.

212	Are age and sex effects on sleep slow waves only a matter of EEG amplitude ?	Aging is associated with reduced slow wave (SW) density (number SW/min in nonrapid-eye movement sleep) and amplitude. It has been proposed that an age-related decrease in SW density may be due to a reduction in electroencephalogram (EEG) amplitude instead of a decline in the capacity to generate SW. Here, we propose a data-driven approach to adapt SW amplitude criteria to age and sex. We predicted that the adapted criteria would reduce age and sex differences in SW density and SW characteristics but would not abolish them. A total of 284 healthy younger and older adults participated in one night of sleep EEG recording. We defined age- and sex-adapted SW criteria in a first cohort of younger (n = 97) and older (n = 110) individuals using a signal-to-noise ratio approach. We then used these age- and sex-specific criteria in an independent second cohort (n = 77, 38 younger and 39 older adults) to evaluate age and sex differences on SW density and SW characteristics. After adapting SW amplitude criteria, we showed maintenance of an age-related difference for SW density whereas the sex-related difference vanished. Indeed, older adults produced less SW compared with younger adults. Specifically, the adapted SW amplitude criteria increased the probability of occurrence of low amplitude SW (<80 µV) for older men especially. Our results thereby confirm an age-related decline in SW generation rather than an artifact in the detection amplitude criteria. As for the SW characteristics, the age- and sex-adapted criteria display reproducible effects across the two independent cohorts suggesting a more reliable inventory of the SW.

213	A 2‐year dyadic longitudinal study of mothers' and fathers' marital adjustment when caring for a child with cancer	Objective Studies examining interrelationships within parental couples confronted with pediatric cancer are scarce. This study explored dyadic longitudinal associations between both partners' family functioning and mood at diagnosis, and marital adjustment 2 years later.  Method Parents of children (n = 47 couples) with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) completed the Family Well‐Being Assessment and Profile of Mood States‐Bipolar Form at diagnosis, and the Locke–Wallace Marital Adjustment Test 2 years post diagnosis. Multilevel linear models using the actor–partner interdependence model (APIM) and controlling for baseline marital adjustment were conducted to evaluate within subject and dyadic longitudinal effects.  Results For mothers, better marital adjustment 2 years post diagnosis was associated with perception of greater family support and less role conflict and role overload at diagnosis. For fathers, better marital adjustment 2 years post‐diagnosis was associated with perception of less role conflict, greater role ambiguity, and being more tired at diagnosis, as well as their partner's perception of less role conflict at diagnosis.  Conclusions These findings highlight the importance of considering both partners' perspectives in understanding marital adjustment across treatment phases in parents of children with ALL. Early interventions for couples should be tailored to meet each partner's needs in order to foster resilience within the couple.

214	Changes in regional cerebral perfusion over time in idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder	Background Idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder is associated with increased risk of neurodegeneration, but the temporal evolution of regional perfusion, a marker of cerebral activity, has not been characterized. The objective of the current study was to study longitudinal regional perfusion in patients with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder.  Methods Thirty‐seven patients and 23 controls underwent high‐resolution single‐photon emission computed tomography. After 17 months on average, scans were repeated for idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder patients. We compared regional cerebral blood flow between groups and over time.  Results At baseline, patients showed lower relative regional perfusion in the anterior frontal and lateral parietotemporal cortex compared with controls. However, over time, patients showed an increase in relative regional perfusion in the anterior frontal, lateral parietal, and occipitotemporal cortex, reverting toward normal control levels.  Conclusions Patients with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder showed significant areas of relative regional hypoperfusion, which disappeared over time to finally return to average levels, suggesting possible developing compensation in areas affected by neurodegeneration.

215	Cerebral white matter diffusion properties and free‐water with obstructive sleep apnea severity in older adults	Characterizing the effects of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) on the aging brain could be key in our understanding of neurodegeneration in this population. Our objective was to assess white matter properties in newly diagnosed and untreated adults with mild to severe OSA. Sixty‐five adults aged 55 to 85 were recruited and divided into three groups: control (apnea‐hypopnea index ≤5/hr; n = 18; 65.2 ± 7.2 years old), mild (>5 to ≤15 hr; n = 27; 64.2 ± 5.3 years old) and moderate to severe OSA (>15/hr; n = 20; 65.2 ± 5.5 years old). Diffusion tensor imaging metrics (fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (AD), radial diffusivity, and mean diffusivity) were compared between groups with Tract‐Based Spatial Statistics within the white matter skeleton created by the technique. Groups were also compared for white matter hyperintensities volume and the free‐water (FW) fraction. Compared with controls, mild OSA participants showed widespread areas of lower diffusivity (p < .05 corrected) and lower FW fraction (p < .05). Participants with moderate to severe OSA showed lower AD in the corpus callosum compared with controls (p < .05 corrected). No between‐group differences were observed for FA or white matter hyperintensities. Lower white matter diffusivity metrics is especially marked in mild OSA, suggesting that even the milder form may lead to detrimental outcomes. In moderate to severe OSA, competing pathological responses might have led to partial normalization of diffusion metrics.

216	Induction of systemic oxidative stress leads to brain oedema in portacaval shunted rats	Background & Aims The pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is multifactorial and often associated with the development of brain oedema. In addition to ammonia playing a central role, systemic oxidative stress is believed to aggravate the neuropsychological effects of ammonia in patients with chronic liver disease (CLD). The aim of this study was to (i) induce systemic oxidative stress in hyperammonaemic portacaval anastomosed (PCA) rats by inhibiting the antioxidant glutathione using Dimethyl maleate (DEM) and (ii) investigate whether a synergistic relationship between ammonia and oxidative stress contributes to the pathogenesis of brain oedema in CLD. Methods Four-week PCA and sham-operated rats received DEM (0.4–4 mg/kg/day) for the last 10 days before sacrifice when oxidative stress markers [reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA)] were assessed in blood and frontal cortex. Brain water content was measured using a specific gravimetric technique. Results Dimethyl maleate induced an increase in ROS and MDA in the blood, but not in the brain, of the PCA rats, compared with non-treated PCA rats. This was accompanied with an increase in brain water content (PCA+DEM: 78.45 ± 0.13% vs. PCA: 77.38 ± 0.11%, P < 0.001). Higher doses of DEM induced systemic oxidative stress in sham-operated controls, but brain oedema did not develop. Conclusions Dimethyl maleate provoked systemic, not central, oxidative stress in PCA rats, resulting in the development of brain oedema. Independently, hyperammonaemia and systemic oxidative stress do not precipitate brain oedema; therefore, our findings sustain that a synergistic effect between hyperammonaemia and systemic oxidative stress is responsible for the development of brain oedema in HE.

217	Le développement de l’autonomie professionnelle d’infirmières nouvellement diplômées sur une unité de soins intensifs	The barriers in transition-to-practice for newly graduated nurses on intensive care units has been well documented. Independent professional practice is, in particular, one of the barriers shared by newly graduated nurses integrating an intensive care unit. This research aims to explore the perceptions of newly graduated nurses and preceptors regarding the professional autonomy development of the newly graduated nurses in a nursing residency program on intensive care units. Nursing residency programs were developed in order to facilitate transition-to-practice of newly graduated nurses. In these programs, the evaluation that assesses clinical competence development can be primarily based on the newly graduated nurse’s autonomy. However, few studies focus on the development of professional autonomy of newly graduated nurses. As study framework, a model that includes Benner's stages of clinical competence (1982), Tardif's competency assessment approach (2006) and a definition of professional autonomy as suggested by Létourneau (2017) is proposed. By conducting a descriptive exploratory study, semi-structured individual interviews collected the data from newly graduated nurses (n=6), while preceptors (n= 4) shared their perceptions during focus groups. Content analysis by Van der Maren (1996) was used for data analysis. The results include the barriers encountered in the early career of the newly graduated nurses in critical care setting, a definition of professional autonomy and the influences of the newly graduated nurses’ professional autonomy development. The influences of the newly graduated nurses’ professional autonomy development and the definition of professional autonomy have been linked in a concept map. Considering these findings, implications for practice, research, education and management in nursing were made.	newly graduated nurses , professional autonomy development , professional transition-to-practice , intensive care unit , preceptors	en	23988.0
218	The impact of nocturnal wear of the prosthesis on the oral health-related quality of life of an apneic edentulous population	Problematic: Tooth loss is one of the chronic diseases associated with several anatomical and functional alterations in the oral cavity and the upper airway tract. These changes result in the deterioration in oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL), particularly among the elderly. Complete dentures can enhance the appearance and restore some impaired masticatory functions, creating a positive impact on OHRQoL. However, continuous nocturnal wear of dentures may raise oral health problems. In contrast, some studies have found that the impact of sleeping with dentures is positive with regard to the quality of sleep and quality of life. Objectives: The aim of this Master’s study is to investigate the impact of sleeping with dentures on OHRQoL in edentulous elderly patients who suffer from obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Methodology: This master research project is nested in a randomized, crossover trial study of 70 edentulous elderly patients diagnosed with moderate to severe OSA (AHI ≥10). The participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups (sleeping with or without the prosthesis in opposite order), for two periods with a 30-day interval between them. Data on the effect of nocturnal wearing of dentures on OHRQoL and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) were collected at the baseline and during the two follow-up visits, using the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-20) and Short form (SF-36) questionnaires respectively. Data analysis was performed using mixed effect models appropriate for repeated measures including types of intervention (sleeping with or without dentures), sequence and visit number. Results: Results reported below are based on data collected from 63 patients. The overall OHIP-20 score was slightly higher among patients who wore their dentures while sleeping than in those who did not, but not at a significant level (p=0.08). The scores of all OHIP-20 subscales were increased among patients who slept with prosthesis, except for the social disability which slightly decreased, and the handicap remained at the same average. However, the significant negative impact was reported only for two OHIP scores: psycho-discomfort (p=0.04) and physical disability (p=0.05). OHIP-20 scores were influenced neither by the assignment sequence nor by the period, with an exception for handicap scores which slightly increased among elders assigned to sleep with dentures in the first period of this study. In contrast, SF-36 results showed an improvement in the mean scores in all subscales among the elderly when participants were sleeping with dentures, but the only significant impacts were found on social function and health change aspects (p <0.01, and p=0.01, respectively). The assignment sequence had a significant effect on physical function (p=0.03), pain (p=0.02), and health change (p=0.02). The follow-up visit number had a significant impact only on the physical function domain (p=0.03). Conclusion: While sleeping with dentures could have a negative impact on psycho-discomfort and physical discomfort aspects of OHRQoL, it could have a positive impact on the social function and health change aspects of HRQoL. The results of this Master’s research should be considered as preliminary since the total data analysis has not completed yet.

219	Le rôle des vésicules extracellulaires dans la dysfonction lymphatique liée à l’athérosclérose	All cell types release extracellular vesicles (EVs) that carry different types of cellular cargo, such as proteins, lipids and nucleic acids. These small vesicles are found in all biological fluids including blood and lymph and can interact with neighboring cells. The lymphatic system is a preferred route for the mobilization of cholesterol from the arterial wall. We have demonstrated in a mouse model that lymphatic dysfunction precedes the development of atherosclerosis and that that this dysfunction affects the contraction capacity of the collecting vessels. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that EVs contribute to atherosclerosis-associated lymphatic dysfunction. Therefore, we have initiated a translational study involving two groups of healthy subjects that differ in their risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). We quantified several subtypes of circulating EVs on platelet-free plasma by ultraspecialized flow cytometry in the detection of small particles (> 100 nm) combined to other state-of-the art complementary techniques. Next, we assessed the lymphatic function using near-infrared imaging and injection of indocyanine green (ICG). Our preliminary results are promising for the role of EVs and lymphatic dysfunction in the development of atherosclerosis and corroborate with our observations made in mice. Individuals at high risk of CVD have signs of lymphatic dysfunction even before the onset of subclinical atherosclerosis. The mechano-sensitive response of their collecting vessels appears to be defective and is observable in concert with a profile of EVs that presume lymphatic damage. These results remain to be confirmed with the recruitment of additional subjects and the assessment of the correlation with the polygenic risk score of developing a CVD, in the hope of making these specific EV subsets and lymphatic function new biomarkers in the early detection of CVD.	extracellular vesicles , Lymphatic system , Atherosclerosis , Flow cytometry , Cardiovascular diseases , Infrared imaging	en	23982.0
220	Notes de programme : une histoire, des pratiques et de nouveaux usages numériques	Since their appearance in the mid-nineteenth century, program notes, sometimes containing detailed information on the works that are about to be performed, have continued to meet audiences needs during concerts. They respond to a wide range of needs: providing intelligible comprehension tools for laymen and laywomen, who discover the music of the past and of the present, while arousing the curiosity of well-accustomed listeners, who increase their knowledge and cultivation. This goes for program notes as well as other music appreciation tools, torn between the desire to make classical music accessible to all and, on the other hand, the rigorous approach to musicology that is expected from connoisseurs. In this thesis, we combine both theory and practice. In addition to an inquiry, conducted in October 2017 as part of three concert nights at the Orchestre symphonique de Montréal (hereafter, OSM) – an inquiry which gives us an idea of how program notes are regarded by concert audiences –, we will display a series of short open educational videos that we produced for the OSM, during the 2015-2016 season. The work necessary for these new digital tools is partly based on the analysis of a large body of former program notes from which we have identified a number of trends and specific cases. The results of the inquiry show that the OSM’s audience, far from being homogeneous, is made up of listeners who bear very different expectations. According to many, the program notes are considered appropriate for one’s concert experience. However, they may also spring critical reactions among concertgoers: either too detailed, tedious for some, or somewhat dull for others. Although audience members have different musical backgrounds and scales of knowledge, both novices and connoisseurs seem to share a common interest in the music itself, which needs to be explained through means of analysis. This interest is being fulfilled by program notes, in line with the requirements of musicological research. The question remains: how can one describe a work of music in order to meet the needs of everyone? In this thesis, we try to find appropriate answers to this matter.

221	L’évolution du terme « Métis » chez le Conseil national des Autochtones du Canada et l’Alliance laurentienne des Métis et Indiens sans statut entre 1971 et 1982	Between 1876 and 1982, Métis were excluded from federal Indian policy, as they were not recognized as indigenous owing to the discriminatory and assimilationist clauses within the Indian Act. However, numerous spaces emerged for the recognition of the indigenous nature of the rights and identities of Métis and non-status Indians (MNSI) amid the creation of the Native Council of Canada in 1971 and the repatriation of the Canadian constitution in 1982. Among these were the creation of MNSI representative organizations across the country, the funding of historical and legal research for land claims, and lastly, the recognition of Métis rights as an Aboriginal people within the constitution.  Within the scope of these spaces and the pressing context of land claims and constitutional repatriation, the NCC and the Laurentian Alliance of Metis and non-status Indians (LAMNSI) highlighted different ideas and definitions on the rights and identities of MNSI people in Canada in order to be recognized by the state. For this reason, the CNAC valued an ethno-national concept of Métis that was centered around the Red River community. Consequently, LAMNSI argued that there was no such thing as a Métis Nation in Quebec or in eastern Canada. Instead, LAMNSI affirmed that its members belonged to the historical, cultural and familial realities of the First Nations.

222	Exploration de la culture alimentaire biomédicalisée québécoise : de l'alimentation « saine » à la production de corps différenciés	This PhD thesis presents, from a cultural studies perspective, a critical and situated (Haraway, 1988) exploration of Quebec’s contemporary food culture and of the various definitions of “healthy” food it produces and renders effective. More precisely, I analyse the power relationships that inform its development as well as those taking form and effectivity through the knowledge and practices constitutive of healthy food (and its multiple forms and modes of existence). Through critical analysis of the current Quebec food culture, I question the bodies, human and more-than-human ones, that are produced therein, and are differentiated by unequal power relationships. The analysis presented is the result of an embodied and dialogic ethnography following the methods of materials gathering and analysis suggested by Probyn (2016). The thesis is separated into three distinct, but interrelated, parts. The first part explores Quebec’s food culture, in which I am fully immersed. This part presents the food culture and the knowledge, practices, and events that it contributes to creating, as well as the multiplicity of healthy food definitions that emerge within it, according to their various contexts of emergence. Throughout this part, I highlight how particular kinds of knowledge are produced, articulated and legitimated, as well as how relationships involving and linking humans and more-than-humans are produced and conveyed. I demonstrate how all of these processes participate in the multiple modes of emergence of healthy food in Quebec. In the current food culture, healthy food is regularly thought and problematized in relationship to human bodies. The second part of the thesis presents my analysis of what I have called the biomedicalized food culture, attending especially to the relationships between bodies, food, and health it contributes to creating. I put at the forefront how the current food culture cannot be analysed without taking into account the contemporary “healthist” (Crawford, 1980) discourses that inform the manners by which bodies are put in relation to food, under health-oriented considerations. I mobilize the conceptual tools proposed by Clarke et al. (2010) on the biomedicalization of the social field to question how food and bodies are put in relation and problematized, in a context where health is a moral and individual objective to reach (Crawford, 1980; Lupton, 1997; Metzl et Kirkland, 2010). I criticize how the biomedicalized food culture limits the type of relationships that can take form and be considered between food and bodies, as well as the types of bodies that are produced and authorized.  The third part of the thesis is concerned with the bodies, human and more-than-human ones, that are produced within the biomedicalized food culture, as much as by the power relationships that participate in their production and differentiation. By “produce”, I mean among other things how bodies are discursively defined, framed, controlled, etc.; evaluated, characterized, discriminated, excluded, stigmatized; materially produced (their corporeal materialities, their biology, etc.). I navigate between different manners of analysing their production as much as I explore the different types of bodies that are produced, drawing on reflections (and literatures) that apprehend and question them from various epistemologies.

223	An examination of concussion education programmes : a scoping review methodology	Objectives The primary purpose was to review the literature on concussion education programmes. The secondary purpose was to inform knowledge translation strategies for concussion researchers and practitioners. Design Research on concussion education programmes is relatively new. As a result, the current study implemented a scoping review methodology, which is a type of literary search used to provide a preliminary assessment of the size and scope of a body of literature, as well as identify strengths, weaknesses and gaps in the research. Methods A five-stage process for conducting a scoping review was followed for this study: (a) identifying the research questions, (b) identifying relevant studies, (c) identifying the study selection criteria, (d) charting the data and (e) reporting the results. Results Concussion education programmes have been developed and implemented with populations ranging in age from 9 to 49 years and have used interactive oral presentations, educational videos and computer-based learning programmes. Although the content of these programmes varied, the topics generally addressed salient aspects of concussion injury and recovery. Quantitative instruments have been the preferred methods for assessment. Conclusions Education programmes aimed at improving participants’ long-term concussion knowledge, behaviours and attitudes of concussions are needed. Researchers must consider using a knowledge translation framework to enhance concussion education programmes. The application of such a framework can lead to novel and interesting ways of disseminating information about concussive injury and recovery.		en	23912.0
224	A narrative inquiry into a female athlete’s experiences with protracted concussion symptoms	This article explores a female university volleyball student-athlete’s experience with protracted concussion symptoms. Through the methodology of narrative inquiry, four salient themes became apparent related to Daphnée’s experiences: (a) “I felt so alone,” (b) “I had to make one of the hardest decisions of my life,” (c) “I feel like I’m in prison,” and (d) “There’s no light at the end of the tunnel.” Overall, this study offers a rare look into the impact of concussion on an individual’s athletic and academic identities, career progression, and in turn, her imagined stories of who she was and who she was becoming.

225	"Intervention de pratique réflexive auprès de préceptrices pour accompagner 
le développement du raisonnement clinique infirmier des débutantes aux soins intensifs"	Clinical nursing reasoning is a springboard to the safe delivery of quality care and services (Goudreau, Boyer, et Létourneau, 2014). Preceptorship programs have been designed to facilitate the development of clinical reasoning of beginner nurses. However, these programs do not necessarily provide the full opportunity to support the professional development of nurse preceptors . As it has been pointed out in scientific literature and demonstrated during the internship, nurse preceptors need support in fostering the development of clinical nursing reasoning. As part of a master’s degree in nursing, a reflective practice intervention was developed and tested with preceptors from an intensive care unit, in order to better equip them to support the development of clinical reasoning for beginners. This reflective practice intervention guided by the reflexion model of Huard et al. (2016) and Knowles' andragogical principles (1984), consisted of four activities, three of which were in the form of an interactive discussion group. This reflective practice intervention enabled the preceptors to become more aware of their preceptorial practice to potentiate the opportunities for the development of clinical reasoning for beginner nurses in intensive care. This reflective group practice intervention appears to have been an effective professional development strategy, which should be more widely recognized in clinical settings to improve and enhance the quality of care. Continuous professional development activities through reflective practice place each learner at the center of their learning and aim not only to support the preceptors, but also to contribute indirectly to the advancement of the nursing profession.

227	Perceptions des membres de l’équipe interprofessionnelle face à la présence de la famille lors de la réanimation d’un proche	Background. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation is emotionally charged for the members of the interprofessional team, but also for the patient's family. The family wants to be present with their loved one at this critical time. However, this inclusion of the family is not widespread in the hospital environment today. Different perceptions and barriers emanate from this practice. Aim. Identify the perceptions of interprofessional team members regarding the presence of the family during emergency department resuscitation maneuvers in order to promote this practice. Methodology. An integrative review of the literature according to the method of Whittemore and Knafl (2005) was conducted. Scientific articles were retrieved from the Cumulative Index to Nursing Information and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PsycINFO, Medline, Web of Science, Cochrane and Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) databases. Results. Of the 1,910 potential articles identified, 23 writings were included. The integrative review highlights many benefits and risks perceived by nurses and physicians regarding the inclusion of the family during resuscitation maneuvers. One of the perceived benefits is that the family provides emotional support to the patient. Family presence also strengthens the family/caregiver bond. Factors affecting the interprofessional team's level of confidence in the inclusion of the family were also identified. However, the lack of studies on the perception of all members of the interprofessional team regarding the inclusion of families when resuscitating a loved one was noted. Conclusion. The results of this integrative review of the literature provide a starting point for reflection on the development of a model of care organization aimed at improving practices by promoting the inclusion of families.

228	Integration in the community following a severe traumatic brain injury : a qualitative study exploring the presence of occupational rights violations over a lifetime experience	Introduction: Severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a chronic condition associated with an ongoing need to adapt to a multitude of life changes. To ease transitions and optimize occupational development, people with TBI should ideally be provided with equal opportunities to engage in varied and meaningful occupations. Despite this overarching principle, disparities between ideal and actual engagement are common. The objective of this study was to examine the experiences of people living with TBI more than 5 years post injury to explore changes in engagement in their occupations and potential situations of occupational rights’ violations. Methods: For this exploratory qualitative study, in-depth interviews were completed with 5 participants with severe TBI (average time post-injury: 17.6 years). Interviews were analyzed using principles of the critical incident technique. Results: Despite currently being in a relatively stable living situation, all participants had experienced changes in their community integration. These were associated with: high task requirements, quality of support provided by the social environment, accessibility to resources, and level of interest in engaging in occupations. In this context, participants had to decrease their engagement in meaningful occupations, and adapt their occupations, personal expectations, and environments. Conclusions: Following their TBI, participants were prevented from fair and equitable access to numerous occupations, which limited their community integration. Injustices were difficult to overcome as participants lacked the abilities and formal support to do so. These results underline the need for more long-term community services.

229	Distinct cognitive and discriminative stimulus effects of ketamine enantiomers in rats	Although (S)-ketamine was approved for use in treatment-resistant depression in 2019, new preclinical findings suggest that (R)-ketamine might produce better efficacy and tolerability relative to (S)-ketamine. Here we evaluated the effects of (R)-, (S)-, and (R,S)-ketamine on executive functions as measured in the attentional set shifting task (ASST) and on their discriminative stimulus effects in rats. Earlier data demonstrated that cognitive flexibility is compromised by (R,S)-ketamine, but the effects of enantiomers in rats are unknown. Separate cohorts of rats were tested in ASST and trained to discriminate either (R,S)-ketamine, (S)-ketamine, or (R)-ketamine (all at 10 mg/kg) from saline; in order to maintain the discrimination, a higher (R)-ketamine dose (17.5 mg/kg) was subsequently instituted. In ASST, all three forms increased the trials to criterion measure at reversal learning and extra-dimensional set-shifting phases. However, in contrast to (R)- and (S)-ketamine, (R,S)-ketamine prolonged the mean time to complete a single trial during early stages, suggesting increased reaction time, and/or unspecific side-effects related to motor or motivational impairments. In the drug discriminations, all rats acquired their respective discriminations between drug and saline. In (R,S)-ketamine-trained rats, (R)-ketamine and (S)-ketamine only partially substituted for the training dose of (R,S)-ketamine. Further, (R)-ketamine did not fully substitute in rats trained to (S)-ketamine. The data suggest more serious cognitive deficits produced by (R,S)-ketamine than its enantiomers. Furthermore, (R,S)-ketamine and its isomers share overlapping but not isomorphic discriminative stimulus effects predicting distinct subjective responses to (R)- vs. (S)-ketamine in humans.		en	23887.0
230	L’implantation d’un outil pour favoriser la prescription infirmière en cessation tabagique au service régional des soins à domicile pour maladies pulmonaires chroniques	"More than 1.3 million Quebecers have active smoking, resulting in the death of 13,000 people each year. Addiction to nicotine, the main component that causes tobacco dependence, is a chronic and recurring problem. According to research the combination of behavioral support such as counseling with nicotine replacement therapy significantly increases the chances of patients quitting smoking compared to only using counseling. The Ordre des infirmières et infirmiers du Québec has published clinical guidelines regarding nurses’ authorization to prescribe nicotine replacement therapy which regulate clinical practice in smoking cessation. The right to prescribe helps meet the needs of patients by reducing the time it takes to access care. Despite the fact that nurses in Quebec have the right to prescribe, statistics show that very few nurses exercise this right. The Canadian nurses association recommends that all settings use evidence-based clinical decision support tools. The expert group from Registered nurses association of Ontario recommends the use of the ""Fagerstrôm Test for Nicotine Addiction"" as the best tool to use for support for smoking cessation. The evaluation of nicotine dependence makes it possible to determine if a nursing prescription is necessary and to target an appropriate prescription to effectively alleviate withdrawal symptoms. The goal of the internship was to implement the tool and identify the facilitators and barriers to nursing prescription for smoking cessation at the regional home care unit. This was possible thanks to the collaboration of nurses, counselors and managers of the regional pulmonary home care service. 5 nurses implanted the tool. The results of the internship confirmed that the tools facilitate the deployment of nursing prescriptions. Indeed, the Fagerstrôm test was useful not only to determine the level of dependence, but also to offer education to patients on nicotine replacement therapy and to adjust the interventions of nurses. The tool was also useful in eliciting changes in the discourse among patients, which is considered the starting point for behavior change. In addition, it allowed the nurse to see the added value of the joint use of the Fagerstrôm test and the questionnaire on the stage of change. Finally, the results of the internship highlight the importance of several barriers and facilitators to nurse prescription in particular; readiness for change, bad experiences with nicotine replacement therapy, family background, financial barriers, impact of reimbursement for nicotine replacement therapy, and importance of clinical judgment."		en	23874.0
231	Sensate sovereignty : A dialogue on Dylan Robinson's hungry lIstening	Dylan Robinson's Hungry Listening: Resonant Theory for Indigenous Sound Studies emerges from encounters between Indigenous sound performance and Western art music. The book takes aim at the pernicious tendency for the latter to insist upon aesthetic assimilation as the end-goal of these encounters, which far too often means derogating the former’s ontologies and protocols of song. In this dialogue-review, members from the The Culture and Technology Discussion and Working Group (The CATDAWG) situate the book within sound studies and critiques of settler colonial listening, reflecting on the major conceptual contributions of the book such as sensate sovereignty, hungry listening, and critical listening positionality.		en	23866.0
232	Police encounters involving citizens with mental illness: use of resources and outcomes	Objective: Few studies have addressed use of resources in police interventions involving individuals with mental illness. The time police officers spend on interventions is a straightforward measure with significant administrative weight, given that it addresses human resource allocation. This study compared the characteristics of police interventions involving individuals with mental illness and a control sample of individuals without mental illness. Methods: A total of 6,128 police interventions in Montreal, Québec, were analyzed by using a retrospective analysis of police intervention logs from three days in 2006. Interventions involving citizens with (N=272) and without (N=5,856) mental illness were compared by reason for the intervention, the use of arrest, and the use of police resources. Results: Police interventions involving individuals with mental illness were less likely than those involving individuals without mental illness to be related to more severe offenses. However, interventions for minor offenses were more likely to lead to arrest when they involved citizens with mental illness. Interventions for reasons of equal severity were twice as likely to lead to arrest if the citizen involved had a mental illness. After controlling for the use of arrest and the severity of the situation, the analysis showed that police interventions involving individuals with mental illness used 87% more resources than interventions involving individuals without mental illness. Conclusions: Future studies using administrative police data sets could investigate the use of resources and division of costs involved in new programs or partnerships to better address the interface of criminal justice and mental health care.

233	Exploration des considérations des intervenantes allochtones en regard de leur travail en contexte Inuit, dans une perspective décoloniale	Aboriginal peoples are highly resilient to many physical and psychosocial health issues. Intergenerational trauma from past and current colonization is seen as one of the explanations for these difficulties, coupled with a lack of services to address the determinants of well-being involved. To address these challenges, community-based approaches that promote empowerment and self-governance are recommended. Non-Aboriginal stakeholders are involved in supporting community mobilization and their contribution can be substantial. Nevertheless, it seems essential to decolonize interventions, particularly by carrying out an introspection on one's own presence and impact in an indigenous context. In the first part, an ethnographic analysis of my process as a young student-researcher will be carried out and will allow an analysis of the feelings, tensions, questions and reflections that shaped this thesis. Then, the results of phenomenological qualitative analysis of five interviews conducted with non-Inuit stakeholders working in Nunavik or Nunavut will be presented. The analysis of these verbatim will have made it possible to highlight the speaker's considerations in relation to themselves and in relation to the communities, from a decolonial perspective. The inductive qualitative analysis of a focus group conducted with Inuit stakeholders will then be presented, validating some considerations. This study will have supported the importance of self-knowledge and the recognition of invisible privileges of non-aboriginal people in relation to past and current history of colonization, in order to meet the needs of communities as a priority through the establishment of meaningful and lasting trust-based relationships.	collaboration , Whiteness , Aboriginal , Colonization , Decolonial perspectives , Inuit , Trust-based relationships	en	23839.0
234	Décrochage de l’école secondaire : rôle de la fratrie et effet modérateur des caractéristiques de la dyade	The goal of this study is to determine whether the sibling dropout-adolescent dropout association depends on three key dyads’ characteristics, including: gender configuration (same-sex or opposite-sex dyad), age difference, and whether the adolescent and his or her dropout sibling live with in the same home or not. The data were collected from a sample of Canadian adolescents (N = 545). One-third of the sample consisted of students who had recently dropped out of high school, one-third were matched students who had a similar profile but persevered, and one-third were normative students not particularly at risk of dropping out. The results of the study show that adolescents with a sibling who has dropped out are more likely to drop out themselves than those with no siblings who have dropped out. This association is stronger when the dyads are of the same sex compared to opposite-sex dyads. In addition, participants who have a dropout sibling very close in age (with a gap of two years or less)  or fairly close in age (with a gap of 3 to 4 years, are particularly at risk of dropping out, while the risks are not significantly higher when the age gap is larger, again compared to those without dropout siblings. However, the results do not suggest any moderating effects associated with whether or not a common residence is shared. The results’ implications for practice and research are discussed.	adolescence , High school dropout , siblings , adolescence , dyad characteristics , social learning	en	23837.0
235	Stress chez les nouveaux parents et amour conditionnel	This cross-sectional study examined the relationship between perceived conditional negative regard (a behavior that thwarts basic psychological needs), stress, and dyadic adjustment during the transition to parenthood. Primiparous couples (n=137) of 6-months old babies were recruited to fill out an online questionnaire. Structural equation model analysis with an Actor-partner interdependence mediation model were conducted. Results show that for each partner, stress partially mediated the link between perceived conditional negative regard and dyadic adjustment (actor effects). For the partner effects, stress was not a mediator between these variables. However, some partner effects were found: 1) Bearing mothers’ perceived conditional negative regard was associated with partners’ dyadic adjustment, and 2) Partners’ perceived conditional negative regard was associated with bearing mothers’ dyadic adjustment. Overall, the findings shed light on the dyadic influences of conditional negative regard and the mechanisms through which it decreases dyadic adjustment during the transition to parenthood.

236	Les associations longitudinales entre les symptômes de psychopathologie et la consommation de cannabis à l’adolescence et le rôle de l’orientation sexuelle comme modérateur	The association between cannabis use and mental health is not yet well understood. Additionally, sexual minorities present higher rates of cannabis use and mental health issues than heterosexuals.  Objective. To examine the developmental relationships between cannabis, and depression and anxiety across adolescence in heterosexual and LGB youth.  Method. The relationships between cannabis, and depressive and anxiety symptoms at 13, 15, and 17 years were examined using cross-lagged models in 1548 participants. Multigroup analyses were conducted to examine the models according to sexual orientation.  Results. Small bidirectional associations were found in the full sample, which remained significant once control variables were included in the model: cannabis use positively predicted later anxiety symptoms, and depressive symptoms at 15 years predicted cannabis at 17 years. LGB participants presented a considerably larger association between depressive symptoms at 15 years and cannabis at 17 years, as well as a negative association between anxiety symptoms at 15 years and cannabis at 17 years.  Conclusion. These results suggest that the relationships between cannabis, and depressive and anxiety symptoms are bidirectional across adolescence, albeit small. Sexual minorities present particularly strong associations that may represent self-medication efforts for depressive symptoms between 15 and 17 years.	marijuana , cannabis , adolescence , LGB , youth , mental health , depression , anxiety , sexual minority , substance use	en	23824.0
237	Influence des variables de trait et d'état sur le contenu affectif des rêves de tous les jours	Although emotions are reported in a large majority of dreams, little is known about the factors that account for night-to-night and person-to-person variations in people’s experience of dream affect. We investigated the relationship between waking trait and state variables and dream affect by testing multilevel models intended to predict the affective valence of people’s everyday dreams. Participants from the general population completed measures of personality and trauma history followed by a three-week daily journal in which they noted dream recall, valence of dreamed emotions, as well as their level of perceived stress for the day and prior to sleep onset. Within-subject effects accounted for most of the variance in the reported valence of dream affect. Trait anxiety was the only variable that significantly predicted dream emotional valence at the between-subjects level. While highlighting the need for more fine-grained measures in this research field, our results point to methodological limitations and biases associated with retrospective estimates of general dream and waking affect, and bring into focus state variables that may best explain observed within-subject variance in emotions experienced in everyday dreams.	dream , trait anxiety , perceived stress , emotional valence , prospective , multilevel , continuity hypothesis of dreaming , trauma , boundary thinness	en	23819.0
238	Segmentation automatique de la fibrose pulmonaire sur images de tomodensitométrie en radio-oncologie	Pulmonary fibrosis is an interstitial lung disease characterized by an irreversible production of scarring tissue. Pulmonary fibrosis has a particularly poor prognosis, with a mean survival after diagnosis lower than many cancers. This pathology was recently identified as a risk for complication following radiation therapy treatments. Pulmonary toxicity can lead to severe conditions that compromise the benefits provided by radiation therapy, making pulmonary fibrosis a relative contraindication to treatments. Manual segmentation of fibrosis on computed tomography (CT) images is a difficult task that can involve many experts for a single patient. The aim of this project is to perform automatic segmentation of pulmonary fibrosis on CT images. Fully convolutional neural networks were developed and implemented to automatically assign lung tissues. For an input CT slice, every lung voxel is assigned a tissue in a single inference. Parameters optimization was performed in a supervised and semi-supervised manner by minimizing variants of the cross-entropy between the prediction and manual annotations produced by experts. The dataset employed consists of high resolution CT scans and delineations made by radiologists and radiation oncologists. Predicted segmentation maps were compared with manual segmentations to validate the tissues assigned by the convolutional networks. Results suggest that radiation oncology applications could be developed. Possible applications include pulmonary fibrosis screening prior to treatment planning and assessment of fibrosis progression during and post-treatment.

239	L'enfant dans le projet pédagogique de Platon	This study wants to question Plato’s theory of soul through his conception of child and childhood. For this philosopher, human is a mixture of body and soul, which do not belong to the same domain. On the one hand, the body functions following the rules of the sensible world, which are temporal, corporeal and imperfect. On the other, the soul responds to the laws of the intelligible world which are eternal, transcendant and perfect. But the soul is confronted to the obstacles and the imperfections of the sensible world when it becomes the prisoner of a body. A human must try as best as he can to retrieve the perfection that his soul once possessed, especially through the practice of philosophy, which reminds him of what he was and therefore what he has to be. For Plato, the child suffers from a philosophical deficiency that complicates the return of the soul to perfection. He is completely dominated by his body and what his body provokes within his soul. Thus the child becomes a synonym of imperfection. As the first period of human life, childhood is the first obstacle that the soul must overcome to retrieve its true nature. This research would like to show that the child is a central subject of the Platonic system, because he becomes the fundamental stake of a philosophy whose goal is to achieve a better life for humans.

240	Perspectives pluralistes critiques sur l’indétermination du droit	No theory of the legitimacy of judges accompanies the Critical Legal Studies’ arguments on the indeterminacy of law, which entails there are no criteria to identify a legitimate interpretation. Critical legal pluralism, which redefines law to take account of its inherent plurality rather than denying its very possibility on these grounds, could however provide such criteria. Indeed, it presents many resemblances with Dworkin’s theory of law which argues that citizens are entitled to reap the benefits of the interpretative nature of law. Both theories defend that law allows to bridge a group’s past, which is essential to its self-understanding, with the present, and both insist that law must be made to appear relevant in the present.  Pluralists however prioritize the current significance of law and stress that communities are split by a variety of definitions of the good. According to them, law is mainly a process to think about human conduct and grant it meaning, and it depends as such on citizens’ creative capacities. Accordingly, only an interpretation that is accepted by a group and seen as meaningful can be considered legitimate. This criterion forces us to consider a form of negotiated justice, where two persons consult a judge to develop a common reading of a rule which would be legitimate in each person’s legal universe.

241	On the bias-variance tradeoff : textbooks need an update	The main goal of this thesis is to point out that the bias-variance tradeoff is not always true (e.g. in neural networks). We advocate for this lack of universality to be acknowledged in textbooks and taught in introductory courses that cover the tradeoff.  We first review the history of the bias-variance tradeoff, its prevalence in textbooks, and some of the main claims made about the bias-variance tradeoff. Through extensive experiments and analysis, we show a lack of a bias-variance tradeoff in neural networks when increasing network width. Our findings seem to contradict the claims of the landmark work by Geman et al. (1992). Motivated by this contradiction, we revisit the experimental measurements in Geman et al. (1992). We discuss that there was never strong evidence for a tradeoff in neural networks when varying the number of parameters. We observe a similar phenomenon beyond supervised learning, with a set of deep reinforcement learning experiments.  We argue that textbook and lecture revisions are in order to convey this nuanced modern understanding of the bias-variance tradeoff.

242	Towards Understanding Generalization in Gradient-Based Meta-Learning	"In this master's thesis, we study the generalization of neural networks in gradient-based meta-learning by analyzing various properties of the objective landscapes. Meta-learning, a challenging paradigm where models not only have to learn a task but beyond that, are trained for ``learning to learn"" as they must adapt to new tasks and environments with very limited data about them. With research on the objective landscapes of neural networks in classical supervised having provided some answers regarding their ability to generalize for new data points, we propose similar analyses aimed at understanding generalization in meta-learning. We first introduce the literature on objective landscapes of neural networks in Section \ref{sec:intro:objective_landscapes}. We then introduce the literature of meta-learning in Section \ref{chap:prof_forcing}, concluding our introduction with the approach of gradient-based meta-learning, a meta-learning setup that bears strong similarities to the traditional supervised learning setup through stochastic gradient-based optimization. At the time of writing of this thesis, and to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to empirically study the objective landscapes in gradient-based meta-learning, especially in the context of deep learning. We notably provide some insights on some properties of those landscapes that appear correlated to the generalization to new tasks. We experimentally demonstrate that as meta-training progresses, the meta-test solutions, obtained after adapting the meta-train solution of the model, to new tasks via few steps of gradient-based fine-tuning, become flatter, lower in loss, and further away from the meta-train solution. We also show that those meta-test solutions become flatter even as generalization starts to degrade, thus providing experimental evidence against the correlation between generalization and flat minima in the paradigm of gradient-based meta-leaning. Furthermore, we provide empirical evidence that generalization to new tasks is correlated with the coherence between their adaptation trajectories in parameter space, measured by the average cosine similarity between task-specific trajectory directions, starting from a same meta-train solution. We also show that coherence of meta-test gradients, measured by the average inner product between the task-specific gradient vectors evaluated at meta-train solution, is also correlated with generalization. Based on these observations, we propose a novel regularizer for the Model Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) algorithm and provide experimental evidence for its effectiveness."

243	Le documentaire collaboratif : enjeux et pratiques artistiques sous l’angle des dynamiques autochtones-allochtones	This research-creation master’s thesis proposes a theoretical and artistic study of collaborative approaches in documentary film. Contemporary issues of the representation of the Other push documentary artists to develop innovative methodologies where power relations between filmmaker—filming equipment—filmed are reconceptualized. The theoretical and creative components of this thesis consider these issues from the perspective of indigenous—non-indigenous dynamics in Mexico and Canada.  The first chapter examines the colonial relationships of powers rooted in our contemporary societies and perpetuated in the documentary exercise. The collaborative approach is presented as an option borrowed by several artists, including Roberto Olivares Ruiz and Iphigénie Marcoux-Fortier. Chapter two is devoted to analyzing their work. The ethical and practical considerations studied served the development of the short film Segunda Piel; therefore, chapter three outlines the characteristics of the collaboration and the creative process that have been carried out. Finally, the thesis concludes by measuring the limits and successes of the collaborative documentary approach in regard to the creative process and inherent power relations.

244	Le centenaire de la Grande Guerre au prisme des médias : le cas des quotidiens The Guardian, Le Monde et die Süddeutsche Zeitung	This mémoire aims to show that media space, in times of commemoration, is a privileged place for historians who want to capture the dynamics of a community’s memory. Our case study is the media coverage of the centenary of the First World War through the lens of The Guardian, Le Monde and Die Süeddeutsche Zeitung. We analysed in these newspapers the press coverage from June 2014 to July 2017 in the online sections First world war, Centenaire 14-18 and Erster Weltkrieg. This study uses an operative definition of collective memory that allows us to understand the necessity, in the history of memory field, to study journalism not simply as an archive, but also as a discursive space where various complex representations of the past meet and communicate in order to redefine themselves. This discursive space has two points of junction: Practiced history and “mythistory”. The dynamics of this space have been studied for each publication in this research. First, we identify the major historical configurations of the Great War, the role of historians in the coverage, and try to see to which extent these configurations are expressed in the three newspapers studied. Finally, the commemorative intentions of the newspapers are identified and then tested through a study of news-flow and an analysis of the lexical fields of the respective media coverage.

245	Identification de gènes impliqués dans la variation morphologique des fleurs entre deux espèces du genre Rhytidophyllum	Floral adaptations to specific pollinators like corolla shape changes often result in reproductive isolation and thus speciation. But despite their ecological importance, the genetic mechanisms behind this diversity of traits are still poorly understood, especially outside model species. Hence, our goal is to identify genes involved in corolla shape variation between two species of the Rhytidophyllum genus (Gesneriaceae family) from the West Indies, which is characterized by shifts in pollination modes during its evolution. The first one, R. rupincola, has a tubular corolla and is strictly pollinated by hummingbirds. The second one, R. auriculatum, has more open flowers and is pollinated by both hummingbirds and bats. We know from previous work that the variation in morphological floral traits between these species is explained by a few quantitative trait loci (QTLs) of moderate to small effect (Alexandre et al., 2015), but we still do not know which genes underly these loci. In this study, we surveyed the literature and used a comparative transcriptomic approach to identify candidate genes that could explain floral variation between R. auriculatum and R. rupincola. We then tested their association with corolla shape variation using QTL mapping for a F2 hybrid population. Results showed that 7 out of 29 candidate genes were included within 8 different QTL. The number, repartition and putative function of these genes suggest that corolla shape is a complex trait. This sort of investigation is rarely undertaken in non-model species, but is important to integrate developmental genetics with an evolutionary perspective.

246	La stratégie de ciblage de la France Insoumise auprès des jeunes électeurs de 18 à 24 ans : le cas de la campagne présidentielle française de 2017	Through a qualitative survey consisting of eleven semi-structured interviews with strategists who worked on French presidential candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon’s incipient movement, the France Insoumise, this dissertation aims to further the understanding of the political marketing practices used throughout his campaign. We focus on the practices devised to attract young voters so as to validate or refute the hypothesis that the FI purposely targeted the 18-24 years old age group, through the use of marketing inspired concepts and strategies so as to influence their political behavior. We posit that this strategy partly explains the good results of the far-left candidate who before stood on the fringes of the political ecosystem. Far from passing a moral judgement on the aforementioned use of marketing practices, which have been used in an almost systematic manner as of late in western parties; the studies’ results show the effectiveness certain targeting tactics. They also show a clear professionalization of the political marketing field in a country where the use of marketing and personal data is still a sensitive topic.

247	La plainte du chien battu, ou la poésie désenchanteresse (1991-2013) de Michel Houellebecq	This master’s dissertation is a study of Michel Houellebecq’s poetry according to the theoretical framework of sociocritic (Duchet, Robin, Popovic). Urban life, social life and alterities of the city are the most present themes in the poetical work of the author. The main hypothesis is that the writing mobilizes and take over signs, linguistic acts and representations which float around in the French contemporary society, but in a dynamic way: the scriptural act of writing modifies their meaning and criticizes their common use. In the first chapter, we will discuss the “putting into text” (literal translation of the « mise en texte » concept by Duchet, which is the action of putting something into the form of a literary text) of urban life, which shines a light on how much the economic laws rule the city and its inhabitants. It describes a market world where money reigns. In the second chapter, the “putting into text” of social life and people-to-people ties shows how surprisingly artificial they are and certifies that their organization shrinks individual liberties more and more. Having free time to spend with your loved ones was once a given of social modernity but is now becoming difficult to manage. In the third and last chapter, the putting into text of the othernesses of the city (suburbs, province, nature) reveals that they offer no alternative to the hostility of the urban world and the fact that it is, and it will always be, every man for himself. Despite this distressing diagnosis, poetry tries to detect here and there hints of hope and solidarity.

248	Consonant gemination in West Greenlandic	This thesis proposes an analysis in Harmonic Serialism of a cross-morpheme consonant gemination process in West Greenlandic. Central considerations to the analysis are surface restrictions on geminate consonants as well as general consonant behavior at morpheme boundaries. The gemination process at hand involves regressive consonant assimilation when a consonant-initial affix is introduced to consonant-final stem. This operates alongside a process of stem-final consonant deletion, with both processes serving as mutually exclusive strategies to prevent heterorganic consonant clusters from surfacing in West Greenlandic. While the distribution of these processes is not surface-apparent, it is explained through the proposal of unattached moras that function as triggers for assimilation. Additionally, the analysis implements a set of operations that impose restrictions on the output forms of geminate consonants and establishes a formal relationship between these output forms and their position within a morpheme. The objective of this thesis is to propose an example of how a more modern, unified analysis of West Greenlandic grammar could be modeled in Harmonic Serialism. While the majority of earlier works on West Greenlandic phonology are either purely descriptive in nature or involve rewrite rules that cannot share a formal relation or output goal, this thesis proposes an approach within a serial, constraint-based framework as a viable alternative.	inuit , compensatory lengthening , consonant assimilation , consonants , gemination , Greenlandic , Harmonic Serialism , Inuit , Optimality Theory , phonology , West Greenlandic	en	23739.0
249	L'exemplarité chez Max Aub : une négociation littéraire avec l'autorité	A rhetorical value among the Ancients, exemplarity was converted into a literary referent in the first collections of short stories. This transformation, at the dawn of modernity, remains sparsely commented upon. However, it is caught between cultural history and literary studies. The angle of analysis is therefore based on an approach combining a poetic perspective, looking for tensions within words, and a historical perspective, placing greater emphasis on the evolutionary process of a literary referent. This is where the adopted perspective stands out: literary thought delves deeper when encountering an attention dedicated to the history of literary recuperation. In this manner we can track the transformation of a rhetorical resource, the example, which would later give birth to various literary genres and transform itself into a legacy of the narrative tradition. This legacy would then be recovered by several authors, including Max Aub. This reflection will be punctuated by different stages. These correspond to the chapters of the master’s thesis: the first will summarize the origins and evolutions of the exemplum, while the second will focus on the narrative turn of exemplarity. Following the idea that Cervantes embodies, through his writings, a decisive mutation of literary exemplarity, I will comment further on the nature of this mutation. The third chapter will be devoted to Max Aub and his relationship to models, using the prism of exemplarity. This work is essentially scholarly. The perspective I work with allows me to combine literary history and reflections on certain intertextual issues. Aub's relationship with Cervantes and the designated tradition allows us to narrate more fully the derivation of the examples. Such a derivation is interesting, insofar as it signals the renewed concern of a thought recycling the path of its predecessors. Since Aub's case is not isolated, we can generalize some of our analyses, and finally dive into a question parallel to the relationships maintained by the texts: how to navigate through the apparent heaviness of the canonical texts? Thus, the repercussions of the canon on the authors who intend to dialogue with it and enter it are at the heart of this research.	influence , paradigme , violence , canon , tradition , exemplarity , paradigm , rhetoric , narrative	en	23728.0
250	La réussite criminelle des participants à la fraude financière en ligne	Carding is a criminal phenomenon which consists of compromising financial data in order to do fraudulent transactions. Several private and public parties highlighted the size of the loss caused by this new form of criminality. From the criminological angle, little research is available in the size and scope of the phenomenon, particularly on the criminal achievement of this kind of online offenders (called carders). To fill this gap, this research project is aimed at understand the criminal achievement of carders by observing the impact of their personal and social characteristics on their criminal income. Theses variables relate among others to their market activities or their sociodemographic. To do so, an online survey, hosted on Tor, was conducted. A total of 49 completed surveys were collected to do our analysis. By describing these personal and social characteristics, this work has been able to update our knowledge about carders and to address gaps about certain part of what we known about carding. Overall, the results shown that few carders can claim a good criminal achievement and that a minority of them can earn large amounts of money. Experience, speciliazed skills, the use of online forums or play the role of broker explained the criminal achievement among carders.Apart from the fact that our study brings some answers about those predictors, this project highlights the strengths and weaknesses of using an online survey to collect data from a criminal ecosystem.	carding , survey , Criminal achievement	en	23717.0
251	L’identification organisationnelle dans une entreprise de vente multiniveau ：une approche communicationnelle	In this thesis, we propose to examine the question of organizational identification by mobilizing an approach centered on the detailed study of interaction. To do so, we draw from the CCO framework (Communicative Constitution of Organization) and assume the communicational nature of the constitution of organizations. Communication is here understood as an organizing process that constitutes the organization, and can therefore be considered as the starting point for any organizational analysis (Putman, Nicotera and McPhee, 2009, Taylor and Van Every, 2000). By adopting this perspective, identification, conceived as an act of consubstantialization (where consubstantiality refers, echoing Kenneth Burke, to all the qualities of our respective identities from which we can develop a common basis of action with other people), is analyzed through the detailed study of interaction. To study this phenomenon, we adopted a qualitative approach by which we studied a multi-level marketing (MLM) company. Data were collected by videorecording distributors in their daily interactions, particularly while attending meetings and presentations. Our study allows us to show how a common substance is constructed, reproduced and negotiated through communication.	substance , interaction , organizational identification , CCO framework , MLM company	en	23714.0
252	Synthèse biocatalytique de macrocycles planaires chiraux	Macrocycles represent a unique chemotype in organic chemistry, with applications ranging from pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, aromachemicals and material science. An important property of macrocycles is the possibility of displaying planar chirality yielding distinct atropisomeric structures with unique properties. Very few generalized techniques capable of controlling atropisomerism in macrocycles exist, rendering their synthesis extremely challenging. We have achieved the first example of enantio- and atroposelective biocatalytic synthesis of planar chiral p-cyclophanes. Employing a commercially available immobilized lipase (CALB) and simple pro-chiral starting materials, we were able to generate 23 different structures with yields ranging from 11 to 88 %. SFC analysis permitted evaluation of the enantioenrichment of the different macrocycles, which ranged from 96 to >99 % ee. Importantly, planar chiral macrocycles having halogen or borylated substituents are capable of molecular diversification outside the boundaries of what may be tolerated by the enzyme. Our discovery paves the way for the use of biocatalysts in the control of atropisomerism during macrocycle formation.	cyclophanes , macrocycles , atropisomerism , biocatalysis	en	23707.0
253	Le travail de l’Intelligence artificielle : rapport au travail et coup d’œil sociodémographique	In Montreal, with an abundance of public subsidies and private investment, Artificial intelligence is on everyone's lips. Emerging in Quebec's metropolis is an ecosystem conducive to the development of smart technologies, giving birth to new types of businesses. After illustrating the socio-demographic qualities of the professionals drawn towards this field, this dissertation aims to trace the work-specific relationship developed by young workers who choose to work in this promising sector. Through a qualitative study, the author examines what employment conditions look like in this emerging sector of the tech industry. The findings in this paper highlight the changing culture of work and how it has increasingly become a way of expressing oneself as an individual. It captures in action the construction of meaning that these young and highly qualified workers attribute to their professional sphere in order to escape the flexibility and precariousness responsible for the erosion of the so-called wage society.

254	Cinq variations héroïques et sérieuses sur un air célèbre suivi de : destruction et construction romanesque : étude du double mouvement de la musique dans Moderato Cantabile de Marguerite Duras	In this work of research-creation, it is at the heart of my intentions to approach classical music by considering the dual movement that this topic can undergo in a literary text, as it serves both as destruction and composition within the novel structure. My creative writing project, Cinq variations héroïques et sérieuses sur un air célèbre, is envisioned as a caricature of the musical milieu from the perspective of a character who, through five delusional monologues integrating the principles of variation and repetition, paints a satirical portrait of classical musical, a genre with which we are unaccustomed. As a parallel to these variations and their bitter aftertaste, it appears interesting to, in my essay, Destruction and construction in the Novel: the dual movement of music in Moderato Cantabile by Marguerite Duras, study the involvement of music in this work and bring to the fore the importance of the principle of variation. Carrying a message of destructive connotations, music remains, however, essential in the construction of the novel and generates the advent of new codes of reading. Music is established both as a component of writing and the architecture of the work. I would like to bring to light the tensions that music builds in Durassian writing, in a spectre moving from the microscopic to the macroscopic, through an analysis of extracts revealing its involvement at multiple levels.	variations , structure , Marguerite Duras , Creative writing , Music , Novel	en	23690.0
255	L'impact des recommandations des commissions d'enquête sur la législation québécoise	The subject of this master's thesis are the impacts on Quebec's legislation of inquiry commissions on the lack of integrity and ethics in public administration. More specifically, the implementation by lawmakers of recommendations proposed by commissioners’ reports since Confederation is examined. Even though public inquiry commissions are mandated by the government to discover the truth in a particular case by using a quasi-judicial proceeding, their reports contain proposals to prevent new occurrences of the same problem. During the first decades of public inquiry commissions in Québec (1867‒1959), their reports contained but few legislative recommendations, (with some exceptions, e.g. Dunscomb Commission, 1869‒1870; Cannon Commission, 1909), and when such recommendations were included, parliamentarians were reluctant to integrate them in legislation (save for Dunscomb Commission). Since the 1960s, public inquiry commissions' reports have contained more complex recommendations and the successive legislatures have proven themselves more interested in implementing them. Legislators reacted to the extended media coverage of inquiry commissions (e.g. Cliche Commission, 1975; Charbonneau Commission 2015) and the tendency has been for the rapid adoption of laws inspired by their reports. In the last decades, commissions have proposed the creation of several politically independent government institutions, leading to their creation (Agence du Revenu du Québec, Autorité des marchés publics, etc.). However, throughout history, lawmakers have been more reluctant to follow recommendations respecting parliamentarians or ministers themselves.

256	La reconnaissance juridique des contrats intelligents face à la réglementation globale des technologies	The Blockchain technology is essentially a decentralized and distributed network of digital transactions records. Its implementation on the cryptocurrency market was followed by other applications, such as the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) and Smart Contracts. This thesis will focus precisely on the legal recognition of smart contracts in the light of the established positive law and the regulations currently being drafted in various jurisdictions, including Quebec, as well as in the light of the soft law. The context of globalization, legal pluralism and state sovereignty changes are taken into consideration. The first part of this study focuses on the technological aspects in order to present the foundations of the Smart Contracts operation. The second part is dedicated to analyzing the current juridical panorama. The normative framework of the positive law already provides applicable regulations to Smart Contracts, some general, others more specific. It is further understood that the soft law could be a way of harmonizing the current context. A harmonization in this direction would be relevant in order to enhance the essential regulatory framework of new relations coming from the technological development. Given all these facts, the soft law along with hard law seem to be appropriate to chart the legal framework for the new technologies, in order to overcome the many legal uncertainties existing in this field.

We previously demonstrated that the molecular scaffold 14-3-3zeta (14-3-3ζ) had essential roles in adipogenesis. However, the contributions of 14-3-3ζ to mature adipocyte function are not known. 3T3-L1 cells and tamoxifen-inducible adipocyte-specific 14-3-3ζ knockout mice (adi14-3-3ζKO) models were used to examine the roles of 14-3-3ζ in lipolysis. siRNA-mediated knockdown of 14-3-3ζ impaired lipolysis in 3T3-L1 cells stimulated by the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol (Iso), forskolin (an activator of adenylyl cyclase) and dibutyryl cAMP (dbcAMP). qPCR analyses revealed significant reductions in lipase transcript levels (Atgl and Hsl). Furthermore, reductions in the phosphorylated and total levels of PKA substrates such as HSL and CREB were detected in 14-3-3ζ-depleted 3T3-L1 lysates by immunoblotting. These findings were recapitulated in vivo, as reductions in phosphorylated and total HSL levels were detected in the gonadal adipose tissue of adi14-3-3ζKO mice. adi14-3-3ζKO mice and gonadal explants also displayed impaired lipolysis following i.p CL-316,243 (a beta-3 adrenergic agonist) injections and Iso treatment respectively. Interestingly, decreased 14-3-3ζ expression in 3T3-L1 cells and mice revealed reductions in characteristics of a mature adipocyte, such as Pparg, Lpl, and Fabp4 transcript levels, PPARγ levels, triglyceride content, and Oil Red O (ORO) incorporation. Collectively, these results demonstrate that 14-3-3ζ has essential roles in facilitating lipolysis and determining adipocyte maturity.

258	Cibler le système digestif pour protéger le foie : évaluation de l’efficacité prophylactique et thérapeutique de traitements de l’encéphalopathie hépatique dans un modèle murin de cholestase hépatique par ligature de la voie biliaire	Introduction. Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a major but common complication of liver failures diseases. The physiopathology of HE mainly involves intestinal bacteria metabolism derived ammonia. The golden standard for patients who experience overt episodes of HE is lactulose but its observance is poor due to uncomfortable side effects. On the other hand, Rifaximin is a potent candidate but there is a lack of relevant data from clinical trials to support its sole use. Antifibrotic drugs are another category of treatment that can be useful in the setting of HE since it can prevent the onset of cirrhosis and thus of the liver failure, this can decrease the appearance and severity of the episodes. The aim of this study is to evaluate in a murine model of bile duct ligation the efficiency of therapeutic treatments (lactulose and rifaximin) alone or in combination to decrease blood ammonia and ameliorate HE status; and of prophylactic treatments (obeticholic acid, rapamycin, pirfenidone, ursodeoxycholic acid) individually to prevent the onset of fibrosis. Materials and methods. The two projects used a murine model of bile duct ligation. For the evaluation of the efficiency of rifaximin, three weeks after surgery, the animals were sorted into five groups according to the treatment they received daily and according to the model : SHAM-VEH, for animals that underwent a mock surgery (SHAM) and were treated with vehicle (VEH); BDL-VEH, for animals that underwent a bile duct ligation surgery (BDL) and were treated with vehicle; BDL-RIF, for animals that were treated with rifaximin (RIF); BDLLAC, for animals that were treated with lactulose (LAC); BDL-LAC+RIF for animals that were treated with lactulose and rifaximin (LAC+RIF);. For the evaluation of the effect of antifibrotic drugs, one week after surgery, the animals were sorted into six groups according to the treatment they received daily and according to the model : SHAM-VEH, BDL-VEH, BDL-OCA for animals that were treated with obeticholic acid (OCA); BDL-RPM, for animals that were treated with rapamycine (RPM); BDL-UDCA, for animals that were treated with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA); BDL-PFN, for animals that were treated with pirfenidone (PFN). All animals were evaluated during the model for survival, food consumption and growth. The biological parameters of the liver function were evaluated at the end of the model. More specifically, this project includes a deeper analysis on fibrosis through histological analysis with establishment of the METAVIR score and measure of the content on hydroxyproline. The rifaximin project includes behavioural analysis to evaluate the HE status and measurement of cerebral edema. Results. Concerning the rifaximin project, no difference can be established between the treatments in term of survival, growth, food consumption, behavioural tests, cerebral edema, biochemistry parameters including ammonia. No treatment, taken alone or in combination, showed efficacy to treat HE. Concerning the antifibrotic drug study, some compounds have shown an increase in mortality, although no difference can be observed on growth, food consumption, biochemistry parameters, histology or hydroxyproline content. Conclusions. Overall, the study on rifaximin does not present strong and conclusive results on the sole use of rifaximin. According to the study on the antifibrotic drugs, no compounds show evidence of prevention of the onset of the fibrosis.

259	Arterial stiffness and brain health : investigating the impact of sex-related differences	Introduction: It is well established that sex differences exist in the manifestation of vascular, cerebrovascular and cardiovascular disease. Arterial stiffness (AS), an independent predictor of cardiovascular disease (CVD), has been associated with changes in cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) and cognitive decline in aging. Specifically, older adults with increased AS show a steeper decline on executive function (EF) tasks. Decreased EF is also linked with reduction in CVR among older adults. Interestingly, the relationship between AS and CVR is more complex, where some works show decreased CVR with increased AS, and others demonstrate preserved CVR with higher AS. In addition, recent work suggests that measurements of AS may be affected by differences in the concentration of hematocrit (HCT). Here, we investigated the possible role of sex and HCT on these hemodynamic relationships. Methods: Acquisitions were completed in 48 healthy older adults (31 females, 63 ± 5 years) on a 3T MRI. Pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling using dual-echo readouts were collected during a hypercapnia challenge (5mmHg CO2 change, during two, 2 min blocks). CVR was calculated as the %∆CBF signal per mmHg change in end-tidal CO2. Aortic PWV data was acquired using a cine phase contrast velocity encoded series during 60 cardiac phases with a velocity encoding of 180cm/s through plane. PWV in the aortic arch was computed between ascending and descending aorta. Statistical analyses were done using SPSS. Results: A moderation model test controlling for age and white matter hyperintensity volume revealed a significant direct effect of PWV on CVR (β=1.630, 95% CI [.654, 2.607), as well as PWV on EF (β=-.998, 95% CI [-1.697, -.299]). Sex moderated the relationship between PWV and CVR (β=-1.013, 95% CI [-1.610, -.4169]), and PWV and EF (β=.447, 95% CI [.020, .875]). In addition, there was a significant effect of HCT on the sex differences observed in the moderation effect (PWV*SEX) on EF (β=-0.7680, SE = 0.3639 ,95% CI [-1.5047, -0.0314], p=0.0414). Conclusion: Together, our results indicate that the relationships between PWV, CVR and EF is complex and in part mediated by sex and HCT. Future work should investigate the role of hormone variations (e.g., menopause) on these relationships to better personalize CVD prevention strategies.

260	Le sang intra-péricardique et sa contribution à la fibrillation auriculaire post-opératoire en chirurgie cardiaque : une cible potentielle pour la prophylaxie?	Postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) is a common complication of cardiac surgery that is associated with increased morbidity and costs. Although numerous prophylactic measures have been evaluated, none have been universally implemented considering the risk of complications, contraindications and lack of evidence. The aim of this thesis is to examine the role of intrapericardial blood in the development of POAF after cardiac surgery and evaluate its potential as a target for prophylaxis.  For this thesis, a total of three studies were carried out. To begin, a literature review was conducted to elucidate the pathophysiological and clinical elements connecting the accumulation of shed blood within the pericardial sac to POAF. Afterwards, both a retrospective study with propensity score analysis and a randomized controlled trial were carried out to evaluate the incidence of POAF after implementing a universal postoperative chest drainage protocol using an active tube clearance (ATC) device, designed to prevent intraluminal clogging and improve drainage.  The first study concluded that the presence of intra-pericardial blood, through the activation of local and oxidative processes, is a perioperative factor triggering POAF in susceptible individuals. The second study identified the use of ATC as an independent protective factor against POAF. Finally, the last study demonstrated a 15% non-significant relative risk reduction of POAF associated with ATC.  In conclusion, an efficient pericardial drainage could reduce the incidence of POAF after cardiac surgery. However, the optimal strategy has yet to be determined.

261	Bioresorbable coronary stents : non-invasive quantitative assessment of edge and intrastent plaque – a 256-slice computed tomography longitudinal study	Coronary bioresorbable stents (BRS) are made of a bioresorbable polymer rather than metal. Unlike metallic stents, BRS do not produce significant artifacts in computed tomography (CT) and are radiolucent in CT, making it possible to evaluate coronary plaque beneath an implanted stent.  PURPOSE: The purpose of our study was to evaluate the volumes of plaque and low attenuation plaque components (LAP —a marker of plaque vulnerability) of pre-, intra- and post-stent plaque location between 1 and 12 months post-implantation.   METHODS: In our prospective longitudinal study, we recruited 27 consecutive patients (mean age 59.7 +/- 8.6 years) with bioresorbable stents (n=35) for a 256-slice ECG-synchronized CT evaluation at 1 month and at 12 months post stent implantation. Total plaque volume (mm3) as well as absolute and relative (%) LAP volume per block in the pre-, intra- and post-stent zones were analyzed; comparison of 1 and 12 months post BRS implantation. Changes in these variables were assessed using mixed effects models with and without spline, which also accounted for correlation between repeated measurements with factors such as time and zone/block (1 block = 5 mm in longitudinal axis). The value % LAP= LAP absolute volume/ total plaque volume.  RESULTS: Our block or spline model analysis showed no significant difference in plaque or LAP volumes in pre-, intra- and post-stent zones measured at 1 month and at 12 months.   CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates the feasibility of repeated non-invasive quantitative analysis of intrastent coronary plaque and in-stent lumen using a 256-channel CT scan. This pilot study did not show significant differences in plaque volume and attenuation between 1- and 12-month follow-up from stent implantation. The method we used could be applied to the evaluation of different stent structures or different pharmacological profiles of bioresorbable stents.

262	The adoption of sustainable menu practices in healthcare institutions in Quebec : a study of feasibility	Background: In many societies, as in Quebec, there is an increased interest towards sustainable food systems. Food sustainability aims to maintain human and planetary health through nutritious food, all the while promoting economic and social development. In this perspective, foodservice managers in healthcare institutions can prioritize sustainable menu practices (SMPs). As there is little research on SMPs in this context, it is of uttermost importance to understand their feasibility in healthcare institutions. Objective: This study aimed to analyze the feasibility of adopting SMPs in Quebec healthcare institutions. Methods: Following an integrated knowledge translation and exchange approach and in partnership with Nourish (McConnell Foundation), a qualitative study was carried out using semi-structured interviews with seventeen foodservice managers, recruited through purposeful sampling in ten of thirty healthcare institutions in Quebec. The revised Diffusion of innovations theory, describing the nine principal determinants of the processes of the diffusion of an innovation (SMPs) in a complex social system (healthcare organization), structured the interview guide for data collection and the codebook for data analysis.  Results: Managers report being motivated by food sustainability, however this does not always translate to concrete actions due to its lack of prioritization in foodservices. Challenges to adopt and implement SMPs are considerably more recurrent than facilitators. Key barriers include perceived SMP complexity, the context of the healthcare system, a substantial lack of resources and shortfalls in clear political directives from Ministry of Health. Amongst enhanced support and ministry guidance, foodservice managers need increased collaboration between all food system actors for better SMP adoption.  Discussion: This research contributes to in-depth understanding of the managerial experience in SMP adoption in various regional and institutional settings. Findings suggest the need for food system partnerships, as well as support and strategies that would remove important barriers in SMP adoption.

263	Investigating the localization mechanism of Bsg25D mRNA in Drosophila melanogaster	The subcellular transport and localized translation of mRNA molecules is emerging as a highly prevalent and important process for controlling asymmetric protein distribution in cells. A candidate mRNA, Bsg25D, known to localize to centrosomes and astral microtubules in Drosophila embryos during early events of embryogenesis, was selected to determine the role and importance of mRNA targeting to the mitotic apparatus during cell division. The localization of Bsg25D to centrosomes in Drosophila embryos is conserved between species such as D. melanogaster, D. simulans and D. yakuba. Bsg25D encodes a protein closely related to centrosome-associated proteins Ninein (Nin) and Ninein-like protein (Nlp) in mammalian cells. Structure function analysis revealed that the coding and 3’UTR of Bsg25D are necessary for its targeting pattern, suggesting that a cis-regulatory motif that drives its localization, is in the coding + 3’ UTR region.

264	Implantation d’un dépistage des difficultés sexuelles auprès d’une clientèle en réadaptation suivant un accident vasculaire cérébral : une étude de faisabilité.	Objectives: Examine the factors that could affect the implementation of a Sexual Difficulty Screening tool (SDS) in stroke rehabilitation, the clients’ needs regarding sexual rehabilitation and related professional roles with clinicians. Methodology: A mixed research design was used in a rehabilitation hospital, where the SDS was implemented for four months. The number of times the SDS was administered and the clinicians' level of comfort in addressing sexuality before and after implementation were measured. The perceived factors influencing the implementation, as well as clients’ needs and professional roles, were gathered through interviews and group discussions with five stroke clients, 15 clinicians and a coordinator. Results: The SDS was used 28 times during the study. The clinicians' level of comfort improved significantly (p = 0.001) post-implementation. The influencing factors were grouped into four themes: the acceptability of the SDS, the individual characteristics of participants, the context of the rehabilitation hospital and the implementation process. Clients’ needs were variable, from the absence of rehabilitation needs to the need for more information regarding sexuality and a safe environment to experiment their own sexuality. Occupational, physical and speech therapists reported they could contribute to sexual rehabilitation post-stroke but emphasized the importance of an interdisciplinary approach. Conclusion: Several types of factors, some of which could be modified, influenced the implementation of the SDS. Clients’ sexual rehabilitation needs and clinicians’ professional contribution have been clarified. Training and access to specialized sexuality resources would be important for supporting clinicians in future studies on the subject.

265	Justice pénale internationale : la lutte contre l’impunité en tant qu’impératif moral	The fight against impunity as conducted by the International Criminal Court is criticized and controversial. The actions of the international criminal institution are perceived by its critics as renewing forms of racism, ethnocentrism, imperialism, neocolonialism, authoritarianism that fundamentally corrupt the aspiration to justice. Paradoxically, the need for international criminal justice is understood as an imperative of peace and justice. This research examines the justifications for such a moral imperative. It starts from the assumption that it is categorical and comes from an ethical approach to ethics. The justifications for such an assumption rest analysis of the different historical contexts that have seen the affirmation or re-affirmation of a categorical rejection of crimes of inhumanity (Article 5 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court: the crime of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, crimes of aggression). These condemnations laid the foundations for an ethic of universal significance and recognized humanity as a universal moral community. Thus, despite moral and ethical particularisms, the philosophical foundations of the fight against impunity is based on a moral universalism and the regulating idea of an ethical contract linking the community of states and peoples. It is about being and making humanity. Therefore, in spite of; realistic theories of international relations suggesting both the amorality of inter-state relations, prudential motivations and instrumental rationality (morality of interest), despite the culturalist perspectives that testify to moral and ethical pluralism, we want to show that the fight against impunity is above all an universalizable moral duty (based on the principle of dignity) of a deontological nature (even if this struggle also implies consequentialist considerations). Given the complexity of this issue, our research will be transdisciplinary; and our approach combines inductivism and deductivism.

This process, consisting of transposing electronic models into instrumental music, appeared shortly after the creation of the Westdeutscher Rundfunk (WDR) and Groupe de Recherche Musicale (GRM) studios. This dissertation addresses the origin and evolution of this approach, its possible forms and examples of its dissemination in contemporary music. Four new pieces, created during this master's degree, further explore the idea of hauntological instrumental music, inspired by audio artifacts from the defective analog and digital recording media.

267	Morsures canines et expositions à la rage au Nunavik : épidémiologie, gestion et différences liées à l'âge	In Nunavik, arctic fox rabies is still endemic and dog bites represent a considerable source for human exposure, nevertheless, we are lacking scientific evidence to guide management and prevention strategies in this particular socio-cultural context.   In the present study, we analyze cases of declared animal bites that were reported to the Nunavik Regional Health Board (NRHB) from 2008 to 2017, taking into account the specific and global context, as well as the differences between children and adults in order to retrieve accurate, contextual and reliable information to guide future control and prevention strategies. Over the ten year period, 320 cases of animal related injuries were reported with an important increase during the study period. Over 90% of these cases involved dogs. The annual incidence was higher than previously reported in other regions in Canada and the United States (US). The spatial distribution, for potential human exposures to rabies as well as animal rabies cases, was different between the villages of Hudson Bay and Ungava Bay.  Two main victim profiles have emerged through the analysis, namely children under 15 years old (y/o) who were most likely to be exposed in the head and neck, mostly during play and young male adults through activities such as mushing and hunting; these differences should be considered and targeted in prevention strategies as risk factors. During the study period, 15 rabid animals were identified. Although positivity rate was higher among wildlife, most confirmed human exposures occurred with a dog (60%). These results sustain the importance of dog bites as a public health issue in Inuit communities of Nunavik and highlight the need for preventive approaches that are adapted to the context.

268	Impact of asthma education and/or specialized asthma care on subsequent morbidity in asthmatic children	Background: Randomized controlled trials have shown that asthma education alone or in combination with medical review reduces the risk of subsequent emergency department (ED) visits. Nevertheless, asthma education and specialized care often provided in different settings, which increases the implementation burden in clinical practice. Objectives: In children referred to the Asthma Education Centre (AEC) following an ED visit for asthma, the primary objective was to evaluate the real-life individual and combined impact of an AEC visit and specialized asthma care (SAC) visit on a subsequent ED visit for asthma over the following year. Methods: Retrospective cohort study of children referred to the AEC in the year following an ED visit for asthma. The time to subsequent ED visit for asthma was analyzed by a Cox proportional hazards model with time-varying exposures (AEC and SAC). Results: Compared to the children who did not receive any of the exposures, those who had exposure to AEC alone [Hazard Ratio (HR) =0.68, CI 95% 0.53-0.86] or with SAC (HR=0.43, CI 95% 0.34-0.53) had a decreased risk of an earlier subsequent ED visit. Exposure to SAC alone did not have a statistically significant effect on a subsequent asthma visit for asthma Conclusion: In a cohort of children referred to the AEC following an ED visit for asthma, receiving asthma education with or without specialized care was associated with protection against a subsequent ED visit for asthma.	asthma , children , education , specialized care , specialist	en	23586.0
269	Apprendre à collaborer en équipe interprofessionnelle et à développer les compétences de la pratique collaborative et de partenariat patient en santé et services sociaux dans un cours universitaire hybride à l’ère du numérique	Collaboration among health professionals is required to contend with population aging, the prevalence of chronic illnesses, and staff shortages in certain health professions (WHO, 2010). As well, to foster optimal collaboration and provide good quality of care, some teams are now adopting a patient partnership approach in which the patient’s experiential knowledge of living with illness is valued as part of the interprofessional collaboration and the patient is integrated into the healthcare team. The Université de Montréal (UdeM) offers a program in interprofessional collaboration education (IPE) geared towards teaching the competencies required for collaborative practice in both health sciences and psychosocial sciences in partnership with patients. The IPE is confronted with a variety of challenges related to logistics, communication, and the compartmentalization of professions, among others. To overcome these obstacles, the UdeM has turned to digital technology to help interprofessional teams of students to collaborate online and in person. This study focused on describing how students in interprofessional teams collaborate in the hybrid course entitled Health Sciences Collaboration in Partnership with Patients, offered by the UdeM. We describe how students collaborate online and in the classroom, and we identify the competencies in the competency framework used. Our study proposes a conceptual framework based on the IPE’s hybrid (online and in person) collaborative learning model, which we constructed using: 1) the model of Chiocchio, Grenier, O’Neill, Savaria, and Willms (2012), to describe how the student teams collaborate and used dimensions of collaboration (communication, synchronisation, explicit and implicit coordination) ; 2) the competency framework for collaborative practice and patient partnership in health and social services (Direction collaboration et partenariat patient [DCPP] and Comité interfacultaire opérationnel de formation à la collaboration, l’Université de Montréal [CIO-UdeM], 2016); and 3) the interprofessional work typology of Xyrichis, Reeves, and Zwarenstein (2018). Our study used a convergent mixed methodology. We conducted this study with a cohort of 1,435 second-year undergraduate students in course CSS2900 coming from 13 20 different UdeM programs. This course is divided in three parts: 1) online training 2) intra- program activity, 3) interprofessional workshop coanimated by a health professional and patient-partner facilitator in classroom. First, we analyzed the online collaboration journal (OCJ) of 12 interprofessional student teams (n = 60). Second, we distributed a questionnaire on Collaboration in Interprofessional Teams to the entire cohort at the end of the course, to which 321 participants responded. The results show that the majority of study participants used the dimensions of collaboration in a similar manner online and in person. Communication and coordination were dependent on synchronization when collaboration occurred online. The use of both social media and an online collaborative writing tool fostered collaboration in hybrid mode. In the classroom, the patient-partner co-facilitator supported the teams as they reviewed their learning (coordination) and, in this way, developed the competencies of the framework for course CSS2900. Under the hybrid study model, the teams were able to collaborate over an extended period, similar to a flipped classroom approach (Figure 29). This fostered development of the framework competencies (DCPP and CIO-UdeM) and helped break down professional boundaries. The learning contexts in which effective competency practices were mobilized appeared analogous to the interprofessional networking and consultative collaboration categories in the typology of Xyrichis et al.

270	Exploration, sous l’angle de l’approche de la déviance positive, des pratiques cliniques d’infirmières au regard de l’hygiène des mains et des facteurs qui les influencent en contexte hospitalier québécois	Many approaches have been advocated over time to improve nurses’ hand hygiene adherence rates in order to prevent healthcare-associated infections – nosocomial infections. Nevertheless, these rates have been and continue to be low in Québec (Lacoursière, 2018), as they are everywhere else (Stella et al., 2019). In the mid-1980s, a behavioural change approach – positive deviance – appeared in public health literature. This approach proposes to identify the presence of positive deviants – individuals or groups who outperform others – and to explore the factors that explain the better performance, in order to develop ways to encourage change among other individuals or groups (Bradley et al., 2009). Although studies using the positive deviance approach have been published in the nursing literature, it is unclear whether this approach can be applied to nursing practice with regard to hand hygiene. The purpose of this study was to explore, from the perspective of the positive deviance approach, the clinical nursing practices related to hand hygiene and the factors that influence them in a Québec hospital setting, as well as to examine the applicability of this approach to hand hygiene in nursing practice. To this end, we conducted two focused ethnographies with 21 nurses on two care units (a medical surgery unit and a palliative care unit) at a university hospital centre in the Montréal region. These two units were chosen because the nurses’ hand hygiene adherence rates were higher than their colleagues’ rates on other care units at the same hospital centre. The data were collected from January to October 2015, mainly through 18 individual interviews and 14 shadowing periods. An observation grid was used to record the contextual details. According to the method described by Patton (2002, 2015), all the collected data were coded and grouped under categories and then a frequency analysis of the codes was carried out in order to allow interpretation.  The results of this study show that the clinical practices are similar on both healthcare units; the participants use mainly hydro-alcoholic solutions before entering and leaving the patients’ rooms. Some of the factors that explain the higher hand hygiene adherence rates are shared by both care teams. On the individual level, the participants recognize the importance of having knowledge about the role of hand hygiene to prevent the transmission of infections, protect themselves and protect the patients; on the organizational level, there is a collaborative practice within each team; on the environmental level, the accessibility and availability of the hydro-alcoholic solution distributors greatly facilitate hand hygiene practices; on the sociopolitical level, both teams are facing cuts under the health reform and uncertainty related to a move to a new hospital; on the cultural level, the members of both teams work together toward a common goal, which we called “social cohesion” as described by Kwok et al. (2017). However, the factors that lead to this cohesion differ in each team. On the medical surgery unit, the leadership of the head nurse mobilizes the team to improve their hand hygiene adherence rates. On the palliative care unit, the team shares a humanist care practice to protect patients who are at the end of their lives. This led us to postulate that positive deviance applies to a care team – not just to individuals – who are working together to protect patients from healthcare-associated infections.   The knowledge from this study suggests that to improve nurses’ hand hygiene adherence, it would be preferable to target the care teams that perform best, to develop interventions that include factors on several levels, not just the individual level, and to increase human and financial resources.

271	Characterization of carotid artery plaques using noninvasive vascular ultrasound elastography	Atherosclerosis is a complex vascular disease that affects artery walls (by thickening) and lumens (by plaque formation). The rupture of a carotid artery plaque may also induce ischemic stroke and complications. Despite the use of several medical imaging modalities to evaluate the stability of a plaque, they present limitations such as irradiation, invasive property, low clinical availability and high cost. Ultrasound is a safe imaging method with a real time capability for assessment of biological tissues. It is clinically used for early screening and diagnosis of carotid artery plaques. However, current vascular ultrasound technologies only identify the morphology of a plaque in terms of echo brightness or the impact of the vessel narrowing on flow properties, which may not be sufficient for optimum diagnosis. Noninvasive vascular elastography (NIVE) has been shown of interest for determining the stability of a plaque. Specifically, NIVE can determine the strain field of the moving vessel wall of a carotid artery caused by the natural cardiac pulsation. Due to Young’s modulus differences among different vessel tissues, different components of a plaque can be detected as they present different strains thereby potentially helping in characterizing the plaque stability.  Currently, sub-optimum performance and computational efficiency limit the clinical acceptance of NIVE as a fast and efficient method for the early diagnosis of vulnerable plaques. Therefore, there is a need to further develop NIVE as a non-invasive, fast and low computational cost imaging tool to better characterize the plaque vulnerability. The procedure to perform NIVE analysis consists in image formation and image post-processing steps. This thesis aimed to systematically improve the accuracy of these two aspects of NIVE to facilitate predicting carotid plaque vulnerability.  The first effort of this thesis has been targeted on improving the image formation (Chapter 5). Transverse oscillation beamforming was introduced into NIVE. The performance of transverse oscillation imaging coupled with two model-based strain estimators, the affine phase-based estimator (APBE) and the Lagrangian speckle model estimator (LSME), were evaluated. For all simulations and in vitro studies, the LSME without transverse oscillation imaging outperformed the APBE with transverse oscillation imaging. Nonetheless, comparable or better principal strain estimates could be obtained with the LSME using transverse oscillation imaging in the case of complex and heterogeneous tissue structures.  During the acquisition of ultrasound signals for image formation, out-of-plane motions which are perpendicular to the two-dimensional (2-D) scan plane are existing. The second objective of this thesis was to evaluate the influence of out-of-plane motions on the performance of 2-D NIVE (Chapter 6). For this purpose, we designed an in vitro experimental setup to simulate out-of-plane motions of 1 mm, 2 mm and 3 mm. The in vitro results showed more strain estimation artifacts for the LSME with increasing magnitudes of out-of-plane motions. Even so, robust strain estimations were nevertheless obtained with 2.0 mm out-of-plane motion (correlation coefficients higher than 0.85). For a clinical dataset of 18 participants with carotid artery stenosis, we proposed to use two datasets of scans on the same carotid plaque, one cross-sectional and the other in a longitudinal view, to deduce the out-of-plane motions (estimated to be ranging from 0.25 mm to 1.04 mm). Clinical results showed that strain estimations remained reproducible for all motion magnitudes since inter-frame correlation coefficients were higher than 0.70, and normalized cross-correlations between radiofrequency images were above 0.93, which indicated that confident motion estimations can be obtained when analyzing clinical dataset of carotid plaques using the LSME.  Finally, regarding the image post-processing component of NIVE algorithms to estimate strains of vessel walls from reconstructed images with the objective of identifying soft and hard tissues, we developed a strain estimation method with a pixel-wise resolution as well as a high computation efficiency for improving NIVE (Chapter 7). We proposed a sparse model strain estimator (SMSE) for which the dense strain field is parameterized with Discrete Cosine Transform descriptions, thereby deriving affine strain components (axial and lateral strains and shears) without mathematical derivative operations. Compared with the LSME, the SMSE reduced estimation errors in simulations, in vitro and in vivo tests. Moreover, the sparse implementation of the SMSE reduced the processing time by a factor of 4 to 25 compared with the LSME based on simulations, in vitro and in vivo results, which is suggesting a possible implementation of NIVE in real time.

272	Contrôle circadien de la réponse des lymphocytes T CD8 à la présentation antigénique	Circadian rhythms control various aspects of the physiology in mammals. Among these processes, circadian clocks control the innate and the adaptive immune responses. Since few decades, numerous studies started to uncover the role of the circadian system in the immune response. However, the circadian control of the adaptive immune response remains poorly studied. My PhD work focused on the circadian control of the CD8 T cell response to vaccination by dendritic cells. Erin E. Fortier et al. published in The Journal of Immunology that wild type mice vaccinated with antigen presenting cells loaded with the OVA peptide present a day/night variation of the CD8 T cell response after a vaccination done during the middle of the day (zeitgeber time (ZT) 6) compared to a vaccination done during the middle of the night (ZT18)1. Indeed, the proportion of CD8 KbOVA+ cells and the proportion of CD8 CD44hi IFN+ T cells were higher during the middle of the day than the middle of the night. However, this work showed a diurnal but not a circadian rhythm, that remained to be confirmed. The first part of my PhD research confirmed a role of the circadian system in the rhythm of the CD8 T cell response to vaccination. We showed a contribution of the dendritic cell clock as well as an essential role of the CD8 T cell clock. Moreover, this rhythm impacts the ability to control an infectious challenge as shown by a circadian variation in bacterial load (Listeria monocytogenes) in wild type but not in mice lacking clock in mature CD8 T cells. The second part of my research focused on the analysis of the transcriptome of CD8 T cells from naive mice collected every 4 hours over 48 hours. We showed that CD8 T cells are more prone to be activated during the day and at the opposite are more prone to be inhibited during the night. These results are correlated with the rhythm of the CD8 T cell response to vaccination. Finally, during the third part of my PhD, we confirmed that the rhythm of the CD8 T cell response to antigen presentation was acting at the early stage of the CD8 T cell activation. We used wild type mice reconstituted with bone marrow cells containing 1% of OT-I precursor cells (CD8 T cells restricted for the KbOVA complex, expressing the receptor chain of the TCR for the OVA peptide, V5) and vaccinate these mice during the middle of the subjective day (CT6) or during the middle of the subjective night (CT18). At the early stage of the CD8 T cell response to vaccination, we showed a higher expression of several activation markers after a vaccination done during the middle of the day than during the middle of the night, such as CD5, CD69, IRF4 and the phosphorylation of S6 (marker of the mTOR activity) and AKT. Altogether, my PhD work highlights a new mechanism involving the circadian system in the control of the immune response. A better understanding of how circadian clocks act on the immune response will allow implementing new treatment strategies in order to increase their efficacy as well as to decrease side effects.

273	Les cellules dendritiques mérocytiques : un nouveau sous-type de cellules dendritiques conventionnelles spécifiquement régulée par Bim	Unlike other conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) subtypes, presentation of peptides derived from apoptotic bodies by merocytic dendritic cells (mcDCs) is associated with a break of tolerance. Presentation of peptides derived from pancreatic beta cells by mcDC is linked to diabetes induction. However, when loaded with peptides derived from tumor cells, they allow the reactivation of T cells and the elimination of the tumor. These properties specific to mcDC highlight new aspects in the control of break of tolerance. Understanding their relationships with other DCs and their regulation is important for understanding the mechanisms associated with immune tolerance. We have determined that mcDCs are cDCs. mcDCs are short-lived cells able to induce an allogeneic response. They express the specific cDC transcription factor, Zbtb46. mcDCs are differentiated from the cDC common precursors. They express and require IRF-4 for their homeostasis, a transcription factor associated with cDC2 differentiation. However, the proximity of mcDC to cDC2 differs in terms of metabolism where they have different signatures. mcDCs are found in greater numbers in the mouse model of spontaneous autoimmune diabetes (NOD) than in a resistant line (C57BL/6). Our laboratory validated that the Idd13 locus of chromosome 2 was linked to mcDC number, thus suggesting that one or more genes of this locus have a role in regulating the number of mcDC. By targeting polymorphic genes between the NOD and C57BL/6 mice, we determined that Bim gene, encoding a pro-apoptotic molecule, regulate specifically mcDC in a bone marrow intrinsic manner. Therefore, mcDCs are a subset of cDCs specifically regulated by Bim. This subtype of cDCs is a key player in break of tolerance and understanding their homeostasis is important in determining their role in immune tolerance.

274	Hedgehog interacting protein (Hhip) regulates both pancreatic and renal dysfunction in high fat diet-induced obese mouse model	Hedgehog interacting protein (Hhip), a signaling molecule in the Hedgehog Hh pathway, was originally discovered as a putative antagonist of all 3 secreted Hh ligands, i.e., Sonic (Shh), Indian (Ihh), and Desert (Dhh).  Hhip regulates cell function via either canonical- or non-canonical Hh pathway. Hhip encodes a protein of 700 amino acids, and is abundantly expressed in vascular endothelial cell-rich tissues, including the pancreas, and kidneys. To date, less is known about Hhip’s expression pattern in mature islet cells, and its function under normal and/or disease conditions, such as diet induced-obesity, as well as its role in chronic kidney disease, and kidney dysfunction. Hhip null mice (Hhip-/-) display markedly impaired pancreatic islet formation (45% reduction of islet mass with a decrease of beta cell proliferation by 40%), however Hhip-/- mice die shortly after birth mainly due to lung defects.  In our first study, we systemically studied the role of pancreatic Hhip expression by using a whole body knock out in response to 8 weeks high fat diet (HFD) insult, and HFD-mediated beta cell dysfunction in vivo, ex vivo and in vitro using heterozygous (Hhip+/-) vs. wild type (Hhip+/+) mice. Both HFD-fed Hhip+/+ male and female mice developed severe glucose intolerance (IPGTT), which was ameliorated in male and female HFD-Hhip+/- mice. Associated with this glucose intolerance, was hyperinsulinemia, which was observed only in HFD-fed male Hhip+/- mice. HFD-fed Hhip+/- mice had high levels of circulating plasma insulin in both insulin secretion phases compared to HFD fed Hhip+/+ mice. In the pancreas, Hhip expression was increased in the islets of HFD-Hhip+/+ mice, mainly co-localized in beta cells and none in alpha cells. While maintaining the total islet number, and beta cell mass, male HFD-Hhip+/+ mice had a higher number of larger islets, in which insulin content was reduced; islet architecture was disoriented, with evident invasion of alpha cells into the central core of beta cells; and an evident increase in oxidative stress markers (8-OHdG and NADPH oxidase 2 (Nox 2)). In contrast, male HFD-Hhip+/- mice had a higher number of smaller islets, with increased beta cell proliferation, pronounced glucose stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), ameliorated oxidative stress and preserved islet integrity. In vitro, recombinant Hhip (rHhip) dose-dependently increased oxidative stress (Nox2 and NADPH activity), and decreased the number of insulin-positive beta cells, while siRNA-Hhip enhanced GSIS, and abolished the stimulation of sodium palmitate (PA)-BSA on Nox2 gene expression. We believe our data highlights a novel finding as to how pancreatic Hhip gene inhibits insulin secretion, by altering islet integrity, and promoting Nox2 gene expression in beta cells in response to HFD-mediated beta cell dysfunction. Diabetes presents high risk factors associated with complications such as chronic kidney disease (CKD) characterized by a gradual loss in kidney function. The increased incidence of diabetic related kidney complications has been recently correlated with increase rate of obesity. We recently established that impaired nephrogenesis in kidneys of offsprings of our murine model of maternal diabetes was associated with upregulation of Hhip gene expression [127]. Subsequently, our recent data also shows that hyperglycemia induced increased renal Hhip gene expression in adult murine kidneys leading to apoptosis of glomerular epithelial cells and endothelial to mesenchymal transition (Endo-MT) - related renal fibrosis [128].  In this current study, we demonstrated how Hhip overexpression in renal proximal tubular cells, contributes to early development of chronic kidney disease after 14 weeks of HFD. Mice in HFD-fed groups showed significantly greater weight gain as compared to mice in ND fed groups. IPGTT revealed that HFD fed mice also developed glucose intolerance, with no apparent changes in insulin sensitivity. HFD did not impact hypertension, even though we had a modest trend of increase in perirenal fat deposit in the HFD fed subgroups. Renal function as measured by the glomerular filtration rate was normal in all four subgroups, indicating that neither HFD, nor Hhip overexpression promoted renal hyperfiltration. Nonetheless, renal morphology revealed HFD kidneys had subclinical injury, presented signs of tubular vacuolization and damage compared to ND fed mice. This pathology of tubular damage and vacuolization was more pronounced in HFD-fed transgenic (Hhip-Tg) mice compared to non-Tg mice, and this promoted mild tubular cell apoptosis and enhanced oxidative stress. In conclusion, HFD feeding-induced obesity led to detrimental effects on glucose toleranc,e and mild morphological changes in kidneys, characterized by the presence of osmotic nephrosis, increased renal oxidative stress, and apoptosis which might be mediated by an increase in renal FABP4. This was exacerbated by the over-expression of Hhip in the renal proximal tubules.	High Fat Diet , Hhip Gene Expression , Pancreatic beta Cell Dysfunction , Kidney Dysfuntion	en	23524.0
275	Marais de saules à effluent nul pour le traitement d'eau contaminée	During the last decades, a type of constructed wetlands, usually planted with willows, was developed to operate a water treatment system with zero effluent, by evapotranspiration. These zero liquid discharge wetlands are typically used for domestic wastewater treatment, but could also be an attractive alternative for other applications, such as contaminated leachate treatment. However, the design guidelines currently available do not allow for the design of a flexible system that would manage the large variations of volume to be treated related to the very nature of leachates (i.e. produced entirely from precipitation) and do not take into account inter and intra-annual variation of willows evapotranspiration (ET). This thesis first presents a literature review of ET for the genus Salix and its most important driving factors. It appears that growing conditions are more important than species identity and that water availability, fertilization and contamination are the main factors dictating ET in willow. The effect of age, experimental context, planting density, and soil type could not be clearly demonstrated by this review. Then, a study on the potential ET of S. miyabeana 'SX67' is presented. It is shown that a model based on foliar parameters and on the water vapor pressure deficit in the air makes it possible to predict the ET of S. miyabeana under wetland conditions. This study will, among other things, improve the design plans for a potential zero effluent willow wetland. To continue, the response of S. miyabeana 'SX67' to different leachate concentrations and different types of substrates was studied. This cultivar has been tolerant of raw leachate concentrations found at a treated wood pole storage site. The type of substrate influenced the willow response and ecophysiological performance, and affected the dynamics of the contaminants. Finally, the hydrological modelling of a system with zero effluent by willow bed makes it possible to propose a method of dimensioning for the different compartments of the system in order to reach a zero effluent objective over a period of 20 years, as well as to propose solutions for optimal design and operation. The application of the model to the specific case of a treated wood pole storage site made it possible to assess the hydrological feasibility of this technology in the climate context of southern Quebec. On the basis of this study, the main limit for the application of zero effluent willow bed in Quebec is the wetland area and the storage volume required. In the case where an effective pre-treatment step precedes the willow bed, the life of the wetland should not be limiting and will depend mainly on the lifespan of the plants. However, the fate of the contaminants in the system, be it the disposition of the accumulated contaminants at the pre-treatment stage or a possible translocation of contaminants into the aerial parts of the plants, should be considered before establishing a system with zero effluent. The results of this research make it possible, among other things, to propose zero-effluent willow wetlands as an interesting alternative for the treatment of contaminated water in Quebec.

276	Investigating the comparative effects of adaptation on supra and infragranular layers with visual and acoustic stimulation in cat’s visual cortex	In the cat primary visual cortex (V1 or area17), neurons fundamentally respond to orientations of the objects in the outside world. Neurons responding to specific orientations form the orientation columns in V1. A neuron responding to a horizontal orientation will get optimally excited towards the outline of a horizontal object. This feature of the visual cortex known as orientation selectivity has been continuously explored to study the effects of adaptation. Following a training paradigm called adaptation, the same neuron that was inherently responding to the horizontal orientation will respond to an oblique orientation. In this thesis, we seek to examine the orientation tuning properties of individual neurons in superficial and deeper layers of V1 in different adaptation environments. Due to the extensive interconnectivity between V1 neurons, we hypothesize that not only do individual neurons get affected by adaptation paradigm, but the whole cortex is reprogramed.  To this aim, extracellular recordings were performed in conventionally prepared anesthetized cats. Neural activities were recorded simultaneously from layer 2/3 and layer 5/6 using a tungsten multichannel electrode. Neurons were adapted with a visual adapter (visual adaptation) and a repetitive sound (sound adaptation) in two different settings. Both types of adaptations were performed uninterrupted for 12 minutes. In both settings, sine-wave drifting gratings were presented to evoke responses in V1 and generate tuning curves from the recorded multiunit activity. The functional connectivity between the recorded neurons was revealed by computing cross-correlation between individual neuron pairs. In response to visual adaptation, layer 2/3 and 5/6 neurons displayed classical attractive and repulsive shifts. On comparing the behaviour of the neurons in either layer, an equivalent tendency was observed. Cross-correlograms between the spike trains of neurons in layers 2/3 and 5/6 revealed synchronized firing between the neurons suggesting coordinated dynamics of the co-active neurons and their functional connections. During sound adaptation, where the visual adapter was completely absent, shifts in the tuning curves were observed in either layer indicating a novel orientation selectivity. However, it is noteworthy that cells in both layers shifted in opposite directions indicating independent behaviour. V1 neurons might have an additional role besides processing visual stimuli. The visual neurons may have demonstrated multisensory properties when stimulated indirectly through neighbouring sensory regions. Our results indicate that primary visual neurons can be evoked by direct or indirect stimulation. The difference in the responses of layer 2/3 and layer 5/6 neurons towards the different adaptation environments indicate that neurons in V1 may behave similar or different towards the different sensory stimulus. This suggests that V1 responses are stimulus dependent. Additionally, the synchronized firing of layer 2/3 and layer 5/6 neurons towards visual adapter signify an existence of functional connectivity between the neuron pairs. Together, it can be summarised that visual neurons undergo an alteration of selectivity by building new orientation maps that ultimately potentiates plasticity within sensory regions that are highly suggestive of entire cortex being multisensory.	adaptation , corrélation , Visual cortex , Plasticity , Orientation selectivity , Multisensory , Functional connectivity	en	23495.0
277	Résilience et vieillissement cognitif : une approche de modération en neuro-imagerie structurelle et fonctionnelle	"Many changes to the brain occur in normal aging, both structurally and functionally. These changes most often result in a certain deterioration of cognitive functioning, and thus affect the quality of life of the elderly. It appears, however, that some people are relatively spared and manage to maintain a comparatively high level of cognitive functioning despite advancing in age. In the presence of an acceleration of population aging, there is a striking need to understand the factors and neurobiological mechanisms that may contribute to this better resilience to the effects of aging on the brain and on cognition. Although several models have attempted to account for this phenomenon, the understanding of the mechanisms that underpin it is still relatively incomplete. The main objective of this thesis was to expose the neurobiological correlates associated with a better resilience to the effects of normal aging on the brain and cognition, through structural (MRI) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). This thesis contains four articles. The intention of the first article (Chapter II) was to synthesize knowledge about the mechanisms involved in the resilience against the degenerative effects of normal aging on cognition. In this literature review, we were interested in the two main models attempting to account for this protective phenomenon: the brain reserve and cognitive reserve. Examining the empirical literature leads to the conclusion that better resilience might be based on both structural and functional brain differences, and therefore that the two proposed models could make an independent contribution to the resilience phenomenon. In addition, we hypothesize that the correlates of resilience are very similar to the brain differences associated with cognitive training. The following three articles are empirical articles which focus on working memory, a function that declines with age but shows significant inter-individual differences. The purpose of the second article (Chapter III) was to investigate the relationship between education, a well-established reserve proxy, and the regional volume of gray matter, as well as between education and brain activation during a working memory task in cognitively healthy elderly participants. Results indicate that higher years of education are associated with lower age-related loss of volume in the frontal and parietal areas, as well as greater age-related activation in some prefrontal regions that are part of the working memory network. The third study (Chapter IV) sought to examine whether functional education-related brain differences are compatible with neuronal efficiency and/or flexibility mechanisms. It further aimed to examine the ""protective"" effect of these functional differences on working memory performance. The results suggest that the two proposed mechanisms would be associated with a better preservation of working memory in the face of the effects of age, but that their respective involvement would depend on the level of the task requirement. Finally, the objective of the fourth study (Chapter V) was to first test the relationship between engagement in a stimulating lifestyle and white matter integrity maintaining. Then, the study aimed to examine whether greater white matter integrity decreased the impact of age on working memory. The results of the study suggest that a more stimulating lifestyle would be associated with a lesser age-related white matter lesions volume, and that this smaller white matter lesions volume would in turn be associated with better working memory performance."

278	Difficultés neurocognitives et fonctionnement cérébral chez des survivants de la leucémie lymphoblastique aiguë pédiatrique	Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most prevalent cancer in children. Today, the survival rate of ALL is very high, mainly because of the efficiency of contemporary treatment protocols. However, several studies report neurocognitive deficits, neuroanatomical damage and neurofunctional particularities in that population. These deficits can affect quality of life as well as academic and professional achievement. The aim of the present thesis was to study the neurocognitive profile and neuronal functioning of survivors of ALL. This thesis includes three articles, one review article and two empirical articles. Our first article aimed at summarizing frequent neurocognitive difficulties and neuroanatomical damage present in ALL survivors. Our review shows that several deficits are seen in that population. Regarding cognition, executive difficulties are the most frequently reported. Amongst them, short-term memory is one of the most affected neurocognitive function. Regarding neuroanatomical damages, cerebral white matter integrity is frequently altered in that population. Moreover, these difficulties persist many years after the end of treatments. In some cases, the gravity of these deficits can even increase with passing years after diagnosis. Nevertheless, few studies have investigated long-term adult survivors, more than a decade after diagnosis. Our second article first describes the neurocognitive profile of a cohort of adolescent and adult ALL survivors. Our results suggest a high incidence of deficits in working memory, phonological verbal fluency, cognitive flexibility and visuo-motor coordination. We also aimed at validating a brief neurocognitive screening procedure in a sub-population of the same cohort, composed uniquely of adult ALL survivors: the DIVERGT screening procedure. Our results showed that the DIVERGT accurately predicted general intellectual functioning, mathematics and verbal memory. The procedure had acceptable sensitivity, specificity, and excellent negative predictive value (NPV) for the screening of difficulties in multiple neurocognitive domains. Therefore, the DIVERGT could easily be used during routine examination in adult ALL survivors and, improve the quality of cancer related long-term follow-up. Because deficits in short-term memory/ working memory are frequent in ALL survivors, we investigated neural correlates of visual short-term memory (VSTM) in that population, using magnetoencephalography (MEG) as part of our third article. Comparing ALL survivors results with healthy subjects, we aimed at uncovering VSTM related brain activation anomalies in our clinical population. Our results showed that performance in VSTM was similar between controls and survivors. However, atypical brain activation was found in multiple brain regions in ALL survivors. They displayed an over activation of regions that are usually involved in VSTM: lateral occipital, precentral and postcentral gyri, as well as regions that are not usually involved in VSTM: superior and middle temporal region and supramarginal gyrus. A sub-activation of the inferior frontal region was also found. Our results suggest the existence of compensatory neural mechanisms in ALL survivors, allowing them to perform as healthy subjects. Last, we showed that these patterns of activation were modulated by the age of onset, a well-known risk factor for the development of neurocognitive deficits. Activity was reduced in participants who were younger at the time of diagnosis. Altogether, these results highlight the importance of studying neurocognitive and neuronal functioning in ALL survivors, as well as the factors that can modulate their efficacy.		en	23480.0
279	Stochastic optimization of staffing for multiskill call centers	In this thesis, we study the staffing optimization problem in multiskill call centers, in which we aim at minimizing the operating cost while delivering a high quality of service (QoS) to customers. We also introduce the use of chance constraints which require that the QoSs are met with a given probability. These constraints are adequate in the case when the performance is measured over a short time interval as QoS measures are random variables in a given time period. The proposed staffing problems are challenging in the sense that the stochastic constraints have no-closed forms and need to be approximated by simulation. In addition, the QoS functions are typically non-linear and non-convex. We consider   staffing optimization problems in different settings and study the proposed models in both theoretical and practical aspects. The methodologies developed are general, in the sense that they can be adapted and applied to other staffing/scheduling problems in queuing-based systems.   The thesis consists of three articles dealing with different challenges in modeling and solving staffing optimization problems in multiskill call centers. The first and second articles concern a two-stage staffing optimization problem under uncertainty. While in the first one, we study a general two-stage discrete stochastic programming model to provide a theoretical guarantee for the consistency of the sample average approximation (SAA) when the sample sizes go to infinity, the second one applies the SAA approach to solve the two-stage staffing optimization problem under arrival rate uncertainty. Both papers indicate the viability of the SAA approach in our context, in both theoretical and practical aspects.  To be more precise, in the first article, we consider a general two-stage discrete stochastic problem with expected value constraints. We formulate  its SAA with nested sampling. We show that under some assumptions that hold in call center examples, one can obtain the optimal solutions of the original problem by solving its SAA with large enough sample sizes. Moreover, we show that the probability that the optimal solution of the sample problem is an optimal solution of the original problem, approaches one exponentially fast as we increase the sample sizes. These theoretical findings are important, not only for call center applications, but also for other decision-making problems with discrete decision variables.   The second article concerns solution methods to solve a two-stage staffing problem under arrival rate uncertainty. It is motivated by the fact that the SAA version of the two-stage staffing problem becomes expensive to solve with a large number of scenarios, as for each scenario, one needs to use simulation to approximate the QoS constraints. We develop an algorithm that combines simulation, cut generation, cut strengthening and Benders decomposition to solve the SAA problem. We show the efficiency of the approach, especially when the number of scenarios is large.   In the last article, we consider problems with chance constraints on the service level measures. Our methodology proposed in this article is motivated by the fact that the QoS functions generally display ``S-shape'' curves and might be well approximated by appropriate sigmoid functions. Based on this idea, we develop a novel approach that combines non-linear regression, simulation and trust region local search to efficiently solve large-scale staffing problems in a viable way. The main advantage of the approach is that the optimization procedure can be formulated as a sequence of steps of performing simulation and solving linear programming models. Numerical results based on real-life call center examples show the practical viability of our approach.  The methodologies developed in this thesis can be applied in many other settings, e.g., staffing and scheduling problems in other queuing-based systems with other types of QoS constraints. These also raise several research directions that might be interesting to investigate.

In doing so, we hope to improve our understanding of these relationships and interactions with this species in order to adapt management policies and improve their fit with society’s needs and the local socio-cultural context. On the one hand, this study explores relations between First Nation peoples and the wolverine as well as the perceptions and social representations of this species by different societal groups (Elders, hunters, trappers, Indigenous/non-Indigenous children). On the other hand, it tries to understand the role played by wolverines in the context of ex-situ conservation (i.e. in a zoo) and knowledge and motivation by the public towards the protection of this species. We addressed these goals through the use of multiple different methods: semi-directed interviews, questionnaires, drawings, and participant observation, and applied these techniques in three separate study sites, both with and without wolverines. For example, we studied human-wolverine interactions in the North Slave region of the Northwest Territories with Indigenous populations (Dene and Métis First Nations), where people share the land with wolverines, gathering information from both adults and children alike. We then contrasted the knowledge and perceptions of these children with those of a second group that no longer have regular contact with this species, the Naskapi Nation in northern Quebec. Finally, at the St Félicien Zoo in Quebec, we qualitatively assessed the willingness of the general public to support conservation measures for this carnivorous species. Results indicated that Dene and Métis First Nations have a very deep knowledge of this species, which they admire and respect, which emphasized the importance of participation by First Nation peoples in the implementation of conservation programs for this species. In analyzing children's knowledge and perceptions, we found that while many children possess a basic knowledge about wolverines, there are numerous gaps in that knowledge which, if filled, may benefit future conservation efforts. Despite these gaps, the wolverine was relatively well represented in drawings by children, though their ecological role may remain be cloudy to some, and differences in their portrayal were apparent among territories/provinces in which children live. Data collected in the zoo indicate that the general public, in a region where wolverines have become extirpated, lack some general knowledge about this species and that the level of knowledge is not equal across the greater public. Promisingly, exposure to wolverines at the zoo or through children's camps does seem to promote positive attitudes towards this species and foster support for their conservation. These results shows that there is a need for increased awareness and public information programs for wolverine conservation, particularly in areas where new management programs may be implemented, to increase social acceptance of this species and raise public knowledge about this misunderstood carnivore. An integration of local populations, both children and adults, is necessary for a better legibility of management of the animal; as well as the valorization of traditional knowledge and its integration in scientific research. For the success of a species management program, it is inevitable to ask the people what they want and support the project. This study emphasizes the importance of participation by local populations, both adults and children, in conservation management plans for their success. Additionally, greater value should be assigned to traditional knowledge and its integration into scientific research. Finally, conservation programs must acknowledge the desires of the local populations and work together with local stakeholders if they wish to succeed.

281	La violence masculine à l’égard des femmes dans les Églises en Haïti : analyse praxéologique des récits de vie des personnes immigrantes haïtiennes qui vivent à Montréal	Our thesis focuses on male violence against women in churches in Haiti. It is part of the disciplinary field of theology in interdisciplinary dialogue with human sciences, particularly at the intersection of sociology, anthropology, political science, philosophy, history, psychology, Men’s Studies and feminist theology. The problem revolves around four main issues: the prevalence of violence against women in Haiti; Church violence, the resistance and solidarity of Haitian women; the importance of the commitment of men in the fight against this violence. These questions are posed in a Haitian context and, more specifically, in the Christian churches in Haiti.  The research has as methodological support the praxeology. This allows us to observe and articulate, from a field study, the stories of people who have been involved in episodes of church violence in Haiti. Such research seeks to stimulate social and religious change among clerics and lay people from an awareness that propels them to become involved in private spheres, but above all to engage in the political struggle against masculine violence towards women.  Our thesis helps to promote: 1) the transformation of men's behavior towards women in Christian churches in Haiti; 2) the awareness of members of the clergy and secular men regarding respect for the rights of women, their emancipation and liberation; 3) masculine solidarity as a strategy to promote the integration of women in the positions of responsibility; 4) the involvement of men in the fight against male violence against women. Finally, the specificity of this research is not only limited to exploring the violence of men towards women in Christian churches, but also extends to other institutions of Haitian society.

282	Impact of early environment on children's mental health : lessons from DNA methylation studies with monozygotic twins	Over the past decade, epigenetic analyses have made important contributions to our understanding of healthy development and a wide variety of adverse conditions such as cancer and psychopathology. There is increasing evidence that DNA methylation is a mechanism by which environmental factors influence gene transcription and, ultimately, phenotype. However, differentiating the effects of the environment from those of genetics on DNA methylation profiles remains a significant challenge. Monozygotic (MZ) twin study designs are unique in their ability to control for genetic differences because each pair of MZ twins shares essentially the same genetic sequence with the exception of a small number of de novo mutations and copy number variations. Thus, differences within twin pairs in gene expression and phenotype, including behavior, can be attributed in the majority of cases to environmental effects rather than genetic influence. In this article, we review the literature showing how MZ twin designs can be used to study basic epigenetic principles, contributing to understanding the role of early in utero and postnatal environmental factors on the development of psychopathology. We also highlight the importance of initiating longitudinal and experimental studies with MZ twins during pregnancy. This approach is especially important to identify: (1) critical time periods during which the early environment can impact brain and mental health development, and (2) the specific mechanisms through which early environmental effects may be mediated. These studies may inform the optimum timing and design for early preventive interventions aimed at reducing risk for psychopathology.

283	Deterritorialized male subjectivity : liminality, in-betweenness, and becoming  in migrant literary and cultural contexts	This dissertation stems from the search for a subject without reference to the webs of relations that hold it. Through rhizomatic movements, it breaks territorialities of narrative and moves beyond the subject’s thresholds by following literary and cultural lines of escape away from imprisoning forces of subjugation. The investigation flows along marginalized sites of transformation and displacement and through sites of resistance and decolonization. In my readings of migrant and Indigenous literatures, deterritorialization and decolonization intertwine at three major sites: liminality, in-betweenness, and becoming.  These sites are not only innovative aesthetic forms that cross the threshold of identity in our contemporary culture; they also participate in the project of reinventing and rearranging the relation of self and other toward new beginnings. The new perspectives that are offered engage ethically, avoid judgment, and foresee the possibilities for revolutionary political, social, and economic transformation.    The movements of deterritorialization that emerge within the writings and artistic production of Richard Mosse, Chris Abani, Leslie Marmon Silko, Thomas King and Rawi Hage provide possibilities for reflection at the thresholds of different male subjects in crisis. This project first addresses the underlying Thing that moves in between territories and confounds the desire to capture its essence; instead, following Deleuze and Guattari, it moves along with the male subjects’ nomadic movements as they become desubjectified simulacra in various sites of unlearning. In Richard Mosse’s Incoming and The Castle, for example, such a site of unlearning separates the materiality of the displaced from its image and informs discourse about the ways in which representation endangers, limits and violates existence. Through Abani’s GraceLand, this project further investigates modes of liminality and initiation ceremonies and acknowledges the lived experiences of male subjects in different cultural structures. In Rawi Hage’s novels, I explore the ways masculinity arranges or rearranges itself creatively in acts of performance. The dissertation also again turns to liminality by way of Leslie Marmon Silko’s Ceremony, and Thomas King’s post-apocalyptic narrative of identity. In this way, the harmonious conjunction of Indigenous voices and Indigenous and migrant literatures attempts to locate where these lines of escape might come together, refuse to cross, or crumble back upon themselves in flows of violence.

284	Développement d'une réaction d'amidation utilisant le diphénylsilane en tant qu'agent de couplage et d'une réaction de borocyclopropanation photochimique	This manuscript describes the work carried out in Pr. Charette’s laboratory between 2015 and 2019. It can be divided into two different topics: the development of new amidation strategies and the development of new cyclopropanation methodologies. Amide synthesis is still a challenge for the scientific community nowadays. Indeed, the development of simple, robust, atom economical and environmental friendly procedures remain one of the research priority in organic chemistry. To contribute to this field, an amide synthesis methodology has been developed by using diphenylsilane as a coupling reagent. The latter is commercially available, stable and cheap. Moreover, only a siloxane and dihydrogen are generated during the reaction. The developed methodology has also been applied to the synthesis of a series of di- and tripeptides. The cyclopropane moiety has been increasingly used in pharmaceuticals. Indeed, this moiety can influence different crucial parameters in the development of bioactive molecules. The development of new cyclopropanation methodologies is therefore a relevant field. Borocyclopropane synthesis is of particular interest: as a matter of fact, these compounds can create structural diversity via boronate functionalization. In order to obtain a user-friendly, robust and greener chemical process, a photochemical approach using continuous flow technology has been favored. A photoredox borocyclopropanation of styrenes has been developed; the latter is carried out under UV-A irradiation with xanthone as a photosensitizer. Mechanistic studies have supported that this transformation proceeds according to two concurrent photoredox catalytic cycles. Finally, a new diiodo reagent bearing a pinacol boronate group and a trimethylsilyl group has been developed to access gem-disubstituted cyclopropanes. The bases of a UV-visible photochemical process using this new reagent have then been established. Thereby, the first example of a gem-borocyclopropyl silane derived from styrene has been synthesized.	peptides , gem-borocyclopropyl silanes , diphenylsilane , photochemistry , continuous flow , gem-borocyclopropyl silanes	en	23405.0
285	Fonctionnalisation d'halocyclopropanes et préparation de composés diazoïques semi- et non-stabilisés pour la synthèse de cyclopropanes polysubstitués	The cyclopropane moiety is present in a large number of bioactive molecules as its incorporation usually improves their physicochemical properties. As a result, the development of new methodologies allowing the synthesis of various substituted cyclopropanes have become of significant interest. In order to access stereoenriched 1,2,3-trisubstituted cyclopropanes, we first developed a Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling of 2,3-disubstituted halocyclopropanes synthesized in the group using a chiral dioxaborolane ligand. Mild and highly reproducible reaction conditions were developed, especially thanks to the synthesis of a Buchwald type pre-catalyst. The next chapters were devoted to the synthesis of substituted cyclopropanes using diazo compounds bearing the groups to introduce. Semi-stabilized diazoalkanes (bearing π-system-containing groups such as aryl or alkene moieties) were first employed. The use of an iron porphyrin allowed the cyclopropanation of aryldiazomethanes generated in situ from 2-nosylhydrazones under mild conditions, enabling a broader scope of semi-stabilized diazo compounds that can be used in cyclopropanation reactions. Then, we investigated the cyclopropanation of dialkyldiazoalkanes generated in situ from arylsulfonylhydrazones. Gem-dimethyl cyclopropanes, motifs of particular interest in medicinal chemistry, were synthesized under metal-free conditions. However, high temperatures were needed to decompose the diazo precursors. Because of these harsh reaction conditions, we moved to another strategy enabling the synthesis of non-stabilized diazo compounds. We envisioned the oxidation of free hydrazones, being a more atom economical process that typically requires lower temperatures. After the completion of a project initiated by other group members employing stoichiometric amounts of a metallic reagent, we investigated the use of an organic oxidant. Iodosylbenzene allowed the generation of numerous aliphatic diazo compounds and was compatible with the in situ [3+2] cycloaddition of various Michael acceptors. Conversion of the 1-pyrazolines into the corresponding cyclopropanes was not always spontaneous under these reaction conditions, and therefore a photolysis process using continuous flow was developed in order to induce the ring contractions. Unnatural amino acids and gem-dimethyl cyclopropanes were synthesized in high yields using methodology. Immobilizing the iodosylbenzene in a packed bed reactor using a continuous flow set up allowed us to rapidly generate clean solutions of phenyldiazomethane. However, the production of non-stabilized diazo compounds using this process turned out to be more complicated due to numerous incompatibilities. Finally, the syntheses of amino-, alkoxy- or aryloxycyclopropanes were attempted by generating heteroatom-substituted diazo compounds from the corresponding free hydrazones. An aminocyclopropane was obtained during the initial investigation of this reaction. Although in low yield, this result showed the feasibility of each and every step.	cyclopropane , Suzuki-Miyaura , cycloaddition , diazo compound , carbene , continuous flow	en	23398.0
286	Birth size and gestational age in opposite-sex twins as compared to same-sex twins : an individualbased pooled analysis of 21 cohorts	It is well established that boys are born heavier and longer than girls, but it remains unclear whether birth size in twins is affected by the sex of their co-twin. We conducted an individual-based pooled analysis of 21 twin cohorts in 15 countries derived from the COllaborative project of Development of Anthropometrical measures in Twins (CODATwins), including 67,850 dizygotic twin individuals. Linear regression analyses showed that boys having a co-twin sister were, on average, 31 g (95% CI 18 to 45) heavier and 0.16 cm (95% CI 0.045 to 0.274) longer than those with a co-twin brother. In girls, birth size was not associated (5 g birth weight; 95% CI −8 to −18 and −0.089 cm birth length; 95% CI −0.202 to 0.025) with the sex of the co-twin. Gestational age was slightly shorter in boy-boy pairs than in boy-girl and girl-girl pairs. When birth size was standardized by gestational age, the magnitude of the associations was attenuated in boys, particularly for birth weight. In conclusion, boys with a co-twin sister are heavier and longer at birth than those with a co-twin brother. However, these differences are modest and partly explained by a longer gestation in the presence of a co-twin sister.		en	23396.0
287	Exploitation des documents audiovisuels numériques d’archives : modèle conceptuel théorique des usages, modalités et moyens d’organisation et de diffusion sur le web	The digital revolution and the development of the internet improved access to audiovisual documents. In the digital environment, it is crucial to take account of the uses of the audiovisual archives in their organisation and dissemination, since their preservation does not rely on the passive conservation of materials kept intact but instead is dependant on their usage. However, there are few studies on usage of digital audiovisual archival documents and there is a theoretical gap in conceptual definitions pertaining to usages of these types of documents.  Our research aims to develop, from an interdisciplinary corpus of archival, information science and sociology of usages literature, a theoretical and conceptual model of digital audiovisual archival documents usage which is subsequently used to suggest possible solutions to adapt to users their organisation and dissemination on the web.  To achieve this goal, we first analyse theoretical concepts and constructs related to usage and digital audiovisual archival documents. Second, a theoretical and conceptual model is developed then transposed into web organisation and dissemination means to explore new potential solutions.  The clarification of concepts and theoretical constructs addresses gaps within user studies and theoretical writings. The model is useful to anticipate possible uses and adapt for this purpose practices, interfaces and web systems. This research aims to enhance access to digital audiovisual archival documents and is a response to the gap between archival practice and theory and actual and future uses and users.	organisation , access to archives , audiovisual archives , archival science , chain of usage , digital audiovisual archival documents , dissemination , components and strata of documents , theoretical and conceptual model , user	en	23394.0
288	Les dialogues de la possession : ritualité et divinisation des ancêtres chez les Mavilans et les Malavettuvans	What does possession add to rituality? When possession enables one to hear the words of gods or ancestors that have authority, when it gives the possibility of a dialogue between the living and the gods, is it possible that it could participate in the dynamics of transformations and continuity of rituals, thus enabling their adaptation to new contexts? In the north of Kerala, we studied the rituals of Teyyam, a possession ritual of popular Hinduism in which the gods are performed by ritualists from lower castes who will, in some instances have the opportunity to share the message of certain gods criticizing caste discrimination. If this ritual implements a hierarchical reversal, yet also reaffirms, in its staging, caste distinctions, why is this situation accepted? As we will demonstrate, the Teyyam ritual, in addition to being a means to consult the gods, nowadays also constitutes for many, a commemoration that can inspire social struggles.  The Mavilan and the Malavettuvan are related Adivasi communities that practise the rituals of Teyyam in their isolated villages. However, they have included in this ritual the worship of their own ancestors, recently deceased individuals who distinguished themselves during their lifetimes by their positive leadership. During the dialogues that take place in the ritual space, we can hear the ancestors argue about the importance of maintaining solidarity among the members of the family group, at a time when, more and more in society, there is a decline of the extended family as a support group. These ancestors can also, through dialogue, transmit an ethic of leadership and responsibility to the heads of the household, current or emerging. As was the case in the past, one wishes, today, that ancestors continue to do after their death what they were doing during their lifetime: act as a mediator with power and intervene to help members of their community.   The experiences that happen with possession and that we observed, suggest that the performers or the devotees may influence the words spoken by the ancestors and the gods. The inner landscape of the individuals, their experiences, their desires, their understanding of the nature of the gods and ancestors, what they would like to experiment, say or express, whether conscious or not, intentional or not, can influence the words they speak. If, sometimes, the unchanged character of the ritual is used to argue and to establish its authority, possession may allow flexibility in the articulation of the words of the gods and ancestors, and hence adaptability to new social issues. When something new or unusual occurs during a ritual, it must then be validated, interpreted, or contested, but those that assess these changes are, sometimes, these same gods and ancestors who, in the ritual space, are speaking through the possessed.	possession , transmission , Mavilan , Malavettuvan , anangu , Teyyam , Kerala , Ritual , Ancestors , Hinduism	en	23389.0
289	Capsaicin and Its analogues impede nocifensive response of caenorhabditis elegans to noxious heat	Capsaicin is the most abundant pungent molecule identifed in red chili peppers, and it is widely used for food favoring, in pepper spray for self-defense devices and recently in ointments for the relief of neuropathic pain. Capsaicin and several other related vanilloid compounds are secondary plant metabolites. Capsaicin is a selective agonist of the transient receptor potential channel, vanilloid subfamily member 1 (TRPV1). After exposition to vanilloid solution, Caenorhabditis elegans wild type (N2) and mutants were placed on petri dishes divided in quadrants for heat stimulation. Thermal avoidance index was used to phenotype each tested C. elegans experimental groups. The data revealed for the frst-time that capsaicin can impede nocifensive response of C. elegans to noxious heat (32–35 °C) following a sustained exposition. The efect was reversed 6 h post capsaicin exposition. Additionally, we identifed the capsaicin target, the C. elegans transient receptor potential channel OCR-2 and not OSM-9. Further experiments also undoubtedly revealed anti-nociceptive efect for capsaicin analogues, including olvanil, gingerol, shogaol and curcumin.

290	Walking into the sunset : how criminal achievement shapes the desistance process	According to the criminal career paradigm, the link between past and future criminal activities is important and the desistance process may vary for individuals whose criminal trajectories were punctuated by failure compared to those who achieved a certain level of success. This study, based on the life narratives of 27 individuals who maintained a state of non-offending for more than a year, examines how criminal achievement modulates the desistance process. The aim is to understand whether criminal achievement acts as a barrier or a facilitator in the desistance process. A short questionnaire based on the life-history calendar method was used to classify individuals according to the parameters of their criminal careers. Narrative life stories were then used to look at the obstacles and frustrations encountered during desistance. The results show the relation between criminal achievement and desistance is complex: success in criminal activities is not always hindering desistance.

291	Réussir dans le crime et réussir à s’en sortir : l’influence de la carrière criminelle sur le processus de désistement	Many roads lead to criminal desistance and the path taken depends on past experiences. Few studies have examined the link between criminal career and its aftermath, how the events that characterized the criminal lifestyle influence the decision to desist and to maintain this abstinence from crime. Based on the life narratives of individuals involved mainly in lucrative crimes (N = 15), this study aims to reconstruct their life trajectory to study the meaning and dynamics behind the process of stopping and maintaining abstinence from crime. The results identified two distinct paths. They also suggest that subjective experiences and past events affecting the criminal career provides access to a deeper understanding of desistance and challenges of reentry. Findings also highlight the relevance of criminal achievement in the study of the desistance process. It is hoped that the project will foster a better understanding of turning points in criminal careers and the processes that affect continuity and desistance.

292	Risk factors associated with boys’ and girls’ developmental trajectories of physical aggression from early childhood through early adolescence	IMPORTANCE This study used multitrajectory modeling to identify distinct trajectories of physical aggression from ages 1.5 to 13 years for boys and girls. OBJECTIVES To trace the development of boys’ and girls’ physical aggression problems from infancy to adolescence using mother ratings, teacher ratings, and self-ratings and to identify early family predictors of children on the high physical aggression trajectories. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cohort study used data from the Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child Development (QLSCD), a study of a representative, population-based sample of 2223 infants born in 1997 and 1998 in the Canadian province of Quebec. The dates of analysis were January 2017 to January 2018. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Trained research assistants conducted 7 interviews (at child ages 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 5, 6, and 8 years) with the person most knowledgeable about the child (mothers in 99.6% [2214 of 2223] of cases). Teachers assessed the child’s behavior at ages 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, and 13 years. Self-reports of behavior problems were obtained from the child at ages 10, 12, and 13 years. RESULTS The sample included 2223 participants, 51.2% of whom were boys and 91.2% of whom were of white race/ethnicity. The mean response rate for mother ratings of physical aggression during the first 8 years of life was 80.9% (range, 65.1%-91.7%). For teacher ratings of physical aggression from ages 6 to 13 years, the mean response rate was 45.7% (range, 35.4%-56.9%), while the mean response rate of physical aggression assessment from self-ratings between ages 10 and 13 years was 57.9% (range, 55.2%-60.5%). Attrition was higher among families with low socioeconomic status and single-parent families, as well as among young mothers and mothers who were not fluent in French or English. A statistical analysis to examine the consequences of attrition was included. For boys and girls, the frequency of physical aggressions increased from age 1.5 years (2039 [91.7%]) to age 3.5 years (1941 [87.3%]) and then substantially decreased until age 13 years (1228 [55.2%]). Three distinct developmental trajectories of physical aggression were observed for girls and 5 for boys. Most family characteristics measured at 5 months after the child’s birth were associated with a high physical aggression trajectory for boys and girls. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Family characteristics at 5 months after the child’s birth could be used to target preschool interventions aimed at preventing the development of boys’ and girls’ chronic physical aggression problems.		en	23316.0
293	L'art dans tous ses territoires au jardin des Premières-Nations : regards sur l’immatériel dans les œuvres du Concours d’œuvre murale éphémère	From 2003 to 2017, the First Nations Garden of the Montréal Botanical Garden has exhibited each year the mural artwork of an Indigenous artist as part of the Ephemeral mural contest launched by Sylvie Paré. This memoir brings together all of this exhibition in order to highlight the general discourse and the relations that the artworks have with each other, with the Garden and with the physical and imaginary territories. Through a formal and symbolic analysis of this exposition, that integrates the ontologies, epistemology and methodologies of the First Nations, I wish to reflect on the links that unite the notions of gaze, territory, interconnection and memory. The first chapter focuses on the distance generated by the sight seen as an intermediary “objective” of human experience, and the separation (or schism) that it created between the conceptions of nature and culture. I will then look at how the First Nations Garden questions this rupture. The second chapter of this dissertation focuses more specifically on the oblique perspectives adopted by the mural artworks in that they focus on memories and cultural marks left by the indigenous nations on the territories for more than 10,000 years. Moreover, if the murals generally express an environmental concern, they do so through the eyes of different “entities” circulating fluidly and circularly in space, time and intersubjectivity. They explore the physical and imaginary traces of relationships with the territory and highlight the existence of a relationship of reciprocity with the universe in which the territory plays a dynamic role.

294	Scientific collaboration and high-technology exchanges among BRICS and G-7 countries	Over the last two decades, emerging countries located outside North America and Europe have reshaped the global economy. These countries are also increasing their share of the world’s scientific output. This paper analyzes the evolution of BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) and G-7 countries’ international scientific collaboration, and compares it with high-technology economic exchanges between 1995–1997 and 2010–2012. Our results show that BRICS scientific activities are enhanced by their high-technology exports and, to a larger extent, by their international collaboration with G-7 countries which remains, over the period studied, at the core of the BRICS scientific collaboration network. However, while high-technology exports made by most BRICS countries to G-7 countries have increased over the studied period, both the intra-BRICS high-technology flows and the intra-BRICS scientific collaboration have remained very weak.

295	Publish or impoverish : an investigation of the monetary reward system of science in China (1999-2016)	Although monetary rewards have been used for recognizing scientific achievement since the eighteenth century, it is not regarded as the major reward system in science as described by Merton (1973), in which scientists publish their works and receive the recognition of their peers as the reward. Since academic prizes consisting of cash rewards are awarded only to very few scientific elites, they are considered as a metaphors of prestige rather than simply large sums of money (Zuckerman, 1992). However, the reward system in science changed when the monetary reward incentive for publication was introduced in 1980s. It is reported that this incentive can promote research productivity (Franzoni et al., 2011) but might create a negative goal displacement effect (Frey et al., 2013; Osterloh and Frey, 2014). Since the early 1990s, Chinese research institutions have initiated cash-per-publication reward polices in which Chinese scholars can get cash for each eligible publication. The purpose of publishing their works is not only to advance knowledge and win recognition, but also to earn cash (Sun and Zhang, 2010; Wang, 2016). Since these cash-per-publication reward policies vary by institution and some policies are internal or confidential, they have never been systematically investigated except for in some case studies. The purpose of this study is to present the landscape of the cash-per-publication reward policy in China[1] and reveal its trend since the late 1990s.

296	Astrophysicists on Twitter : an in-depth analysis of tweeting and scientific publication behavior	Purpose – This paper analyzes the tweeting behavior of 37 astrophysicists on Twitter and compares their tweeting behavior with their publication behavior and citation impact to show whether they tweet research-related topics or not. Design/methodology/approach – Astrophysicists on Twitter are selected to compare their tweets with their publications from Web of Science. Different user groups are identified based on tweeting and publication frequency. Findings – A moderate negative correlation (ρ=-0.390*) is found between the number of publications and tweets per day, while retweet and citation rates do not correlate. The similarity between tweets and abstracts is very low (cos=0.081). User groups show different tweeting behavior such as retweeting and including hashtags, usernames and URLs. Research limitations/implications – The study is limited in terms of the small set of astrophysicists. Results are not necessarily representative of the entire astrophysicist community on Twitter and they most certainly do not apply to scientists in general. Future research should apply the methods to a larger set of researchers and other scientific disciplines. Practical implications – To a certain extent, this study helps to understand how researchers use Twitter. The results hint at the fact that impact on Twitter can neither be equated with nor replace traditional research impact metrics. However, tweets and other so-called altmetrics might be able to reflect other impact of scientists such as public outreach and science communication. Originality/value – To the best of our knowledge, this is the first in-depth study comparing researchers’ tweeting activity and behavior with scientific publication output in terms of quantity, content and impact.

297	On the shoulders of students? The contribution of PhD students to the advancement of knowledge	Using the participation in peer reviewed publications of all doctoral students in Quebec over the 2000–2007 period, this paper provides the first large scale analysis of their research effort. It shows that PhD students contribute to about a third of the publication output of the province, with doctoral students in the natural and medical sciences being present in a higher proportion of papers published than their colleagues of the social sciences and humanities. Collaboration is an important component of this socialization: disciplines in which student collaboration is higher are also those in which doctoral students are the most involved in peer-reviewed publications. In terms of scientific impact, papers co-signed by doctorate students obtain significantly lower citation rates than other Quebec papers, except in natural sciences and engineering. Finally, this paper shows that involving doctoral students in publications is positively linked with degree completion and ulterior career in research.

298	The decline in the concentration of citations, 1900–2007	This article challenges recent research (Evans, 2008) reporting that the concentration of cited scientific literature increases with the online availability of articles and journals. Using Thomson Reuters’ Web of Science, the present article analyses changes in the concentration of citations received (2- and 5-year citation windows) by papers published between 1900 and 2005.Three measures of concentration are used: the percentage of papers that received at least one citation (cited papers); the percentage of papers needed to account for 20%,50%, and 80% of the citations; and the Herfindahl-Hirschman index (HHI). These measures are used for four broad disciplines: natural sciences and engineering, medical fields, social sciences, and the humanities. All these measures converge and show that, contrary to what was reported by Evans, the dispersion of citations is actually increasing.		en	23234.0
299	The impact factor’s Matthew Effect : a natural experiment in bibliometrics	Since the publication of Robert K. Merton’s theory of cumulative advantage in science (Matthew Effect), several empirical studies have tried to measure its presence at the level of papers, individual researchers, institutions, or countries. However, these studies seldom control for the intrinsic “quality” of papers or of researchers— “better” (however defined) papers or researchers could receive higher citation rates because they are indeed of better quality. Using an original method for controlling the intrinsic value of papers—identical duplicate papers published in different journals with different impact factors—this paper shows that the journal in which papers are published have a strong influence on their citation rates, as duplicate papers published in highimpact journals obtain, on average, twice as many citations as their identical counterparts published in journals with lower impact factors. The intrinsic value of a paper is thus not the only reason a given paper gets cited or not, there is a specific Matthew Effect attached to journals and this gives to papers published there an added value over and above their intrinsic quality.		en	23232.0
300	The many faces of mobility : using bibliometric data to measure the movement of scientists	This paper presents a methodological framework for developing scientific mobility indicators based on bibliometric data. We identify nearly 16 million individual authors from publications covered in the Web of Science for the 2008–2015 period. Based on the information provided across individuals’ publication records, we propose a general classification for analyzing scientific mobility using institutional affiliation changes. We distinguish between migrants--authors who have ruptures with their country of origin--and travelers--authors who gain additional affiliations while maintaining affiliation with their country of origin. We find that 3.7% of researchers who have published at least one paper over the period are mobile. Travelers represent 72.7% of all mobile scholars, but migrants have higher scientific impact. We apply this classification at the country level, expanding the classification to incorporate the directionality of scientists’ mobility (i.e., incoming and outgoing). We provide a brief analysis to highlight the utility of the proposed taxonomy to study scholarly mobility and discuss the implications for science policy.

301	Mercury and selenium distribution in key tissues and early life stages of Yellow Perch (Perca flavescens)	Whereas early life stages are usually considered as particularly sensitive to both organic and inorganic contaminants, field studies assessing contaminant bioaccumulation in these stages are scarce. Selenium (Se) is thought to counteract Hg toxic effects when it is found at Se:Hg molar ratios above 1. However, the variation of this ratio in key fish tissues of different early life stages is mostly unknown. The present study therefore aimed to assess Hg and Se content in gravid female tissues (gonads, muscle, liver, gut, and brain) and different life stages (egg masses, newly hatched larvae (NHL), larvae and juvenile) of Yellow Perch (YP) in a large fluvial lake (Lake Saint-Pierre, Québec, Canada). Se:Hg molar ratios were measured for each compartment in order to fill associated knowledge gaps. Total Hg (THg) and methylmercury (MeHg) concentration varied between tissue according to the following trend: Muscle > Liver > Gut > Brain > Gonads. During YP early life stages, MeHg values increased according to an ontogenetic pattern (mg/kg dw) (mean ± SEM): Egg masses (0.01 ± 0.002) < NHL (0.015 ± 0.001) < Larvae (0.14 ± 0.01) < Juveniles (0.18 ± 0.01). Se concentrations in different YP tissues showed the following trend (mg/kg dw) (mean ± SEM): Gut (3.6 ± 0.1) > Liver (2.5 ± 0.1) > Gonads (1.92 ± 0.06) > Brain (1.26 ± 0.03) > Muscle (1.23 ± 0.06). In YP early life stages, Se concentrations were highest in NHL (3.0 ± 0.2), and then decreased as follows: Egg masses (2.8 ± 0.1) > Larvae (1.37 ± 0.04) > Juveniles (0.93 ± 0.05). Se:Hg molar ratios varied considerably and were systematically above 1. This is the first study to simultaneously report Hg and Se bioaccumulation through fish life cycle.

302	A community of curious souls : an analysis of commenting behavior on TED talks videos	The TED (Technology, Entertainment, Design) Talks website hosts video recordings of various experts, celebrities, academics, and others who discuss their topics of expertise. Funded by advertising and members but provided free online, TED Talks have been viewed over a billion times and are a science communication phenomenon. Although the organization has been derided for its populist slant and emphasis on entertainment value, no previous research has assessed audience reactions in order to determine the degree to which presenter characteristics and platform affect the reception of a video. This article addresses this issue via a content analysis of comments left on both the TED website and the YouTube platform (on which TED Talks videos are also posted). It was found that commenters were more likely to discuss the characteristics of a presenter on YouTube, whereas commenters tended to engage with the talk content on the TED website. In addition, people tended to be more emotional when the speaker was a woman (by leaving comments that were either positive or negative). The results can inform future efforts to popularize science amongst the public, as well as to provide insights for those looking to disseminate information via Internet videos.		en	23191.0
303	On the compliance of women engineers with a gendered scientific system	There has been considerable effort in the last decade to increase the participation of women in engineering through various policies. However, there has been little empirical research on gender disparities in engineering which help underpin the effective preparation, co-ordination, and implementation of the science and technology (S&T) policies. This article aims to present a comprehensive gendered analysis of engineering publications across different specialties and provide a cross-gender analysis of research output and scientific impact of engineering researchers in academic, governmental, and industrial sectors. For this purpose, 679,338 engineering articles published from 2008 to 2013 are extracted from the Web of Science database and 974,837 authorships are analyzed. The structures of co-authorship collaboration networks in different engineering disciplines are examined, highlighting the role of female scientists in the diffusion of knowledge. The findings reveal that men dominate 80% of all the scientific production in engineering. Women engineers publish their papers in journals with higher Impact Factors than their male peers, but their work receives lower recognition (fewer citations) from the scientific community. Engineers —regardless of their gender—contribute to the reproduction of the male-dominated scientific structures through forming and repeating their collaborations predominantly with men. The results of this study call for integration of data driven gender-related policies in existing S&T discourse.		en	23180.0
304	Studies of molecular pathways associated with blood neutrophil corticosteroid insensitivity in equine asthma	Equine asthma is characterized by bronchial hyperactivity, neutrophilic inflammation, and structural alterations of the airways. Asthmatic patients with neutrophilic inflammation, are insensitive to corticosteroids. The hypothesis of this study is that hypoxia and/or oxidative stress in the microenvironment of the asthmatic lungs may contribute to this insensitivity of neutrophils to corticosteroids. Horses are unique animal models naturally affected by neutrophilic asthma and share several pathophysiological features with humans. Viability, apoptosis, IL-1, TNF- and IL-8 gene expression were measured in neutrophils isolated from peripheral blood of severe asthmatic horses (N = 8) and healthy horses (N = 8) in culture conditions stimulating hypoxia and oxidative stress, in the presence or absence of corticosteroids (Dexamethasone (Dex)). IL-1 and TNF- but not IL-8 were downregulated in the presence of Dex under pyocyanin-induced oxidative stress conditions. Also, in IL-17 and LPS stimulated equine neutrophils, pro-inflammatory gene expression did not decrease after Dex administration. In hypoxemic conditions induced by CoCl2, gene expression of TNF- was significantly reduced by Dex, this was also true in conditions without hypoxia. In conclusion, oxidative stress, but not hypoxia, leads to insensitivity to corticosteroids, which presents a selective gene regulatory pathway (that of IL-8). Both groups of horses demonstrated a similar response indicating a reaction to dexamethasone and not related to asthmatic inflammation.

305	"Estimating treatment importance in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis using
Targeted Learning : an observational individual patient data network
meta-analysis"	Persons with multidrug‐resistant tuberculosis (MDR‐TB) have a disease resulting from a strain of tuberculosis (TB) that does not respond to at least isoniazid and rifampicin, the two most effective anti‐TB drugs. MDR‐TB is always treated with multiple antimicrobial agents. Our data consist of individual patient data from 31 international observational studies with varying prescription practices, access to medications, and distributions of antibiotic resistance. In this study, we develop identifiability criteria for the estimation of a global treatment importance metric in the context where not all medications are observed in all studies. With stronger causal assumptions, this treatment importance metric can be interpreted as the effect of adding a medication to the existing treatments. We then use this metric to rank 15 observed antimicrobial agents in terms of their estimated add‐on value. Using the concept of transportability, we propose an implementation of targeted maximum likelihood estimation, a doubly robust and locally efficient plug‐in estimator, to estimate the treatment importance metric. A clustered sandwich estimator is adopted to compute variance estimates and produce confidence intervals. Simulation studies are conducted to assess the performance of our estimator, verify the double robustness property, and assess the appropriateness of the variance estimation approach.

306	Étude sur la flexibilité mentale et l’inhibition et leurs relations avec l’autonomie fonctionnelle suite à un traumatisme craniocérébral en âge avancé	Background. The aim of this study was to evaluate executive functions and functional outcomes in elderly patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and to explore the effects of demographic and TBI-related variables on these factors. Methods. The sampled population included 53 older adults (≥ 55 years old) divided into two groups: a TBI group (n = 29) and a control group (n = 24). The Trail Making Test (TMT), the Stroop, the Go – No Go and Conflicting instructions subscales from the Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB) along with the Mayo-Portland Adaptability Inventory (MPAI-4) were administrated to both groups. Information about age, education, Glasgow coma score (GCS), length of time post-TBI and lesion location was collected. Results. Differences between healthy participants and individuals with TBI were found in TMT-A, TMT-B, MPAI-4 total score and all subscales scores. Age was associated with TMT -A and TMT-B while education was associated with TMT-A and the ratio score (TMT B/TMT-A). Stroop was associated with length of time post-TBI and occipital lesions. Furthermore, GCS scores were associated with Go – No Go scores. Finally, deficits in TMT-B and frontal lobe lesions were associated with MPAI-4 Abilities Subscale scores. Conclusion. Elderly patients with TBI are slower than control group and show a lower outcome although no executive function deficit was observed. Demographic factors and executive functioning are not associated with functional outcome while age, education, length of time post-TBI influence performances in executive tasks.

307	Targeting the muscle for the treatment and prevention of hepatic encephalopathy	Muscle mass loss or sarcopenia is a principle component of malnutrition which prevails in 65–90% of patients with end-stage liver disease [1]. Intuitively, the roots of malnutrition play a precipitating role in muscle catabolism. Undernutrition frequently occurs in cirrhosis since an inadequate diet is compounded by a hypermetabolic energy demand. However, multiple other factors contribute to the pathogenesis of malnutrition including malabsorption of nutrients, metabolic alterations, increased intestinal protein losses, reduced protein synthesis, increased protein catabolism and disturbance of substrate utilization [2,3].		en	22935.0

310	Développement d’une plateforme numérique pour l’apprentissage de la guitare	In the field of computer science applied to music, this project of master degree in music is centered around the development of a Web platform to support guitar learning, allowing the use of a notation specially adapted to the instrument, and that includes multiple aspects of guitar playing, interpretation (tablature, fingering, harmonic functions, etc.) and which goal is to highlight existing relations between different aspects of music, sound parameters, and instrumental gestures. In collaboration with the guitarist and teacher that created this multimodal notation, the goal of this memoir was to find a suited solution, in the field of computer science, to make this notation available in a pedagogical context and through a digital learning platform that relies on modern web technologies. Before the implementation of the platform, an analysis of existing tools –in the field of com- puter science applied to musical learning– has been made from technical and pedagogical points of view. Main features of the platform, in the current state of development, include an access to a collection of digital partitions, a graphical interface presenting tablatures in a dynamic and flexible way, synchronised with audio rendering and which tempo is adjustable by the user. The platform also offers a set of useful tools when it comes to guitar learning (metronome, chord dictionary, etc.) and allows to edit and share scores quickly in the pedagogue’s alter- native notation.	notation musicale , TIC , tablature , geste musical , musical pedagogy , musicology , computer science , musical notation , ICT , guitar , tablature , augmented score , musical gesture , graphic interface	en	22865.0
311	Prévalence de l’aplasie et de l’hypoplasie des glandes salivaires majeures chez les enfants atteints du syndrome de Down (trisomie 21)	Objective: The main objective of this study is to assess the prevalence of aplasia and hypoplasia of the major salivary glands (parotid and submandibular) in patients with Trisomy 21 (T21). The second objective is to identify the oral manifestations related to this developmental anomaly. Hypothesis: The prevalence of aplasia and hypoplasia of the major salivary glands in patients with T21 is significantly higher when compared with the general population. Method: Data from 46 patients with T21 and 33 patients from a control group was collected. An oral examination, a fungal culture and an ultrasound of the parotid and submandibular glands were performed. Results: The prevalence of aplasia of the parotid glands is 15,2% in patients with T21 and 3,0% in control patients. None of the patients showed aplasia of the submandibular glands. The prevalence of parotid hypoplasia was estimated at 51,8%, whereas the prevalence of the submandibular hypoplasia was 58,4% in patients with T21. These developmental anomalies influence significantly the presence of candidiasis (p<0.0001), oral erythema (p=0.005) and hyposialia (p<0.0001), but does not influence significantly the carious index (p=0.338). Conclusion: The prevalence of parotid aplasia tends to be higher in patients with T21 (p=0.13). Hypoplasia of the parotid and submandibular glands is more common in patients with T21. Oral manifestations related to this developmental abnormality are candidiasis, oral erythema and hyposialia.	Trisomy 21 , Down syndrome , Major salivary glands , Aplasia , Hypoplasia	en	22861.0
312	Le jeu des stéréotypes féminins et masculins en droit international : influences et conséquences pour les victimes de viol en période de conflits armés	This thesis looks at the interplay between female and male stereotypes in the creation of international norms against military rape. The influences and consequences of female stereotypes, such as the weak sex or the passive victims, as well as male stereotypes, such as the strong sex or the active fighters, in armed conflict settings are questioned. Specifically, the excessive generalizations derived from gender-based stereotypes, which encourage the paradigm of women-victims and men-perpetrators of rape are questioned.  In order to understand the interplay between gender-based stereotypes, a two-pronged approach is used to conduct an in-depth analysis of the normative evolution of international law. First, the influences of gender-based stereotypes in the creation of protection norms and penal norms against rape are studied. The review of these international norms shows that, despite the progress attributed to feminists’ efforts, the interplay of gender-based stereotypes is perpetuated in international law. Further, both women and men suffer the consequences in times of armed conflicts. Second, it reviews the impact of such normative consequences, which confine women to the role of passive victims, without the capacity of positive or negative actions during armed conflicts, while neglecting to consider the situation of men, who are not necessarily active fighters, and who may therefore require protection against military rape.  This thesis concludes that the gender binarity dichotomy present in international norms against rape should disappear. Otherwise, the interplay of gender-based stereotypes may be perpetuated. Instead of those norms being influenced by a gender-based categorization, they could be replaced by norms that protect the human race; free of essentialist distinctions based on sex, thus free from stereotypical gender-based discrimination.

313	Le traitement réservé à la Charia dans l'arbitrage international	Globalization has led to the development of economic exchanges between countries with contrasting legal and cultural traditions. These interactions require an understanding and respect of the legal systems because all countries wish to retain their interests, whether it be commercial or not. In the face of these economic advances, international commercial arbitration has emerged as a way to remove states from a particular state legal system and to bring consensus on how to settle disputes. However, when a conflict emerges between East and West, the cultural differences and the religious variables lead the Western countries to question the normativity of Arab Muslim’s rights. Despite the fact that the majority of these states are now secularized in the field of business today, there are challenges to the apprehension and application of Sharia’h, Islamic law and Fiqh. The Western perception of these rights as precarious or unsuitable for governing international trade may have led to some isolation of legislation. Through this study it will be necessary to understand what Sharia’h and Islamic law really are, but especially their content and impact in the field of business in order to justifiy the initial rejection of these systems in the arbitration system. Thus will be traced the evolution of the reception of Sharia’h in international commercial arbitration and the treatment that has been reserved for it until today.

314	Perception des politiques de financement public des écoles confessionnelles au Québec : une analyse à travers le récit d’action publique véhiculé par les médias journalistiques écrits	The legitimacy of public funding for denominational schools raises heated controversies both in Quebec and in other democratic societies. In Quebec, opponents of the public funding policies of denominational schools invoke the irreconcilability of state funding with the societal values advocated by the Quebec model of intercultural integration, highlighting the risks of social division and reconfessionalization of the school system. In this documentary research, we propose a cognitive analysis of the media debate about policies relating to state grants to religious schools. The objectives of our study are to identify the public action narratives conveyed by Quebec's written journalistic media, to understand the mechanisms that determine the emergence of this media discourse, as well as its influence on the trajectory of the public policies under study.

315	Prioriser l’apprentissage dans la gestion des établissements scolaires : une étude documentaire descriptive des dimensions du leadership centré sur l’apprentissage dans le fonctionnement et les activités d’écoles québécoises de milieux défavorisés	This dissertation is in line with the current work of Archambault, Poirel and Garon (2014) research group on school principals focused on learning. It tries to answer the following question, still scarcely studied in Quebec: what do these schools where the school principals give priority to learning in their management, specifically in a disadvantaged environment, do to have an impact on student success? This descriptive documentary study of the dimensions of learning-centered leadership in the operation and activities of Québec schools in disadvantaged neighborhoods describes and gather information the actions planned by schools to give priority to learning. In order to do so, we rely on the most recent French-language conceptual framework in our field, namely that of the research group of Archambault, Poirel and Garon (2014). We describe and document this set of practices and means included in the documents of 13 primary schools (educational project, success plan, management agreement). We use documents recently collected but not processed by Archambault, Poirel and Garon (2014). Although these documents allow only an observation of the actions proposed by the schools, prospective actions, and that their study thus presents certain limits, their interest remains undeniable since they are public documents with obligatory production. In this memoir, we present quantitative data and content data for each category of each of the 14 dimensions of learning-centered leadership using Archambault, Poirel and Garon’s (2014) conceptual model. From this analysis, we produce a synthesis of the presence of themes and the means, actions and strategies associated in schools, classified by dimension. This allows us to see what is in strong presence and what is not present in the documents: all the dimensions of a leadership focused on learning are observed, except the dimension of the social commitment which is under-represented. . Also, we found that schools mainly use data entry, academic results, to quantify the achievement of a goal.We hope that this memoir will serve as a reflexive lever but also as a tool for writing the new generation of permanent products.	learning-centered leadership , permanent products , underprivileged backgrounds , Quebec elementary schools , documentary study	en	22836.0
316	Biosurveillance des retardateurs de flamme organophosphorés chez les travailleurs du recyclage électronique au Québec	Electronic waste (e-waste) contains organophosphate esters (OPEs) flame retardants, which may be emitted into the workplace environment during recycling operations. However, there is a paucity of data in the scientific literature regarding occupational exposure to OPEs in e-waste recycling facilities. In this study, we aimed to measure urinary concentrations of OPE metabolites in e-waste recycling workers, and to evaluate their association with measured air OPE concentrations. Fifteen urinary OPE metabolites were measured in urine samples from 88 workers (six facilities in the province of Quebec, Canada) at the end of their work shift (on Wednesdays). On the same day, 11 OPE were measured in 8-hour personal air samples (n=88) collected in workers’ breathing zone. Spearman rank correlation and linear regressions were performed to assess the relationship between the urinary concentrations of OPE metabolites and air concentrations of their parent compound. Bis (1-chloro-2-propyl) 1-hydroxy-2-propyl phosphate (BCIPHIPP), diphenyl phosphate (DPhP), bis (1-chloro-2-propyl) carboxy 2-ethyl phosphate (BCIPCEP) and bis (2-chloroethyl) carboxymethyl phosphate (BCECMP) were detected in more than 70% of urine samples. Tris (2-chloroethyl) phosphate (metabolite: BCECMP), tris (2-chloroisopropyl) phosphate (metabolites: BCIPCEP, BCIPHIPP) and triphenyl phosphate (metabolite: DPhP) were detected in more than 90% of air samples. The correlation coefficients between the concentrations of urinary metabolites and the concentrations of their parent compounds in air ranged from 0.28 to 0.43 (p <0.05). However, the coefficients of determination (R2) of univariate linear regression models were low (R2s: 0.05-0.12). Our data shows that workers performing e-waste recycling tasks are exposed to OPEs, but that airborne OPEs appear to contribute minimally to absorbed doses	Flame retardants , Organophosphate esters (OPEs) , Urinary biomarkers , Electronic waste recycling , Occupational exposure	en	22831.0
317	Corruption dans le milieu municipal : effets sur les élus et impacts sur les contrats	Collusion and corruption are phenomena against which society has always fought. However, they never cease to renew themselves. The elected municipal officials, due to the proximity and locality of their power are one of those most at risk to be corrupted. The Commission d’enquête sur l’octroi et la gestion des contrats publics dans l’industrie de la construction is revealing in this regard. This dissertation aims to identify the impact this commission had on municipal contracts legislation, on the individual rights of the elected municipal officials as well as on the validity of public contracts concluded in this context. Firstly, we will consider the investigations of the 20th century which led to the first legislative changes with regards to the battle against corruption at the municipal level. Secondly, we will dress a portrait of the revelations stemming from the Charbonneau Commission and the legislative changes this commission had on contractual law. Thirdly, we will study the recourse available to the municipality that has been put in place since the beginning of the investigation of the Charbonneau Commission, that being the application to declare provisionally incapable a member of a municipal council for which there are criminal accusations. In parallel, we will analyse the new interpretation that the Courts have given to the elected officials’ financial protection regime in this same context. Fourthly, we will evaluate the consequences at the penal, civil and ethical level the elected officials with reprehensible conduct are susceptible to incur. We will identify the objectives on which the Courts have put emphasis in the context of the Charbonneau Commission. Fifthly, we will study the consequences of corruption on the validity of the municipal contract. The violation of public policy rules leads to the nullity of the contract. In the context of the recent decision of the Court of appeal in Ville de Montréal c. Octane Statégie inc., 2018 QCCA 223, which of the Civil code of Québec or the common law is best adapted to the reality of municipalities? Finally, we will study the path the legislator chose, following the Charbonneau Commission, to repress businesses that participated in a fraudulent system of call for tenders. We will try to determine if the Act to ensure mainly the recovery of amounts improperly paid as a result of fraud or fraudulent tactics in connection with public contracts, RLRQ, c. R-2.2.0.0.3 provides for rules of evidence as exceptional as some argue. Throughout these different chapters, we will see that the legislator as well as the Courts are constantly searching for a balance between individual rights and public interest, balance which is, all in all, difficult to attain.

318	Les exemptions de taxes foncières des institutions religieuses	Taxation has always been a major issue for our society. By the early eighteenth century, religious institutions claimed a tax exemption in exchange for the many social services they rendered. Based on principles of equity, the imposition of a tax makes it possible to defray the common expenses of our society. Introduced locally in the 1876, municipal taxation has always recognized that state property could not be the subject of any taxation since benefiting all. In the same way, the property of religious institutions has also had the same privilege since the beginning of the imposition of the tax or almost. This history is not without explanation! Indeed, our churches were actively involved in the development of society through both social services (assistance to the poor, health, registry of civil status, etc.) and educational (schools, religious teachings ...). What about today? Is it still relevant to maintain these exemptions while the state has taken over education, health, etc.? While Catholic churches are handed over one by one to municipalities for lack of funding and disciples, that our Quebec government is moving towards neutrality to make room for growing religious pluralism, that our municipalities are looking for new sources of funding, why keep this system of exemptions that seems to go against all trends in society? This is precisely what we will study in this memoir.  In summary, the purpose of this brief is to identify the source of these exemptions from municipal property taxes and to analyze objectively their legal evolution. All, to understand the reasons that support their maintenance, even today, in order to determine their relevance or not in a new legislation. Thus, the first part puts into context the land exemption for religious institutions in Quebec. It first covers the relationship between the state and religion, then presents the main tax impacts of the property tax exemption system on municipalities. The second part establishes the legal framework surrounding this scheme. It discusses the tax regime applicable to property tax exemptions, focusing mainly on articles relating to religious institutions and presbyteries. Then, it presents reasons in support of whether or not to maintain the exemption scheme. And then, the third part proposes possible solutions to legally evolve these exemptions in accordance with the expectations of our Quebec society. Finally, to conclude on a unique destiny of these.

319	Crise, blocage et événements : le coaching de vie dans les parcours biographiques	"Coaching is recognized as a support service aimed to clients who want to achieve personal and / or professional goals. If executive coaching is intended for managers who encounter difficulties and “turning points” in their professional trajectories (Salman, 2013), there are no biographical surveys concerning the path of life coachees. What is most intriguing with life coaching is that it has a polymorphic character that is elusive in its totality and leaves us with several blind spots. Indeed, having ''life"" as a field of practice includes ""everything"", which is making it difficult to study. However, if one considers the fact that common sense ""life"" is used as an expression of self (Lévy, 2001): what does the study of this device allow us to know about whom? Based on a qualitative interview of ten coachees life courses (nine women and one man), I propose an analysis of individual and contextual reasons and motivations at the source of their solicitation as well as an exploration of the crisis notion. This research illustrates that the coachees in the sample experienced a biographical crisis caused by the ""synchronous co-occurrence"" of events in various trajectories of their lives. A type of crisis that causes a blockage (or a freeze) that requires the help of an external party to resolve it. Beyond this individual purpose, the analysis shows that there are important contextual factors explaining life coaching request : a context of general dissatisfaction ( in the private and public life); the occurrence of one or more breaks and biographical transitions (birth, divorce, death, illness, ...); a disappointment with so-called traditional support systems (“solidarities spaces” and psychotherapy f.ex.) and so many other elements whose interconnection shapes collective conditions that guide individuals biographical pathways towards this type of accompaniment. More broadly, given the composition of the sample, this research provides a glimpse into women’s conditions of existence who face various contradictions specific to their social position (s)."

320	Les conceptions du rétablissement chez des femmes fréquentant une ressource communautaire en santé mentale	Since deinstitutionalization, many approaches and ways to treat mental health issues has emerged, as well as methods to support the ones affected by such illnesses. Some have evolved, others have disappeared and some news approaches appeared. From the time of psychiatric rehabilitation, we have wanted to promote autonomy and people’s relational abilities, because those were skills that facilitate social reinsertion. We believed this for a while, and some of us still believe, to this day, in your society. It’s only later, when no one had any interest in keeping mentally ill, patient inside of psychiatric facilities, that new values and attitudes started to emerge. We were then still encouraging autonomous and social skills, as well as aiming improvement in self-determination, formations work, life projects and acquisition of all competences that promote personal and social well-being. Then, we have started taking the patient’s opinion regarding the care received into account. Then, arrived the idea of recovery hint mental health. The concept was, at first seen as a new era, then as a philosophy then as on approach. For many authors, recovery in seen as a movement that incites people to initiate introspection, allowing them to experience success in the world. Those the movements are described in the book: Les deux mouvements de l’être (Corin, Poirel et Rodriguez Del Barrio, 2011). For those who, like me, agree with this was of seeing alternative approach will without a doubt consider that it is the best way of promoting rehabilitation. For others, rehabilitation should aim towards psychosocial rehabilitation. This memoir, without telling us how to promote rehabilitation, is focused on the opinion of those who are the most involved, the people living with mental illnesses. It is a study on mentally ill people’s points of view regarding their own recovery. Although we already have studied some insight focuses on those people’s opinions, this study focuses on the recovery of eleven women that went through challenging situations and explains how they overcame them and eventually recovered. Those testimonials exhibit the importance of self-realization, feelings of accomplishment and self-determination within the conception they have of their own recovery. So, we can better identify people’s needs and understand their own individual recovery, and how it fakes place in the individual’s life.	mental health issues , the concept of recovery , people’s point of view , realization , self-determination	en	22761.0
321	Enjeux de la réinsertion sociale chez des hommes ayant purgé une peine d'incarcération au sein d'une institution carcérale	This memoir is a study on the social reinsertion of men having served sentence in a federal institution. Most of the research on this subject doesn’t demonstrate the course taken by the men upon their return to the community. Instead, only one aspect of the subjectis put forward. Thus, the present research addresses this gap by producing a full exploration of the course taken, by each man encountered, in their return to society. Specifically, the main objective of the research is to highlight the different elements that help or hinder the social reintegration of men having served a sentence in a federal institution. The Bronfenbrenner ecological model, used as a theoretical framework, allows the analysis of these processes. Each of the systems included in this theory is explored, and this, for every man participating in the study. Based on a qualitative type research, six men were interviewed. They had all been outside of the prison walls for at least a year. These men are mostly from our big metropolis, but a few are from more distant cities, allowing to explore what happens outside the city of Montreal. For interviews, the methodological approach of life stories is prioritized, which allowed obtaining a wide testimony concerning their reintegration journey. The results of this research show the various pitfalls and difficulties faced by former Federal inmates during their return within the community, and even during their preparation for their release from the penitentiary walls. The various means set up to help did not have the effect wanted for many of the men. Wishing to seek social reintegration and the different ways put in place to help such men, were found in General, social exclusion and limiting factors.

322	La stratégie numérique des partis politiques québécois lors de la campagne électorale de 2018	Through a series of 10 semi-structured interviews with campaign staff from four Quebec political parties (Coalition Avenir Québec, Quebec Liberal Party, Parti Québécois, Québec Solidaire), this master’s thesis draws a portrait of the digital practices and strategies put in place in the context of the 2018 election campaign. We note that the studied parties show a very high level of digital deployment, integrating as much as possible the best practices observed internationally. Thus, the parties have set up new platforms to compile data, mobilize their supporters, and optimize their advertising. In particular, we conclude that digital technology affects the distribution of campaign resources, the structure of organizations and the level of refinement of political messages. New technologies are central to the exercise of political communication in Quebec, and no party seems to be excluded from this digital convergence.

323	Clinton VS  Trump : une analyse de l'élection de 2016 sous l'angle de l'information	Information plays an important role in some elections. Bartels evaluates the variable could influence significantly around 50% of all the elections in the United States. Despite a potentially decisive influence, few research has studied the variable in the context of the 2016 election. This thesis examines the level of information the average United States citizen possessed during an election that was all but ordinary. It is argued that the average voters’ behavior was influenced by their level of political information (H1) and that Trump was advantaged by a poorly informed public (H2). The scale of information the voters possessed was built with five questions of elementary political knowledge: the names of Joe Biden, Vladimir Putin, Paul Ryan, Angela Merkel and John Roberts. A second scale is built from the grades the interviewers gave to the respondent sample who answered the questionnaire face to face. Simulations are made to compare the sample to a similar one if it was fully informed and if it had been unable to answer a single question. The fully informed sample shows that 56% of voters would have voted for the democratic candidate, which would have likely guaranteed the victory to Hillary Clinton; when the sample is unable to answer a single question, Donald Trump wins the popular vote with 52% and keeps the electoral college.

324	Complémentarité fonctionnelle en phytoremédiation dans un sol à contamination mixte	Mixed contaminated soils with both organic and inorganic compounds represent about 40% of all contaminated sites. Phytoremediation is a promising green technology to decontaminate and restore mixed contaminated sites. The objective of the study was to evaluation the phytoremediation potential of a co-planting system between a shrub and an herbaceous species compared to the species in monocultures. A pot experiment with a woody specie, Salix interior, and one herbaceous species, Achillea millefolium, Trifolium pratense or Festuca arundinacea, and an unplanted control was conducted in a mixed CCA- and PCP-contaminated soil and non-contaminated soil for 120 days. Native and naturalized species with distinct functional traits were chosen for their possibly different and complementary phytoremediation abilities. Plant aboveground and belowground dry weights in all pots, trace element concentrations in plant tissues, and soil trace element and PCP concentrations in contaminated soil were recorded at the end of the cultivation period. Soil contamination and co-planting did not affect species biomass production, except in the S. interior + F. arundinacea treatment (SF) where roots yield was higher in the contaminated soil. The polyculture SF led to increased Cr and Cu total uptake in the roots of F. arundinacea. Furthermore, species in polycultures all had equal or superior trace element concentrations in their tissues compared to their monocultures. Death of S. interior in co-cropping with F. arundinacea was observed with no distinction of soil contamination and lead to mitigated conclusions. Treatments effects on PCP dissipation are inconclusive given the low soil concentrations found at the beginning and at the end of the experiment and because of the variability between the pots. We can therefore suggest that the co-planting of a shrub species and a species with different traits seems to lead to higher phytoremediation potential, but further investigation is required.	co-plantation , Phytoremediation , Functional complementarity , Co-planting , Mixed contamination	en	22743.0
325	Impact des fongicides foliaires et des néonicotinoïdes sur le puceron du soya et ses ennemis naturels	The use of neonicotinoid seed treatments to control the soybean aphid, Aphis glycines, has increased in soybean culture in North America over the last few years. Similarly, the preventive use of foliar fungicides has increased in recent years in Quebec, not because of significant risks of fungal diseases, but rather to increase crop yield through non-fungicidal physiological effects. These practices are generally economically unprofitable and may compromise the biological control offered by aphid natural ennemies. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of commonly used phytosanitary products on the soybean aphid and its natural ennemies. A laboratory experiment was first conducted to test the toxicity of two foliar fungicides to soybean aphid. Next, a field study was conducted over a two year period to evaluate the effects of neonicotinoid seed treatments and foliar fungicides on populations of soybean aphid and its natural ennemies. Our results indicate that neonicotinoid seed treatments can help control soybean aphid populations, however their use is unnecessary in most cases. Foliar fungicides were found to be toxic to soybean aphid and reduced populations in the field and in the laboratory. Natural ennemies were reduced by both foliar fungicides and seed treatments, probably due to their effects on aphids.

326	An Upper Ordovician faunal assemblage from the Neuville Formation of Québec, including an exceptionally preserved soft bodied sea anemone, Paleocerianthus neuvillii n. sp.	Fossils are the primary source of information on ancient life and its biodiversity. Fossils are attributed to geological periods, and the Ordovician is the most significant, having yielded valuable information on the origins, paleoecology and the biodiversity of today’s taxa. Some Ordovician fossil deposits are distinguished by their diversity and exceptionally preserved soft bodied fossils – the two criteria for defining a Konservat-Lägerstatte. Konservat-Lägerstatten are rare and created under specific taphanomic factors that lead to exceptional preservation. Here we demonstrate a new Ordovician Period Konservat-Lägerstatte from the Upper Ordovician of the Neuville Formation, Québec based on high diversity and the preservation of tube-dwelling anemones Paleocerianthus neuvillii n. sp. (Anthozoa: Ceriantharia). This is a benthic organism, with tentacles and a long soft column projecting from the tube. The mouth is surrounded by the crown of tentacles. The tubes often share a base with two, three or more additional tubes. The total length of the tubes varied from 24.9 mm to 51.0 mm (+ 36.9 mm) with small change in width, representing allometric growth. P. neuvillii lived in fine sediment associated with brachiopods, trilobites and echinoderms. The specimens were buried rapidly by a sedimentary flow. Paleocerianthus neuvillii, is the oldest record of a fossil tube anemone. Current phylogenies of the Anthozoa based on morphology and 18S rDNA sequence data place the Ceriantharia as a monophyletic group among Ceriantipatharia, and as a basal group of the Anthozoa. P. neuvillii is the oldest tube anemone fossil and therefore the best proximate ancestor for the Anthozoa.

327	Étude électrique et spectroscopique d'une décharge nanopulsée dans l'hélium à la pression atmosphérique	This thesis presents an electric and spectroscopic study of discharges created by repetitive  nanosecond pulses at atmospheric pressure in helium. Using optical emission and absorption  spectroscopy coupled with predictions from a collisional-radiative model of n=3 helium levels, the  space-time distribution of the electron temperature was obtained in such plasmas. More  specifically, imaging measures in the inter-electrode gap were first carried out to study the temporal  evolution of a nanopulsed discharge in a dielectric tube. We have observed that the rectangular  voltage pulse leads to the creation of two current peaks (therefore discharges) corresponding to its  rise and fall, respectively. The light intensity measurements allow the observation of a Townsend  breakdown during the first discharge and the experimental acquisition of Townsend’s first  coefficient for the electronic multiplication. This first discharge, resulting in the apparition of a  negative glow, does not contain metastable helium atoms (n=2) yet. Also, very high electron  temperatures are obtained, which concurs with the high luminosity from the discharge. Following  a short period where there is no helium emission, a strong rise in emission from impurities is  collected, a consequence of the metastable population increase. Finally, the second discharge  appears at the fall of the voltage pulse. Its origin being the accumulation of charges on the dielectric,  this discharge is shorter and weaker from a light intensity standpoint. Also, metastable presence  linked to Penning ionization mechanisms leads to smaller values of electron temperature.

328	La qualité des relations interpersonnelles d’adolescent(e)s ayant un TCA : liens avec la sévérité des symptômes, les caractéristiques personnelles et l’évolution du trouble	Adolescence is recognized as a period of development where there is an increased risk of suffering from an Eating Disorder (ED). It is also an age where youth must adapt to an altered relational context in which they are expected to separate from parental figures, while keeping positive ties with them, and to develop meaningful relationships with peers. Few empirical studies have examined how the quality of interpersonal relationships with mother, father and peers are linked with the severity of ED symptoms in adolescents with these conditions. A better understanding of the mechanisms that could underlie these associations as well as of the impact that familial and social relationships can have on the evolution of psychopathological symptoms in adolescents with ED is needed in order to improve treatment for this population. On the basis of these considerations, the present thesis aims to examine the quality of relationships with parents and friends of adolescents receiving treatment for an ED in order to better understand how it is related to the severity and evolution of their ED symptoms and to identify individual characteristics that might explain these links. In order to meet this objective, two empirical studies have been conducted and are presented in this thesis.   The first study aimed to examine the associations between the perceived levels of trust, communication and alienation in the relationships with mother, father and peers and the severity of ED symptoms in a clinical sample. The mediating effects of low self-esteem and negative mood were also examined. A total of 186 adolescent females (12 to 18 years old) presenting a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa completed self-report measures evaluating the perceived quality of interpersonal relationships, ED symptom severity, low self-esteem and negative mood. The results indicated that adolescents who perceive more alienation in their relationships with their mother and with their peers also endorsed more severe ED symptoms. Low self-esteem and negative mood acted as mediators of these associations.   In the second study, the links between the positive (i.e., communication, trust) and negative aspects (i.e., alienation) of the quality of the relationships with mother, father and peers, the severity of ED symptoms and the levels of negative mood were examined using a longitudinal design. The sample consisted of 51 adolescents with a diagnosis of ED (anorexia nervosa, bulimia, ED not otherwise specified) who were receiving treatment in a specialized program. Self-report questionnaires were used to assess participants’ quality of relationships with their parents and friends, ED symptom severity and negative mood at their arrival in the services and fifteen months later. The results indicated that better communication with mother and father as well as less alienation in the relationship with the mother at baseline were associated with less severe ED symptoms at follow-up. Higher initial levels of communication with the father and more trust in the interactions with peers were associated with lower levels of negative mood fifteen months later. Exploratory regression analyses also revealed significant associations between improvements in specific aspects of the relationships with mother, father and peers and ED-specific symptoms and negative mood over time.

329	Mobile data and computation offloading in mobile cloud computing	Global mobile traffic is increasing dramatically due to the popularity of smart mobile devices and data hungry mobile applications. Mobile data offloading is considered as a promising solution to alleviate congestion in cellular network. Mobile computation offloading can move computation intensive tasks and large data storage from mobile devices to cloud. In this thesis, we first study mobile data offloading problem under the architecture of mobile cloud computing. In order to minimize the overall cost for data delivery, we formulate the data offloading process, as a finite horizon Markov decision process, and we propose two data offloading algorithms to achieve minimal communication cost. Then, we consider a mobile data offloading market where mobile network operator can sell bandwidth to mobile users. We formulate this problem as a multi-item auction in order to maximize the profit of mobile network operator. We propose one robust optimization algorithm and two iterative algorithms to solve this problem. Finally, we investigate computation offloading problem in mobile edge computing. We focus on workload balancing problems to minimize the transmission latency and computation latency of computation offloading. We formulate this problem as a population game, in order to analyze the aggregate offloading decisions, and we propose two workload balancing algorithms based on evolutionary dynamics and revision protocols. Simulation results show the efficiency and robustness of our proposed methods.	Mobile computing , Cloud computing , Game theory , Markov process	en	22660.0
330	Un rendez-vous manqué. Journaux illustrés et films comiques dans la France d'avant 1915	"The links between the cinema and the illustrated press were perceived very early by the observers. Now, if historians seem to agree on an ""influence"" of the illustrated press on the comic production of French cinema, humorous newspapers are not very interested in cinema in general and completely, or almost completely, ignore comic films. How to explain this phenomenon ? This thesis proposes to develop three lines of thought. First, we try to understand the way in which the illustrated press saw the emergence and growth of the film show at the turn of the 19th century until the mid-1910s. For most chroniclers the cinema appears as an intruder among the Parisian stage shows, deporting in a way the rivalry between theater and cinema in the illustrated press. Then, by looking at the proximity between films and newspapers, it appears that cinema borrows from newspapers as much as it recycles their comic stories, modernizes them. This leads us finally to consider the two media from the angle of their differences, both ideological and political, preventing a meeting that seemed at first sight inevitable."	burlesque , caricature , Illustrated press , Comic films , Intermediality , Pre-cinema	en	22655.0
331	Photographie d'art et culture visuelle contemporaines : vers des pratiques photographiques technologiques	This thesis explores the moving, mobile and fluid nature of contemporary photography by clarifying current uses and values of photographic practices in artistic and socio-cultural circles. We posit the interpenetration of artistic and amateur photography in a contemporary regime by way of the concept of technology (tekhnè) as deployed in the writings of German philosopher Martin Heidegger. This analysis builds on works by modern (Yves Klein, Shunk/Kender) and contemporary artists (Taryn Simon, Penelope Umbrico, Li Wei, Wendy McMurdo), as well as different types of professional and non-professional practices (photojournalism, official documentation, images taken on blogs or social media). A comparative study of these images will allow us to reflect on recent photography in continuity with imaging practices of the 19th and 20th centuries, defining an atopic relationship to space and a metamodern relationship to time.	art contemporain , photography studies , contemporary art , visual culture , digital culture , philosophy of technology , atopia , metamodernism	en	22654.0
332	Lire et penser le monde : une analyse numérique d’un long siècle de géographies imaginées dans l’imprimé de langue française (1700-1815)	Historians have tried to determine what francophones read during the long 18th century for over a hundred years. To do so, they have studied library inventories, printing permits, and the archives of printer-editors, but these sources are fragmentary and of uncertain representativeness. This thesis reframes the question by studying, with a combination of computational methods and close reading, large digitized corpora that approximate the entire French-language print market of the long 18th century. Using these vast corpora, the thesis proposes and demonstrates that it is possible to pinpoint ideas to which readers were probably exposed frequently enough that the ideas influenced the readers’ mental maps of the world, regardless of what precise texts were involved in each case. Thus, the thesis shows that digital approaches constitute a major new tool for historians of reading and print, including (under some circumstances) when the only data at their disposal is OCR results plagued with high error rates. As an illustrative case study, the thesis examines imagined geographies, i.e., mental models of the world produced by exposition to print media containing direct or indirect descriptions of territories and their inhabitants. Concepts drawn from psychology, behavioural economics and media studies suggest how readers may have interiorized the messages transmitted by print and used them, consciously or not, to build their own imagined geographies.  A study of some 70 000 volumes printed in French between 1700 and 1815, extracted from the Hathi Trust collection, shows that the Europe discussed in print expands eastward with time, that England draws most of the attention, and that discourses regarding most of the European powers are both remarkably stable and centred on war and aristocracy. Studies of major periodicals, cheap popular booklets (the Bibliothèque bleue), geography manuals and Raynal’s Histoire des deux Indes corroborate these findings. Examining the 14,547 geography articles published in Diderot’s Encyclopédie reveals a largely urban imagined geography that changes focus during publication, from Diderot’ purely descriptive science to a tool for cultural transmission when Louis de Jaucourt takes over primary writing duties; a parallel study of 6,053 articles drawn from all fields of knowledge shows that the Encyclopédie describes America as a young world rich in resources, primarily botanical, that are ripe for the taking. The way in which the colonial French Atlantic world is portrayed in the Ancien Régime’s main periodicals suggests that they may have played a role in the French public’s notoriously low interest for emigration to the colonies. Travel narratives of expeditions to the Pacific and around the world show tensions between the step-by-step construction of a utilitarian geography and the need to retain readers’ interest by multiplying picturesque or terrifying anecdotes. In all, print media propose to their readers imagined geographies that treat the outside world with distrust.	histoire , France , history , reading , digital humanities , digital history , print , Atlantic world , Early Modern history	en	22652.0
333	Déterminants des migrations de l’Afrique vers l’Europe : du court séjour à la migration durable et / ou irrégulière	"International migration is often seen as a single, one-way movement from a country of origin to a host country. In contrast to this unidirectional view of migration, this thesis focuses on the articulation between temporary and long-term migration in the context of migration between Africa and Europe. More specifically, it focuses on the individual and contextual factors that explain why movements supposedly limited in time (called temporary) are transformed into long stays. In this research, temporary travel is approached from two perspectives: duration and law. In one case [1st empirical article], the aim is to study to what extent and for what reasons occasional stays (lasting less than one year) become the precursors of a sustainable settlement in Europe (for a period of at least one year). In the other case [2nd and 3rd empirical articles], the aim is to study how and why stays designed as temporary from a legal point of view (cases where migrants have a non-permanent right of residence) are transformed into irregular long-term stays. The thesis adopts a comparative approach that focuses on contextual effects in both three African countries of origin (Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana and Senegal) and six European countries of destination (Belgium, United Kingdom, Netherlands, France, Italy and Spain), with a particular focus on migration policy changes. It draws on three international databases: on the one hand, the individual biographical data of the MAFE project (Migrations between Africa and Europe) and, on the other hand, two contextual databases containing a coded description of migration policy changes of the ""Immigration Policy"" and ""Temporary vs permanent migration"" projects, and the ""Determinants of International Migration: A Theoretical and Empirical Assessment of Policy, Origin and Destination Effects"" (DEMIG) project. The statistical methods used are, on the one hand, descriptive statistics, in particular Kaplan-Meier curves and bivariate analysis methods and, on the other hand, explanatory models, in particular discrete time risk and duration models and the logit model. In the first article, it appears that short-term stay has a positive effect on long-term migration for the three sub-Saharan flows considered, although this effect is much greater for Congolese than for Ghanaians and Senegalese. The effect of short stay migration also depends on the period for Congolese migrants, while this interaction is not significant for Senegalese migrants and Ghanaian migrants, which indicates not only the context of the country of origin modulates the effect of the short stay on sustainable migration, but also the variation of the context over time within the same country of origin can modify the relationship between short stay and long term migration. In addition, it is noted that the level of education, land and house ownership, unemployment in the country of origin, social networks and studies in Europe seem to favour the relationship between short and long stays, but economic activity and employment in the countries of origin seem to have the opposite effect. The second article revealed that the risk of being in an irregular situation was increased in periods when migration policies were becoming increasingly strict. The influence of the entry period is very clear for Ghanaian and Senegalese migrants, but the risk of being in an irregular situation decreased in the 1990s and 2000s among Congolese migrants, suggesting that migrants from a country in conflict benefit from some protection against irregularity. The risk of being in an irregular situation is higher in recent immigration countries (Italy and Spain) than in traditional immigration countries (France and the United Kingdom). The irregularity also depends on the individual characteristics and circumstances of departure for Europe. The third article unexpectedly revealed that only policies aimed at limiting entry appear to have a significant effect on the transition to irregularity of Senegalese migrants already legally entering France, Italy and Spain. This result suggests that when policies to control entry become more stringent, migrants no longer dare to leave for fear of not being able to return. Other contextual elements also influence the irregularity of migrants: a negative effect of Senegal's annual GDP growth on the transition to irregularity (immigrants would choose to return to the country to work, thus avoiding irregularity), but a positive effect of the host country's annual GDP growth on the transition to irregularity (they would remain there to benefit from growth despite irregularity)."	transition , short stay , temporary movement , sustainable migration , long stay , irregularity , migration policies , irregular migration , irregular stay	en	22633.0
334	The Path of the Logos : the relevance of the practice of Bible study in an American prison	For Christians, a thorough study of the practice of Bible Study in the prison context can help deepen understandings of what constitutes effective ministry. For people outside of the Christian faith, a study of this practice could increase understandings about the complex relationships between faith, prison and personal growth in America. Many American Christians believe that Bible study is an emancipative practice that can help those forces seeking to resolve America’s enormous incarceration problem. Participants in penitentiary bible study (teachers and students) seek ways of showing that the light of God continues to shine even in the darkest places on earth like prisons.  Belief in this theological perspective has led many Christians (as volunteers or as chaplains) to fight against the problem of mass incarceration by establishing religious practices in prisons. The American prison system sees religion not only as a right to be preserved but also as one of the programs that help rehabilitate the prisoner before his or her return to society. Garden State Youth Correctional Facility (GSYCF) houses about 1200 young men between the ages of 17 and 27. Like most American prisons, GSYCF is required to offer opportunities for religious practice to prisoners.  Through the approach of Pastoral Praxeology, this research observes the practice and the effects of Bible study on the lives of several incarcerated practitioners. The particular Bible study practice that this research project engages is the Logos Bible Study (LBS) which is distinguished from other programs by its focus on the prayerful study of the Holy Scriptures and the promotion of critical self-reflection over time. After analyzing the interviews and surveys of a group of incarcerated participants in LBS, this study has found methods for creating a terrain of positive transformation within a territory of incarceration. These methods lead to Anakainosis-Desmios—a state of spiritual renewal only possible within prison that promotes the creation and expression of emancipatory and hospitable attitudes within an oppressive and hostile prison culture.

335	Diversité taxinomique et fonctionnelle des habitats benthiques dans l’espace et dans le temps : une perspective régionale et décennale	This thesis takes advantage of long-term monitoring data covering a regional scale to better apprehend the main drivers of the diversity of coastal seafloors. Through consideration of multiple spatial and temporal scales and different facets of community diversity, the main objective of this work was to provide a better predictive understanding of the responses of benthic communities to environmental changes. In particular, this thesis addressed the potential consequences of the on-going homogenisation of the seafloor and the global loss of biogenic habitats, havens of diversity made by foundation species. Through comparison of two such habitats, intertidal seagrass meadows and subtidal maerl beds, with bare sediment devoid of foundation species, this thesis has highlighted the key role of biogenic structures for long-term maintenance of the diversity and functioning of benthic communities. Indeed, these habitats mediate the dynamics and responses of benthic communities to environmental conditions, ensure a greater stability of their spatial structures at regional scale, and appeared essential for the long-term maintenance of the ecological functions benthic invertebrates are associated with. This work also highlighted that foundation species may affect benthic communities through different mechanisms, and that has implications on the structure and vulnerability of these communities. Lastly, this thesis emphasized a strong spatial and temporal stability of community richness despite important underlying changes in composition and thereby stressed the need to better characterise these compositional variations to guide conservation. These variations contributed, for instance, to an unexpectedly high taxonomic and functional richness of bare sediment at regional scale, similar to those of biogenic habitats, despite being locally depauperate. Overall, broad-scale monitoring programs are fundamental assets to bridge local empirical and theoretical ecological knowledge to the broader scales at which society manage and benefits from natural ecosystems.

336	La gratuité des soins associée à l’amélioration de la qualité des soins est-elle efficace pour maintenir l’utilisation des services à long terme et améliorer la santé infantile au Burkina Faso ?	Introduction: Improving financial access to health care is believed to be essential for reducing the burden of child morbidity and mortality in resource-limited settings, but the available evidence on the relationship between increased access and health remains scarce and the long-term issues are still unknown. In the specific context of the Sahel region in Burkina Faso where high levels of morbidity and malnutrition coincide with low health care use, a pilot intervention for free health care including quality of care improvement and management of malnutrition at the community level was implemented in September 2008. Objectives:  Using statistical and epidemiological approaches applied to cross-sectional and time series data, this thesis aims to provide a better understanding of how the presence of intervention in communities can increase and maintain long-term use of health services and improve the health of children under five years. The specific objectives are: 1) to evaluate the long-term effects of the intervention on the use of health services in children under the age of five, 2) to estimate the contextual effect of intervention on the probability of occurrence of and the likelihood of health services being used by children under five, four years after the start of its implementation, and 3) to evaluate the contextual effect of the intervention on stunting in children under five, four years after the start of its implementation. Methods: The data for the analyses were provided from a variety of sources including the national health information system, a retrospective health services survey, and a household survey conducted four years after the intervention onset in 41 villages in the intervention district and 51 villages in the comparison district.  We used a quasi-experimental controlled interrupted time-series design group to analyze the immediate and long-term effects of the intervention on the rate of health services utilization in children under five. Then, a quasi-experimental post-test-only design that included a control group allowed us to evaluate the contextual effect of the intervention on the probability of occurrence of a disease, on the probability of use of health services, and stunting in children under five. The analytic strategy combined the propensity score weighting method to balance the covariates between the two groups, two-level mixed-effects negative binomial, and linear and logistic regression models to account for the hierarchical structure of data.   Results: The intervention for free health care including quality of care improvement and management of malnutrition at the community level was associated with an increased and maintained use of health services beyond four years after the onset of intervention (incidence rate ratio = 2.33; 95% CI = 1.98–2.67).  In addition, compared to children living in the comparison district, the probability of using health services was 17.2% higher among those living in the intervention district (95% CI = 15.0–26.6); and 20.7% higher when the illness episode was severe (95% CI = 9.9–31.5). These associations were significant regardless of the distance to health centers and the socio-economic status of households. In addition, inequalities in the use of care were less pronounced in the intervention villages compared to those in the control village. Finally, the results also showed that the residence context accounted for 9.36% of the variance in stunting (intra-class correlation = 9.36% ; 95% CI = 6.45–13.38), and only 2% of the variance in stunting was explained by the intervention. However, we could not demonstrate that the intervention in these communities was associated with a reduced probability of an illness occurring (AME=4.4 (95% CI: -1.0 – 9.8), nor with a significant improvement in the nutritional status among children under five (OR = 1.13; 95% CI = 0.83–1.54). Conclusion: This thesis underlines the importance that affordable health care, including quality of care, as well as improving the management of malnutrition at the community level, are effective in increasing and maintaining the use of health services and reduce geographical inequalities in the use of care. However, this intervention was not associated with improved child health outcomes. Although rigorous longitudinal studies are necessary to fully understand the potential influence of this intervention on morbidity, this thesis highlights the need to simultaneously act on other social determinants of health and to synergistically integrate nutrition-specific interventions for greater impact on child health.

337	L'alliance thérapeutique avec les adolescents de minorités ethnoculturelles en services de protection de la jeunesse	The disproportion of ethnocultural minority youth in child welfare services is well documented in the United States, in Canada and in Quebec. Among the solutions identified to address the over-representation of certain ethnocultural minority groups in child welfare services, the client-caseworker relationship has been found to be on of the best contributing factors towards change. The unique role of therapeutic alliance in intervention success, particularly in child welfare, and the lack of literature giving a voice to adolescents, who are at the heart of these interventions, increase the relevance of documenting their point of view regarding the relationship they have with their caseworker. To this end, two studies were conducted. The first theoretical study is a critical review of the literature regarding recommended clinical practices that promote therapeutic alliance in interventions conducted with ethnocultural minority adolescents in mandatory intervention settings, which include child welfare, juvenile justice and psychiatry. In total, 32 articles were reviewed to highlight clinical practices that are organized around knowledge, skills and dispositions. The methodological limits of the studies are addressed, and recommendations for future research and clinical practice are proposed. The second study, a phenomenological qualitative empirical study, was conducted to 1) better understand the perceived influence of ethnocultural background on the establishment of  therapeutic alliance between ethnocultural minority adolescents and their child welfare caseworker; 2) to understand, from a dyadic perspective, similarities, differences, points of agreement and points of disagreement in the adolescent-caseworker dyad. This study is part of a larger project that aims to explore the experiences of families from ethnocultural minority background receiving child welfare services (Lavergne and Dufour, 2015). Fifteen adolescents aged 12 to 17 and their thirteen caseworkers were met during semi-structured interviews. Thematic analyses were conducted. A second stage of analysis was then carried out, this one on adolescent-caseworker dyads, in order to better reflect the relational nature of therapeutic alliance. The results led to the identification of factors that influence specific therapeutic alliance parameters, including bond and agreement on goals and tasks. However, these influences seem to depend on the relative importance of the cultural parameter in each specific relationship, highlighting the importance of prior evaluation of that variable. The implications for clinical practice, training and research are discussed. The results of the two studies led to the identification of complementary clinical recommendations aimed at fostering therapeutic alliance with adolescents from ethnocultural minorities in child welfare services. Several considerations regarding barriers to applying these practices, optimizing caseworker training programs, and the need for further empirical support of the practices in future research are further addressed.	adolescents , Therapeutic alliance , adolescents , ethnocultural minority , mandatory intervention , child welfare	en	22575.0
338	Learning competitive ensemble of information-constrained primitives	We want to develop reinforcement learning algorithms that enable the learning agent to obtain a structured decomposition of its behavior. Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning provides a mechanism for doing this by explicitly modularising the policy into two components --- a set of low-level sub-policies (or primitives) and a high-level master policy to coordinate between the primitives. While the primitives have to specialize to only a part of the state space, the master policy has to specialize to the entire state space as it decides when to activate which primitives. This introduces a        ``bottleneck'' where the success of the agent depends on the success of the master policy, thereby making it a single point of failure.  We propose to do away with this limitation by using a new mechanism where the sub-policies can decide for themselves in which part of the state they want to act. This decentralized decision making does away with the need for a parameterized master policy. We use this mechanism to train a policy that is composed of an ensemble of primitives but one that does not require a master policy to choose between the primitives. We experimentally demonstrate that this policy architecture improves over both flat and hierarchical policies in the terms of generalization. This work is under review at the NeurIPS 2019 Conference as a paper titled Learning Competitive Ensemble of Information-Constrained Primitives.  In Chapter One, I provide a background to Reinforcement Learning, Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning, Information Bottleneck, Compositionality, and Neural Module Networks and discuss how the proposed work in Chapter Two relates to these ideas. Chapter Two describes the idea of training an ensemble of primitives. I conclude the thesis by discussing some future research directions for the work described in Chapter Two.

339	Étude de l’effet d’un mimétique de l’apoA-I sur la dysfonction diastolique du ventricule gauche	Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (LVDD), a precursor form of heart failure, is a condition that affects compliance and relaxation of the myocardium. Unlike systolic heart failure, there is no clinically approved treatment yet for LVDD. Complexity of the pathways behind this disease as well as the small number of adequate animal models reflecting its physiopathology are the main causes of this lack of treatment. In our laboratory, we previously showed that mimetic of apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), a major component of high-density lipoproteins (HDL), improves LVDD in a rabbit model of aortic valve stenosis (AVS). AVS is one of the main risk factors which can cause LVDD. The first objective of this thesis is to develop a valid animal model of LVDD without AVS. The second objective is to test the potential effects of apoA-I on this pathology and to elucidate the mechanisms of action behind these effects. To do so, we used two different models of rabbits. The first, was based on the exposure of rabbits to a high-cholesterol diet for an average period of 16 weeks (without excess of vitamin D2 to prevent development of AVS). The second, is a surgical model of transaortic constriction (TAC). With this model, rabbits develop LVDD within 12 weeks after surgery, without involvement of AVS. Once LVDD was established, rabbits were treated with 3 injections of 25 mg/kg of apoA-I mimetic peptide weekly for 4 consecutive weeks. Echocardiography sessions were performed throughout the study to assess the stage of the disease at different time points. Molecular effects of the treatment were evaluated by qPCR and by immunohistochemistry experiments. In our two rabbit models, LVDD was established without the presence of AVS. At the end of the treatment period, our drug did not significantly improve diastolic dysfunction in rabbits. Only a few positive effects of treatment involved in the anti-inflammatory pathway have been noticed. In conclusion, these results allowed us to confirm that the positive effects of apoA-I mimetic peptide that we have previously reported on LVDD in another study were mediated by the improvement of AVS but not by a direct effect on the myocardium.	apoA-I , Diastolic  Dysfunction , Aortic valve stenosis , Animal model	en	22533.0
340	Structure-fonction des transporteurs transmembranaires de la famille MmpL3 de Mycobacterium tuberculosis	The emergence of resistance to a multitude of antimicrobial agents in pathogenic bacteria is considered a major threat to public health (2). These strains are recognized as multidrug resistant organisms (MDR) (4). Research is progressing in Gram positive, Gram positive high GC and Gram negative bacteria, and given the scale of the public health threat, these MDR have become potential targets for this research. The objectives of the present study consist of the structural and functional characterization of various transmembrane transporters of the still enigmatic RND (Resistance-Nodulation-Division) family, namely: MmpL3 in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) via the study of its ortholog CmpL1 in Corynebacterium glutamicum (Cgl) and TriAxBC in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa).  The first component of this project, presented in Chapter 2, studies the structure of the transporter MmpL3 Mtb (a TMM mycolic acid transporter essential for the viability of Mtb (5) and that of its CmpL1 Cgl orthologue, which have been predicted via the I- Tasser Pack (6-8). These structures were subsequently validated by comparing to the electronic map generated for CmpL1 (18 Å) by negative staining transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Characterization of the purified CmpL1 transporter by size exclusion chromatography confirmed the trimeric complex size around 315 KDa (including the detergent crown) corroborated by SDS-PAGE gel analyses. Collaborative genetic and biochemical studies have also identified residues involved in the transport of TMM in MmpL3 as well as those residues conferring antibiotic resistance. This data highlighted the location of the essential residues of transport and resistance in the central channel of the trimeric Mmpl3 model. The MmpL3 region activating proto-motor transport has been located at a central cavity, which is an intrinsic feature of the RND family. The low-resolution electronic maps obtained for the protein CmpL1 may serve as the foundation of future studies.     In Chapter 3 we explore the therapeutic potential of the targeting of the transmembrane transporter MmpL3 in different Mycobacterium strains. Our collaborators studied the therapeutic effect of the most promising inhibitors of the MmpL3 Mtb transporter on certain multi-resistant mycobacterial non-tuberculous (NTB) strains. Based on our comparative structural modeling obtained by I-TASSER (6-8), we supplemented the biochemical data by highlighting the structural similarities and differences between the TB and NTB strains as well as their functional impacts. This chapter highlights the interest of direct or indirect targeting of MmpL3 in NTB species. Indeed, the efficacy of certain selected MmpL3 Mtb inhibitors on the treatment of NTB pulmonary infection have potential as generalizable treatment options for other NTB multi-resistant strains, or even to help address the problem of resistance to antibiotics and simplify current combination approaches.                                                                                Other collaborative studies undertaking the same structural approaches were carried out for TriAxBC tripartite carriers (P. aeruginosa), efflux pumps belonging to the RND family. The purpose of Chapter 4 was to generate a structure of the complex and decipher its mode of assembly and expulsion of antibiotics from the intracellular environment. A quaternary structure model of TriAxBC was predicted by I-TASSER (6-8) and validated against its 4.3 Å electronic map generated by Cryo-EM. The TriAxBC complex was also characterized by gel filtration confirming an approximate size of 620 KDa and its trimer composition by SDS-PAGE.  In conclusion, this study is combining different biochemical, genetic and structural approaches to highlight the need for a multidisciplinary approach to characterizing the structure function of RND transporters. The latter remain enigmatic; however, our contribution and the progress of others will allow the generation of new specific drugs targeting multiresistant strains.

341	Étude de l’implication des voies non-canoniques de TGF-beta durant la régénération de la patte chez l’axolotl	The strength of basic research lies in the ability to translate discoveries to real human problems, whether they are medical, social or practical. Generally, research begins with a problem that needs to be solved. Humans have a healing capacity that can be defined as rapid, but resides more in repairing promptly than in quality healing. If the injury in question is not life threatening, usually the human body is able to heal in order to keep the organism alive, but the function is not always restored. For example, in the case of an amputation the healing will be done by scar formation, and will form a stump rendering the amputated part non-functional. Our lab studies regeneration and scar-free healing in a model that does it phenomenally well, the axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum). Understanding the signaling that allows this animal to regenerate perfectly may allow us to transfer these discoveries to treatments for humans.  Our signaling regulatory model of the regeneration process puts the cytokine TGF-β at the heart of our research. This protein is responsible for blastema formation, by allowing migration and proliferation following the amputation. Our research has shown that during the first phase of regeneration, TGF-β activates SMAD2 and SMAD3, and that the healing process mainly goes through SMAD2, since the level of SMAD3 is very low. Also, by only blocking SMAD3, regeneration proceeds normally. The importance of TGF-β for the formation of the blastema is now very well demonstrated, however, its role in wound closure has not yet been determined.  The function of TGF-β is associated with a multitude of processes including epithelial to mesenchymal transitions (EMT). This process is characterized by phenotypic changes of epithelial cells allowing them to migrate. EMTs occur during development, cancer progression and during wound healing. We therefore tried to understand how EMTs could play a role in the regeneration of the limb and how TGF-β could influence it.  During my Ph.D., we determined that EMTs were associated with wound closure, an essential step to regeneration. In addition, their regulation is dependent in part on TGF-β. Wound closure is dependent of the TGF-β/SMAD pathway (known as the canonical pathway) and the TGF-β/p38/JNK pathway (one of the non-canonical pathways). Additionally, we showed that p38 and JNK are essential for blastema progression, and in this case, independently of TGF-.  The results obtained during this thesis provide a better understanding of what signaling pathway allows perfect regeneration in axolotl.

342	Étude de la fusion humaine NUP98-HOXA9 chez la drosophile	Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogenous hematopoietic disorder characterized by the accumulation of immature myeloid progenitors or myeloblasts in the blood and bone marrow. Several genetic abnormalities can lead to the disease. One of these corresponds to the NUP98-HOXA9 (NA9) translocation that fuses sequences encoding the N-terminal portion of NUP98 to those encoding the DNA-binding domain of HOXA9. It is a rare translocation associated with poor prognosis, but represents a prototypical case used to study NUP98-HOX chromosomal rearrangements. Despite numerous studies, the molecular mechanisms underlying NA9 leukemogenic activity remain unclear. This thesis seeks to shed light on NA9’s mechanism of action using the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism.  The first chapter introduces, in a first section, hematopoiesis and provides actual knowledge on NA9 translocation. In a second section, Drosophila hematopoiesis as well as compound eye development and its use for genetic screening strategy are addressed. Next chapters are devoted to our research results. A first article shows phenotype characterization induced by expression of the human NA9 oncoprotein in the Drosophila larval hematopoietic system. NA9 markedly enhanced cell proliferation and tissue growth, but did not alter cell fate specification. Reminiscent to NA9 activity in mammals, NA9 strongly collaborates with the MEIS homolog Hth. Moreover, genetic characterization of NA9-induced phenotype suggested interference with Pvr (Flt1-4 RTK homolog) signalling, which is similar to functional interaction observed in mammals between Flt3 and NUP98-HOX fusions in leukemia. Finally, NA9 expression was also found to induce non-cell autonomous affects, raising the possibility that its leukemogenic activity relies on this property. A second manuscript demonstrates the specificity of a NA9-induced phenotype in fly eye and reports a genetic screen to identify novel NA9 functional partners. A total of 29 loci have been isolated and of which, 16 have now been linked to a specific gene. Three of these had previously been shown to contribute to NA9 activity (Rae1, emb, hth). Finally, we focused on the chromatin remodelling factor E(Pc).     Using Drosophila, this study has uncovered several novel functional aspects linked to NA9 activity. In the long term, upon demonstrating their relevance to NA9-mediated AML onset, some of the new players identified here could pave the way to develop targeted therapeutic strategies to improve overall patient survival.

343	Peter Krausz : Et in Arcadia ego	Peter Krausz is known as a socially conscious artist essentially concerned with the relationship between the human being and nature. Since the 1970s, the discourse of his artistic production has revolved around a critique of territorial and border issues. While represented in a formal language very like that of his prior body of work, the 28 works comprising his most recent series, Et in Arcadia ego (2014-2017), involve a different approach to landscape. How does the absence now of a human figure and of spatiotemporal markers prompt a reflection in spectators on their relationship with the landscape? The compositions in these egg tempera paintings and pastels on paper highlight the pastoral and idyllic aspects of the Mediterranean landscape, an idealization also evinced in the series title, which explicitly refers to the myth of Arcadia. In Antiquity, poets nourished legends about this Greek realm of bounteous nature and eternal spring. Krausz reactualizes the myth by borrowing from the title of Nicolas Poussin’s painting Et in Arcadia ego (1638). The present research examines the meaning of the phrase, usually translated as “I, Death, exist in Arcadia” taking into consideration that Krausz’s series belongs to an entirely different historical period and context of production. Research for this thesis is informed by the concept of landscape as cultural construct developed by philosopher Anne Cauquelin. This concept allows me to establish the historiographic link between the collections of Classical poetry, classicist painting of the 17th century, and the work of Krausz. The artist’s vision of nature will be presented from the perspectives of a fashioned collective memory, and from a singular view of the contemporary landscape. I intend to demonstrate how the Et in Arcadia ego series effectively enables a reflection on the 21st century’s own context of environmental deterioration.

344	Dynamiques hydrologiques d’un petit bassin versant arctique, rivière Niaqunguk, Iqaluit, Nunavut	Despite recent advances in the hydrological knowledge of permafrost regions, precise predictions or modelling of hydrological dynamics in Arctic watersheds remains difficult. In this master thesis a combination of field measurements, chemistry and statistical analysis were conducted at the hillslope scale and at watershed scale within the Niaqunguk River catchment, to improve our understanding of the processes controlling the water delivery to rivers in permafrost landscape. The first study show that hillslope drainage dynamics were intrinsically linked to permafrost active layer thawing patterns. The microtopography of the surficial organic layer has a great influence on the distribution across the hillslope, by first enhancing the accumulation of water in surficial depressions, which in return enhance localized thaw and the accumulation of water in subsurface depressions. The second study conducted at the watershed scale allowed to delineated, based on the particularities of the water chemistry along the river network, four distinct periods, corresponding respectively to early snowmelt, snowmelt recession, baseflow and summer rainfall events. Since dominant hydrological processes within the watershed changed from one period to another, this period division is relevant the understand the behaviour of the river system. The primary processes associated with each of the four periods were: snowmelt contributions, the distinction between late lying snowpack melt and lake contributions, subsurface flows through mineral deposits and surface flows through the organic layer. Fundamental hydrological knowledge generated in this research will greatly help to improve our ability to predict the response of Arctic hydrological systems to climate changes, but is also indispensable for a sustainable management of a future exploitation of the Niaqunguk River as a potable water for the City of Iqaluit.	hydrologie , Arctic , hydrology , active layer , subsurface flows , lakes , surface flows	en	22504.0
345	L’écriture et la réécriture des failles de l’utopie religieuse : analyse comparative de The Scarlet Letter de Nathaniel Hawthorne et The Handmaid’s Tale de Margaret Atwood	This mémoire de maîtrise is a comparative exploration of two literary representations of American dystopic theocracies : The Scarlet Letter (1850), a historical romance; and The Handmaid’s Tale (1985), a speculative projection. The argument is focused upon the regulation and deployment by the totalitarian state of women’s bodies and reproductive capacities, in the broad and remarkably convergent contexts, historical and futuristic/hypothetical, of Puritan literalism. Beginning with a brief survey of utopianism, the mémoire explores the interlinearity of utopian projection with its precise opposite. Literary history suggests that there is no binary opposition between the genres of utopic and dystopic fiction : the latter arises from the very impossibility of social perfection that is internal to the narrative economy of the former.  In sharp contrast to the linear temporality envisioned by American progressives, the fictions studied here entertain – as jeremiad – the circularity of historical and future Christian fundamentalism. For the novels represent a similar, often identical, state regulation and instrumentalization of women’s bodies.   Essentially, this mémoire explores three dimensions of the representation of dissident women in theocratic dystopias.  First, Michel Foucault’s model of the public spectacle of the scaffold, in Discipline and Punish, is brought to bear on the modalities by which the dissident women in these religious societies are punished. Secondly, Erich Auerbach’s theory of figura – the conjoining of prophecy and fulfillment – offers a conceptual context for the historical temporalities of feminist resistance to patriarchal tyranny.  Finally, and consistently, Derridean theory Writing and Difference, 1967 ; Archive Fever – A Freudian Impression, 1995), amplifies the resistances, authorial and figural, to hegemonic assujettissement. This project was written in response to the ominous threats to democracy in the contemporary United States : the access to power of fundamentalist Christian conservatism, the precarious balance between left and right on the US Supreme Court and its implications for women’s access to reproductive control. Ironically, however, dystopian fictions can be both galvanizing and emancipating.	figura , violence , religion , utopia , dystopia , perfectibility , totalitarianism , prophecy , feminism	en	22482.0
346	Développement d’une méthode SPRi pour la quantification et l’identification régiosélective de protéines cibles dans des coupes tissulaires biologiques	The state of certain diseases can be revealed and monitored by the presence or the relative concentration of specific biomolecule in tissues or biofluids. However, it remains challenging to identify and quantify proteins in biological samples with spatial resolution for imaging of tissues in pathological studies or in biochemical measurements. To achieve this objective, the combination of surface plasmon resonance imaging (SPRi) and matrix assisted laser desorption ionization imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI-iMS) was recently proposed to obtain quantitative and qualitative images from a single tissue imprint, on a single sensor chip. In this technique, MALDI-iMS identify and sequence biomolecules, while SPRi provides absolute and regioselective quantification. Both imaging techniques give complementary information about the absolute amount and the spatial organization of proteins at the surface of the sensor, but it is still impossible with the current experimental design to locally quantify a specific target protein. The work presented in this thesis focuses on the development of a reproducible method allowing the regioselective quantification of target proteins within a thin tissue section. Surface chemistry is used to graft a selective bioreceptor on the surface of the sensor chip (such as antibodies) to specifically quantify a biomolecule with regioselectivity. The local quantification and identification of a target protein is monitored using SPRi, in a two-step assay. This thesis will focus on the functionalization of selective sensor chip surfaces for a targeted protein in different samples, and on the transfer of those proteins from samples to the surface through a nylon membrane.

347	Analyse de la gestion et des conditions de la mise en œuvre des cycles d’apprentissage par des directions d’écoles primaires francophones montréalaises	This doctoral thesis focuses on the change management of 21 school administrator’s mandated to implement learning cycles in their school. This complex change, prescribed by the Quebec government in the context of large-scale educational reform, involves major changes in school organization, teaching practices, and professional practices. In order to achieve the implementation of this reform in the early 2000s, the government selected a hybrid implementation model that gives schools leeway to adapt the change to their needs and the specific conditions. However, it seems that implementation of learning cycles remains to be done in most Quebec elementary schools. Difficulties in implementing learning cycles are also present in France and French-speaking Belgium. How to explain such difficulties? Our research suggests some answers to this question by providing a comprehensive analysis of what is involved in learning cycles organization, a relatively new and unclear concept for many school stakeholders. The scope of this change, which affects, among other things, school organization and teachers’ work habits, requires a deep review of practices in schools. A change of this magnitude is difficult to achieve according to the literature presented in this thesis, especially if it’s not a priority for the authorities in place at the various levels of the system (school, school board, Ministry of Education). That being said, some elementary schools in the study are more advanced than others in implementing learning cycles, although none of them work completely in cycles. To learn more about the reasons of these differences, we looked at various reform success factors grouped into five categories: the school principals’ vision of change, their initiatives and strategies to implement the cycles, the general and specific conditions that can influence the process, and the effects of learning cycles in these schools. It appears from this study, that only a minority of school principals consider this change mandatory and have a consistent view of what is a learning cycles organization on a daily basis. Also, the complexity of change has been underestimated, and the implementation’s planning and monitoring was poor. Those findings may explain why this change hasn’t occurred yet.

348	Organisation et re-production des rapports de domination dans les distributions dissymétriques du travail enseignant : une enquête du point de vue d’enseignant·es de groupes racisés	"In less than a decade, the professional integration of immigrant teachers has generated a large body of research in Quebec. In general, these studies use interpretive frameworks that rely on an analysis of cultural gaps between immigrant teachers and the host society. Despite measures put in place in 2001 to mitigate the effects of systemic discrimination in employment in public bodies, there is no research linking the experience of these teachers to the persistent under-representation of racialized teachers in Quebec or, even more notably, in the French-language school boards of the Montreal Metropolitan Region (MMR) (Quebec Human Rights Commission, 2015).  Based on a critical/interpretative epistemological perspective and a framework of feminist analysis, this dissertation moves away from this essentializing prism in order to produce new knowledge aimed at increasing social justice within educational institutions. The feminist perspectives guiding the thesis have in common their desire to expose the configurations of social and power relations through which domination in the various spheres of society is materialized, including in the workplace. Inspired by the sociological method of institutional ethnography, this study takes the form of an enquiry seeking to understand how social relations, especially of race, are organized and (re)produced in the asymmetrical distributions of teaching work. The study was conducted from the point of view of vocational integration teachers who were assigned by racial social relations and were working in French-language school boards in the Montreal MRR (14). Their stories and questions led to an exploration of the institutional and practical processes regulating the obtention of a teaching licence and employment contracts. The study was expanded through interviews with principals of educational institutions (4), educational consultants (2), union representatives (2) and employees in the human resources sector (2) within two school boards of the MMR. Documents that codify these processes in different ways – laws, regulations, reports, collective agreements, etc. – have also been analyzed.  The thesis conclusions explore several aspects. The exposure of the configurations of social relations in teaching work cannot be done without more widely exposing the multiple hierarchies structuring this work and even its legislative framework. From various fragments of materials, the thesis reveals empirically how the increase of atypical and precarious work in teaching – which has become more pronounced since the 1990s – induced an increase in the possibilities of hierarchization among employees, from which arose a reconfiguration of the division of labour. The thesis shows how racial social relations organize the distribution of work in a profession already historically structured according to gender social relations. The results highlight the creation of hierarchical ""classes"" of teachers in order to fill assignments, which are themselves classified according to whether or not they make career advancement possible. In the absence of effective measures to counter systemic discrimination, this thesis shows how the arbitrary nature of the processes and the criteria by which teachers are selected run the risk of disproportionately confining teachers from racialized groups to atypical and precarious jobs. In light of these results, the thesis calls on educational leaders to intervene at several levels of educational institutions to confront inequalities in treatment that effectively compromise equality rights among teaching staff."

349	Sleep and wake disturbances following traumatic brain injury	Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major health concern in industrialised countries. Sleep and wake disturbances are among the most persistent and disabling sequelae after TBI. Yet, despite the widespread complaints of post-TBI sleep and wake disturbances, studies on their etiology, pathophysiology, and treatments remain inconclusive. This narrative review aims to summarise the current state of knowledge regarding the nature of sleep and wake disturbances following TBI, both subjective and objective, spanning all levels of severity and phases postinjury. A second goal is to outline the various causes of post-TBI sleep-wake disturbances. Globally, although sleep-wake complaints are reported in all studies and across all levels of severity, consensus regarding the objective nature of these disturbances is not unanimous and varies widely across studies. In order to optimize recovery in TBI survivors, further studies are required to shed light on the complexity and heterogeneity of post-TBI sleep and wake disturbances, and to fully grasp the best timing and approach for intervention.

351	An integrated 3D approach for effective mine risk education in post war-zone areas	International Mine Action Standards define Mine Risk Education (MRE) as activities that seek to reduce the risk of death and injury from mines and explosive remnants of war, by raising awareness and promoting safe behaviour. MRE systems and practices in post clearance areas in conflict affected regions worldwide promote two main types of activities, identification of explosive remnants of war and making the correct response ensuring individual safety as well as the safety of the community. This can be viewed as a two dimensional approach spanned by Identification and Response dimensions. This paper based on the findings from a recent empirical study conducted specifically in the northern Sri Lanka introducing Reconciliation as a third dimension to further improve the present two dimensional approach of mine risk education. The authors acknowledge that MRE has had a positive impact on war affected communities in global context. However, it needs considerable integration of a learning module which should reflect the different causes of life catastrophe risks are similar to mine risks in extreme scenarios- they constitute non-diversifiable risks, so that MRE helps maintain a significant effect and long- lasting impact on attitudes towards landmines and other explosive remnants of war at the community level.

352	Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (App) culture supernatant antiviral effect against porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) occurs prior to the viral genome replication and transcription through actin depolymerization	PURPOSE: Recently, the strong antiviral activity of an Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (App) culture supernatant against porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) was discovered. Following this finding, the objective of the present study was to understand how the App culture supernatant inhibits PRRSV replication in its natural targeted host cells, i.e. porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs).  METHODOLOGY: Several assays were conducted with App culture supernatant-treated PRRSV-infected cell lines, such as PAM, St-Jude porcine lung and MARC-145 cells. RT-qPCR assays were used to determine the expression levels of type I and II IFN mRNAs, viral genomic (gRNA) and sub-genomic RNAs (sgRNAs). Proteomic, Western blot and immunofluorescence assays were conducted to determine the involvement of actin filaments in the App culture supernatant antiviral effect.Results/Key findings. Type I and II IFN mRNA expressions were not upregulated by the App culture supernatant. Time courses of gRNA and sgRNA expression levels demonstrated that the App culture supernatant inhibits PRRSV infection before the first viral transcription cycle. Western blot experiments confirmed an increase in the expression of cofilin (actin cytoskeleton dynamics regulator) and immunofluorescence also demonstrated a significant decrease of actin filaments in App culture supernatant-treated PRRSV-infected PAM cells. App culture supernatant antiviral activity was also demonstrated against other PRRSV strains of genotypes I and II.  CONCLUSION: App culture supernatant antiviral effect against PRRSV takes place early during PRRSV infection. Results suggest that App culture supernatant antiviral effect may take place via the activation of cofilin, which induces actin depolymerization and subsequently, probably affects PRRSV endocytosis. Other experiments are needed to fully validate this latest hypothesis.

353	Measuring uncertainty at the regional level using newspaper text	In this paper I present a methodology to provide uncertainty measures at the regional level in real time using the full bandwidth of news. In order to do so I download vast amounts of newspaper articles, summarize these into topics using unsupervised machine learning, and then show that the resulting topics foreshadow fluctuations in economic indicators. Given large regional disparities in economic performance and trends within countries, it is particularly important to have regional measures for a policymaker to tailor policy responses. I use a vector-autoregression model for the case of Canada, a large and diverse country, to show that the generated topics are significantly related to movements in economic performance indicators, inflation, and the unemployment rate at the national and provincial level. Evidence is provided that a composite index of the generated diverse topics can serve as a measure of uncertainty. Moreover, I show that some topics are general enough to have homogenous associations across provinces, while others are specific to fluctuations in certain regions.

354	Subcortical amyloid relates to cortical morphology in cognitively normal individuals	Purpose Amyloid (Aβ) brain deposition can occur in cognitively normal individuals and is associated with cortical volume abnormalities. Aβ-related volume changes are inconsistent across studies. Since volume is composed of surface area and thickness, the relative contribution of Aβ deposition on each of these metrics remains to be understood in cognitively normal individuals. Methods A group of 104 cognitively normal individuals underwent neuropsychological assessment, PiB-PET scan, and MRI acquisition. Surface-based cortical analyses were performed to investigate the effects of cortical and subcortical Aβ burden on cortical volume, thickness, and surface area. Mediation analyses were used to study the effect of thickness and surface area on Aβ-associated volume changes. We also investigated the relationships between structural metrics in clusters with abnormal morphology and regions underlying resting-state functional networks and cognitive performance. Results Cortical Aβ was not associated with cortical morphology. Subcortical Aβ burden was associated with changes in cortical volume, thickness, and surface area. Aβ-associated volume changes were driven by cortical surface area with or without thickness but never by thickness alone. Aβ-associated changes overlapped greatly with regions from the default mode network and were associated with lower performance in visuospatial abilities, episodic memory, and working memory. Conclusions In cognitively normal individuals, subcortical Aβ is associated with cortical volume, and this effect was driven by surface area with or without thickness. Aβ-associated cortical changes were found in the default mode network and affected cognitive performance. Our findings demonstrate the importance of studying subcortical Aβ and cortical surface area in normal ageing	Amyloid-beta , Subcortical , Default mode network , Pittsburgh compound B , Cognitive aging	en	22349.0
355	Évaluation de la fidélité intra- et interobservateur pour l’évaluation du vasospasme post-hémorragie sous-arachnoïdienne en angiotomodensitométrie	Objective: To review the literature on and assess the intra- and inter-observer reliability of computed tomography angiography (CTA) in the screening or diagnosis of cerebral vasospasm (CV) following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Methods: Articles reporting the reliability of CTA up to May 2018 were systematically searched and evaluated. Eleven raters independently graded 17 arterial segments in each of 50 SAH patients for the presence of vasospasm using a 4-category scale. Furthermore, readers were asked: to judge the presence or absence of any moderate/severe vasospasm (≥ 50 % narrowing); whether findings would justify augmentation of medical treatment; and/or DSA with/without angioplasty. Four raters reassessed the same patients in different order at least 4 weeks later. Results: The systematic review revealed that the reliability of CTA had not previously been rigorously assessed. The intra-rater reliability reached a substantial level (k > 0.600) in 3/4 readers for the detection of moderate-severe vasospasm, but inter-rater reliability remained below substantial even when results were stratified according to specialty and experience. There was less than substantial agreement for imaging-based recommendations (medical management or indications to proceed with DSA/angioplasty). Dichotomized per segment results (presence or absence of >50% narrowing) allowed reaching substantial agreement only among senior readers evaluating M1 segments. Excluding cases in which segments were obscured by metal artifacts did not allow additional arterial segments to reach the threshold for substantial agreement. Conclusion: CTA was not sufficiently repeatable among observers diagnosing CV to support a general use in guiding decisions in the clinical management of SAH patients.

356	Genetic risk factors of chronic insomnia disorder	Background: Chronic insomnia disorder (CID) affects 3.5 million Canadians. Despite its high prevalence, we do not fully understand the underlying mechanisms of CID. Genetic studies of insomnia contribute to better understanding its biological basis. The latest two genome-wide association studies (GWAS) suggest that MEIS1 gene, previously associated with restless legs syndrome (RLS), is independently associated to insomnia. However, the GWAS phenotyping method was limited and the finding was not yet replicated. Objective: Evaluate the association between MEIS1 and CID. If MEIS1 is pleiotropic to CID and RLS, the minor allele frequency of MEIS1 variants will be equivalent in CID patients with and without RLS. Methods: Overall, 646 CID patients participated in the study. We genotyped three MEIS1 variants. To confirm our results, we compared the allelic and genotypic distributions of the CID cohort to ethnically matched controls and RLS cases from the French Canadian cohort. Results: Patients were diagnosed by sleep specialists and 26% of the sample were diagnosed with CID+RLS. We find significant differences in allele and genotype distributions between CID-only and CID+RLS groups. Allele and genotype distributions of the three MEIS1 SNPs were similar in between CID-only and control groups and in between CID+RLS and RLS-only groups (all p>0.05). Conclusion: Our data confirms the association between MEIS1 and RLS but it does not support the pleiotropic effect of MEIS1 in CID. Further, our study highlights the critical importance of phenotyping and the need to carefully isolate CID from other disorders that can cause sleep difficulties, particularly RLS.

357	Alliance thérapeutique dans un cadre de surveillance communautaire (probation et libération conditionnelle) : implications et enjeux	Therapeutic alliance as a component of interventions efficiency is frequently read in literature. This project aims to question about this relationship applied to a context of care imposed such as community supervision (probation and conditional release). More specifically, it tends to assess the possibility to establish a positive work environment and relationship in consideration of this specific context. To that end, the relationship between the community agent and his client is explored and the benefits provided by a working alliance. Moreover, the links between different components are considered (therapeutic alliance, optimal conditions, professional attitudes, desistances from crime) to apprehend the concept of assisted desistance	Therapeutic alliance , Conditional release , Assisted desistance	en	22294.0
358	Suivi longitudinal de la charge externe de joueurs professionnels de hockey sur glace au cours d’une saison	For a typical team of the American Hockey League (AHL), the season has 76 matches spread over 28 weeks in which teams compete for a place in the playoffs. In addition to matches, players have to participate in on- and off-ice training sessions to maintain/build hockey-specific skills and fitness. The current thesis had the following purposes: (1) to draw a portrait of the physical demands place on the player and to better understand the evolution and changes that have occurred in modern ice hockey (2) to describe the impact of these changes as they relate to the position of the player (3) to detail the different methods of external load monitoring that are used in other sports such as soccer, rugby and Australian football and expose the challenges associated with employing them with a professional ice hockey team (4) to track the external load of a professional hockey team, through the use of accelerometers, to better understand its evolution during the season. Fifty players, who at one time or another were part of an American Hockey League team during the 2017-18 AHL season, participated in a study on external load monitoring. Using accelerometers, data from each training session and matches during the season were collected and analyzed. Results revealed that the intensity and the training load differed according to the position of the player during the matches and the trainings sessions preceding a match. These results raised the importance of carefully monitoring external load although the used of accelerometers seemed to present great potential for individualized monitoring of the player’s external load throughout a hockey season.

359	Investigation du système ubiquitine protéasome et découverte de nouvelles cibles thérapeutiques anti-cancer surpassant la résistance acquise au bortézomib	Multiple Myeloma (MM) is the second most common human blood cancer. The proteasome, a multi-protein complex responsible for the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins, has been established as a major target for the treatment of MM cancer patients. Although patient survival rates have significantly improved since the introduction of proteasome inhibitors (bortezomib), patients develop resistance and ultimately relapse. Therefore, this disease remains a major public health issue and there is an absolute need to develop novel therapies. In our study, we generated bortezomib-resistant cancer cell lines and conducted deubiquitinases (DUB: 100 genes) and ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2: 40 genes) RNAi screens to identify which genes of these families affect cell proliferation of sensitive and/or resistant cancer cells following abrogation of their function. Among several hits, we identified the proteasome-associated DUB PSMD14, which is required for protein deubiquitination prior to their entry and degradation by the proteasome. These hits have been validated by other RNAi sequences. Further, PSMD14 was submitted to more detailed analysis using RNAi, CRISPR/Cas9 and mutagenesis approaches in sensitive or resistant cancer cells. We found that PSMD14 depletion result in a dramatic decrease of cell proliferation and cell death compared to bortezomib target PSMB5. On the other hand, we observed that the extent of histone H2A ubiquitination and HSP70 expression levels are correlated with the cellular sensitivity to proteasome inhibition. Thus, these factors could be potential biomarkers for MM patient survival prognosis.  PMSD14 as well as other candidates revealed from our screens represent potential therapeutic targets whose inhibition is predicted to overcome the acquired resistance to proteasome inhibitors currently used to treat cancer patients.

360	Approche génomique pour l’étude de la polydactylie dépendante de Hoxa11	Limb development requires HoxA and HoxD complexes genes, the expression domain of Hoxa11 and Hoxa13 are mutually exclusive, with Hoxa11 being restricted to the proximal part of the limb bud, and Hoxa13 being restricted to the distal part. It has been shown that ectopic expression of Hoxa11 in the autopod domain induces a limb with polydactyly, but we have found that the combined Gli3 loss-of-function (Xt/Xt) with Hoxa11 gain-of-function (Prx1Cre; Rosa26Hoxa11/Hoxa11) induces the development of an oligodactyl limb, with less than 5 digits formed. The aim of this project was to characterize the effect of the ectopic expression of HOXA11 transcription factor in the modulation of the digit number. We show by in situ hybridization that Grem1 expression in the limb bud with ectopic Hoxa11 and inactivated Gli3 is reduced or lost, which leads to an alteration of the SHH – GREM1 – FGFs positive feedback loop. In addition, we have used genomic approaches (ChIP-Seq) for the HOXA11 transcription factor and the epigenetic mark H3K27Ac to characterize the effects of distal expression of Hoxa11 genome-wide. We provide evidence that HOXA11 contributes to the regulation of Grem1 expression, but also to the regulation of other anterior genes like Alx4, Irx3/5 and Hand1.

361	Une minorité sans histoire : le cas des Roms en Roumanie	The Romanian Revolution of 1989 began the process of democratization after more than four decades of communism. Numerous economic, political and social changes followed the fall of the totalitarian regime, especially as a result of the country's accession to the European Union. One of the issues that demonstrates the progress and the limits of Romania’s transition to democracy is the conflicting memories awakened by the historiographical revision. Pressure from European and international institutions has created political opportunities for minorities, including Hungarians, Jews, and the Roma; to find their place in national history, which until now had been ignored. Despite the new political opportunities and the advances of the Jewish and Hungarian communities, the Roma have remained largely absent from Romania’s national history. This analysis examines the factors that explain the gap between the representation of the Roma with that of the Jewish and the Hungarian communities through the lens of the political process model, which encompasses three well-established factors of the social movement theory: political opportunities, resource mobilization, and framing.

362	La participation syndicale des travailleurs dans un contexte de précarité de l’emploi	"Employment precarity can be defined as the accumulation of insecurities or as the lack of security in an employment relationship. This phenomenon still exists despite its evolutions across time. Precarity can take several forms : low income, low control on one's work schedule, fixed-term contracts, insufficient number of hours, lack of access to social protection or unionization. All those forms will have consequences on one's living conditions, such as material deprivation (inadequate housing, clothes, food, leisure), stress or adverse effects on health. In the meantime, unions organize and fight to grant their members the best working conditions achievable. When it comes to precarious workers, unions militate for better regulations, in order to mitigate the negative consequences of employment precarity. Members' participation to the daily life of their union is here considered to be capital : They are the only ones able to inform the union's head of the current situation, and they are the only ones able to implement means of pressure in order to create a balance of power with the company's management. It is noticeable however, that on a theoretical point of view, most models about union participation from members have their focus on the so-called ""traditional"" workforce, that presents no signs of precarity. The aim of our research is therefore to apply an analysis grid, initially tailored for ""traditionnal"" workforce, to a group of workers featuring precarity factors. By analyzing working conditions, current union strategies and participation in tis form and intensity, we intend to see how participation from precarious workers can differ from the one of a standard workforce. To do so, we have analyzed and compared two groups of unionized workers. Those two groups are unionized with the same union, belong to the same corporate group and operate in the same economic field. Yet, the form and intensity of their union participations differ significantly. Our analysis therefore consisted of meeting different actors of those two groups. Thanks to the results of our interviews, we highlighted the union strategies that allow one of the two groups to have a higher participation level. We also provide a feedback on the classical theories regarding union participation, to see which ones can be extended to precarious workers and which ones cannot. Through the analysis of our cases, we determined that certain elements such as the attitude of union representatives toward their function, communication methods or the way collective identity was built are very important to characterize union participation from a precarious workforce. Conversely, while classic theories about union participation seem to highlight the importance of union attitude of the workforce, individual activities or formal communication methods for union participation, our finding tend to mitigate the importance of the latter elements."	precarious work , precarious workers , union participation , membership logic	en	22239.0
363	Les expériences de maintien en emploi au travers de la trajectoire de transplantation rénale : une description qualitative	Following kidney transplantation, employment predicts patient quality of life and decreases mortality and graft loss greffon (Chisolm et al., 2015; Prihodova et al., 2015). Yet, a majority of able kidney recipients are unemployed (Slakey & Rosner, 2007). Amongst the possible explanatory factors, employment during dialysis is a robust predictor of return to work after transplantation (van der Mei et al., 2006). In this regard, the development of efficient support systems aimed at keeping patients with chronic diseases in the workforce requires a thorough understanding of their needs and concerns (Vooijs et al., 2017). However, end-stage-kidney-disease patients’ perspectives regarding job retention remain poorly documented. This study thus aims to describe patients’ experiences of labour participation before and after kidney transplantation. A descriptive qualitative research design was adopted (Sandelowski, 2000). Patients with end-stage-kidney-disease who recently underwent transplantation were recruited one to twelve months post-transplant at a university-affiliated hospital in a large urban area. They were interviewed about their illness and work experiences using a semi-structured interview schedule. Based on employment status, 31 of those interviews were selected and were subjected to thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2006; Patton, 2015). Three themes emerged from the data: (1) struggling to establish a satisfactory routine that balances work and illness demands as well as patient involvement in other life domains, (2) becoming aware of personal limits due to a decline in work capacity which leads to needing support from others, and (3) being motivated to stay at work by cultivating positive perceptions about work and by undertaking targeted actions. These results suggest possible interventions aimed at job maintenance for kidney transplant patients such as supporting patient adjustment during employment transitions, encouraging dialogue with employers, and supporting the use of self-management strategies adapted to their work schedules. Limits of the present study include a lack of diversity in recruitment sites and the absence of an iterative process during data collection. Future studies could be conducted in rural or private care settings and examine the long-term employment adjustment of transplant recipients.	transplantation , étude qualitative , employment , kidney disease , qualitative study , chronic illness , activities of daily living , work-life balance , self-management , activity limitations	en	22230.0
364	Preuve de concept in vitro de la navigation par résonance magnétique en conditions physiologiquement réalistes	This research aims to demonstrate the feasibility of magnetic resonance navigation (MRN) as a treatment for unresectable, malignant liver tumors. This method consists in steering magnetic drug-eluting microbeads in hepatic arteries towards diseased liver lobes using an unmodified magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner, with regards to physiological, anatomical and technological limitations. To reproduce a physiological flow during the MRN experiment, the arterial flow was measured using phase contrast MRI on seven porcine models. In addition, to evaluate the feasibility of creating in vivo flow conditions that are suitable for MRN, a balloon catheter positioned in the proper hepatic artery was used simultaneously with a 0.5 mL/s saline infusion to reduce mean flow velocity and systolic-diastolic variation. In parallel, to characterize the arterial flow profile as a function of embolization level for treatment planning, a quantitative digitally subtracted angiography (qDSA) program was developed and used to measure arterial flow rate in individual vessel segments of a realistic porcine hepatic arterial phantom under fluoroscopy with injection of contrast agent at 0.25 mL/s. Then, a proof-of-concept in vitro MRN experiment was performed under flow rate conditions similar to those measured in vivo to demonstrate the feasibility of using a 20 mT/m gradient sequence in an unmodified MRI scanner to selectively steer aggregates composed of 20 magnetic microbeads in a one-bifurcation hepatic arterial phantom. Phase contrast imaging on pigs revealed that using a balloon catheter decreases the mean hepatic arterial flow velocity from 20.5 ± 15.3 cm/s to 8.4 ± 5.0 cm/s (uncertainty representing the standard deviation) as well as the systolic-diastolic variation from 24 ± 14 cm/s to 4.9 ± 2.3 cm/s, which is compatible with MRN. The qDSA program provided a flow estimate in individual segments with a root-mean-square error of 34%, but further development is needed to allow the characterization of the arterial flow profile as a function of embolization level. For the MRN experiment, the steering efficiency obtained was 100%. This research shows that the use of a balloon catheter reduces arterial hepatic flow velocity and variation and that qDSA is a promising flow measurement method in the context of transarterial chemoembolization. In addition, this research shows that MRN is possible under realistic physiological and anatomical settings, with reduced flow and with an unmodified MRI scanner.

365	Les rôles de Kant et de Hegel dans le diagnostic adornien de la crise de l’expérience des temps modernes	The entire work of T. W. Adorno can be interpreted as a philosophical answer to his singular diagnosis of the crisis of experience in modernity. This thesis sheds light on this diagnosis by examining the ambiguous roles that Friedrich Hegel and Emmunel Kant play in it. Following the transformation of the German Enlightenment from Kant to Adorno, we show how each of the three philosophers respond to a crisis contemporary to him by making experience a concept that bonds autonomy and subjectivity together. It is especially the Kantian concept of autonomy and the Hegelian concepts of experience and subjectivity that Adorno criticizes and saves in order to theorize the general incapacity of individuals to enter a non-ideological relation with the objective social reality that characterizes late capitalism. But such a diagnosis is no pessimism or nostalgia, it is a necessary pre-step opening the way to a subjectivity able to resist the multiple heteronomous forces that systematically undermine the individual and collective forms of self-determination.

366	L'origine de la vie chez Maupertuis et Diderot	In this research, we analyze the theoretical difference between Maupertuis and Diderot in their analysis of the living. Even though their theories seem similar on many aspects and are opposed to preformationism, they have, however, different theoretical foundations that we will explore through a debate they had. In the first chapter, we will explore preformationism. The purpose is to show the theoretical framework and its problems to understand what Maupertuis and Diderot were facing. In the second chapter, we will examine Maupertuis’ positions and his theory of living beings. We will discuss his criticisms against preformationism, his transformism and his epigenesis. Finally, we will discuss in the third chapter Diderot’s living theory and the debate he had with Maupertuis. The purpose of this paper is to show the theoretical differences between Maupertuis and Diderot concerning the living beings.

367	Évaluer la réalisation d’une intention avec le Virtual Multitasking Test 3e édition : une étude de validité du construit	Background: Prospective memory (PM) is a complex cognitive process which involves remembering realizing an intention in the future (Ellis, 1996). PM is recognized for its implication on autonomy and safety of the person in everyday life. In several clinical contexts, detecting PM disorders could have a therapeutic utility. Yet, the traditional neuropsychological tests do not represent well enough the complexity of daily tasks. However, virtual reality represents an interesting alternative given its good ecological validity. Virtual Multitasking Test-3 (VMT-3), a three-dimensional apartment, helps to estimate PM thanks to several everyday life tasks. Objective: The objective of this research is to validate the VMT-3 on a theoretical plan by comparing it with two standardized neuropsychological tests that are recognized as being ecological (RBMT-3 and CAMPROMPT). Method: The final sample involves 102 healthy participants, among whom 48 women and 54 men with an average age of 41. We compared the subjects’ performance using traditional tests of PM and episodic memory (EM) as well as the VMT-3. Results: The correlations of this present study found significant links between index of the VMT-3 and index of ME and MP part of the RBMT-3. The CAMPROMPT was only correlated with event-based index of the VMT-3. Conclusion: The VMT-3 proposes valid indications of PM (event-based type). Future research is necessary to continue this validation study. The results’ interpretation suggests that the realization of the VMT-3 is possible thanks to some cognitive functions, among which the PM, the executive functions and the multitasking. We suggest that the VMT-3 should be compared with ecological neuropsychological tests which evaluate multitasking abilities.

368	The implication of cell-derived microvesicles in retinal pigment epithelium degeneration	In industrialized countries, degeneration of the macula is the most common cause of irreversible vision loss after 65 years of age and is termed age-related macular degeneration (AMD). This multifactorial disease comprises two types according to the stage of progress: dry AMD (70% of AMD cases) and wet AMD (30% of AMD cases). Dry AMD causes alterations in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) whose role in retina homeostasis is critical. These functional and structural alterations are manifested by accumulation of metabolic and cellular waste products in the form of drusen, which appear as lipid-enriched deposits between the RPE and Bruch’s membrane. Oxidative stress is the main contributing factor, which can derive RPE cell blebbing activity and senescence. Despite extensive research; there is still no cure for dry AMD. Our laboratory has long been focusing on the effects of microparticles originating from different cells, such as RPE-derived microparticles (RMPs). Microparticles (MPs) are membrane fragments that are released into environment upon cell activation or apoptosis and are responsible for various biological functions. microRNAs are selectively enriched in microparticles. According to our RNA sequencing profile analysis, let-7f is one of the most abundant microRNA (miRNA) in RMPs, and it may mediate oxidative stress-induced retinal cell dysfunction. The principal objective of this work was to explore the molecular events responsible for RMP-induced RPE cell dysfunction, emphasizing the disruptive signal of let-7f. Our findings strongly indicate that RMPs released by RPE cells under oxidative stress accelerate RPE degeneration and cause subretinal deposits. Given the results regarding let-7f function, this miRNA seems to be the main suspect exerting the detrimental effect of microparticles in RPE cells. In conclusion, verification of the role of RMPs and downstream players such as let-7f in retinal degeneration should inspire the development of therapeutic targets against AMD.

369	Latent variable language models	There has been a renewed interest in generative modeling/unsupervised learning for language for downstream natural language understanding tasks. In this thesis, we explore the augmentation of standard language models with latent variables. In the first chapter, we provide a brief introduction of language models, the classical n-gram treatment and the more common Neural Language Models in use today. We also briefly introduce variational autoencoders and the recent work improving upon them. In Chapter 2, we review work that explores the space where latent variable models and language models intersect. We then empirically analyse the effectiveness of a couple of these methods. In particular, we re-implement the models from Bowman et al. (2015) and Yang et al. (2017), and benchmark them against the Penn Treebank dataset with some experiments of our own. In Chapter 3, we discuss an ICML submission: Generating Contradictions, Entailments and Neutral Sentences. In this work, we encode source sentences to a latent distribution space and attempt to manipulate it from there to generate sentences corresponding to the given logical entailment. While our efforts are unsuccessful, we believe that enabling controllable latent variable distributions is an interesting direction to pursue. In Chapter 4, we conclude with a review of the content covered in the thesis, and a higher-level discussion of what possible avenues of future work could resemble.	language models , probabilistic models , deep learning , neural networks , latent variables	en	22131.0
370	How do construction sites affect cycling and walking? : perspectives from a panel of experts	The impact of traffic disruptions provoked by construction sites can be major, especially for active modes of transportation like walking and cycling. Understanding this impact is necessary, although difficult given the lack of analytic tools for studying ephemeral alterations of the circulation space. The aim of our study was to establish an analytic framework for understanding the impact of construction sites on active transportation. The research included semi-structured interviews with ten experts and a three-round Delphi study during which an expanded group of experts (29 participants) developed a list of influential factors. The length of detours caused by construction sites was the most influential factor on walking; the temporary organization of traffic flow space (sharing the roadway) was the most important for cycling. These results provide guidance for empirical studies, in order to understand and mitigate the negative effects of construction works on active transportation.

371	Subcortical amyloid load is associated with shape and volume in cognitively normal individuals	Amyloid-beta (Aβ) deposition is one of the main hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease. The study assessed the associations between cortical and subcortical 11C-Pittsburgh Compound B retention, namely in the hippocampus, amygdala, putamen, caudate, pallidum, and thalamus, and subcortical morphology in cognitively normal individuals. We recruited 104 cognitive normal individuals who underwent extensive neuropsychological assessment, PiB-positron emission tomography (PET) scan and 3-tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisition of T1-weighted images. Global, cortical, and subcortical regional PiB retention values were derived from each scan and subcortical morphology analyses were performed to investigate vertex-wise local surface and global volumes, including the hippocampal subfields volumes. We found that subcortical regional Aβ was associated with the surface of the hippocampus, thalamus, and pallidum, with changes being due to volume and shape. Hippocampal Aβ was marginally associated with volume of the whole hippocampus as well as with the CA1 subfield, subiculum, and molecular layer. Participants showing higher subcortical Aβ also showed worse cognitive performance and smaller hippocampal volumes. In contrast, global and cortical PiB uptake did not associate with any subcortical metrics. This study shows that subcortical Aβ is associated with subcortical surface morphology in cognitively normal individuals. This study highlights the importance of quantifying subcortical regional PiB retention values in these individuals.	Alzheimer’s disease , Amyloid-beta , Subcortical , Volume , Shape	en	22115.0
372	Examining the ethical and social issues of health technology design through the public appraisal of prospective scenarios : a study protocol describing a multimedia-based deliberative method	Background: The design of health technologies relies on assumptions that affect how they will be implemented, such as intended use, complexity, impact on user autonomy, and appropriateness. Those who design and implement technologies make several ethical and social assumptions on behalf of users and society more broadly, but there are very few tools to examine prospectively whether such assumptions are warranted and how the public define and appraise the desirability of health innovations. This study protocol describes a three-year study that relies on a multimedia-based prospective method to support public deliberations that will enable a critical examination of the social and ethical issues of health technology design. Methods: The first two steps of our mixed-method study were completed: relying on a literature review and the support of our multidisciplinary expert committee, we developed scenarios depicting social and technical changes that could unfold in three thematic areas within a 25-year timeframe; and for each thematic area, we created video clips to illustrate prospective technologies and short stories to describe their associated dilemmas. Using this multimedia material, we will: conduct four face-to-face deliberative workshops with members of the public (n = 40) who will later join additional participants (n = 25) through an asynchronous online forum; and analyze and integrate three data sources: observation, group deliberations, and a self-administered participant survey. Discussion: This study protocol will be of interest to those who design and assess public involvement initiatives and to those who examine the implementation of health innovations. Our premise is that using user-friendly tools in a deliberative context that foster participants’ creativity and reflexivity in pondering potential technoscientific futures will enable our team to analyze a range of normative claims, including some that may prove problematic and others that may shed light over potentially more valuable design options.

373	Évaluation du 4,5-dihydrodiol-benzo[a]pyrène et du 7,8-dihydrodiol-benzo[a]pyrène en tant que biomarqueurs spécifiques alternatifs d’exposition au benzo[a]pyrène	Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) is one of the more commonly studied polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), a group of omnipresent pollutants in the environment formed through incomplete combustion processes. It is listed as a confirmed carcinogen to human beings by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and is highly present in many workplaces.  Although presenting a significant health risk to workers, there are currently no convenient compound-specific biomarkers that enable the tracking and monitoring of occupational exposure to BaP. 3-Hydroxybenzo[a]pyrene (3-OHBaP) is the most developed, as a biomarker, amongst the metabolites of BaP. It’s mostly excreted with the faeces, presenting in trace amounts in urine, which makes it difficult to measure; it is also demonstrates renal retention, which adds a layer of complexity in its use as a biomarker because there are many factors to take into consideration when looking at its kinetic time course. 1-Hydroxypyrene (1-OHP), in the other hand, is a urinary metabolite of pyrene that serves as a good representative of PAH presence. It is, however, the metabolite of a non-carcinogenic PAH, and is not fully capable of representing the cancer risk posed in a given scenario.  This thesis sought to detect and assess BaP exposure through tracking its urinary metabolites: 4,5-dihydrodiol-benzo[a]pyrene and 7,8-dihydrodiol-benzo[a]pyrene (4,5-diolBaP and 7,8-diolBaP; diolBaPs). 4,5-DiolBaP and 7,8-diolBaP were evaluated through two studies:  The first study, the “shampoo experiment”, featured a volunteer who self-exposed to PAHs in a controlled setting by using a coal-tar-based shampoo. The study consisted of two experiments. The first focused on a single exposure and the second on multiple exposures. This study was set to evaluate the time course of 7,8-diolBaP in humans and verifying its potential as a biomarker of exposure through a comparison with 1-OHP in the same experimental framework. The second study consisted of a comparative analysis of 4,5-diolBaP, 7,8-diolBaP, 1-OHP and 3-OHBaP in an occupational setting, evaluating the competency of the diolBaPs in a real-world setting alongside established biomarkers of BaP and PAH exposure. Five workers at a carbon anode production plant volunteered to participate in this study. For both of these studies, the urine samples were analysed by ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography (UHPLC) coupled with fluorescence.  “Shampoo Experiment”: The single and multiple exposures revealed a monoexponential elimination on the part of 7,8-diolBaP, identical to 1-OHP, with similar magnitudes of concentration. 1-OHP was also confirmed to undergo a more rapid elimination from the system, where after each exposure for 7,8-diolBaP, the ensuing peak value is higher. This finding demonstrated evidence of accumulation of 7,8-diolBaP throughout the week, whereas with 1-OHP, the second peak is larger, then the third one is smaller, thus showing less accumulation over the same time frame.  “Worker Study”: The results showed that the analytical method used was unable to properly discern 4,5-diolBaP from other urinary contaminants eluting during the same retention time. 7,8-DiolBaP, on the other hand, eluted at urinary concentrations that were a similar order of magnitude to 1-OHP, as can be seen in all of the workers evaluated. For some workers, the urinary concentration of 7,8-diolBaP was consistently at its peak prior to the start of a shift and elimination took place during the shift, to provide a lower concentration value at the end of the shift. With 1-OHP, the rise was immediate with exposure, peaking at the end of every shift. For other workers, both 7,8-diolBaP and 1-OHP are consistently higher at the end of the shift. These variations are likely to indicate different routes of exposure. This thesis showed the potential use of 7,8-diolBaP as a compound-specific biomarker of exposure for BaP and thus provides a starting point in exploring the quantification of BaP exposure and negative health effects in humans. Confirmation of the compound’s identity is needed through the use of mass spectrometry.

374	Individualisme, subjectivisme et mécanismes économiques	The economists of the Austrian School count among the most consistent supporters of methodological individualism, but they were for the most part strongly opposed to clearly anti-holist trends such as constructivism, reductionism, and positivism. This article discusses why the sort of methodological individualism defended by the Austrians could not, for interconnected reasons, be rendered compatible with any one of these philosophical trends. The manner in which the Austrians managed to reconcile their analysis of economic mechanisms with a strictly subjectivist approach is especially considered. The discussion also underscores some ambiguous dimensions of the debate between holism and individualism.		en	22078.0
375	Was Keynes a Liberal and an Individualist? Or Keynes reader of Mandeville	Whether and to what extent Keynes should be considered both a liberal and an individualist is a rather complex question, and one which this paper proposes to disentangle by analyzing Keynes' understanding of Mandeville, whose positions on these two issues were rather ambiguous, as well. Through a comparison of Keynes' reading of the Fable of the Bees with those of N. Rosenberg, F. Hayek and L. Dumont, it is shown that Mandeville' s and Keynes' positions are much more alike than is generally admitted. Furthermore, this similarity invites us to redefine such categories as « individualism », « holism », « liberalism » and « interventionism », which clearly are difficult to apply to either of these two authors.		en	22076.0
376	Étude de l’impact des collectionneurs sur la préservation et la conservation du jeu vidéo	This thesis proposes an incursion into the world of video games and the struggle against its unavoidable deterioration. It aims to determine the extent of this coming challenge and recommends possible ways to assure the lasting qualities of video games. The final objective resides within the proposition that communities of collectors can influence the preservation of the medium and try to determine if this influence is positive or negative. The study first addresses classic collecting to better understand what makes a collector and what motivates its behaviour. Afterward, we explore the problematic of video game preservation, looking at the coming difficulties while exploring possible solutions to counter the damages to the video game heritage. Finally, the thesis links these two themes while defining the video game collector with all of their idiosyncrasies and questioning its outlook toward the preservation of the medium. With the help of a questionnaire distributed into these communities, we then try to answer our guiding question looking at the impacts of collectors on the preservation of the video game medium.	conservation , ROM , Video game , Collector , Emulator , Gameplay , Serialization	en	22064.0
377	Stefano della Bella et Le Vase de Médicis : dessin et éducation artistique au XVIIe siècle	This thesis will address the practice of the Florentine draughtsman and printmaker Stefano della Bella (1610-1664), more specifically in regard to his actions related to teaching drawing and his emphasis on this activity in his work.  I will primarily focus on his engraving titled The Medici Vase, dated 1656, in which the artist drawing an antique vase becomes the main focus.  Through the drawing, the artist is representing the world surrounding him and is integrating the very figure of the observer within his work.  As such, the artist is demonstrating a new trend.  By this integration of the figure of the draughtsman, there is a manifestation of sorts of the artist’s conscience of his own image.  I will also examine the relationships that Stefano della Bella maintained with his sponsors.  Indeed, these relationships allow a better understanding of the foundations of his craft.   Furthermore, the present thesis will also explore the issue of artistic teaching, Della Bella having integrated himself in the education of princes.  He was involved in an educative program aimed at two famous princes: Louis XIV of France via educational decks of cards and Cosimo III de’ Medici via drawing classes.  The motivation behind concentrating on this aspect of Della Bella’s career is to study the way in which he used his artistic practice around influential people.  Conversely, this responsibility requires answering an offer that can become limitative and can influence the values and principles that the teachings must contribute to.  This thesis will allow a better understanding of the new status of an artist evolving in the 17th century and will provide a concrete example of a prolific artistic career that is characterised by strategic relationships.

378	Jacques Linard, Une nature morte de 1640, marqueur de son temps	Abstract The French still lives of the first decades of the 17th century lend themselves well to meditation and to intellectual and philosophical discourses. The contribution of the French painter Jacques Linard (1597–1645) to French still lives are fundamental, however, his work is seldom studied. We wish to contribute to the research, by offering an original analysis of Still life with shells and a coral, dated in 1640, which portrays characteristics of French sensitivity. The apparent simplicity of this painting reveals a hermeneutic that goes beyond the spiritual context proper to the decrees of the Counter Reformation on art. The presence of natural objects abounds by mythological and religious symbolism, raises the question of Linard’s goal, and their relevance in 17th century French society. Using Michel Foucault’s concept of Archaeology, this memoir aims to develop with multiple points of view the message that Jacques Linard expresses pertaining to the interests of a changing France, suggested by the content, the composition and the naturalistic style of the painting. We will first relate the cultural history involving Christian symbolism, then we will carry out an original iconographic analysis in order to show the religious, moral and scientific meaning of this work of art. In 17th century France, the presence of natural objects also suggests new societal behaviour linked to ancient philosophy and scientific development which we will give an account of in correlation to the French cultural challenges that overlay its religious message.

379	Théorisation et contextualisation des microchromies dans le cheminement artistique et spirituel de Fernand Leduc	Our work proposes a theoretical and contextual reading of the works of Fernand Leduc produced from the 1970s : the « microchromies ». Seeking to understand the intrinsic functioning of these paintings, we formally analyse four « microchromies », paying particular attention to the issues that each tries to elucidate.  The way we look at « microchromies » is based on the relationship between the work of art and the artist’s literature, allowing us to understand the evolution of his thought and his art. Through this double reading, we are able to include the « microchromie » in a journey of more than seventy years of artistic experimentation and spiritual exploration. To this end, we analyse the artistic movements and philosophies that have, from near or far, participate in the metamorphosis of Leduc’s approach. Since the « microchromies » are the latest works of Leduc’s career, we propose a comparative analysis with works from the beginning of his career in order to elucidate this continuous process. Thus, it is possible for us to determine in what way « microchromies » may or may not be included in the « rhythm of overcoming » (« rythmique du dépassement ») as the ultimate art proposition of his career.

380	Les phrases se jettent en bas de mon corps ; suivi de L'expérience de la douleur dans l'oeuvre de Tania Langlais	This thesis, combining reasearch and creative writing, focuses on the experience of pain and how it takes shape in the language. The creative part, entitled Les phrases se jettent en bas de mon corps, proposes a narrative poetry in which a female enunciator lives, through the writing process, the pain and its impact on the various sensory systems: exterior perceptions (external perceptions, the five senses), proprioceptions (perceptions of body space) and interceptions (perceptions of the internal environment, how the body is felt). The reflexion of the cerebral body and the suffering corporal brain continues in the research section, where pain is approached as a vector of meaning in Tania Langlais' work. The three poetry books, Douze bêtes aux chemises de l'homme, La clarté s'installe comme un chat and Kennedy sait de quoi je parle are a poetic cycle where verses dialogue, resonate in a poem and in the same book, but also from one oeuvre to another. The analysis of their interaction, their disparities and similarities, allows us to better understand the particularity of the discourse of pain in Langlais. The various literary notions mentioned, such as the process of repetition, the question of enunciation and the representation of space, are supported by notions of neurobiology (Antonio Damasio, André Holley) and contemporary phenomenology (Mark Johnson and George Lakoff).

381	The role of the left anterior temporal lobe for unpredictable and complex mappings in word reading	The anterior temporal lobes (ATLs) have been consistently associated with semantic processing which, in turn, has a key role in reading aloud single words. This study aimed to investigate (1) the reading abilities in patients with the semantic variant of primary progressive aphasia (svPPA), and (2) the relationship between gray matter (GM) volume of the left ATL and word reading performance using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Three groups of participants (svPPA, Alzheimer’s Disease, AD and healthy elderly adults) performed a reading task with exception words, regular words and pseudowords, along with a structural magnetic resonance imaging scan. For exception words, the svPPA group had a lower accuracy and a greater number of regularization errors as compared to the control groups of healthy participants and AD patients. Similarly, for regular words, svPPA patients had a lower accuracy in comparison with AD patients, and a greater number of errors related to complex orthography-to-phonology mappings (OPM) in comparison to both control groups. VBM analyses revealed that GM volume of the left ATL was associated with the number of regularization errors. Also, GM volume of the left lateral ATL was associated with the number of errors with complex OPM during regular word reading. Our results suggest that the left ATL might play a role in the reading of exception words, in accordance with its role in semantic processing. Results further support the involvement of the left lateral ATL in combinatorial processes, including the integration of semantic and phonological information, for both exception and regular words.

382	Comportements sexuels problématiques : évaluation d'un modèle conceptuel axé sur les traits d'insensibilité émotionnelle	Sexual behavior problems (SBP) in children represent a complex issue both in terms of research and clinical intervention. The heterogeneity of children with SBP is a conceptual and methodological challenge. While research on the factors associated with SBP presented by children appears somewhat limited, there is some ground of belief in an association between SBP and callous-unemotional traits (e.g., superficial affect and lack of empathy and remorse). Few studies to date have explored this association, and none has focused specifically on children aged between 6 and 12 years old. These traits are important to consider because they are associated with the severity of aggression behaviors in youth and an increased resistance to intervention. Objectives. The main objective of this Masters’ thesis is to foster our understanding of the factors associated with the variety of SBP. Specifically, we want to understand if and to what extent callous-unemotional traits are associated with SBP. We have therefore proposed an adapted conceptual model that takes into account callous-unemotional traits. Method. Our sample consists of 90 parent-child dyads (M child’s age = 9.1 years ; SD = 2.2 ; 36.7% girls), who received psychotherapy services for SBP at the Marie-Vincent Center between 2006 and 2010. Participants completed an assessment battery including several instruments that reflect all the dimensions of the conceptual model. A score of callous-unemotional traits was derived from various instruments measuring children's behavior. A hierarchical linear regression model was developed to estimate the influence of callous-unemotional traits, taking into account the influence of the individual and family variables. Results. Results revealed that callous-unemotional traits were not associated with children's SBP when their externalized behaviors were taken into account. In addition, the presence of externalized behaviors and exposure to a combination of victimization experiences, excluding sexual victimization, were associated with the variety of SBP. There was also no significant association between sexual victimization and the variety of SBP. Conclusion. The results partially support the proposed conceptual model. Research with larger samples should be done to better understand the influence of callous-unemotional traits on SBP. The results suggest, however, that externalized behaviors and non-sexual victimization experiences are more important in explaining the variety of SBP of children referred for an intervention than sexual victimization.	sexual behavior problems , SBP , callous-unemotional traits , CU traits , conceptual model , externalized behaviors , victimization experiences , children	en	21975.0
383	Police et manifestantes : une étude qualitative sur l'expérience des femmes en action de protestation	Studies on policing protest have identified key variables relative to strategies employed on groups, namely political ideology and identity of protesters. However, empirical data on gender is scarce even if this variable distinguishes women's experiences in other forms of police intervention. The purpose of this study is therefore to understand the experiences of women activists in their interaction with the police in the context of collective actions. In order to assess whether gender influences their relations with the police, nineteen semi-structured interviews were conducted with women activists who experienced numerous conflictual exchanges with the police. The analysis of the interviews has demonstrated that gender is important in the construction of their experience. Gendered interactions took place both at an individual level as well as when police intervened on protest groups. Sexist, paternalistic, machismo and sexualized comments and attitudes shape rapports between individuals, and shed light on the presence of the discretionary power of police officers during crowd management interventions. When trying to understand what motivates the choice of a particular intervention directed towards a militant group, it is difficult to consider gender as a predictive factor. However, it caracterizes part of women’s interactions when gathering around feminist or non-mixt issues. These interactions allow us to argue that the police controls social disorders, but also protects the gendered social order. This brings us to reflect on women's recourse of violence as a form of civil disobedience. Finally, the conflicting interactions have had considerable effects on the mobilization of these activists, leading to the crystallization of certain ideologies and perceptions about the police institution. This study follows a feminist perspective that pursues a broader goal of understanding the gender relations that build women's lives.

384	"L’écart socioprofessionnel et linguistique, un facteur de tension entre immigrantes et locaux ?
Une analyse dialectique relationnelle des expériences des immigrantes qualifiées hispanophones bénévoles dans leur intégration au Québec"	"The socio-cultural and professional integration of immigrants in a new host country inevitably depends on their ability to communicate effectively. In Quebec, a good command of French is a prerequisite for integration. Thus the provincial government recommends that new immigrants engage in volunteering as an integration strategy that will help them develop their socio-cultural and language skills and also expand job opportunities. This research describes the interactions between Spanish-speaking immigrant women with the status of skilled workers who volunteer and ""Francophone locals"" during their integration process in Quebec. More specifically, this study seeks to find out how immigrant women with skilled worker status manage the discrepancy between their professional skills and status and their lack of French language ability. To do this, the study uses Baxter and Montgomery's (1996) relational dialectic theory to explore the seemingly contradictory ""pull and push"" forces that arise in any interpersonal relationship: the simultaneous desire for integration and separation; stability and change; and expression and non-expression. The data were collected through semi-structured interviews and life stories that addressed their migration process, their experiences in Quebec, and the nature of interactions that touched on issues of cultural identity."	immigrant(e)s , tensions , integration , immigrants , volunteering , languages skills	en	21959.0

In the past few years, virtual reality technologies have become more and more present in our mediasphere. marketed as a new way to be immersed in digital worlds. I followed and met some of the professionals that are currently working in video game studios to create theses new embodied gaming experiences. My aim here is to describe and analyze some of the major challenges that virtual reality technologies pose in the design of digital environments.

386	Étude des déterminants génétiques et moléculaires de la scoliose idiopathique	Idiopathic Scoliosis (IS) is a complex disorder of the spine. It mostly occurs between 10 and 15 years old and affects ~1-4% of the global pediatric population with a much higher prevalence in females. In most cases the underlying cause of IS is unknown, although a genetic component is well recognized. A number of candidate genes and loci have been suggested, but few have been successfully replicated in multiple studies. Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several candidate genes for IS susceptibility. Among these the LBX1 locus is by far the most successfully replicated locus in different populations, although until now it has not been tested in the French-Canadian population. Few studies have attempted to detect rare causal variants in IS and this field of research is still in its infancy. The primary goal of this thesis was to investigate the genetic component of IS through complementary approaches. In the first study, we aimed to find new genes enriched with rare variants, which might contribute to the disease. Hence, we performed whole exome sequencing (WES) in a French-Canadian IS cohort, followed by a second phase of targeted sequencing of the 24 best candidate genes in a replication cohort. In parallel, we performed WES in a unique multiplex family of three affected sisters with healthy parents. Our results implicate a novel gene, FAT3, not previously associated with IS, as a strong candidate for this condition. In the second study we performed a GWAS to test for genetic markers associated with IS in our French-Canadian cohort. The complete results of the GWAS analysis are beyond the scope of this thesis. The main objective of the current analysis was to test association of the LBX1 locus. Our results support an association with the region near the LBX1 gene in our French-Canadian population. In the third study, our approach is a candidate gene approach. We attempted to elucidate the genetic and biochemical correlates of circulating YKL-40 levels with the risk of spinal deformity progression in the context of IS. Our prior works have demonstrated that IS patients exhibit a distinctive G inhibitory (Gi) proteincoupled receptor signaling dysfunction, which enabled their classification into three distinct biological endophenotypes (FG1, FG2 or FG3). Previous microarray analysis revealed a significant elevation in the expression of CHI3L1 gene, encoding for the secreted glycoprotein YKL-40, in IS patients classified in FG1 endophenotype when compared to FG2 and FG3 ones, which are more prone to develop a severe scoliosis. In this study, we demonstrated that IS males classified in FG1 endophenotype exhibit significant higher plasma YKL-40 levels than controls and other IS endophenotypes. Furthermore, the non-severe scoliosis group showed significant higher levels of YKL-40 than controls. SNPs in CHI3L1 gene showed significant association with YKL-40 plasma levels in non-severe cases. Functional in vitro analysis showed that YKL-40 could play a protective role in the context of IS by altering the Gi-signaling dysfunction induced by the elevation of osteopontin in IS. In sum, we propose a novel association of FAT3 gene with IS, replicated the association of LBX1 gene with IS in a new cohort, and propose a new biochemical marker, YKL-40, associated with non-severe forms of IS and has a plausible protective role in IS.

387	A passagem do conceito epistêmico ao conceito pragmatista de verdade em Habermas	The conception of truth advocated by Habermas in 1972 involved a procedure of justification that did not leave any room for a direct confrontation with the thing (adaequatio). K.-O. Apel immediately criticized this narrow epistemic conception of truth, pointing out the “correspondence” that is an essential part of the idea of truth. The clash between the two authors on this matter comes to the fore in their respective interpretation of Husserl’s theory of evidence. In his book Truth and Justification published in 1999, Habermas introduces a modified version of his theory. He is from now on ready to acknowledge the fact that truth implies a certain form of realism, at least in the pragmatic context of the lifeworld. It is important to examine the role played by Rorty in this evolution of Habermas’s thought toward a pragmatist conception of truth.

388	Actigraphy data in pediatric research : the role of sleep diaries	Background. When assessing children's sleep using actigraphy, researchers usually rely on a sleep diary completed by a parent as an aid in scoring actigraphic data. However, parental nonadherence in completing the sleep diary may significantly reduce the amount of available data. The current study examined the agreement between actigraphic data scored with and without a sleep diary to evaluate the impact of not using a sleep diary when studying children's sleep with actigraphy. Methods. Sixty children (aged 6–10 years; 36 girls) wore an actigraph for three to seven consecutive nights, and mothers were asked to complete a diary of their child's sleep during the same period. Actigraphy data were scored under two conditions (with and without diary) rated independently for each child by two different research assistants, who each scored 50% of the files in each condition. Results. Group-level analyses and intraclass correlations revealed very strong convergence between the two scoring conditions: on all sleep variables (sleep duration, wake duration, and sleep efficiency), average mean differences were very small and intraclass correlations very high. Bland and Altman’s (1999) approach allowed for a child-by-child examination of agreement between the two conditions and revealed that, although they cannot be considered interchangeable, the two conditions produce quite minimal differences in the estimation of sleep variables. Conclusions. The findings suggest that it is possible to use some actigraphy data for which no corresponding diary data are available, although this approach should be used sparingly.

389	From early relationships to preacademic knowledge : a socio-cognitive developmental cascade to school readiness	This study aimed to test a four-wave sequential mediation model linking mother–child attachment to children’s school readiness through child executive functioning (EF) and prosociality in toddlerhood and the preschool years. Mother–child attachment security was assessed when children (N = 255) were aged 15 months and 2 years, child EF at age 2, prosocial behavior at age 4, and finally cognitive school readiness in kindergarten (age 6). The results revealed three indirect pathways linking attachment to school readiness: one through EF only, one through prosocial behavior only, and a last pathway involving both EF and prosocial behavior serially. These findings suggest that secure attachment may equip children with both cognitive and social skills that are instrumental to their preparedness for school.

390	Sleep and aggressive behavior among toddlers: investigating directionality of associations	This study examined the reciprocal associations between sleep (duration and quality) and aggressive behavior in toddlers. The sample consisted of 82 children (43 boys and 39 girls) and their parents who completed two assessments, when children were 2 and 3 years old. At both time points, children wore an actigraph for 3 consecutive days to assess their sleep patterns, and both their parents reported on their child’s aggressive behavior. The results indicated negative associations between sleep quality at age 2 and both parents’ evaluations of aggressive behavior at age 3; in contrast, the relations between aggression at age 2 and sleep (duration or quality) at age 3 were small and nonsignificant. In line with studies of older children and adolescents, these results suggest that sleep difficulties are more likely to favor the emergence of aggressive behavior among young children than the converse.

391	Trifluorométhylthiolation par C-H activation et synthèse d’amines primaires en chimie en flux continu	This thesis is divided into two parts: primary amine synthesis from halides and Pd(II)-catalyzed trifluoromethylthiolation of C(sp3)-H bonds.  Both methods were developed in continuous flow chemistry.   Primary amines are important building blocks in synthetic chemistry. Therefore, numerous methods for the synthesis of primary amines have been developed. However, mono-alkylation of ammonia, is unreliable, as only modest yields are obtained, due to the poor nucleophilicity of ammonia and the formation of di- and tri-alkylated by-products. In this dissertation, flow chemistry has been used to develop a fast and efficient method for the direct amination of halides with ammonia. In addition, the methodology has been applied to an in-line synthesis showing the possibility for automated synthesis of various compounds.  There is a growing interest of the pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries toward the SCF3 moiety, due to its high lipophilicity and electron-withdrawing character. On the other hand, C-H activation has proven to be an elegant way to functionalize a molecule in an atom- and step-economical fashion. Although C-S bond formation by C-H activation has been relatively underexplored, Pr Pannecoucke and colleagues have elaborated a Pd(II)-catalyzed trifluoromethylthiolation of non-activated C(sp3)-H bonds using a bidentate directing group. Unfortunately, in somes cases, the yields remained modest and long reaction times are needed. Using a continuous flow approach, the reaction proceeded 120–429 times faster and afforded the desired product with improved yields.	amination , C-H activation , aminoquinoline , trifluoromethylthiolation , Flow chemistry , amination , halide	en	21912.0
392	Archivage et transmission des films de famille dans l’environnement numérique	This dissertation aims for a better understanding of value and uses of homes movies and alternative practices deployed to archive them, then considers how they contribute to the renewal of archival perspectives. First, we observe the main material, discursive and expressive components which define home movies and what makes their archiving problematic (part 1). Then, we examine their qualities and possible uses and assess the reasons that justify, despite their trivial, redundant and incomplete nature, their archiving and their inclusion into the audiovisual heritage of the nations (part 2). The fact that they are taken into consideration by the archives is part of the postmodern approach, which argues for the necessity to preserve and to disseminate more diversified representations of the society, while the practices deployed to archive them are part of the contemporary approach, which count on use of the archives and direct involvement of community members at all stages of the archiving process (part 3). Finally, we study a few home movies archiving projects taking place outside major heritage institutions, trough the intermediary of regional organizations and independent networks which adhere to the community archives model and the collector-storyteller spirit. We analyse how these projects make the most of digital environments to gather related movies into collections of interest, to make them visible and intelligible in the eyes of the community through acts of edition and narration, and to establish common spaces of sharing which support their consultation, their interpretation and their usage in order to maintain their meaning potential over time (part 4).

393	Formation continue des enseignants du secondaire au Burkina Faso : quel apport des TIC pour l’amélioration des compétences professionnelles ?	"Secondary education in Burkina Faso faces a number of problems, including a high rate of failure at the GCSE-""O"" Levels andGCE-""A"" Levels, a blarant lack of textbooks, and a clear lack of initial training offered by teachers’ Institutes for the training of future teachers, a virtual lack of continuous training which could have contributed to updating knowledge and to developing professional skills. Moreover, the lack of teachers, mainly in the scientific subjects, has led the authorities in charge of education to permanently recruit students holding at least the academic level of GCE-""A"" Levels + 2 to reduce this shortage. The recruited teacher-trainees thereafter receive an accelerated pedagogical training of up to six months before being assigned to classes. There is no doubt that this painting (which is done in defiance of the quality of the training) will undoubtedly lead to the continuous deterioration of the quality of the secondary school education. This secondary school education is already severely put through the mill, to the extent that a traditional system of continuous training does not exist in our educational system in order to enable an effective support of all teachers in updating their knowledge. Thus, the purpose of this thought is to create a new dynamic, based on shared findings and building on what exists to implement a continuous training for teachers at the height of the challenges and give back its attractiveness to the profession of teachers. This though aims to reflect on how to help the teacher build his career and facilitate his access to formal and informal training.   It aims to understand what continuous training can be according to the paradigm of lifelong learning/training. In concrete terms, this study seeks to better understand whether there can be a qualitative relationship between continuous training and ICT. In other words, can ICTs serve as a relay for the teachers’ in-service training in the school context of Burkina Faso? To this end, could the setting up of an individualized distance training system, thanks to ICT engineering, to which one could add sessions of face-to-face training during the holidays, be part of a suitable solution to this issue? The framework of reference for this research is structured around the theory of socio- constructivism, which serves as a backdrop for our reflection. We will then focus our attention on key concepts of our study that are: ICT, initial training, continuous training, distance-training, secondary education, professional skills. We opted for a mixed-type descriptive research combining both quantitative and qualitative data. To do this, we conducted a questionnaire survey and semi-structured interviews with 60 subjects from four secondary schools in the city of Ouagadougou. In general, the results of the research show that secondary school teachers have important continuous training needs and that the design and implementation of a distance-training program focused on the use of ICTs is of a great necessity.

It particulary investigates the reaffirmation of musicians’s ethnic identity through the symbolic production of what we have called « musical romanity ». We are aiming to underline the musical strategies established by migrants in their integration to a new cultural space. The overall objective of our work is to provide an ethnomusicological contribution to the field of inter-ethnic studies. In this perspective and under a qualitative approach we have met and interviewed the members of the Orchestra Rapsodia Română as well as recording and analysing some of their musical productions.     Our research allowed us to identify several elements linked to the observed phenomena. First, it appears that the migrant’s musical productions in the context of integration can be divided in three categories : internal, external and « in between ». We have established that the music of the Orchestra Rapsodia Română is linked to the internal dimension of the integration process. In that specific context we have observed that musicians with different profiles work togheter to musically produce what they judge an « authentic » Romanian ethnicity despite their divergences on how exactly it should be done. Hence, they solidify the links binding them in a « descent community » (Shelemay, 2011), that brings them « recognition » (Taylor, 2010). Based upon our analysis, this situation implies that musician’s appreciation criteria tend to evolve from what Molino (2009) would call technical and objective criteria to cognitive and functional criteria.

395	Corticospinal excitability, mental rotation task, motor performance and disability in subjects with musculoskeletal disorders of the wrist and hand	The objective of the thesis was to investigate for the presence of changes in cortical sensorimotor processes (corticospinal excitability and the body schema measured with the Left Right Judgment Task (LRJT) performance), in participants with Musculoskeletal Disorders (MSD) of the wrist/hand. A second objective was to determine the relationship between these cortical sensorimotor processes and measures of sensory and hand motor function, disability, pain and pain related psychosocial factors. First, an observational cross-sectional study was conducted to explore corticospinal excitability of muscles in the hand and cortical sensorimotor processes, utilizing transcranial magnetic stimulation and the LRJT in healthy, pain-free participants and participants with chronic wrist/hand pain. Increased corticospinal excitability for the abductor pollicis brevis of the affected hand in participants with chronic MSD of the wrist/hand was found and these changes were significantly correlated with pain intensity, disability, and negatively correlated with spinal motoneuronal excitability. Differences in LRJT performance were also found between healthy control participants and participants with pain for both LRJT accuracy and reaction time.  In a second cross-sectional study, LRJT performance, motor, sensory and cognitive assessments were performed on sixty-one participants with MSD of the right dominant wrist/hand. The multiple linear regression model revealed that taking pain medication, participating in (social, work, household and leisure) activities, two-point discrimination, and motor performance explained performance on the LRJT of the right (affected) hand. Those participants that took pain medication on the day of the evaluation performed more poorly on both LRJT accuracy and reaction time of the right (affected) hand. These participants had higher pain severity and disability scores and decreased cognitive and motor function.  Collectively, these results suggest that participants with heterogeneous MSD of the wrist/hand display altered cortical sensorimotor processes. Whereas corticospinal excitability appears to be related to pain intensity and disability, the LRJT may be associated with a confluence of factors (sensory, motor, cognitive-affective, and behaviours). These findings suggest that cortical sensorimotor changes do not simply appear to be the result of the condition but involve a complex interaction between pain, sensorimotor and cognitive-affective processes, and possibly behavioural responses to the condition. The findings also provide valuable insight as to those persons who may benefit from cognitively directed interventions in addition to peripherally driven rehabilitative treatments.

396	Augmenter la vitesse d’infusion de la cocaïne par voie intraveineuse induit des changements neurochimiques, neurobiologiques et comportementaux chez le rat : implications pour la toxicomanie	Many individuals will experiment with cocaine during their lifetime; yet, few will transition from occasional drug use to addiction. Pharmacokinetic factors of the drug and the way it is consumed are important in this process. Drugs and routes of administration that produce the rapid rise of drug levels in the brain are believed to facilitate this transition. Similarly, intermittent access to the drug, which provokes fluctuations of cocaine concentrations in the brain rather than maintaining continuous high levels, may also be involved. The work presented in this thesis examines how speed of drug delivery and frequency of intake may induce addiction-like symptoms in a rat model of cocaine self-administration and promote neuroplasticity. In a first study, microdialysis was used to determine the effects of rate of cocaine infusion on cocaine and dopamine levels in the dorsal striatum of awake, freely-moving rats. Over the range of infusion rates used (5-90 seconds), cocaine and dopamine concentrations did not significantly vary. Instead, rapid cocaine infusions lead to the faster rate of onset of both molecules in the brain, implying that differences in cocaine-induced behaviour and neuroplasticity are not due to how much drug reaches the brain but on how fast the drug does so. Previous work from our laboratory showed that rapid cocaine infusions increase motivation for cocaine, a symptom of addiction. Therefore, we examined potential changes in the brain caused by rapid cocaine infusions in animals showing excessive motivation for the drug as assessed under a progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement. First, we investigated the effects of cocaine infusion rate on corticostriatal expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and TrkB mRNA in rats with a history of chronic and continuous exposure to cocaine under long access conditions (6 hours/session) and found that only rats self-administering rapid cocaine injections had altered BDNF and TrkB mRNA levels. Next, new evidence suggested that experienced cocaine users do not consume the drug continuously, but rather space out each intoxicating event. Therefore, using an intermittent access model of self-administration, where brain cocaine levels fluctuate within the session, we examined the effects of rate of infusion on c-fos mRNA expression, a marker of neuronal activity. A first group of rats had intermittent access to rapid cocaine infusions, a model we consider as addiction-relevant, while the second had access to slow and continuous cocaine, which promotes significant cocaine intake without promoting addiction-like behaviour. Animals in the addiction-relevant group presented greater motivation for cocaine and showed greater c-fos mRNA expression in various corticostriatal regions. Together, these results suggest that rapid and intermittent cocaine infusions facilitate the development of drug-induced neuroplasticity which may cause addiction-like behaviour, and particularly implicate the orbitofrontal cortex and the dorsal striatum. These two interconnected structures are both involved in addiction. Therefore, we temporarily and pharmacologically disconnected this circuit and found that it reduces motivation for cocaine. In conclusion, we show that pharmacokinetic factors are important when developing animal models of addiction, and that better understanding the mechanisms involved can potentially improve prevention and treatment therapies.

397	Transfert interespèces d’électrons par conduction directe via la matrice protéinique exocellulaire dans un biofilm anaérobie granulaire	Effective interspecies electron transfer (IET) is key to the efficient functioning of anaerobic microbial communities. On the other hand, even today there is little information on the mechanisms by which microorganisms cooperate to exchange electrons. Direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) is a metabolic pathway of IET in which free electrons flow from one microorganism to another without being transported by reduced molecules such as molecular hydrogen or formate. This pathway has been proposed as being present between fermentative and methanogenic populations in the granule during anaerobic digestion. It would involve the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) of the granule to facilitate the transfer of free electrons. The present study examines these hypotheses. The DIET is divided into two broad categories, DIET mediated by a conductive non-organic material (mDIET) and the biological DIET (bDIET). The latter only involves the cells themselves and their components (pilis, nanowires, etc.). Using anaerobic granules in which Geobacter was not dominant (Geobacter is known for its frequent participation in DIET), the tests carried out with two co-substrates showed that the methanogenic activities of the formate and the hydrogen decreased in the presence of a non-methanogenic co-substrate such as ethanol. This may indicate that the bDIET occurs and competes with hydrogen and formate. In addition, the addition of conductive microparticles, such as stainless steel and granular activated carbon, increases the methanogenic activity in the disintegrated granules as compared to the disintegrated granules without microparticles. These results indicate that syntrophic bacteria from anaerobic sludge, excluding Geobacter species, can also perform mDIET. On the other hand, further to tests with a small reactor designed for the study of mDIET, it was determined that this mechanism may not be exclusive, i.e. alone it can not ensure the survival and growth of the methanogens carrying it out; other IET mechanisms may have to occur in parallel with the mDIET. Acetoclast methanogens, known to perform bDIET, have been enriched in the mDIET assays, as well as some non-acetoclastic methanogens, suggesting a role that is still undefined to date in this pathway. Finally, further to studies of granule EPS, the Methanosaeta concilii proteins were shown to be best represented in all three granular sludges studied, highlighting its role in the formation and maintenance of the anaerobic granule, as well as its stability and effectiveness. Without confirming a specific role for EPS, this study highlights the existence of structures and molecules in the extracellular matrix of the granule that chemically have the ability to participate in the bDIET, such as humic substances and formate dehydrogenases.

398	Implantation d’un système de vidéosurveillance intelligente pour détecter les chutes en milieu de vie	Introduction. Aging is associated with an increased risk of fall, which threatens Aging in Place. The numerous and serious consequences of falls on the older adult’s health and independence are reduced with a quick intervention. Yet the informal caregivers, who often intervene in case of a fall are not numerous enough and are often worn out because of the burden related to the care provided for the older adult (Ducharme, 2006; Wolff et al., 2017; World Health Organization, 2015). The development of alternatives to detect and alert in case of a fall becomes essential to facilitate Aging in Place in safety and to maintain a quality of life (van Hoof, Kort, Rutten, & Duijnstee, 2011). Many fall detection systems have been developed. However, they have limits (eg. the recording of personal data), that the intelligent videomonitoring system (IVS) tries to compensate. The IVS is composed of one camera linked to a computer and to the Internet. Based on the computerized analysis of the images, the IVS automatically detects falls and sends an alert to the chosen recipient (eg. the informal caregiver) on his smartphone, computer or tablet. The IVS preserves privacy with its closed circuit functioning: without a fall, the images are destroyed; in case of a fall, an image of the fall can be sent to the recipient. This image can be blurred at the request of the older adult. The 30 seconds before the fall can be recorded to document its causes, if the older adult authorizes it. Previous studies on the IVS show that the IVS has the potential to answer the users’ needs (Lapierre et al., 2016, 2015; Londei et al., 2009; Rougier, St-Arnaud, Rousseau, & Meunier, 2011). However, it is important to validate its technology and explore users’ perception in ecological conditions (at home with older adults at risk of fall) (Atoyebi, Stewart, & Sampson, 2015). Purpose. Based on the Model of Competence explaining the person-environment interactions (Rousseau, 2017), the study aims to explore the feasibility of the IVS implementation to detect falls at home in order to improve the older adult’s quality of life and decrease the caregiver’s burden. Methodology. The thesis follows a development research design (Contandriopoulos, Champagne, Potvin, Denis, & Boyle, 2005) in four steps. Step 1 was two scoping reviews (Daudt, Van Mossel, & Scott, 2013) on fall detection technology and on wandering management technology respectively. Many databases have been searched (eg. CINHAL, Medline, Embase). Each step of the study selection, data extraction and analysis have been independently realised by two co-authors. Results were compared and disagreements were solved by consensus or by a third part intervention. Extracted data were descriptively analysed (Fortin & Gagnon, 2015). Step 2 was a multiple case study (Yin, 2014) with six older adults living alone with a risk of fall, on the implementation of a previous version of the IVS, the programmable videomonitoring system. The programmable videomonitoring system was installed for seven nights at home to observe participants walk when they went to the bathroom at night. Semi- structured interviews were realised before and after the experiment. Data were qualitatively analysed (Miles, Huberman, & Saldana, 2014). Step 3 was a proof of concept in two phases: 1) a simulation study in an apartment- laboratory (Contandriopoulos, Champagne, Potvin, Denis, & Boyle, 2005) and 2) a pre-test at home with young adults. Phase 1 implied a simulation of daily living scenarios and falls scenarios to estimate the sensitivity, specificity, error rate and accuracy of the IVS. The pre- test consisted in the implementation of the IVS at home for 28 days to anticipate the technological difficulties related to extended implementation. For the two phases, a logbook was completed to document the IVS functioning, then data were descriptively analysed. Step 4 was a multiple case study (Yin, 2014) with three dyads of older adults/caregivers. The included older adults had a high risk of fall and lived alone. The IVS was implemented for a two-month period with the informal caregiver as the alerts recipient. A semi-structured interview was realised before, at mid-term, and after the experiment. Data were qualitatively analysed (Miles, Huberman, & Saldana, 2014). Results. Results encompass the adaptation of the IVS to explore the feasibility of its implementation at home to detect serious falls. Step 1 highlighted the gaps in the literature, some of which were filled by the thesis project (eg. lack of studies exploring the implementation of ambient system in various homes). This step also enabled us to identify ways to improve the IVS and its implementation process. Step 2 highlighted factors facilitating or hindering the implementation of cameras system at home. Step 3 has enabled us to validate the technology in a similar environment to the older adult’s home and to solve technical difficulties related to the prolonged implementation. Finally, step 4 enabled us to explore the feasibility of the implementation of the IVS at older adults’ home for a two-month period. Discussion. This development research enabled us to adapt the IVS for its implementation by means of four research steps (scoping reviews, proof of concept, multiple case study), and then to show the feasibility of its implementation. Results led to the identification of factors influencing the IVS at home and enabled us to make recommendations in this regard. This thesis is original on three aspects: 1) the implication of a multidisciplinary team, 2) a user-based conception, 3) the implementation of the technology at home. Despite the remaining challenges regarding the implementation (eg. the performance discrepancy between the home and the apartment-laboratory), this study encourages the further development of the VSI. Conclusion. This thesis aimed to address the problematic of falls at home thanks to the implementation of the IVS to automatically alert the informal caregiver. Results from this development research highlight that the IVS may be a promising way to detect serious falls, to alert the caregiver and document the falls causes. Future researches should be involving quantitative designs, more specifically with more various profiles of informal caregivers and a longer period of implementation, to demonstrate the IVS outcomes. The IVS could then become accessible to the older adult to support Aging in place and relieve the caregiver’s burden.

399	Effet des antirétroviraux sur la pathogénèse du VIH : une étude par modélisation mathématique intégrant la cinétique du virus, de l’immunité, du médicament, et le comportement d’adhésion avec leurs variabilités interindividuelles	Tremendous progress was made in treating people living with HIV. Nowadays, antiretroviral therapy usually allows patients to suppress viral loads for several years, if not decades. Despite this scientific achievement, chronic drug intake is usually necessary as no treatment can completely eradicate the virus. Patients under these conditions may experience constant side effects. Further, patients’ tissues and organs may become damaged over time, as chronic immune activation is observed in most patients despite adequate drug intake and undetectable viremia. The number of treatment options can also become seriously limited over time if patients’ viruses develop and accumulate drug resistance. These issues motivate current scientific efforts. Hopefully, results from these efforts may lead to improvements in patient’s quality of life and lower the financial burden HIV imposes on society.  Using the most up-to-date knowledge in the field of HIV, this thesis addresses some of the above-mentioned issues through a quantitative systems pharmacology approach supported by clinical data. Our main objective was to inform the mechanisms underlying the development of resistance and the persistence of the virus in vivo. We used available information on the components involved in the virologic response to drugs. This allowed developing models that bridge multiple scales, going from molecular, to viral, then cellular and finally to the clinical level. By assessing the ensuing models’ ability to explain and reproduce empirical data, we studied the consistency of hypotheses regarding the causality of studied phenomena. First, we developed a model allowing to better understand the extent of drug resistance development in patients undergoing antiretrovial therapy. The model combines several components, including viral kinetics, immunity, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, drug adherence as well as their interindividual variability. Predictions originating from our in silico model are consistent with clinical observations of virologic failure for the three treatments that were considered consisting of efavirenz, emtricitabine, tenofovir, darunavir and ritonavir. Through this integrative approach, we have remedied previous models that largely underestimated the risk of resistance. Our results highlight the important role played by low lymph node drug penetration in the development of resistance. The model we developed is an added forward step toward the use of in silico methods in the prediction of virologic responses in HIV patients. We then investigated the causes underlying the increasingly slow phases of viral decline observed in patients initiating antiretroviral therapy. Opinions differ as to the role played by low drug penetration in tissues in the existence of these phases, leading to a fragmentation in research efforts. To shed light on this issue, we additionally considered, in our integrative model, different rates of tissue penetration.  Our results indicate that, if low drug penetration were the only cause of the decline in phases of the viral load, then the ensuing low drug exposure would put patients at a very high risk of developing drug resistance. Prediction of high risk quantitatively contradicts the observed reality (little to no resistance), leading us to conclude that low penetration is unlikely a fair explanation to the phases of viral decline. The last part of the thesis examines the ability of some patients to maintain low viral loads after interrupting prolonged antiretroviral therapy. We revisited a reported correlation between viral load values at interruption (also called residual viremia) and the duration of time patients maintained low viral loads afterwards. The interpretation of this correlation proved to be challenging since this duration includes both a time of complete control of viremia and a time during which viremia grows to a low-level threshold once control is lost. Using a mechanistic model and advanced statistical techniques, we were able to estimate the expected duration of complete viremia control along with its interindividual variability. Contrary to a direct interpretation of the correlation reported in the literature, our analysis reveals that the time of viremia control is unlikely associated with patients’ residual viremia. In summary, the in silico approach adopted in this thesis is part of an overall effort aiming to minimize patient recruitment and the financial costs involved in drug development. Our models suggest that better drug penetration in lymph nodes would likely lead to a decreased risk of drug resistance in non-adherent patients. However, our results also suggest that such an improvement would have little influence on the rate of decline of viral loads. Further, and regardless of the influence lymphatic tissue drug penetration may have on residual viremia, this improvement would not favour viremia control after antiretroviral discontinuation.	drug adherence , drug distribution , drug efficacy , drug individualization , drug resistance , highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) , HIV , HIV persistence , in vitro to in vivo extrapolation , interindividual variability , latent cells , mathematical modeling , post-treatment control , quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) , viral rebound , virologic failure	en	21825.0
400	Conception d'espaceurs pour relever les défis de bioconjugaison	One of the major problems of oral or intravenous administration of drugs is the fact that the active pharmaceutical ingredient will distribute itself in the whole body, without any specificity towards the diseased site. In this project, the working hypothesis is that conjugating these active pharmaceutical ingredients with targeted ligands will direct them towards therapeutic targets, to improve therapeutic efficacy or intestinal permeability. For this purpose, a series of spacers with diverse properties (length, hydrophily, cleavability) were developed to conjugate the active pharmaceutical ingredient to a targeting moiety such as a peptide or a protein.  Firstly, poorly permeable active pharmaceutical ingredients were conjugated to ligands recognizing receptor GM1 such as peptides or the β subunit of cholera toxin (CTB), in the purpose to improve intestinal permeability. Indeed, CTB is internalized in enterocytes by binding to receptor GM1. Following optimization of spacers, the affinity of the peptide conjugates with receptor GM1 was preserved as shown by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and microscale thermophoresis (MST). Internalisation of conjugates was evaluated by flow cytometry in Caco-2 and T84 intestinal cells. Peptide conjugates were internalized in Caco-2 and T84 cells, but the internalization was limited and did not increase in presence of GM1 supplementation.  On the other hand, an albumin-CTB conjugate (CTB-BSA) was internalized more significantly and the mechanism depended on GM1. Finally, the permeability was evaluated on a monolayer model of Caco-2 and T84 cells. The peptide conjugates demonstrated modest permeability across the monolayer, whereas CTB-BSA had superior permeability against controls.  This study shows that conjugating CTB to a macromolecule improves its permeability across a monolayer of intestinal cells.   Secondly, an immunostimulating drug was conjugated to an antibody targeting the HER2 receptor of breast cancer to form an antibody drug conjugate (ADC). The objective of this approach was to improve the anticancer efficacy of the antibody targeting HER2 currently used in the treatment of breast cancer (Trastuzumab), by combining the immunostimulating properties of the drug. The anti-HER2 murine antibody was conjugated to the drug using a cleavable pH-sensitive spacer. The degree of conjugation and colloidal stability of the resulting ADCs were evaluated by hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) and size exclusion chromatography (SEC) respectively. It was possible to graft 4 or 8 molecules of drug to the antibody while keeping an adequate colloidal stability. The ADC retained its affinity towards cells presenting HER2 receptor such as TUBO cells and H2N100 cells. The drug grafted to the ADC also conserved its therapeutic activity in vitro on these cells, as demonstrated by the evaluation of demethylation and gene expression of CXCL9 and CXCL10. These conjugates were promising in vitro et the assessment of the anticancer activity in vivo on a mouse model of breast is currently being studied in Stagg’s laboratory.

401	Les effets cardioprotecteurs de peptides dérivés des sécrétagogues de l’hormone de croissance dans le modèle d’ischémie-reperfusion du myocarde murin	Growth hormone-releasing peptides (GHRP) are synthetic peptides that stimulate growth hormone (GH) secretion after binding with the ghrelin receptor (previously known as the growth hormone secretagogue receptor 1a, GHS-R1a). Unacylated ghrelin (UAG) represents the predominant form of ghrelin in circulation, but UAG does not bind to the ghrelin receptor and does not stimulate GH release. Studies have shown that GHRPs and UAG possess cardioprotective effects independent from GH secretion. The group of Ong has identified the CD36 receptor, expressed in cardiomyocytes, macrophages and adipocytes among other cells, as the second binding site for GHRPs, whereas the receptor for UAG is still unknown until this day. The general aim of this thesis was to evaluate the cardioprotective effects of a new class of GHRPs analogues, the azapeptides, which show a higher selectivity towards the CD36 receptor in comparison to that of ghrelin, and the cardioprotective effects of a bioactive peptide fragment of UAG, UAG6-13, in the pathology of ischemic heart disease.   The model of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (MI/R) was generated by a surgical ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery for 30 min to induce an ischemia, followed by a reperfusion of 6 or 48 h in C57BL/6 male mice. The mice have been pretreated in the first study with azapeptide CP-3(iv) (289 nmol/kg) or the vehicle (0.9% NaCl) daily by subcutaneous (s.c.) injection, and in the second study with UAG (100 nmol/kg), UAG6-13 (1000 nmol/kg and 3000 nmol/kg) or the vehicle twice daily by s.c. injection prior to being subjected to MI/R.   Our first study have shown that CP-3(iv) protects against I/RM induced injury by reducing the infarct size and preserving myocardial hemodynamics. These effects result, in part, by an increase in adiponectin production/secretion and proteins involved in its transcription in adipose tissue. This leads to an increase in circulating levels of adiponectin and a decrease in plasma concentration of non-esterified fatty acids. In the myocardium, the anti-oxidative, anti-apoptotic and pro-metabolic properties of adiponectin has been observed. None of these effects was observed in CD36 deficient mice and the function recovery of the heart by CP-3(iv) has been abrogated by an anti-adiponectin antibody in an isolated heart model, showing the dependency for the CD36 receptor and the importance of the role of adiponectin to mediate the cardioprotective effects of CP-3(iv). Our second study showed that UAG and UAG6-13 have reduced the percentage of myocardial lesions and preserved cardiac hemodynamics. These effects result largely by a reduction in plasma concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-α. Moreover, our results have shown a reduction in apoptosis and an activation of the AMPK pathway involved in fatty acids oxidation in the heart. The effects of UAG6-13 are independent of the ghrelin receptor as shown by a concomitant addition of D-Lys3-GHRP-6, a ghrelin receptor antagonist, in the model of isolated heart.   In conclusion, the work conducted in this thesis have shown that CP-3(iv) and UAG6-13 possess potent cardioprotective effects in the pathology of MI/R and constitute new therapeutic approaches which can be applied in ischemic cardiovascular disease.

402	Impact of the pulvinar on the ventral pathway of the cat visual cortex	Signals from the retina are relayed to the lateral geniculate nucleus from which they are sent to the primary visual cortex. At the cortical level, the information is transferred across several visual areas in which the complexity of the processing increases progressively. Anatomical and functional evidence demonstrate the existence of two main pathways in visual cortex processing distinct features of the visual information: the dorsal and ventral streams. Cortical areas composing the dorsal stream are implicated mostly in motion processing while those comprising the ventral stream are involved in the processing of form and colour. This classic view of the cortical functional organization is challenged by the existence of reciprocal connections of visual cortical areas with the thalamic nucleus named pulvinar. These connections allow the creation of a trans-thalamic pathway that parallels the cortico-cortical communications across the visual hierarchy.  The main goal of the present thesis is twofold: first, to obtain a better comprehension of the processing of light increments and decrements in an area of the cat ventral stream (area 21a); second, to characterize the nature of the thalamo-cortical inputs from the cat lateral posterior nucleus (LP) to area 21a.  In study #1, we investigated the spatiotemporal response profile of neurons from area 21a to light increments (brights) and decrements (darks) using a reverse correlation analysis of a sparse noise stimulus. Our findings showed that 21a neurons exhibited stronger responses to darks with receptive fields exhibiting larger dark subfields. However, no differences were found between the temporal dynamics of brights and darks. In comparison with the primary visual cortex, the dark preference in area 21a was found to be strongly enhanced, supporting the notion that the asymmetries between brights and darks are transmitted and amplified along the ventral stream.  In study #2, we investigated the impact of the reversible pharmacological inactivation of the LP nucleus on the contrast response function (CRF) of neurons from area 21a and the primary visual cortex (area 17). The thalamic inactivation yielded distinct effects on both cortical areas. While in area 17 the LP inactivation caused a slight decrease in the response gain, in area 21a a strong increase was observed. Thus, our findings suggest that the LP exerts a modulatory influence on the cortical processing along the ventral stream with stronger impact on higher order extrastriate areas.  Taken together, our findings allowed a better comprehension of the functional properties of the cat ventral stream and contributed to the current knowledge on the role of the pulvinar on the cortico-thalamo-cortical processing of visual information.	corrélation reverse , area 21a , primary visual cortex , reverse correlation , lateral posterior nucleus , contrast response , electrophysiology , thalamic inactivation	en	21816.0
403	Development and testing of a virtual nursing intervention to increase walking after a cardiac event : a randomized trial	Although increasing physical activity produces several health benefits after an acute coronary syndrome event (Anderson et al., 2016; Moholdt et al., 2018), only 40 to 60% of coronary patients attain the recommended physical activity level (De Smedt et al., 2016; Janssen & Jolliffe, 2006; Reid et al., 2006). Whereas web-based interventions offer novel modalities scalable to large populations of coronary patients, there is a paucity of evidence using objective measures of physical activity behaviour (Devi et al., 2015). The development of a four-week web-based tailored nursing intervention, TAVIE en m@rche, was guided by a framework integrating Strengths-Based Nursing Care and Self-Determination Theory. The intervention goal was to increase moderate-intensity walking to the recommended 150 minutes per week in insufficiently active acute coronary syndrome patients. The intervention is centered on videos of a nurse delivering content tailored to baseline self-reported autonomous motivation, perceived competence, and walking behavior. The primary aim of this parallel two-group multicenter randomized controlled trial was to test the effect of TAVIE en m@rche on increasing steps per day at twelve-weeks post-randomization. Secondary aims included testing the effect of the intervention on increasing steps per day at five weeks, and increasing walking and moderate to vigorous physical activity at five and twelve weeks. We also explored the effect of the intervention on motivation and confidence to attain the walking recommendation, quality of life, smoking status, cardiac medication adherence, secondary prevention program attendance, emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and angina frequency. Eligible acute coronary syndrome patients reported performing less than the recommended physical activity level six-months prior hospitalization and having the ability to access the web-based intervention. Randomization occurred between the fourth and sixth week post-hospitalization upon which the participants were assigned to either the experimental group, receiving TAVIE en m@rche, or the control group, receiving hyperlinks to public websites. Outcome data were collected at five and or twelve weeks according to the aims. Sixty participants were randomized equally among the two groups, in which thirty-nine provided completed data for the primary outcome. At twelve weeks, relative to the control v groupe, a minimal and non-significant increase in steps per day as well as a non-significant improvement in moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity were found in the experimental group. No significant effects were observed between groups regarding other secondary or any exploratory outcomes. The minimal and non-significant increase in the primary outcome may be explained by most participants attaining the intervention goal before receiving access to the intervention. The magnitude of improvement in moderate to vigorous physical activity, albeit non-significant, could nonetheless represent important health gains in the experimental group. However, caution in interpretation is warranted in this result for the following limitations: the types of physical activities that could have explained this improvement were not collected, a risk of attrition bias was present, and the result shows statistical uncertainty that occurred from a small sample size. This study contributes to the advancement of theory in intervention design by demonstrating the conceptualization and operationalization of a novel web-based intervention using a nursing approach. Empirical contributions arise from stimulating thinking on possible adaptions of the intervention and research design to best reach the intended population for intervention and to best meet their needs for support in increasing physical activity.

404	Évaluation par IRM 3T, par échographie et par microscopie du cartilage épiphysaire de poulains de 0-6 mois d’âge : mieux comprendre et diagnostiquer l’ostéochondrose	Osteochondrosis (OC) is an ischemic chondronecrosis of epiphyseal growth cartilage that results in focal failure of endochondral ossification and in the development of osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) at specific sites in the epiphyses of humans and animals, including horses. Extensive OC lesions at the lateral ridge of the equine trochlea have a poor outcome with surgical debridement and can be career ending. The pathophysiology of the disease is partly understood, but the upstream events leading to the focal ischemia remain unknown. The epiphyseal growth cartilage matrix undergoes major dynamic changes in early life that could weaken it biomechanically and predispose it to focal trauma and vascular failure. There is a clinical need to develop and validate non-invasive imaging techniques for screening and monitoring of subclinical lesions, as their early detection holds the promise to improve outcome. Subregions in neonatal foal femoral epiphyses (n=10 osteochondrosis predisposed; n=6 control) were assessed for vascularity using 3T Susceptibility-weighted imaging (3T SWI) and ultrasonography and for proteoglycan and collagen structure/content employing 3T quantitative MRI (3T qMRI: T1r and T2 maps). Site-matched validations were made with histology, immunohistochemistry and second harmonic microscopy. There was no vascular and cartilage matrix difference between control and OC specimens, but a striking difference was seen in vascular pattern and cartilage matrix structure and composition at the OC-predilected site in the lateral ridge of the trochlea in all specimens compared with others sites in the trochlear ridge. This site was less ossified with more perichondrial vessels not yet bridging with the subchondral bone. Furthermore, the mean vascular density was significantly higher at this site, as well as T1r and T2 relaxation times (p<0,002), suggesting matrix content and structure changes. Microscopic evaluation of this region revealed an expansive area with low proteoglycan content and a hypertrophic-like appearance on second-harmonic microscopy. We speculate that this matrix structure and composition, though physiological, may weaken the epiphyseal growth cartilage biomechanically in focal regions and could enhance the risk of vascular failure with trauma leading to OC. However, additional investigations are required to confirm this hypothesis. As ultrasonographic measurements strongly correlated with the histological measurements and with the site-matched SWI images, v and to translate our findings to the clinic, we indertook an ultrasonographic examination of the femoral trochleae of a cohort of foals in a field situation on a stud farm (n=46, 27-166 days old) was performed and radiographs were taken concurrently and at one year. Subclinical osteochondrosis lesions, characterised by semicircular indentations in the ossification front (indirect evidence of focal failure of ossification) were detected in six foals (28–145 days old), both with radiography and ultrasonography, but post-mortem validation of lesions was not possible. While 3T SWI MRI and 3T qMRI pave the way for non-destructive longitudinal studies to improve understanding of OC in all species, ultrasonographic examination of the femoral trochlea in young foals is a promising, practical tool for screening subclinical osteochondrosis and monitoring and managing lesions at important clinical sites.

405	Analyse biochimique et inhibition de complexes macromoléculaires dans des cellules humaines et bactériennes	All cellular processes depend on macromolecular complexes. Studying their composition, structure and the interactions between their components is a crucial step toward understanding of their functions. Moreover, their components can be targeted in applied research aimed at drug design. During my Ph.D., we set up a multidisciplinary approach to study two macromolecular complexes: the eukaryotic selenocysteine (Sec) biosynthesis and incorporation machinery and the H. pylori type 4 secretion system. Sec is the 21st amino acid of the genetic code and is encoded by the UGA stop codon. Thus, Sec decoding requires a specialized translation machinery and is driven by transient interactions between RNA and proteins. Although the main factors of the machinery are now identified, many molecular details remain to be clarified. In order to characterize the interactions between all the known factors, we took advantage of the BRET (Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer) assay. Our in vivo interaction studies allowed us to define the oligomeric state of several factors of the machinery and to identify previously unknown interactions. Sites of interaction between several factors of the machinery were also determined using in vitro approaches. Thus, we propose here a more detailed model of the steps leading to the Sec decoding. In addition, we propose the first structural model of a key protein of the machinery (SECp43), that could be later exploited to elucidate the function of the protein in the translation machinery. Then we focused on the type 4 secretion system of Helicobacter pylori. The H. pylori bacterium is a human pathogen whose presence increases the risk of gastric carcinogenesis. The type 4 secretion system encoded by some strains constitute an aggravating factor of pathogenicity. Due to the emergence of multidrug-resistant H. pylori strains, current treatments to eradicate bacteria become unsuitable. Thus, we propose to adopt an alternative strategy to antibiotics and undertook to develop and characterize molecules capable of inhibiting the virulence of the bacterium. The 1G2 molecule, that targets the Cagα ATPase protein, was identified. The 1G2 molecule inhibits the ATPase activity of Cagα and decreases by almost 50% the proinflammatory response of eukaryotic cells induced by the H. pylori infection. The effectiveness of the molecule was subsequently evaluated on drug-resistant clinical strains of H. pylori, genetically and biochemically characterized. We have demonstrated that the 1G2 molecule was also effective on highly virulent clinical strains. As chronicity of H. pylori infection may lead to the development of gastric cancers, our results suggest the high potential of the 1G2 molecule in the treatment of H. pylori infection. This molecule could serve as a basis for the design of other molecules having a more noticeable effect on the virulence of H. pylori.

406	Staufen1 est un régulateur post-transcriptionnel du cycle cellulaire	The cell cycle is crucial for growth, but also for development. This mechanism is so critical that the slightest damage to one of its stages can lead to problems of growth and development, but also to the appearance of anomalies, such as cancers, and ultimately death. As a result, cell proliferation is a finely regulated mechanism, best avoiding possible failures and imbalances.  The regulation mechanisms of the cell cycle transitions are grouped at several levels, and are highly hierarchical and structured: the transcriptional and post-translational regulations are among the most studied aspects to date. Other processes, such as post-transcriptional regulation, are less documented. However, number of discoveries of RNA-binding proteins, which play a key role in the different phases of the division cycle, is increasing since the past decade. Splicing, nuclear export, localization, degradation and translation of mRNAs represent the multiple aspects of post-transcriptional regulation, and amply justify their importance in refining the control of the different phases of the cell cycle.  Staufen1, an RNA-binding protein, is one of the incredible discoveries that have revolutionized our understanding of gene expression regulation, and has helped deepen our understanding of the mechanisms underlying various cellular and physiological processes. The research work undertaken during this thesis has contributed to deepening our knowledge of Staufen1 protein function in the post-transcriptional regulation of the cell cycle and proliferation. We have identified a new mechanism of degradation of STAU1 during mitosis exist, involving the ubiquitin-proteasome system. We have also shown for the first time that STAU1 could inhibit tumor proliferation in colorectal cancer, and our results have been confirmed and extended in later studies. Moreover, the results of our experimental approaches in untransformed cellular models, strongly suggest a positive roleof Staufen1 in promoting the proliferative potential during tumorigenesis. . These results are consistent with a multitude of studies showing the positive role of STAU1 in the regulation of proliferation and its involvement in various types of cancers. However, more comprehensive review of Staufen1 studies suggests a multi-mechanistic model in the various carcinogenic processes, and opens up a future field of investigation to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that support the STAU1 functions associated with cell proliferation and tumor development.

407	Modélisations de maladies des motoneurones en utilisant le poisson zébré	Hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSP) are a group of heterogeneous neurodegenerative diseases affecting upper motor neurons, causing progressive gait dysfunction and more than 60 genes have been linked to this disease. On the other hand, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a late-onset progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects both upper and lower motor neurons, leading to muscle atrophy with spasticity and death in two to five years due to respiratory failure. These two motor neuron disorders, while separate, share common genes and pathological mechanisms and as such, increasing our knowledge about their similarities and differences can help us have a better understanding of each of them individually. In order to study these two diseases, we used previously characterized zebrafish models and developed new ones to deepen our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of HSP and ALS. In the first part of this thesis, we identified ER stress as a new pathological mechanism at play in HSP due to spastin loss-of-function and showed that ER stress modulators are able to rescue the locomotor phenotype. We also identified a new gene causative of HSP, CAPN1 (SPG76), provided in vivo validation of its loss-of-function pathogenicity and identified microtubule networks disorganization as one of the main defects. In the second part of this thesis, we generated several new zebrafish models to study ALS. Two transgenic lines expressing either a wild-type or a mutant TDP-43 protein under the control of an inducible promoter allowed us to recapitulate previous findings obtained with mRNA injections and identify transcriptomic changes due to the mutant protein that are in line with recent transcriptomic data obtained in mouse models. We also generated two new lines with knock-in of ALS-causative point mutations in the tardbp and fus zebrafish endogenous genes using the CRISPR/Cas9 technology. These results underscore the value of the zebrafish model to study motor neuron disorders and their pathophysiological mechanisms as well as open new therapeutic avenues.	stress RE , TDP-43 , FUS , spastin , CRISPR/Cas9 , calpain 1 , Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , hereditary spastic paraplegia , zebrafish , ER stress	en	21795.0
408	À la chasse aux métaux traces dans un Nord canadien en évolution rapide : approches limnologiques, écologiques et collaborative = Hunting for trace metals in a rapidly changing North : limnological, ecological, and collaborative approaches	Climate change will have wide-ranging effects on Arctic ecosystems and communities. Accelerated warming combined with significant pressure to exploit natural resources has led to Arctic ecosystems vulnerable to both climatic and socio-environmental change. As the Arctic is an important indicator of future global changes, it is important to study the impact of these changes on human and ecosystem health. A key knowledge gap in our understanding is how rapid changes in the North will affect the transport and biogeochemical cycling of key contaminants, including trace metals. In this thesis, I used a large-scale ecological approach to study the environmental fate, bioaccumulation, and trophic transfer of trace metals in Canada’s northern ecosystems. In the first chapter of this thesis, I studied the potential impacts of a changing climate on mercury cycling within Arctic lakes and ponds. This large-scale, multi-year study investigated whether microbially-active permafrost thaw ponds were potential sources of mercury in the eastern Canadian Arctic. Our results showed that thaw ponds are small but abundant sources of methylmercury, with potentially significant downstream effects linked to permafrost thaw. The second chapter of this thesis examined the effects of aquatic productivity on the uptake of methylmercury in biota at the base of freshwater food webs. I sampled a gradient in ecosystem productivity to study the implications of climate-induced changes in productivity on mercury bioaccumulation. Our results suggested that indicators of productivity, such as algal biomass and nutrient stoichiometry, are not the main drivers of methylmercury accumulation within unproductive Arctic lakes. The third and fourth chapters of this thesis focused on the behaviour and environmental fate of rare earth elements in Arctic ecosystems. Few ecotoxicological studies exist for rare earth elements and our goal was to establish baseline data before the proliferation of rare earth mining projects at northern latitudes. Our results found that rare earth element bioaccumulation patterns appear to be species- and tissue-specific and they do not biomagnify in natural food webs. I also identified key environmental drivers of bioaccumulation in zooplankton, including, pH, dissolved organic carbon and the rare earth element free-ion concentrations. These studies highlight the utility of zooplankton as a biomonitor for rare earth elements in freshwater ecosystems. Lastly, my thesis highlights the importance of collaborative research with Indigenous communities by examining a successful community-based environmental monitoring program in Nunavik. I participated in a collaborative and land-based environmental monitoring and science education program with the aim of integrating Indigenous knowledge into ecological research. I also examined the role of peer-led workshops as an effective platform for early-career researchers to reflect on the benefits and challenges of conducting community-collaborative research in Indigenous communities. Overall, my thesis greatly improves our understanding of how rapid socio-environmental change may affect the bioavailability and trophic transfer of mercury and rare earth elements in the eastern Canadian Arctic. Understanding the impact of future changes on the environmental fate of metals is crucial to ensuring the health of Arctic ecosystems and communities.	bioaccumulation , environment , mercury , methylmercury , rare earth elements , metals , arctic , subarctic , freshwater , food webs , bioaccumulation , zooplankton , lakes , ponds , community-based monitoring , community-collaborative research	en	21777.0
409	Health professionals’ perception of distress in cancer patients and family members : measuring accuracy and examining the role of empathic skills	Dealing with cancer and its treatment is an important life challenge for patients and family members, who must adapt to a variety of psychosocial consequences related to the illness. Managing psychological distress in persons affected by cancer is an important aspect of whole-patient and family-centred care. Recent advances in cancer care research and policy have allowed for more accurate detection of distress. Routine administration of screening tests is now common practice. However, many avenues are left unexploited. The principal aim of the present thesis was to examine empathic skills such as perspective taking as a complementary strategy for improving the detection of distress in adults affected by cancer.  The objective of the first study was to examine physicians’ natural empathic ability to detect depression and general distress in adults with advanced cancer. Previous findings suggested that oncology professionals often struggle to accurately detect patient distress. We verified this phenomenon by employing more reliable and valid measures of patient-physician agreement than those most commonly reported in the literature. Analyses of agreement were conducted at both global and symptom levels in an effort to provide more detailed information on physicians’ performance. In addition, regression analyses were performed to examine variables of empathic ability as possible correlates of patient-physician agreement on depressive symptoms. The results suggest that physicians have difficulty detecting depressive symptoms, particularly those that are more subtle in nature. Physicians’ self-reported ability to provide compassionate care, quality of relationship with the patient, and self-efficacy in detecting patient distress, were all associated with higher patient-physician agreement on at least one depressive symptom.   The main objective of the second study was to compare two types of perspective taking on clinician ability to detect distress in parents of children with cancer. A quasi-experimental study was designed through the integration of basic theory and methodology from social psychology research. Oncology professionals were randomly assigned to one of two groups, and were then shown a video featuring parents of children with cancer. In the imagine-self group, they were instructed to imagine the feelings and life consequences which they would experience if they were in each parent’s situation. In the imagine-other group, they were instructed to imagine the feelings and life consequences experienced by the parents. No significant group differences were found for parent-clinician agreement on parents’ negative thoughts and feelings. However, clinicians who, in accordance with the imagine-self perspective, reported being more concentrated on their own feelings tended to show lower agreement. Clinicians who were instructed to adopt an imagine-self perspective reported significantly more distress than those instructed to adopt an imagine-other perspective. No association was found between clinician distress and parent-clinician agreement.  The findings of this thesis suggest that empathic skills could significantly contribute to accurate detection of distress in persons affected by cancer. This new line of research could have important implications for communication training, management of psychosocial resources, and possibly prevention professional burnout. More experimental research is needed before evidence-based guidelines can be elaborated.

410	Observations multi-longueur d’onde d’amas et de groupes de galaxies proches	Clusters and groups of galaxies are dynamic environments, continually perturbed. On the one hand, the supermassive black hole of the central galaxy can release powerful rela- tivistic jets compensating the radiative losses of the intracluster or intragroup medium. This mechanism is called active galactic nucleus feedback. On the other hand, the interaction between the cluster or the group with other galaxies can also generate important perturba- tions such as shocks or cold fronts. In general, these internal or external perturbations leave their footprints into the observations of clusters and groups covering the entire electromag- netic spectrum. In this thesis, the multi-wavelength observational study of one group and one cluster of galaxies, both nearby, is presented. Overall, this work has contributed to the comprehension of some of the complex processes characterizing these environments. First, the analysis of deep observations (380 ks) from the X-ray observatory Chandra of the galaxy NGC 4472 (z = 0.0038), the dominant galaxy of a group falling into the Virgo cluster, is presented. These new observations have allowed the detailed study of the radio lobe dynamics. Rims of cold gas surrounding the radio lobes have been detected and seem to be constituted of gas originating from the group center. We estimate the energy required to lift this gas from the center of NGC 4472 to be ∼ 1056 erg. We have also led the analysis of the abundance distribution of different elements (O, Ne, Mg, Si et Fe) from the X-ray spectrum. Second, we have produced a radio-frequency map of the Perseus cluster (z = 0.018), obtained from new Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array observations at 230-470 MHz in B configuration. The data reduction and calibration steps as well as the imaging process were specifically adjusted for the analysis of these observations, taking into account the strong presence of radio frequency interferences at these frequencies and the presence of the ex- tremely bright central active galactic nucleus in the cluster center. The observations have revealed a multitude of new structures associated with the cluster central diffuse radio emis- sion, the mini-halo. These structures include several radial filaments stretching in different directions, a concave structure correlating with the bay and several other correspondences with the X-ray structures such as cold fronts. These results show that mini-halos are there- fore not simply diffuse, uniform radio sources, but rather have a rich variety of complex structures. A comprehensive picture of the dynamics of the filamentary emission-line nebula sur- rounding NGC 1275, the dominant galaxy of the Perseus cluster, has been revealed with the observations of SITELLE («Spectromètre Imageur à Transformée de Fourier pour l’Étude en Long et en Large des raies d’Émission»), a new optical imaging Fourier transform spec- trometer at Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. With its wide field of view of 11′ × 11′, it is the only instrument of this type covering the 80kpc × 55kpc (3.8′ × 2.6′ at the distance of NGC 1275) large nebula in its entirety. Our analysis of these observations shows a smooth radial gradient of the [N II]λ6583/Hα line ratio, suggesting a change in the ionization source and mechanism across the nebula. We have produced for the first time a complete detailed velocity map of the filaments. This map reveal a previously unknown rich velocity structure. The velocity map shows no visible general radial trend or rotation, indicating that filaments are not falling uniformly onto the galaxy, nor being uniformly pulled out from it. A com- parison between these measurements and the Hitomi results on the Perseus cluster is also presented. Finally, we have created a high-resolution image at 230-470 MHz of the Perseus cluster with new Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array A configuration observations. The high dynamic range and resolution achieved in this image have allowed the identification of new structures. Most of the extended mini-halo emission filling the core of the Perseus cluster disappears in these observations due to the high resolution and only some of the brightest western parts remain visible. The central radio emission fills the inner X-ray cavities and extends toward the outer cavities. As the outer cavities are visible at lower frequencies, we are therefore catching the spectral turnover at around 350 MHz. Beyond the central emission surrounding NGC 1275, we also describe and analyze the morphology of four complex radio sources harbored in the Perseus cluster: IC 310, NGC 1265, CR 15 and NGC 1272. These radio galaxies are infalling into the Perseus cluster. We detect distortions in the tail of IC 310 as well as two distinct jets. We report the presence of a global radio filamentary structure associated with the galaxy NGC 1265. Lastly, the radio galaxies CR 15 and NGC 1272 are also resolved in this high-resolution image.

411	Rigid and strongly rigid relations on small domains	Strongly rigid relations play an important role in the study of the complexity of Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) (Feder and Vardi [22], Schaefer [9], Jeavons [23], Bulatov, Jeavons and Krokhin [24], Larose and Tesson [34], Larose [31], Barto and Kozik [36], and Bulatov, Jeavons and Krokhin [27]) which are the subject of intense research in both artificial intelligence and operations research (Russell and Norvig [19]). An n-ary relation r on a set U is strongly rigid if it is preserved only by trivial operations. It is projective if the only idempotent operations in Polr are projections.  Rosenberg (1973) characterized all strongly rigid relations on a set with two elements and found a strongly rigid binary relation on every domain U of at least 3 elements. Larose and Tardif (2001) studied the projective and strongly rigid graphs, and constructed large families of strongly rigid graphs. Łuczak and Nešetˇril (2004) settled in the affirmative a conjecture of Larose and Tardif that most graphs on a large set are projective, and characterized all homogenous graphs that are projective. Łuczak and Nešetˇril (2006) confirmed a conjecture of Rosenberg that most relations on a big set are strongly rigid.  In this thesis we characterize all strongly rigid relations on a set with at least three elements to answer an open question by Rosenberg (1973) (Rosenberg [7], Problem 6 in Rosenberg [13]). We classify the binary relations on the 3-element domain and demonstrate that there are merely 4 pairwise nonisomorphic rigid binary relations on the same domain (among them 2 are pairwise nonisomorphic strongly rigid), and we classify the binary relations on the 4-element domain and show that there are merely 40 pairwise nonisomorphic rigid binary relations on the same domain (among them 25 are pairwise nonisomorphic strongly rigid) (Example 5.4 and Example 6.1 in Sun [41]). We extend a strongly rigid relation on a 4-element domain to any finite domain (Sun [43]). Finally, we give a strongly rigid ternary relation on any finite domain and conjecture a strongly rigid k-ary relation on any finite domain (Sun [42]).

412	Étude d’équations à retard appliquées à la régulation de la production de plaquettes sanguines	The object of this thesis is the study, using mathematical models, of the regulation mechanism maintaining an optimal quantity of blood platelets. The first chapter presents the biological and mathematical context of the thesis. In a second chapter, we introduce a model for platelet production assuming a regulation by the platelet quantity of both the differentiation rate of stem cells to the platelet cell line and the amount of platelets produced by each megakaryocyte. We show that the dynamic of this model corresponds to a delay differential equation x'(t) = −γx(t)+f(x(t))g(x(t−τ)), and we obtain for this equation new sufficient conditions for stability and for the oscillation of solutions. In a third chapter, we analyze a second model for platelet production in which the regulation is continuous through the maturation speed of megakaryocyte progenitors. The stability analysis requires to adapt a pre-existing framework to problems where the bifurcation parameter is not the delay, and allows to show that increasing the death rate of megakaryocyte progenitors leads to the onset of periodic solutions, in agreement with clinical observation of amegakaryocytic cyclical thrombocytopenia. The last chapter covers a differential equation with two delays that appears among others in a model of platelet production which considers that platelet death can both age-independent and age-dependent.	oscillations , platelet , cyclical thrombocytopenia , stability analysis , oscillations , delay , transcendental equation , Hopf bifurcation	en	21745.0
413	« Au secours des petits infirmes » : les enfants handicapés physiques au Québec entre charité et exclusion, 1920-1990	This thesis develops our knowledge of the history of children with physical disabilities in Quebec by analyzing the representations and services offered to this clientele between 1920 and 1990. Camped in the current critical studies on disability, it aims to integrate disability at the heart of the demonstration by postulating the social construction of this category of analysis. Addressing a largely unexplored theme in historiography, it enriches the history of childhood in Quebec, as well as that of education, assistance and health. It is based in part on the model developed by Marie-Claire Cagnolo around the “logics” that have governed the treatment of people with disabilities. This study also relies on a variety of sources, from philanthropic association archives to official documents and government reports. Some silences in history have also been partially filled by interviews with witnesses.   The main hypothesis underlying this thesis is that the place of children with disabilities in the province is determined by a double tension, on one hand between the antagonistic logic of exclusion and integration, and on the other hand between medical sphere and the socio-educational sphere that determine the organization and prioritization of the services offered to this clientele.  The demonstration is structured into six thematic chapters: after a methodological description, chapter two looks at the main actors (philanthropists and governments) with this clientele, chapter three addresses the discourses on young people with disabilities, while the subsequent chapters look at paramedical, educational and finally recreational services for them.   The first services intended specifically for children with physical disabilities in Quebec have been implemented at the turn of the 1920s by women of the bourgeoisie who justified this incursion into the public sphere in the name of maternalism. These philanthropists participate in the movement to defend the rights of “crippled” children on the international scene during the inter-war period. The idea of a hegemonic medical hold in the care of young disabled people, often defended by researchers, is relativized by the predominant role of volunteers and their socio-political engagement, at least until the 1940s.  Three figures emerge from the discursive analysis: the angelic victim, the rehabilitated child-citizen and the monster. The vulnerable “cripple” is part of a paternalistic approach of assistance, which makes the disabled person an object of compassion to arouse the charity of the public. The figure of the useful citizen calls for a logic of reparation and rehabilitation, which provides compensation for the members of the society that are not growing with the same chances as the others. As for the monster, it symbolizes the reaction of communities driven by fear and rejection responding to a logic of elimination or exclusion.  These various logics are also evident in the care of children with disabilities in Quebec, both in terms of the organization of care and in the development of educational or recreational services. The logic of assistance, based on a combination of public and private support and the need to protect children, emerged in the response to polio epidemics from the 1930s to the 1960s, as well as in the operation of special schools or adapted camps. The tragedy of thalidomide marks a turning point in the early 1960s as the federal government’s blatant responsibility leads to the organization and funding of a rehabilitation program, according to a logic of reparation. However, this compensation is addressed to a well-defined category of citizens who have been wronged by state negligence and does not include all children with disabilities. Only a paradigm shift, transforming disability into a collective problem, and no longer individual, will allow the transition from a logic of reparation to that of participation and inclusion. This transition took place between 1970 and 1990, when the government of Quebec guaranteed the services offered, according to a societal logic based on social inclusion and the recognition of young people with disabilities as subjects of rights. These gains remain however fragile, at risk of falling into mechanisms of exclusion.  Far from constituting a linear path leading from stigmatization to full recognition of rights in an inexorable progression, the past of children with disabilities is marked by ups and downs, sudden advances followed by regressions. The pejorative representations of children with disabilities, ranging from degenerate to monster, coexist with more positive images such as the future citizen or the subject of rights, just as the different logics of integration and exclusion coexist throughout history, a duality that still continues today.	assistance , exclusion , Disability , Children with disabilities , History , representations , assistance , philanthropists , education , rehabilitation , integration , exclusion	en	21727.0
414	Les brassages du croire : analyse de nouvelles catégories théologiques pour l’anthropologie du croire à partir de cas hindous-chrétiens	The aim of this dissertation is to problematize Christian way to believe when in contact with other conceptions of spiritual life. Because this religious and spiritual pluralism makes it necessary to renew critically theological appreciation of phenomena such as mixing, transfer or borrowing, three concepts are convened to examine the fundamental question that leads this work: how should the combination – at the outset, by participating in other traditions than those designated as “Christian” or, above all, developing a spiritual and religious dual anchoring – be considered, and be legitimized? On the theoretical level, the history and the validity of the three concepts (bricolage, syncretism, mestizaje), which suffer from a certain confusion in theology, are put under examination. Hybridity, more widespread in the English language, is a concept semantically too multifarious in French (compared to similar concepts), to justify a specific place alongside the other concepts as its meaning somehow encompasses the three of them. The deepening of the anthropology of belief, backed by a spiritual theology centered on discernment, proves particularly fruitful to think these issues. On a methodological level, throughout the work, historical epistemology provides the modality through which the analysis of the different concepts is being undertaken. On a concrete level, in order to illustrate these questions, this work takes its inspiration from experimentations and challenges Christianity in India faced. Concretely, taking as a point of departure the context of the Indian subcontinent, this work examines Indian Christian figures or enterprises engaged in different types of religious transfers (Part I). Then (Part II), specific issues of missiology from Vatican II until now are investigated through four themes (interreligious dialogue, culture, social justice and dialogue with the secular world), from which ten principles are laid out for the three concepts to rely on. This research comes back to the recent theologizing of the spiritual dimension (part 3) where anthropology of believing - which is fundamentally related to what is meant by spiritual life today - helps examining how it is transformed and strengthened not against, but in relation to a world qualified as “non-Christian.” Finally (part 4), the study traces the history and lexical properties of bricolage, syncretism, (hybridity) and mestizaje, in order to evaluate how they allow, each in their own way, to better reflect certain developments (or explorations) of the contemporary Christian spiritual life. The conclusions of this dissertation unveil at least three essential propositions. Primo, that the notion of identity, fundamental when it is shaken up by religious pluralism, can be thought of in a flexible, dynamic and porous way to external influences. These influences have the capacity to enrich more than to threaten an individual’s spiritual life, as opposed to what conservative or fundamentalist discourses suggest – all the more so if concepts related to mixing are well explained. Secondo, that nowadays mission cannot be thought of as an ad extra evangelization only - towards the world – but has to be understood as ad intra as well, emulated by catechesis or conversion, for instance. As Christians are on their way to God, their own evangelization must continue, and may take shape in (or be spiritually stimulated by) the encounter of the other - the non-Christian. Tertio, this work shows the importance of rethinking Christian truth in a dialogical rather than a dialectical way. In the same way, faith which characterizes Christian tradition should be envisaged under the larger idea of believing, more universal and common to any spiritual path, in order to grasp the quest for truth in its true complexity and plurality.	mission chrétienne , bricolage , Religious pluralism , Christian mission , Spiritual life , History of Christianity in India , Mestizaje , Hybridity , Syncretism , Discernment , Historical epistemology	en	21723.0
415	Complexes NCN de Ni(II) et Ni(III) : synthèse, caractérisation et rôle dans le mécanisme de couplage C-O, C-N et C-halogènes	This thesis describes the synthesis, characterization and reactivity of NCN type Ni(II) and Ni(III) pincer complexes. The thesis is divided in three parts. The first discusses the synthesis of a new family of Ni(II) complexes based on the 1,3-bis(pyrazole),5-R-C6H3 ligand (R = H, OMe). Ligand synthesis is executed by Ullman coupling between pyrazole and 1,3-diiodobenzene or 1,3-dibromo,5-methoxy-benzene. Refluxing ligands with nickel precursor {[NiBr2(iPrCN)]}n in the presence of triethylamine leads to the formation of pincer complexes (NCNpz)Ni(II)Br and (MeO-NCNpz)Ni(II)Br by C-H activation (pz = pyrazole). The alkoxide-type Ni(II) complex (NCNpz)Ni(BHT) (BHT = 2,6-t-Bu2-4-Me-OC6H2) is isolated from the reaction between (NCNpz)Ni(II)Br and NaBHT. Oxidation attempts did not lead to the characterization of an authentic Ni(III) species. Reacting bromo complexes with H2O2 leads to the formation of Br-NC(OH)Npz and NC(OH)Npz when starting from (NCNpz)Ni(II)Br and MeO-NC(OH)Npz when starting from (MeO-NCNpz)Ni(II)Br. The aerobic reaction of (NCNpz)Ni(II)Br with different alcohols and amines leads to the functionalization products of the ligand NC(OR)Npz and NC(NR2)Npz.  The second theme is the functionalization of the Cispo-Ni(III) bond in (NCN)Ni(III)Br2. The reaction of (NCN)Ni(III)Br2 with H2O, various alcohols, amines and strong acids leads to the formation of C-O, C-N and C-halogen bonds. A kinetic study shows that Ni(III) displays first order behavior excluding the possibility of a disproportionation reaction between 2 Ni(III) which would lead to a Ni(IV) species. Measurement of an inverse kinetic isotopic effect of 0.47 for the reaction with MeOH/CD3OD indicates a proton transfer arising from one or several pre-equilibria occuring before the rate determining step. The observation of yields of less than 50% for the functionalization reaction indicates a comproportionation reaction between the Ni(I) resulting from the reductive elimination and the starting Ni(III). These observations allow proposition of a mechanism for C-O, C-N and C-halogen bond formation from the (NCN)Ni(III)Br2 complex.  The third part reports the synthesis of new cationic and dicationic NiI(III)complexes starting from (NCN)Ni(III)Br2. In the presence of AgSbF6 and acetonitrile, (NCN)Ni(III)Br2 reacts to give dicationic complex [(NCN)Ni(III)(MeCN)3]2+ in 83% yield. The reaction between (NCN)Ni(III)Br2 and [(NCN)Ni(III)(MeCN)3]2+ leads to the formation of the cationic [(NCN)Ni(III)(Br)(MeCN)]+ with a yield of 84%. These complexes are characterized by X-ray diffraction and electron paramagnetic resonance. Reacting these complexes with MeOH leads to the formation of the functionalized product NC(OMe)N and a cationic divalent nickel complex suggesting a comproportionation between [(NCN)Ni(III)(Br)(MeCN)]+ or [(NCN )Ni(III)(MeCN)3]2+ with the NiI generated by the formation of the C-O bond. Reacting [(NCN)Ni(III)(Br)(MeCN)]+ or [(NCN)Ni(III)(MeCN)3]2+ with MeNH2 leads to the formation of the functionalized product NC(NHMe)N with typical yields of 30%. These low yields are explained by the ability of the ionized Ni(III) complexes to oxidize MeNH2. A comprehensive DFT study highlights the reaction mechanism steps for C-O and C-N bond formation. The first step is the coordination of the substrate with the trivalent metal center. Then deprotonation of MeOH is provided by the pincer’s amine moiety while deprotonation of MeNH2 arises from an outer sphere process. Reductive elimination was found to be the limiting step for C-O and C-N bond formation. The value of the isotopic kinetic effect of 0.62 is also rationalized by a DFT vibrational analysis.

416	Comment l’ancienneté et le degré de résolution de problèmes associé à la tâche modulent-ils l’impact du leadership d’habilitation sur la performance à la tâche ?	This research focuses on the impact of empowerment leadership on task performance, taking into account two moderating variables: the tenure and the degree of problem solving associated with the task. Based on the substitutes for leadership theory, as well as on the job demands-resources theory, it was expected that the contribution of empowerment leadership to performance would be greater when employee tenure was low and problem solving associated with the task of the employee was high. Moderation hypotheses were tested using the answers to questionnaires of 324 employees and their immediate supervisor from 17 organizations working in various sectors. The results of regression analyze indicate a positive and significant link between empowerment leadership and task performance. On the other hand, the anticipated moderation hypotheses are not supported. These results are discussed and implications for theory and practice are stated.

417	The hard problem of prediction for conflict prevention	There is a rising interest in conflict prevention and this interest provides a strong motivation for better conflict forecasting. A key problem of conflict forecasting for prevention is that predicting the start of conflict in previously peaceful countries is extremely hard. To make progress in this hard problem this project exploits both supervised and unsupervised machine learning. Specifically, the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model is used for feature extraction from 3.8 million newspaper articles and these features are then used in a random forest model to predict conflict. We find that several features are negatively associated with the outbreak of conflict and these gain importance when predicting hard onsets. This is because the decision tree uses the text features in lower nodes where they are evaluated conditionally on conflict history, which allows the random forest to adapt to the hard problem and provides useful forecasts for prevention.		en	21631.0
418	A longitudinal investigation of sleep and daytime wakefulness in children and youth with concussion	A high proportion of adults who sustain a concussion identify changes in their sleep during the acute stage, typically reporting an increased need for sleep or nonrestful sleep. Our understanding of sleep following concussion is less well understood within a pediatric population. In this study, we investigated the trajectory of sleep and daytime sleepiness in a prospective cohort of 40 children and youth (6–18 years old) with concussion, 40 age-and sex-matched healthy children and youth, and 40 with upper-extremity orthopedic injury. Evaluations occurred during the acute stage (<2 weeks) and at 3-, 6-, and 12-month postinjury using the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children and the Postconcussion Symptom Scale. There were no significant differences within- or between-group differences in sleep across all four time points with analysis of the groups as a whole. When groups were divided by age (6–11 and 12– < 18 years), there was a significant difference in the ability to initiate sleep for the younger concussed group during the acute stage, compared with healthy controls, as well as significantly greater daytime nap duration that decreased over time. Significant correlations were also found between the frequency and duration of daytime naps and Postconcussion Symptom Scale total score and subscores (cognitive, physical/migraine, mood, and sleep) in the concussed group during the acute stage. Our results suggest that in a group with noncomplicated concussion, children and youth have transient alterations in daytime sleepiness that are related to concussion symptoms. Younger children may be more vulnerable to disturbances in sleep and daytime wakefulness.	Concussion , Sleep , Daytime wakefulness , Longitudinal , Children , Youth	en	21626.0
419	Negotiating insecurity? : a comparative study of collective bargaining in retail food in Canada, Germany, Sweden and the United States	Risk refers to the economic uncertainties encountered by workers. These include how forms of wage instability, scheduling uncertainty, and the erosion of traditional employee benefit structures are negatively affecting their material welfare and ability to plan for the future.  This thesis speaks to scholarly debates on the nature and causes of worker risk. It does so by exploring the evolution of risks in unionised workplaces. This is achieved in two ways. First, the study seeks to provide insights on the nature of risk trends in unionised settings over time. Second, it explores the impacts of actor strategies (unions, employers, states) on risk outcomes in collective bargaining across different organisational and institutional settings.  This thesis develops a novel theoretical framework for understanding risk, incorporating three dimensions (generosity, individualisation, and segmentation). Each dimension adds value to the exploration of risks over time in the organisations under investigation. Different literatures are also mobilised to examine how, in different contexts (organisational and institutional) and with different actors and their attributes (power), actor strategies shape outcomes across these three dimensions.  Contextualised case-studies were conducted for this study. This thesis investigates experiences in retail food – a sector and industry typically associated with work practices that drive economic insecurity. The research design entails a longitudinal (1980-2016) comparison of eight supermarket chains (cases) in two liberal market economics (Canada and the United States) and two coordinated market economies (Germany and Sweden).  The thesis is structured in three overview chapters (research question, theoretical approaches, operationalisation), three separate articles presenting different aspects of the research findings, and an analytical overview chapter discussing key results in the context of the broader literature and with regard to their implications.  Several contributions stem from these findings. First, this thesis demonstrates how risks have not only increased across the chains, but that these increases differ in their form and intensity across three dimensions. These differences have implications for how we measure risks and explain their trajectories. Second, this thesis finds that actor strategies matter to risk, yet that their outcomes can only be understood in relation to contextual variables. It also points to the importance of union power to the effectiveness of these strategies in mitigating the risks experienced by workers in these different organisational and institutional contexts.

420	En marge de l’histoire : le traitement du passé dans trois romans québécois contemporains	This thesis focuses on the representation of the «past tense» in three contemporary Quebec novels, La constellation du lynx by Louis Hamelin, Pourquoi Bologne by Alain Farah and Jonas de mémoire by Anne Élaine Cliche. These narratives share an obsession for the past that drives the narrators to investigate problematic and unknown episods that the texts explore while keeping it at a distance. The structure of these texts creates and maintains this gap with the past whose access is always indirect. The analysis of narration and narrators shows how these varying degrees of distance remain dynamic. These novels install also a distance in their uses of the past with the step back they take from established facts and preconceived ideas. The explored past is interpreted and transformed by fiction that proposes a rereading of it. The hypothesis of this thesis, based on « sociocritique », questions the role of fiction and its ability to reveal aspects of the past that remain unattainable to other research fields, especially to History who seeks to eliminate subjectivity.

421	"Le tatouage contemporain : vecteur d’identité 
ou artefact de consommation?"	The aim of this dissertation is to uncover the motivations by which individuals have decided to permanently mark their bodies with particular motives capable of defining their identity in the same way as their individuality. These reasons, however, are subject to inflections of trends and modes conveyed in the media. In the last 20 years, tattoo has gone subtly from a brand of rebellion and originality to a standardized brand associated with youth and fashion. In this thesis, we have tried, by interviewing a dozen people from various backgrounds and having lived this mutation, to understand the reasons for having these tattoos as well as the changes of perception on the phenomenon. Thus, based on various theories including the Goffmanian theory of self-staging, David Le Breton's theory of identity-making and Bauman's vision of consumerism, we can partially explain the phenomenon.

422	Kant and Lévinas on the problem of theodicy	In his article of 1982 “The Useless Suffering” Lévinas writes that his interpretation of the story of Job in the Old Testament is in agreement with the reading offered by Kant in his essay of 1791 on “theodicy.” For the two authors indeed every attempt at showing that a divine justice is at work in the events of the world is doomed to fail, or more precisely: to be contradicted by the facts. The question of theodicy must on the contrary be addressed from a strictly moral point of view. And this question provides a special opportunity to stress the profound differences between Kant’s and Lévinas’ ethics: on the one hand, honesty with oneself, and on the other hand, care for the other.

423	Der Phänomenologiebegriff bei Kant und Reinhold	In this paper I study the sources of Reinhold’s concept of phenomenology introduced in his Beyträge zur leichteren Übersicht des Zustandes der Philosophie… of 1802. Kant renounces to take up Lambert’s definition of phenomenology, which amounts to a theory of illusion (Schein). At the time of the Dissertation (1770) as well as in the Metaphysische Anfangsgründe der Naturwissenschaft (1786) he prefers to define phenomenology as a doctrine of appearances (Erscheinungen). Reinhold for his part integrates both definitions in his conception of phenomenology and assigns to it the task of tracing how illusion operates through the world appearances.

424	Développement cognitif des enfants épileptiques : contribution du stress	Epilepsy is a neurodevelopmental disorder with an onset mainly during childhood, and is linked to life-long cognitive deficits. In this article, we suggest that stress could negatively influence the cognitive development in children suffering from epilepsy. The object of this article is to present two explanations that are complementary and cumulative regarding the link between stress and cognitive development in epileptic children and to review the current knowledge regarding them. First, stress influences seizures’ frequency and severity, which influences cognitive development. Secondly, stress causes cognitive deficits which might be added to the cognitive deficits caused by seizures.	Convulsions , Stress , Epilepsy , Seizure , Stress , Anxiety , Hippocampus	en	21494.0
425	Effets de la consommation de l’alpha-glycérylphosphorylcholine sur la performance physique chez des joueurs (ses) de volleyball universitaire	Recent data suggest alpha-glycerophosphatidylcholine (a-GPC), a choline donor, could contribute to an increase in physical performance. The experimental study VolleyAGPC is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial aimed at evaluating the ergogenic potential of a-GPC in elite volleyball players. We hypothesized that chronic supplementation with a-GPC could improve vertical jump performance. To verify this, countermovement jump (CMJ) performance was assessed in female (n=14) and male (n=13) varsity athletes using bilateral force platforms before and after 28 days of either a-GPC (1000 mg/day) or placebo administration (randomized attribution). In a second phase of the study, after a one-week washout period, placebo and a-GPC conditions were reversed. Training load, wellness and adverse effects were monitored daily using an online survey while choline and a-GPC rich food items intake was assessed weekly. Data showed that a-GPC supplementation did not affect indices of wellness in athletes nor did it associate with adverse effects as compared to placebo. Men performed significantly better than women on all CMJ jumping variables that were analyzed. Peak power and impulse were improved over the course of the study in both sexes. However, the rate of force development during the eccentric braking phase of the CMJ were only improved in women. Importantly supplementation with a-GPC did not affect any of the jump variables that were evaluated. In conclusion, 4 weeks of daily a-GPC supplementation was safe but did not lead to beneficial effects on vertical jumping performances in elite volleyball players.

426	La dramaturgie vocale : approche herméneutique des qualités expressives de la voix chantée. Le cas du metal symphonique	The voice has expressive abilities that add semantic content to the vocalized message. These abilities, called phonostyles, are connected to connotations and representations – a vocal imaginary – that enable us to understand who is speaking and his/her emotional state, without needing to see the speaker. The same phenomenon occurs in the singing voice: phonostylistic analysis reveals the appearance of vocal personae and their emotional state during the song. The vocal imaginary ensures that each vocal style has its own imaginary. Symphonic metal is a favorable field for the analysis of expressive vocal qualities, because it contains eclectic vocal styles: operatic, pop, heavy, and growl. This thesis aims to study how the voice is used in a corpus chosen within the symphonic metal repertoire in order to understand how what I call the vocal dramaturgy is created during a song. Vocal dramaturgy is the creation of a song’s own imaginary through the means of the voice and the semantic contents it adds to the sung text, such as the invention of vocal personae and the transmission of emotions experienced by these personae, as well as the interactions between them.	vocal dramaturgy , singing voice , symphonic metal , vocal imaginary , phonostylistic analysis , hermemeutic	en	21472.0
427	Fichte, Schleiermacher Y W. Von Humboldt, sobre la creación de la universidad de Berlín	On the eve of the foundation of the University of Berlin, Wilhelm von Humboldt was in charge of choosing between the various proposals submitted for the organization of the future institution. Since he had to choose for instance between the Fichte’s and Schleiermacher’s proposals, he retained the project of the latter, feeling closer to Schleiermacher’s liberal approach than with Fichte’s more ‘authoritarian’ views. In fact, the profound difference between Humboldt and Fichte is to be found in their respective conception of the ‘vocation of man’. For Humboldt the human being has to develop his/her own unique personality through the process of “Bildung”, whereas for Fichte the ultimate aim of human beings is to reach a point of perfection in which all individuals would be identical. This fundamental divergence has consequences on all aspects of the project: curriculum, student life and pedagogy.

428	Les triangles sphériques et le paradoxe des objets non congruents	Kant has been concerned with the problem of incongruent counterparts at different moments in his career: for instance in his 1768 article on the directions in space, in his Dissertation of 1770 and in the Prolegomena (1783). The purpose of this article is to demonstrate that 1) the example of the spherical ‘scalene’ triangles is the only one (thus excluding the isosceles and equilateral triangles) that can support Kant’s argument about the intrinsic character of the difference between two similar but nevertheless incongruent spherical triangles, 2) that what is here philosophically at stake is Wolff’s erroneous conception of “similarity” in geometry, and 3) that Kant’s thesis on the intrinsic nature of the difference between incongruent counterparts in space remains valid for his conception of space as “absolute” in 1768 as well as for his view of space as an a priori formal condition of the possibility of experience in 1783.

429	"Kant et les conditions ""conditionnées"" de la possibilité de l’expérience"	The aim of this paper is to set out some features of Kant’s conception of transcendental philosophy. I would like to argue that this philosophy, although it is situated at a higher level of discourse than common knowledge, does not essentially transcend the limits that it sets to this knowledge. In order to achieve this, I stress the fact that Kant regards experience as a mere “possibility.” Now, the Critique of Pure Reason explains that the human understanding cannot conceive of an absolute possibility, but only a relative one, namely a possibility that is tied to conditions. And possible experience as a whole is no exception here. Hence the expression “conditions of the possibility of experience” which designates the topic of the Transcendental Analytic. This also means that experience is “contingent” (A 737/B 765). It is not in itself necessary; rather, it is dependent upon certain conditions. But then we learn that the most important transcendental conditions for this experience, i.e., the dynamic principles, are themselves “contingent” (A 160/B 199). Consequently, these transcendental conditions are not unconditioned; they in turn depend on empirical conditions, over which they have no control.

430	Développement et mise à l’essai de récits audio dans une activité de réflexion collective avec des infirmières accompagnant des jeunes mères ayant vécu de la maltraitance	INTRODUCTION: A significant proportion of young mothers in early childhood intervention programs have experienced childhood trauma. Nurses do not always feel supported, nor competent, to approach this topic with them. When used in a collective reflection activity, digital stories have been identified as relevant tools to support nurses in their practice. However, the development of these devices and their actual use remain poorly described. AIM: This report describes the development of digital stories and their utilization in a collective reflection activity with nurses in an early intervention program. METHOD: Two digital stories were created with reference to Fraiberg's (1975) work with young mothers who have experienced childhood trauma. A period of immersion with the team of nurses in their daily activities allowed a contextualized approach to recruit credible informants, conduct separate narrative interviews with a nurse and a young mother, and write two short stories. Five nurses participated in a collective reflection activity based on a reflective practice framework (Rolfe, 2011), the course of which was recorded iteratively to ensure ongoing support and co-supervision of the group facilitator. FINDINGS: Upon hearing the voice of a young mother and recognizing themselves in the short story of a nurse, participants shared repressed emotions, started to describe their own practice and engaged in a critique of the conditions that shape their professional practice. Initiating a dialogue on a sensitive and silenced issue, the conversation highlighted nurses’ emotional laboring. Reflective practice was essential to develop group facilitator skills that were supportive to initiate collective reflection and analysis. CONCLUSION: Theories are valuable tools to create digital story devices that have the power to initiate group mediated reflections on sensitive and unacknowledged issues. This project reveals that nurses in early childhood intervention programs could readily pursue further engagement in reflective practice with their peers on this generally unspoken topic; and that further attention is required to support emotional competence development so that nurses feel prepared to hear the voices of young women with a childhood history of abuse and neglect.	digital stories , primary care nurses , collective reflection , childhood maltreatment , young mothers , emotional laboring , emotional competency , early intervention program	en	21405.0
431	Perception des cliniciens, gestionnaires et usagers à l’égard des interventions de groupe offertes pendant la réadaptation en déficience physique	Introduction: The demand for physical rehabilitation services in auditory, language, motor or visual impairment is growing. Concerned about the access and the efficiency of the services, rehabilitation settings are called upon to increasingly offer group interventions. Objectives: The first objective of this study is to examine the facilitators and barriers to the implementation of group interventions in rehabilitation. The second objective is to explore the perception of clinicians, managers and patients of issues related to quality of care, costs and the achievement of goals during those interventions. Methodology: A multiple case study design was used. Clinicians and managers from five rehabilitation centres in the Montreal area were consulted using an online questionnaire (n = 162) and focus groups. Individual interviews were conducted with patients who participated in group interventions. Descriptive and quantitative statistics were performed for the results of the questionnaire. The qualitative data were grouped by themes and triangulated with the results of the questionnaire. Results: Key facilitators include patient’s interest, potential for influence among participants, and recognition of the value of these interventions. The main obstacles are schedule management, time required for reasonning and planning the interventions and having a critical mass of patients which is sometimes insufficient to form groups. Regarding the second objective, group interventions are perceived as safe. They should be offered for profit rather than for financial reasons and be linked to the achievement of patient goals. They must also be offered as a complement to individual interventions. Conclusion: Group interventions provide many benefits. A better understanding of the perceptions of key actors will facilitate their implementation as well as their sustainability. Recommendations are proposed to help managers and clinicians plan services and at thus maximize benefits for patients.

432	Criblage génétique et caractérisation fonctionnelle des mutations dans le gène CHD2 associé à l’épilepsie dans un modèle de poisson zèbre	Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological diseases worldwide affecting more than 50 million people. Although medical research unravelled the genetic basis of some epilepsies, the majority of cases remains unexplained. A particular form of epileptic encephalopathies with photosensitivity has recently been associated with the CHD2 gene. In order to better understand the role of CHD2 in epilepsy, we screened epileptic patients for pathogenic variants and we characterized the functional effect of newly discovered genetic variations in a zebrafish model. Overall, we sequenced the CHD2 gene in a total of 1959 epileptic patients, including 95 photosensitive, and reported 37 new genetic variations potentially damaging in various types of epilepsy. We demonstrated in vitro that a silent mutation found in a photosensitive epileptic patient affects the splicing of the gene and leads to the introduction of a premature stop codon, suggesting a partial loss of function of the protein. We then showed in situ that the chd2 gene is expressed in the brain of zebrafish, and could be knocked down in this model using a Morpholino (MO). Zebrafish injected with MO presented a curved morphological phenotype, as well as a reduced lifetime. Then we showed that injection of the wild-type human CHD2 gene resulted in a significant rescue of this abnormal phenotype. Subsequently, we injected different mutant copies of the human CHD2 gene to characterize genetic variations identified in our cohort. Only one of these did not significantly save the phenotype. In order to study the effect of a complete inactivation of chd2, we established a stable line of zebrafish that do not express this gene, using the CRISPR-Cas9 technique. We are the first to knockout chd2 in zebrafish, and will continue using this transgenic line to better understand the role of this gene in epilepsy. Although our results are preliminary, we showed in a zebrafish model that a new genetic variation in CHD2 could cause epilepsy.

433	The Role of Cardiotrophin-Like Cytokine Factor 1 on the Development of Atherosclerosis	Metabolic syndrome represents a major global health problem. Its rate is constantly increasing. Cardiovascular diseases emerging from dyslipidemia conditions are a worldwide leading cause of death and morbidity, despite extensive medical research and wide range of drugs targeting atherosclerosis, obesity, diabetes etc.  Recent findings suggest the existence and persistence of low-grade inflammation in pathogenesis atherosclerosis and obesity. The “symbiosis” between metabolic and immune system is substantial and any perturbation contribute to the development of altered metabolic conditions that ultimately culminate in such disorders as obesity and atherosclerosis. The overall goal of my Master internship was to characterise the effect of cardiotrophin-like cytokine factor 1 on development of atherosclerosis and validate a long half-life derivative of cardiotrophin-like cytokine factor 1 coupled with Fc fragment of immunolglobulin G. Cardiotrophin-like cytokine factor 1 is a cytokine of the immune system with immunoregulatory activity. Cardiotrophin-like cytokine factor 1 belongs to the interleukin 6 family of monomeric cytokines. Cardiotrophin-like cytokine factor 1 is efficiently secreted in the presence of cytokine receptor like factor 1, a soluble cytokine receptor. Cardiotrophin-like cytokine 1 possesses neurotrophic activities mediated through the receptor of ciliary neurotrophic factor. Cardiotrophin-like cytokine factor 1 is a high affinity ligand for sortilin. Genome-wide association studies indicated that plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and cardiovascular disease are associated with single nucleotide polymorphisms variants regulating sortilin expression. It was observed that cardiotrophin-like cytokine factor 1 binds and activates transfectants co-expressing sortilin and receptor of leukemia inhibitory factor. Both receptors are expressed by myeloid cells and leukemia inhibitory factor is a potent inducer of anti-inflammatory M2 macrophage differentiation.  The overall objective was to investigate if the interaction of cardiotrophin-like cytokine factor 1 or cardiotrophin-like cytokine factor 1 coupled with Fc fragment of immunoglobulin G with atherosclerotic plaque macrophages will reduce the foam cell formation and development of plaque. Our work shows that cardiotrophin-like cytokine 1 expression in mice on LDLR-/- atherosclerosis model does not decrease the development of plaque. However, some results revealed a significant contribution of cardiotrophin-like cytokine factor 1 in gain of body mass without changes in food intake.

434	La responsabilité civile du psychiatre lors du suicide d’un patient : une perspective canadienne	"The psychiatrist, as an expert, is frequently asked to assess the suicide risk presented by a patient. Therefore, he may have his liability engaged and so, could be sued in the event of the death of the patient. Thus, although a large number of suicide risk assessment and management tools have been developed, the practice is still not standardized. Hence, this research aims to propose a reflection on the prevention of suicide and more specifically, on the responsibility of the psychiatrist. As a first step, we wish to present the phenomenon of suicide regarding epidemiological data and etiology, among other things. Next, we focus on the assessment of the suicide risk and what are the challenges related. In the third section, we expose the tools that can support practitioners in this evaluation process and discuss their relevance. Finally, referring to Canadian court decisions, we explore the issue of the civil responsibility of the practitioner. Our research shows that most of the decisions are in favor of the psychiatrist, considering that the absence of scientific agreement on a single and optimal practice makes it difficult to qualify the psychiatrist’s practice as reprehensible. Thus, if a ""standardization"" of practice would undoubtedly be well greeted, it seems unlikely in the near future as suicide is a particularly complex social phenomenon."

435	La problématique de la responsabilité pénale des enfants impliqués dans les actes terroristes de Boko Haram au Cameroun	In Cameroonian criminal law, as well as in international criminal law, there is no clear and specific legal framework for the question of the criminal responsibility of children involved in terrorist acts. On one hand, the legal status of these children is not unanimous in criminal law. On the other hand, the Jihadist group Boko Haram, located in Northeast Nigeria, regularly uses children to carry out terrorist attacks on Cameroonian soil. Regarding such situation, we wonder whether the criminal responsibility of these children may be engaged. The answer to this question is not obvious and may lie in the degree of perception of the concept of child in criminal law, which makes it difficult to implement the criminal responsibility of terrorist children and the issue of impunity for terrorist acts involving children. In the first chapter, the author analyses the factors that may make it difficult or uncertain to implement such criminal responsibility and tries, in the second chapter, to consider the solutions to fill such gaps.

436	"Expériences négatives d'accouchements décrites par des femmes ayant accouché en 
milieux hospitalier : les liens avec le concept des violences obstétricales"	"The purpose of this qualitative exploratory research is to better understand negative experiences of childbirth from a women’s perspective by analyzing their descriptions of events and to then explore whether a relationship can be made with the emerging concept of obstetric violence (OV). In order to achieve this, I conducted semi-structured interviews with eight women who have had negative experiences of childbirth. Following a literature review, I developed a new definition of obstetric violence and proceeded with an attempt to operationalize the concept. The characteristics of this concept are divided into three main categories and two cross-cutting categories : pathologization of childbirth, dehumanization and lack of consent. The two cross-cutting categories are : medical protocols and medicine not based on evidence. While I found that women participating in the study do not use the term ""obstetric violence"" in reference to their negative experiences of childbirth, what they describe is consistent with key characteristics and indicators of obstetric violence used in this research and resulting from the literature review on the subject. I recommend that research on obstetric violence be continued to ascertain its prevalence and also to include a greater diversity of experiences. I also recommend implementing the Mother and Baby Friendly Birth Facility (MBFBF) initiative as a tool to prevent this systemic violence. I conclude that a paradigm shift is needed to put women and birthing people at the heart of the decision-making process of childbirth."

437	Conception et mise en œuvre d’un dispositif de formation innovant pour l’intégration des TICE dans les pratiques enseignantes : étude de cas, enseignants stagiaires des mathématiques du CRMEF Souss-Massa, 2015-2016	"The ambition to train teachers in practices of integrating new technologies into mathematics classes, led us to review the current contexts of such a practice, and to question the environments and pedagogical paradigms associated with the current forms of trainings in new technologies in Morocco. Hence, we reacted to the problem by developing a project of designing and implementing a training system called ""CollabEF"". This system was tested through courses for the benefit of teacher trainees of Mathematics at the CRMEF Souss-Massa (Regional Centre for the Education and Training Professions), during the training year 2015-2016. Individual interviews were conducted at the end of the training. As for the data analysis, we used descriptive statistics, Principal Correspondence Analysis (PCA) and Component Factor Analysis (CFA). From these analyses, it appeared that the majority of the participants favorably appreciated the training, and that the positive points stated by the trainees were, as a whole, acquisition of skills related to the integration of the ""GeoGebra"" tool in their professional practices. Thus, an appropriate innovation of the current training regarding the integration of ICT could make the perceptions of the teacher trainees more favorable towards this practice and consequently to the appropriation of the new technologies in their profession. The major conclusion of our study is that the use of scientific and technological innovations in the field of education and training, allows us to overcome the difficulties constrain the training in the integration of ICT in Morocco to make those innovation more effective."

438	Kantian Enlightenment as a critique of culture	It is puzzling to notice that in his 1784 essay on Enlightenment, Kant addresses every human being with his watchword « Have the courage to use your own understanding! », while at the same time he seems to restrict the access to the public discussion of matters of common interest to the learned persons (Gelehrte). This begs the question: Is the participation in the public debate part and parcel of Kant’s conception of Aufklärung? A positive answer to this question is given by Katerina Deligiorgi in her Kant and the Culture of Enlightenment. A critical assessment of this book will lead us however to consider that Kant has a differentiated approach to enlightenment depending on whether someone is educated or uneducated. Following Rousseau, Kant has come to recognize as a matter of fact this inequality toward the products of culture. Now the two-level conception of enlightenment entailed by this inequality becomes explicit in the 1790s, especially in the very last work Kant has published: The Conflict of the Faculties (1798).

439	Polarized partisanship in Turkey	A vast literature demonstrates that partisanship has a stabilizing impact on politics, as it limits electoral volatility. Recent studies have also shown that polarization increases partisanship; as parties differ more in their policy positions, they become more visible and citizens identify themselves more with a political party. Polarization thus leads to partisanship, and partisanship stabilizes the politics. While multiple studies have already tested the application of party identification outside the US, less is known about the implications of party identification in polarized non-consolidated democracies. Focusing on Turkey, this study investigates partisanship in a highly polarized context by means of data from the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems, modules 3 and 4. The results suggest that Turkey, after decades of electoral instability, has been stabilized with an increase in partisanship. However, this research also finds that high polarization in Turkey is associated with more biased perceptions of short-term factors. This study draws normative implications about partisanship in light of democratic theory.	voting behavior , party identification , polarization , vote , Turkey	en	21320.0
440	Influence de la température sur les mouvements précoces chez l’opossum Monodelphis domestica	Changes in external temperature are detected by nerve fibres located in the skin and mucosae that express thermosensitive receptors. In mammals, thermosensation is mostly studied in mature animals and little is known about its development. We use the newborn opossum as a model of study to asses if thermosensation is functional at early stages of development, using in vitro preparations of brainstem and spinal cord where both facial skin and forelimbs (FL) were kept. Like other marsupials, newborn opossums are very immature at birth, but must climb on the mother’s belly to find a teat where they attach. Stimulations consisted of puff ejections of liquids at cold, neutral and hot temperatures directed towards the face, and FL responses were observed visually under a microscope or triceps activity was recorded in electromyography. Cold temperatures always induced FL or muscular responses, but neutral and hot temperatures were less potent to do so. Sections of the trigeminal nerve and spinal cord showed that thermal responses are at least partially mediated through the trigeminal nerve. Facial skin removal abolished FL responses to hot and neutral stimulation, but only decreased those to cold temperature. Immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR suggest that TRPM8, the main receptor involved in cold sensation in adult mammals, is not expressed in opossum at birth. Overall the present study demonstrates that the newborn opossum is sensitive to temperature, but mostly to cold and that this sensation is not mediated by TRPM8.

441	How do parents of a child with cancer perceive their psychosocial needs from cancer diagnosis to remission? : a systematic review of qualitative data	Introduction: To improve psychosocial care, it is imperative to focus on the needs of parents, based on their own opinions and experiences. Objectives: This systematic review of the literature and thematic synthesis aims to: (1) identify the different categories of psychosocial needs reported by parents (2) isolate the unmet needs of parents, and (3) analyze the relationship between reported needs and the moment of the trajectory. We selected qualitative and mixed studies on the psychosocial needs of parents in pediatric oncology in PUBMED, EMBASE, CINAHL and PsycINFO databases. To select studies and extract methodological data for the thematic synthesis, we used the Consolidated criteria for qualitative research - COREQ tool (Tong, Sainsbury, & Craig, 2007). Results: We identified 102 studies with these criteria, of which 18 were synthesized in Nvivo 11 with line-by-line coding and thematic analysis of study results. This analysis revealed five categories of unmet needs: 1) social; 2) relational; 3) emotional; 4) displacement; 5) informational. Parents' unmet needs related to 1) lack of family and social support; 2) difficult relationship with the healthcare team; 3) ineffective coping with cancer; 4) ineffective communication about cancer; 5) difficult transition from hospital to home. These reported needs were present at all stages of the cancer trajectory, except for the need for support during the return home after the end of treatment. The thematic synthesis also identified the following themes of improvement suggestions for psychosocial care based on parental opinion: 1) strengthening relationships with family and community; 2) investing in a positive relationship with parents; 3) helping manage emotions and the practical aspects of the disease; 4) helping with the transition to the home; 5) giving information about cancer. Conclusion: This systematic review presents parents’ unmet psychosocial needs and their suggestions about how the psychosocial care they receive could be improved, based on their own unmet needs. Parental opinions about their care are the base for the social validity of psychosocial care.	Parents’ psychosocial unmet needs , Thematic synthesis , Psychosocial care	en	21310.0
442	Prédire la renonciation à la libération conditionnelle dans le système correctionnel provincial du Québec	In the Quebec correctional system, parole-eligible inmates are automatically summoned to a parole board hearing unless they waive their right to the hearing. Every year, almost half of all eligible inmates waive this right, but correctional authorities do not know why. The purpose of this study was to identify the provincial inmates in Quebec who are likely to waive their right to a parole hearing. The Quebec correctional services provided us with administrative data on all parole-eligible inmates in 2014-2015 (N = 3 675). These data included sociodemographic information as well as criminal and correctional records. We selected a subpopulation of offenders who were assessed with the LS/CMI during the sentence they served in 2014-2015 (N = 2 579). Next, we performed logistic regressions, first while isolating non-Indigenous men, non-Indigenous women, and Indigenous men, and then while merging them. Findings indicated that the predictors of parole waiving vary according to sex and ethnicity. However, the probation officer's recommendation for the inmate's release was an important predictor for the three examined subgroups. Indigenous men were also significantly more likely to give up their right to a parole hearing than non-Indigenous men (Exp(B) = 2.234) or women (Exp(B) = 2.073), even when other factors were controlled for. This suggests the presence of structural problems that prompt Indigenous men to forego the possibility of a discretionary release. Possible explanations are proposed for our results, practical implications are discussed, and recommendations are offered to correctional authorities.

443	Using electroencephalograms to interpret and monitor the emotions	The long journey of technology has totally changed human’s life: human stepped on the moon, Mars rovers2 are discovering the Mars, computers are one inseparable part of our lives and in the health section, people live longer, there are treatments for lots of sicknesses. Also, scientists have studied human’s emotion and tried to detect their emotions based on different parameters such as facial expression, speech and intonation, electrical response, verbal communication. These methods work based on the effect of human emotions on body and behavior, but the emotion is not the only parameter that effect on body and attitudes of people. Additionally, people could pretend, hide their emotions and control their body and reactions, also, people with a limit on their body movement will reduce the accuracy of correct recognition of emotion. Researchers found a direct relation between emotions and brain activities, people or limit in body movement could not reduce the certainty of detected emotion.  We used EEG (Electroencephalogram) to create a tool called Emotimap that detects current emotion, monitor emotional evolution in real-time, also detects the general emotion. Current emotion is brief and strong, emotions that people feel again any emotional factor and general emotion is the emotion that engages people for a long time. Emotimap uses formulas to calculate the Arousal and Valence of people then ignore unstabled feels and maps the result on the two dimensions Russel’s Circumplex diagram to detect the emotions.  We asked 20 people to participate in an experimentation in which they faced up with different emotional factors in an isolated Virtual Reality (VR) to observe and save the information of emotional factor and their reactions. The results show participants have felt exactly what was expected with the rate of 37.73% when the metric distance is just 1.55%, metric distance is the proximity of felt and expected emotions (smaller number shows the more similarity). Comparing different formulas shows the most similar equations goes to formulas with the same number of sensors using 𝛽 and 𝛽low with the rate of 40% of similarity, with metric distance in range of 20% to 60%. This is because some equations detect emotions sooner and some others are more strong in picks amplitude. In detaile, equation with 𝛽high detects an emotion a little bit sooner then a equation with 𝛽low, also, formulas with twelve sensors chase the EEG amplitude changes very weak when equation with four sensors are more sensible in picks, and the formulas with two sensors are the most sensible. Comparing the similarity of the participant reactions with their similarity of charactristics based on Big 5 test shows that the effect of memories is more stronger than the effect of their charactristic. Analysing the result shows Emotionap could successfully detect general emotion of participant with the rate of 95%.	AI , Emotion , EEG , VR , IA , RV	en	21285.0
444	L’écriture autofictionnelle dans La carte et le territoire de Michel Houellebecq et L’été de la vie de J.M. Coetzee	Having become one of the pioneering genres in contemporary and ultra-contemporary literature, legitimized and favoured by numerous writers, autofiction takes various forms. Michel Houellebecq, in La Carte et le territoire (2010), and J.M. Coetzee, in Summertime (2009), explore an original subgenre of autofiction : autofiction spéculaire, based on the concept introduced by Vincent Colonna. We are proposing a reading of the two novels that situates them in this stream, namely through the use of the processes of mise en abyme (literally, “placed into abyss”) and metalepsis. In their respective novels, Houellebecq and Coetzee are given the status of characters. They use two rare processes: third-person autofiction through the viewpoint of fictional characters and they depict their own death. They thus create a game through which they seek, not without irony and through fiction, to recreate their own public image and, beyond which, to influence their place in the literary world. The interpretation of fictional processes of self-recreation reveals the role played by the author’s characters and the effect on the reader of their successive representations during the narrative. The comparative exploration of the two novels uses the notions of character-effect and posture in order to understand Houellebecq and Coetzee’s intentions. Lastly, the discussion on the autofiction spéculaire reveals a game of mirrors and reflections developed by Houellebecq and Coetzee so that they can represent themselves as writers – one as a great author and the other as a Nobel prize winner – compared to their depiction of a real man without any qualities which they enjoy portraying.

445	Co-analyse de la reconstruction du savoir-évaluer d’enseignants formés à l’étranger en situation d’intégration socioprofessionnelle au Québec : une recherche collaborative	The schools in Quebec have more and more internationally educated teachers (MELS, 2014), seen as inspiring models for immigrant students (Wang, 2003) and mediators between school and families immigrants (Cruickshank, 2004). One of the greatest challenges of their socioprofessional integration concerns the adjustment of their assessment skills to the norms and values which are aimed ensure success of the largest number of students in Quebec. This is so because they have evolved in a context where evaluation serves to sanction and select the best. An analysis of recent literature review shows that the question of adjusting learning assessment practices of migrant teachers has been neglected so far (Morrissette et al., 2014, Niyubahwe et al., 2013). Thus, this thesis aims to highlight how migrant teachers reconstruct their assessment skills in Quebec schools. In this perspective, it bases on Schön's work (1983) on the (re)construction of the practitioner's repertoire of actions as well as on a socioconstructivist perspective that leads us to consider that this transformation of the repertoire takes place in the center of the interactions in working situation. This thesis is part of a research that focuses more broadly on the socio-professional integration of teachers trained outside of Quebec, who work in Montreal schools (Morrissette & Demazière, CRSH 2015-2017) and from which data collected through biographical interviews and group analysis with 5 immigrant teachers and members of their professional ecology. The analysis follows the strategy of case-based reasoning (Becker, 2016), leading to the description of two adaptive processes of reconstruction of the assessment skills: the abandonment of the non-operative ways of evaluating and the adjustment of the transversal ways of evaluating in two contexts. The second register of analysis mobilizes the perspective of the interactionist sociology of Abbott's professional groups (1988, 2003). This new theoretical perspective leads to highlighting the labor code in the area of assessment of learning, which is the object of ongoing negotiations among all the actors of the schools in Montreal.

446	Building a validity argument for the listening component of the Test de connaissance du français in the context of Quebec immigration	Language testing is a ubiquitous practice in immigration contexts used as a data collection procedure to assess immigrants’ ability to communicate in the language of the host country to promote social as well as economic integration and productivity in the workplace (McNamara & Shohamy, 2008). Unlike English tests, little attention has been directed to the interpretation and uses of scores from French proficiency tests, which prompts – indeed, requires – validation research to justify test use. Drawing on advances in test validity theory (Kane, 2006, 2013), this study builds a validity argument for the listening component of the Test de connaissance du français (TCF) in the context of Quebec immigration. Test validity theory has evolved considerably since the traditional tripartite model of content, predictive and construct components (Cronbach & Meehl, 1955), have been conceptualized as a unitary construct (Messick, 1989) and more recently have been theorized in terms of argumentation (Kane, 2006, 2013), borrowing concepts from models of inference (Toulmin [1958], 2003), which include scoring, generalization, explanation, extrapolation and decision inferences that play key roles in a validity argument. In an argument-based approach to validity, claims about testing instruments are composed of warrants that must be supported by backings in the form of empirical studies, which are foundational for the claims, but also support the inferences that authorize each of the claims in the argument. More specifically, this study gathered empirical evidence to support the scoring, generalization and explanation inferences, proposing three research questions that addressed construct representation, potential bias and test method usefulness. The questions were concerned with the listening subskills that the TCF assesses, differential item functioning (DIF) across gender, first language, age, and geographical location as well as the option functioning of multiple choice (MC) items in the assessment of second language listening comprehension. Although multiple statistical and measurement models are readily available to analyze test response data, this study privileged confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to examine the listening subskills operationalized in the TCF, specifying the models following suggestions from a panel of experts. The unidimensional Rasch model was used to generate the difficulty parameters across subgroups of interest to perform the DIF analyses. And the nominal response model (NRM) was used to model the response options of the MC items. The results from these three studies yielded backings for each of the selected inferences in the validity argument for the TCF. Based on the CFA models recommended by the panel of experts, the results suggested that the TCF test forms under study primarily assess examinees’ understanding of explicitly stated information in aural discourse, thereby underrepresenting the listening construct. A few items were found to target the ability to infer implicit ideas and understanding of the general topic or main idea, however, this latter subskill was only found in one test form, suggesting that the forms are not equivalent. The DIF analysis flagged multiple items across test forms and between the subgroups of interest, but very few were associated to potential bias, which included speech perception, literary genre and vocabulary familiarity. Thus, given that many items flagged for DIF could not be associated to a potential bias, this question was partially answered and attenuates the validity argument. The results from the NRM suggested that most items functioned well while others were potentially doubled keyed. The argument-based approached to validity proved helpful in putting together empirical evidence into a coherent whole to support and build a case for the interpretation and uses of the TCF in the context of immigration, which in turn can be used to address the identified weaknesses, providing a means to attenuate the potential rebuttals that threaten the validity of the argument. Some caveats in the validation framework were also outlined and relate to the accessibility of data to address the extrapolation and decision inferences in immigration contexts, but as Newton and Shaw (2014, p. 142) advocated “the argument-based approach underlies the fact that validation is not simply a one-off-study but a program: potentially a very intensive program”. And this program can include key stakeholders such as government officials that help complete the validity argument for the TCF in Quebec immigration.

447	CD73 : cible thérapeutique dans le cancer de l'ovaire et le cancer du sein HER2+	Many mechanisms are laid in the tumor microenvironment to restrict the anti-tumor activity by the immune system. Identification of novel molecular targets responsible of redundancy phenomenon is necessary for developing innovative immunotherapy strategies that will restore the anti-tumor immune system efficacy. One of the factors responsible for the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment is the extracellular adenosine generated by the ectoenzyme CD73. This thesis explores the properties of CD73 as a novel target in cancer immunotherapy.    To evaluate the role of CD73 / adenosine axis in an immunotherapy context, correlations  has been made on patient cohorts. These results have been confirming with relevant syngeneic and knockout mouse models. In vitro models of mouse and human cancer deficient or proficient in CD73 has also been using. In the high-grade serous ovarian cancer, this thesis shows that CD73 acts as a prognostic marker associated with intraepithelial CD8+ cells and promote in vitro and in vivo tumor proliferation. Results from this thesis also show CD73 expression on fibroblasts that promote immune escape and tumor proliferation. In the HER2+ breast cancer, this thesis investigates CD73 as a resistance mechanism where this enzyme expression on tumor cells and host cells decrease the anti-tumor immune response mediated by anti-ErbB2 mAb therapy.  Results from this thesis also show that anti-CD73 mAb enhances anti-ErbB2 activity to treat engrafted and spontaneous tumors as well as lung metastasis.   This work highlights the adenosinergic pathway in two types of cancers where the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment is a brake for an optimal therapy. CD73 is presented as a novel target candidate in cancer immunotherapy.	CD73 , ErbB2/HER2 , Trastuzumab , EMT , Immunotherapy , Breast cancer , Ovarian cancer , Tumor microenvironment	en	21207.0
448	Mécanismes moléculaires de régulation de l’interaction SOCS1-p53 et leurs impacts sur la suppression tumorale	Tumor suppressor mechanisms are among the main processes that protect the organism against the development of malignant tumors. These mechanisms are numerous and each of them is regulated by a plethora of signaling pathways. These different signaling pathways, however, tend to converge towards the activation of a few central proteins, like p53, the so-called guardian of the genome for example, that are considered the main tumor suppressors of the cell. These proteins can themselves control many different mechanisms of tumor suppression. The specificity by which p53 controls one signaling pathway over another is still badly understood. Since this protein is involved in the malignant transformation of cells, the comprehension of how these functions are regulated is crucial in order to be eventually able to modulate their activities in specific contexts like cancer. Our laboratory has discovered that SOCS1 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1), a protein mainly considered as a tumor suppressor and a negative regulator of inflammatory signaling pathways, interacts with p53 in the context of cellular senescence and facilitates its phosphorylation by ATM (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated) and thus its activation. How SOCS1 controls the p53 signaling pathway, however, remained unknown. The goal of this thesis was to understand how SOCS1 regulates the p53 signaling pathway. First of all, we identified the transcriptional targets of p53 that are specifically modulated by SOCS1. P53 is known to regulate hundreds of targets and those important for tumors suppression still constitute a debate. One approach used to better understand how p53 functions is to identify which targets are important in which context. Knowing which p53 pathways are regulated by SOCS1 allowed us to discover that SOCS1 can regulate ferroptosis, a type of programmed cell death that seems very important for the tumor suppressor functions of p53. We then aimed our efforts at identifying the molecular components regulating the interaction between p53 and SOCS1. We determined that the amino acids tryptophan 53 and phenylalanine 54 of p53 TAD2 are crucial for the interaction with residues tyrosine 80 and tryptophan 81 within the SH2 domain of SOCS1. Mutating Y80 and W81 of SOCS1 results in a loss of interaction with p53 and the incapacity for SOCS1 to arrest the growth of cancer cells. We also discovered a new mode of regulation of SOCS1: the protein is phosphorylated on Y80 by the SRC family kinases. This phosphorylation seems to inhibit SOCS1’s tumor suppressor functions and is deregulated in the tissue samples of patients with lymphoma compared to normal lymph node samples. Finally, we discovered that SOCS1 can form dimers, both in vitro and in cells and it is the phosphorylated form of SOCS1 that dimerizes. This opens the door to a new biology for SOCS1.

449	L'analyse économique du droit du poste de commissaire de la Ligue nationale de hockey	The use of the economic analysis of law when studying the governance of the National Hockey League reduces human error in the decision-making process.  The National Hockey League is a professional league.  Value maximisation of the League teams and profits are important economic objectives.  As a priority, the League governance must help the team owners to realize these economic objectives.  The economic analysis of law can help the Commissioner and the team owners improve the governance of the National Hockey League in order to achieve the objective of value maximisation. This study analyzes the Commissioner’s position within the governance of National Hockey League.  In the first part, a description of the National Hockey League structure as well as an analysis of the market conditions will be completed in order to outline the flexibility in governance related decisions.  It is important to understand the impact of the regulations established by the Governors of the League related to the team markets.  Further, in the second part, an analysis of the Commissioner’s position will be completed based on the theory of the firm.  The creation of the Commissioner’s position was added to another element of the theory of the firm.  As such, the team owners now assume the role of supervisor while the Commissioner takes care of the daily management of the League.  The Commissioner has an interest in ensuring that the National Hockey League contributes actively to the generation of income for the teams.  There can be situations where the Commissioner as diverging views with the team owners on governance.  Using corporate law, in the third part, solutions will be recommended to better attaint the objective of value maximisation of the League teams in the Commissioner’s decision-making process.

450	Travailler dans la violence : le sale boulot paramilitaire en Colombie	Since the second half of the twentieth century, millions of people were reported missing, tortured and executed extrajudicially by paramilitary groups, also involved in the elimination of petty criminals and marginalized populations. In Colombia, paramilitary groups have been used by the state since the 1970s for the suppression of civil social movements, left-wing parties and guerrillas, which have emerged in the country since the 1960s. In the 1980s drug traffickers have begun to fund new organizations and suppress social struggles and deviance. Following a proliferation of these organizations in the 1990s, the federation of paramilitary groups United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC) was created in 1997 to recover the territories controlled by guerrillas, perpetrating massacres, displacing civilians and imposing forced social control on communities, including the commission of sexual violence against women, target killings, torture and atrocities on the bodies of the victims.  Based on an analysis of the life stories of 30 former paramilitaries of the USDFC, my dissertation is interested on paramilitary social control in Colombia. Unlike the characterization of paramilitaries as rational actors, motivated by economic and illegal interests, which dominates the interpretation of their actions, my analysis of the representations of my interviewees raises the importance of morality in understanding paramilitary conducts. In the context of transnationalization of the legal and illegal economy of Colombia at the end of the twentieth century, paramilitary violence helps mantaining the conservative normative structure of society, through the elimination of transgressors of the political, economic and moral order. In such a context of economic and social changes, which transforms traditional economic activities, violence becomes a work for men from the lower classes, whose actions should be interpreted from their life experiences into a reality where violence is one of the few job opportunities. Inspired by research on the perpetrators of (para) state violence, by the work on armed trajectories and by the sociology of dirty work, my thesis invites to conceptualize paramilitary violence as a dirty work of social control. By studying the work of violence according to the experiences of the interviewees, I show that the paramilitaries create moral representations of their actions, which makes it possible to construct their reality, to divide the work by automating each of the functions and to build an identity in a dirty work. My thesis argues that the moral identity of the paramilitaries must be understood not only relative to the conservative discursive context about criminals, but also in relation to the position of paramilitaries in a gray zone between the legal public sector and the illegal private sphere, to whom is delegated the dirty work of repression of civil populations and guerillas. The paramilitaries have an ambiguous relationship to morality between, on the one hand, the idea that they help the state to defend the security of civilian populations and, on the other hand, the illegal nature of violent organizations and practices. Violence is an experience of embodyment and enjoyment of the adrenaline of power, but it is also a traumatic experience marking their identity. My thesis also analyses career trajectories based on the life stories of the interviewees, showing the existence of trajectories differentiated by region, in the temporality of participation and in the degrees of exposure to violence, but also shows the effects of economic and social changes and armed conflict on the careers of peasant men.	violence , Paramilitary groups , Colombia , Former combatants , Perpetrators , Perpetration , Violence workers , Dirty work , Social control , Morality , Identity , Trajectories , Careers , Life stories , Moral	en	21125.0
451	Entrer en état d’urgence à l’ère du capitalisme globalisé : retour critique sur quatorze ans avec Médecins Sans Frontières	"Based on a 14 year working experience with the emergency organization Doctors Without Borders, this thesis seeks to unveil a side of contemporary globalization by exploring numerous fields of humanitarian intervention in Central Africa, as well as as in its headquarters in Geneva.  Beginning with the hypothesis that humanitarian assistance is a place of predilection to grasp an essential aspect of globalization, the thesis questions the legitimacy of international humanitarian interventions by showing that, within other things, the same logic of intervention is increasingly imposing itself at the international level, with the consequence of relativising, even of ignoring all forms of local conditions.  In return, this logic tends to institute an unequal order between victims and emergency workers, leaving little place to the voices, demands and choices of the aided populations, which further enlightens us on questions of sovereignty at the heart of contemporary globalization. The research unfolds at the confluence of these questions.  First, the thesis is anchored in an ethnographic description which makes the inegalitarian paradigm appear between local populations and the emergency workers as it concretely unfolds in the humanitarian missions, to afterwards question the ambiguity of emergency as ideology in long term assistance projects. When we look at the reality from the grounds and from the aided populations, it becomes difficult to separate ""humanitarian aid"" from ""development"", emergency assistance from global politico-economic inequalities, the role of local governments in the miseries of their people from the economic foreign exploitation of the country. The thesis hence unveils the ideological and practical ambiguity of emergency humanitarian aid in order to begin a theoretical reflection on the undersides of contemporary emergency humanitarian aid and its place within globalization.   Second, we go deeper into the theoretical critique of humanitarian aid by leaning on the critiques of colonialism and of development, to afterwards question the place of humanitarian aid in the international order from the 1990s onwards and the contribution of anthropology of humanitarian aid on these issues.  An anthropological mutation signs the entry into late modernity and accompanies the uniformisation of the world, which go hand in hand with a crisis of anthropology as an academic discipline.  In fact, the social sciences and anthropology evolve within the same aporia and the same contradictions as those in which humanitarian assistance is deployed. It is finally upon situating the humanitarian response and anthropological analysis within globalized capitalism seen as ""total social fact"" that we will bring the limits of this study into perspective."

452	Vente de drogues illicites sur le darknet: Enchâssement des marchés de drogues physiques et virtuels	Links seem to exist between virtual and physical markets for illicit drugs. While several authors referred to them, none of their studies really focused on understanding the nature of the links between these two types of markets. Therefore, this research aims to provide us with a better understanding of the links that exist between the virtual and physical markets of illicit drugs. More precisely, it focuses on the frequency of illicit drugs vendors that have sales experience in the physical world, on the level of diversification of those vendors’ activities as well as on the characteristics of their professional networks on cryptomarkets. This study’s data was collected from a survey administered on cryptomarkets that was addressed to illicit drugs vendors who are over 18 years old. The vendors were directly contacted via internal messaging on those cryptomarkets. This study demonstrated that almost half of the vendors in its sample were involved in physical trades of illicit drugs before expanding their activities to cryptomarkets. Those vendors seem to succeed better financially on cryptomarkets than the sellers who have no previous experience in non-virtual illicit drugs dealing. When we analyzed the professional networks of bimodal vendors, we noted that business contacts were mainly met offline. Finally, when we compared the supply sources for bimodal vendors with the ones used by unimodal virtual vendors, we can saw in a significant way that the bimodal vendors restock their products from the physical markets more often than unimodal vendors on the cryptomarkets. We can therefore conclude that links exist between the virtual and physical illicit markets of drugs.

453	Biomimetic bottle-brush polymer coatings for fabrication of ultra-low fouling surfaces	The increasing demand for long lasting antifouling surfaces has steered the development of accessible, novel, biocompatible and environmentally-friendly materials. Inspired by lubricin (LUB), a component of mammalian synovial fluid with excellent antifouling properties, we designed three block polymers with bottle-brush structures and outstanding stability, efficacy, and ease of use. By a simple drop casting or online exposure, the polymers strongly adsorbed on silica surfaces in less than 10 min and were found to be stable in extremely high-salinity solutions and under an unprecedented wide range of pH. The polymers antifouling properties against proteins and bacteria were evaluated using different techniques, demonstrating ultralow fouling properties. With serum albumin and lysozyme adsorption < 0.2 ng/cm2, the polymers were found to be 50 and 25 times more effective than LUB and the known ultralow fouling coatings. The antifouling properties were also successfully tested under MPa compression pressures by direct force measurements using the surface forces apparatus (SFA). The findings of this study suggest that these polymers are amongst the most robust and efficient antifouling agents known today.

454	Caractérisation du statut en fer chez des chiennes en santé avant et après une intervention chirurgicale	Background: Anemia of inflammation is a frequent condition in veterinary and human medicine. Hepcidin, a recently discovered protein, is a key player in iron metabolism and consequently in anemia of inflammation. Objective: To characterize the iron status in healthy female dogs before and after an ovariohysterectomy (OVH). Methods: Prospective study. 29 healthy female dogs had an OVH surgery. Before and 14-18 hours after the beginning of the surgery, the following tests were performed on blood or serum: complete blood count, iron, ferritin, hepcidine, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and C-reactive protein (CRP). IL-6 and hepcidine were measured with a canine and human ELISA, respectively. Results: Mean leukocytes, neutrophils, CRP and IL-6 concentration were significantly higher following the surgery (p < 0.0001). A marked and significant decrease in serum iron (p < 0.0001) accompanied by a significant increase in hepcidin (p = 0.04) without changes in ferritin concentration (p = 0.75) following the surgery were also observed. Conclusion: The results indicate that OVH surgery is a model of systemic inflammation and that it has an impact on iron homeostasis. With further validation in dogs, a serum hepcidin assay may become a key tool in characterizing functional iron deficiency and anemia of inflammation in this species.

455	Synthèse des revues systématiques et méta-analyses traitant des interventions nonpharmacologiques chez des personnes souffrant de maladie d’Alzheimer, de démence vasculaire ou de démence mixte et vivant à domicile	With the aging of the population, the prevalence of major neurocognitive disorder is increasing. In Canada, 13 individuals out of one thousand are affected by the disorder (Tessier, 2016). Alzheimer’s disease, vascular diseases and mixed impairments are recognized to be the most frequent etiology of major NCD. Non-pharmacological interventions (NPI) are often considered in the treatment of people suffering from the disorder so they can maintain their autonomy in everyday life activities and their abilities, often by trying to reduce the functional impairments.  The objective of this work was to make a summary of the best non-invasive NPI to provide to therapists and caregivers the means to identify the best intervention to maintain the autonomy and quality of life depending on the particular needs of the individual. After a literature search on the University’s usual databases, 722 reviews were found. Out of those, 8 that responded to our PICOTS criteria were kept for the present analysis. Five of those were reviews of cognitive interventions and three were of physical exercises. The reviews reported a total of 57 different primary studies published between 1979 and 2015. All of the reviews analyzed the effects of the NPI on cognition, 5 looked at mood and 5 considered the adaptation of the ADL. Methodological quality of the reviews, as assessed by AMSTAR 2, was between low and moderate. Quality of confidence in the evidence as assessed by GRADE was between very low to high. The summary of the results was written in a narrative format. Most of the reviews included in this present work had important heterogeneity in their definition, methodology and outcomes. Therefore, it was impossible to have a clear picture of the outcomes concerning ADL and the quality of life associated with specific interventions. The definition of the physical exercises, albeit with some imprecision concerning the duration and intensity, were best described. Therefore, the results of our summary of reviews allows us to say that a physical exercises program seems to have significant positive effect on autonomy in ADL	Neurocognitive disorders , Alzheimer’s disease , Vascular dementia , Mixed dementia , Non-pharmacological interventions , Cognitive interventions , Physical exercises , Neuropsychology	en	21061.0
456	Seroconversion for cytomegalovirus infection in a cohort of pregnant women in Québec, 2010–2013	Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the leading cause of congenital infection and non-genetic sensorineural hearing loss in children. There are no recent data on the incidence of CMV infection during pregnancy in Canada. This present study was undertaken to determine the seroprevalence of CMV IgG antibodies and the rate of seroconversion in a cohort of pregnant women in the province of Québec, Canada. We used serum samples and questionnaire data collected as part of the 3D Pregnancy and Birth Cohort Study (2010–2013) conducted in Québec, Canada. CMV IgG antibodies were determined in serum samples collected at the first and third trimesters. Associations between independent variables and seroprevalence were assessed using logistic regression, and associations with seroconversions, by Poisson regression. Of 1938 pregnant women tested, 40·4% were seropositive for CMV at baseline. Previous CMV infection was associated with: working as a daycare educator, lower education, lower income, having had children, first language other than French or English, and being born outside Canada or the United States. Of the 1122 initially seronegative women, 24 (2·1%) seroconverted between their first and third trimesters. The seroconversion rate was 1·4 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0·9–2·1]/ 10 000 person-days at risk or 3·9 (95% CI 2·5–5·9)/100 pregnancies (assuming a 280-day gestation). The high proportion of pregnant women susceptible to CMV infection (nearly 60%) and the subsequent rate of seroconversion are of concern.

457	Prospective links between friendship and early physical aggression : preliminary evidence supporting the role of friendship quality through a dyadic intervention	Positive friendships have been related to decreasing levels of children’s physical aggression over time. While this evidence calls for interventions aimed at helping children build good-quality friendships, tests of causality through experimental manipulations are still needed. The goal of this study was to examine whether an intervention aimed to increase dyadic friendship quality could decrease children’s physical aggression at the peer-group level over a school year. A total of 34 aggressive children and each child’s best friend were randomly assigned to two groups: an experimental condition where the members in each dyad participated together in 12 weekly intervention sessions and a no-intervention control condition. Multiple sources were used to evaluate changes in friendship quality and children’s physical aggression. Results showed an indirect effect of the intervention on decreasing levels of physical aggression through the improvement of one specific feature of friendship quality: conflict resolution. These results point to the usefulness of including this relational aspect in intervention programs targeting aggressive children.

458	Links between friends' physical aggression and adolescents' physical aggression : what happens if gene-environment correlations are controlled?	Exposure to deviant friends has been found to be a powerful source of influence on children’s and adolescents’ aggressive behavior. However, the contribution of deviant friends may have been overestimated because of a possible non-accounted gene-environment correlation (rGE). In this study, we used a cross-lagged design to test whether friends’ physical aggression at age 10 predicts an increase in participants’ physical aggression from age 10 to age 13 years. Participants were 201 pairs of monozygotic twins who are part of the Quebec Longitudinal Twin Study. We performed two sets of analyses. In the first set of analyses, using twins as singletons, we found that teacher-rated friends’ physical aggression predicted an increase in each twin’s self-reported physical aggression from age 10 to age 13, above and beyond auto-regressive and concurrent links. Second, we used within-pair differences in regard to friends’ physical aggression to predict an increase in within-pair differences in physical aggression, thus accounting for family-wide influences, including a likely rGE at age 10. No significant association was found, however. These results suggest that part of the influence attributed to friends in past studies may have been due to common underlying genetic effects on both physical aggression and association with physically aggressive friends	Aggressive behavior , Antisocial behavior , Longitudinal study , Pre-adolescents	en	20949.0
459	Friendship experiences and anxiety among children : a genetically informed study	This study examined (a) whether, in line with a gene-environment correlation (rGE), a genetic disposition for anxiety puts children at risk of having anxious friends or having no reciprocal friends; (b) to what extent these friendship experiences are related to anxiety symptoms, when controlling for sex and genetic disposition for this trait; and (c) the additive and interactive predictive links of the reciprocal best friend's anxiety symptoms and of friendship quality with children's anxiety symptoms. Using a genetically informed design based on 521 monozygotic and ic twins (264 girls; 87% of European descent) assessed in Grade 4 (M age = 10.04 years, SD = .26), anxiety symptoms and perceived friendship quality were measured with self-report questionnaires. Results indicated that, in line with rGE, children with a strong genetic disposition for anxiety were more likely to have anxious friends than nonanxious friends. Moreover, controlling for their genetic risk for anxiety, children with anxious friends showed higher levels of anxiety symptoms than children with nonanxious friends but did not differ from those without reciprocal friends. Additional analyses suggested a possible contagion of anxiety symptoms between reciprocal best friends when perceived negative features of friendship were high. These results underline the importance of teaching strategies such as problem solving that enhance friendship quality to limit the potential social contagion of anxiety symptoms.

460	Innovation growth clusters : Lessons from the industrial revolution	Over three centuries ago, a new technology suddenly increased the amount and frequency of available information. Might such «Big Data» have disrupted the causal relationships linking economic growth and innovation? Previous research has affirmed that a society’s economic success during the Industrial Revolution depended on its institutions. Here we examine the hypothesis that by allowing people to cooperate more easily with one another, language standardization raised a society’s rate of innovation. As a result, the region could attract the resources needed to grow more rapidly. Empirical tests with 117 innovations and 251 Western cities suggest that the presence of a standardized tongue helps to explain the burst of innovation and growth observed between 1700 and 1850. Moreover, once one has accounted for language standardization, institutional quality has little further power to explain economic progress.		en	20939.0
461	The expression of genetic risk for aggressive and non-aggressive antisocial behavior is moderated by peer group	Numerous studies have shown that aggressive and non-aggressive antisocial behaviors are important precursors of later adjustment problems. There is also strong empirical evidence that both types of antisocial behavior are partially influenced by genetic factors. However, despite its important theoretical and practical implications, no study has examined the question whether environmental factors differentially moderate the expression of genetic influences on the two types of antisocial behavior. Using a genetically informed design based on 266 monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs, this study examined whether the expression of genetic risk for aggressive and non-aggressive antisocial behavior varies depending on the peer group’s injunctive norms (i.e., the degree of acceptability) of each type of antisocial behavior. Self-reported aggressive and non-aggressive antisocial behavior and classroom-based sociometric nominations were collected when participants were 10 years old. Multivariate genetic analyses revealed some common genetic factors influencing both types of antisocial behavior (i.e., general antisocial behavior) as well as genetic influences specific to non-aggressive antisocial behavior. However, genetic influences on general antisocial behavior, as well as specific genetic influences on non-aggressive antisocial behavior, vary depending on the injunctive classroom norms regarding these behaviors. These findings speak to the power of peer group norms in shaping aggressive and non-aggressive antisocial behavior. They also contribute further to understanding the distinctive development of both types of antisocial behavior. Finally, they may have important implications for prevention purposes.

462	Early warm-rewarding parenting moderates the genetic contributions to callous-unemotional traits in childhood	Background Previous gene–environment interaction studies of CU traits have relied on the candidate gene approach, which does not account for the entire genetic load of complex phenotypes. Moreover, these studies have not examined the role of positive environmental factors such as warm/rewarding parenting. The aim of the present study was to determine whether early warm/rewarding parenting moderates the genetic contributions (i.e., heritability) to callous–unemotional (CU) traits at school age. Methods Data were collected in a population sample of 662 twin pairs (Quebec Newborn Twin Study – QNTS). Mothers reported on their warm/rewarding parenting. Teachers assessed children's CU traits. These reports were subjected to twin modeling. Results Callous–unemotional traits were highly heritable, with the remaining variance accounted for by nonshared environmental factors. Warm/rewarding parenting significantly moderated the role of genes in CU traits; heritability was lower when children received high warm/rewarding parenting than when they were exposed to low warm/rewarding parenting. Conclusions High warm/rewarding parenting may partly impede the genetic expression of CU traits. Developmental models of CU traits need to account for such gene–environment processes.

463	Organizing time banks: Lessons from matching markets	A time bank is a group of people that set up a common platform to trade services among themselves. There are several well-known problems associated with this type of time banking, e.g., high overhead costs and difficulties to identify feasible trades. This paper constructs a non-manipulable mechanism that selects an individually rational and time-balanced allocation which maximizes exchanges among the members of the time bank (and those allocations are efficient). The mechanism works on a domain of preferences where agents classify services as unacceptable and acceptable (and for those services agents have specific upper quotas representing their maximum needs).

464	Gestational age at birth and ‘Body-Mind’ health at 5 years of age : a population based cohort study	Numerous studies have identified the effects of prematurity on the neonate’s physical health, however few studies have explored the effects of prematurity on both the physical and mental health of the child as they develop. Secondary analysis of data from the Millennium Cohort Study, a longitudinal study of infants (n = 18 818, born 2000–2002 in the United Kingdom) was performed. Effects of gestational age at birth on health outcomes at 5 years were measured using parental rating of their children’s general health and severity of behavior problems. The association between parent’s general health ratings and behavior problem ratings was low: 86% of those reporting serious behavior problems (5% of the sample, n = 764) rated their child as being in excellent, very good, or good health. Still, a gradient of increasing risk of poorer outcome with decreasing gestational age was observed for a composite health measure (poor/fair health and/or serious behavior problems), suggesting an association with prematurity for this composite assessment of health status. The greatest contribution to the childhood composite health measure at 5 years was for children born at 32–36 weeks gestation: population attributable fractions for having poor outcomes was 3.4% (Bonferroni-adjusted 95% confidence interval 1.1%–6.2%), compared to 1% (0.2–2.3) for birth at less than 32 weeks. Results suggest that preterm children, by school entry, are not only at high risk of physical health problems, but also of behavioral health problems. The recognition of, and response to comprehensive health and well-being outcomes related to prematurity are important in order to correctly plan and deliver adequate paediatric health services and policies.		en	20901.0
465	Adolescent cannabis use, change in neurocognitive function, and High-School Graduation : a longitudinal study from early adolescence to young adulthood	The main objective of this prospective longitudinal study was to investigate bidirectional associations between adolescent cannabis use (CU) and neurocognitive performance in a community sample of 294 young men from ages 13 to 20 years. The results showed that in early adolescence, and prior to initiation to CU, poor short-term and working memory, but high verbal IQ, were associated with earlier age of onset of CU. In turn, age of CU onset and CU frequency across adolescence were associated with (a) specific neurocognitive decline in verbal IQ and executive function tasks tapping trial and error learning and reward processing by early adulthood and (b) lower rates of high-school graduation. The association between CU onset and change in neurocognitive function, however, was found to be accounted for by CU frequency. Whereas the link between CU frequency across adolescence and change in verbal IQ was explained (mediated) by high school graduation, the link between CU frequency and tasks tapping trial and error learning were independent from high school graduation, concurrent cannabis and other substance use, adolescent alcohol use, and externalizing behaviors. Findings support prevention efforts aimed at delaying onset and reducing frequency of CU.		en	20872.0
466	Genetic markers of Restless Legs Syndrome in Parkinson disease	INTRODUCTION:  Several studies proposed that Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) and Parkinson disease (PD) may be clinically and/or etiologically related. To examine this hypothesis, we aimed to determine whether the known RLS genetic markers may be associated with PD risk, as well as with PD subtype. METHODS:  Two case-control cohorts from Tel-Aviv and New-York, including 1133 PD patients and 867 controls were genotyped for four RLS-related SNPs in the genes MEIS1, BTBD9, PTPRD and MAP2K5/SKOR1. The association between genotype, PD risk and phenotype was tested using multivariate regression models. RESULTS:  None of the tested SNPs was significantly associated with PD risk, neither in any individual cohort nor in the combined analysis after correction for multiple comparisons. The MAP2K5/SKOR1 marker rs12593813 was associated with higher frequency of tremor in the Tel-Aviv cohort (61.0% vs. 46.5%, p = 0.001, dominant model). However, the risk allele for tremor in this gene has been associated with reduced RLS risk. Moreover, this association did not replicate in Tremor-dominant PD patients from New-York. CONCLUSION:  RLS genetic risk markers are not associated with increased PD risk or subtype in the current study. Together with previous genetic, neuropathological and epidemiologic studies, our results further strengthen the notion that RLS and PD are likely to be distinct entities.

467	Caractérisation et étude de l’impact des permissions dans les applications mobiles	Android provides a security model based on permissions to third-party application developers, who control access to system resources, including hardware, settings, and user data. This search examines a set of permission data for more than 130,000 existing apps on the Google Play Store on how they can affect smartphone users. The goal is to identify patterns of permissions usage and to better understand the patterns in permissions from the users' point of view. We report results on thousands of applications and we observe a negative correlation between the score of conformance to the patterns that we calculated for each application, the average rating and the price.  This project also presents an empirical study of the Android permission model, allowing to observe the use of permission sets by third-party developers in similar applications and to identify the risk levels associated with different combinations of permissions in the Android applications. We found that Internet access permission was used by over 70% of applications and that the two most common permissions that access user information are ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION and ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION.  The study showed that the conformance score is not a risk indicator and is not an indicator of sustainability. On the other hand, the degree of use of dangerous permissions is at the same time a risk indicator and an indicator of durability, in fact, the applications which request more dangerous permissions are more likely to be malicious applications and to be deleted from Google Play store. Likewise, we've found that user satisfaction reflects both risk and sustainability, as less-rated apps are more likely to be malicious apps and removed from the Google Play store.

468	Intermolecular interactions between Bottlebrush Polymers boost the protection of surfaces against frictional wear	Polymers exhibiting the bottlebrush (BB) architecture have excellent lubricating properties. However, to motivate their use in real life systems, they must also protect surfaces against frictional damage. In this article, we synthesized a library of polyzwiterrionic bottlebrush polymers of different architectures to explore the effect of intermolecular interactions on their conformation at interfaces and their tribological properties. Using the surface forces apparatus, we show that increasing the number of adhesive blocks on the BB polymers does not impact the friction coefficient on mica surfaces, μ, which remained close to μ = 0.02 but drastically increased the threshold pressure, P*, at which wear initiates from P* = 0.4 ± 0.1 up to 8.0 ± 0.8 MPa. In mixtures of high molecular weight hyaluronic acid and BB polymers, a synergistic interaction between polymers occurred, leading to a significant increase in P*, independently of the BB polymer tested and even reaching superprotection for strongly interacting polymers (up to P* > 14 MPa). Overall, these results show that strong intermolecular interaction between BB polymers and high molecular weight linear polymers is a promising strategy to create highly protective lubricants.		en	20836.0
469	Effet de la buspirone sur le réflexe-H chez la souris adulte décérébrée spinale	Locomotion is generated by a spinal network which is, under normal conditions, modulated by supraspinal inputs and peripheral feedback. A spinal cord injury induces a loss of descending command and silence the locomotor network. Nevertheless, reexpression of this network can be facilitated by application of serotonin, a neurotransmitter originating supraspinally known to help locomotor recovery in spinal rodents. Such effect is associated with neuronal rearrangement which could be observed on reflex pathway. The aim of our study is to measure reflex modulation induced by buspirone, a 5-HT1A partial agonist that allowed reexpression of locomotion in adult spinal mice. Using a newly developed model of decerebrated unanesthetized mouse we measure the modulation of H-reflex excitability induced by buspirone after an acute spinal transection for 60 minutes post-injection. Comparison between buspirone (8mg/kg) treated (N=8) and control (N=6) groups present a significant decrease in reflex amplitude (69%) at early stages of pharmacological treatment followed by a raise (170%) that become significant 30 minutes postdose. Those results allowed us to associate reflexe decrease during prolocomotor period observed in first minutes after buspirone injection. There also support the involvement of buspirone in sensorimotor control.	serotonin , motor function recovery , reflex control , monosynaptic reflex	en	20813.0
470	Facteurs de risque associés au statut de troupeau positif à Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis	Paratuberculosis is a chronic and contagious enteric disease of ruminants caused by Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP). Control of paratuberculosis is justified given the associated economic losses and the potential role of MAP in Crohn’s disease in humans. Cattle usually become infected at a young age, primarily by the fecal-oral route. After a long incubation period (up to several years), infected cows may start shedding MAP without showing clinical signs, thus perpetuating MAP infections on the farm. Management procedures that limit exposure of susceptible animals to MAP are more effective at reducing disease prevalence than simply testing and culling MAP infected cows. Any management practices that expose (directly or indirectly) susceptible animals to fecal material from MAP shedders can be considered a risk factor for infection. The objectives of this master’s thesis are: 1) critically review the available scientific literature that evaluates the association between management practices (measured by a risk assessment questionnaire (RAQ)) and MAP herd status, et 2) identify the association between management practices and MAP herd status (determined using bacteriological culture of environmental samples) of dairy herds in Québec, Canada. A systematic review was performed to answer the first objective. We included studies that assessed PTB risk factors using a RAQ and measured the association between risks factors and MAP herd status. For the second objective, a case-control study was designed. A total of 26 case herds in which MAP had been isolated from at least 1 environmental sample in each herd and 91 control herds (no clinical cases of paratuberculosis and negative on 2 consecutive yearly environmental samplings) were selected. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between selected risk factors and MAP herd status. Twenty-one cross-sectional, 5 case control and 3 longitudinal studies met the inclusion criteria. Herd size was significantly associated with MAP herd status in  12 (4 with low RoB) out of 18 studies, introduction of new animals was significantly associated with MAP herd status in 10 (4 with low RoB) out of 24, history of PTB was significantly associated with MAP herd status in 6 (4 with low RoB) out of 13, and management of colostrum and milk were significantly associated with MAP herd status in 5 (none with low RoB) out of 18. For Québec dairy herds, herd size (OR=1.17; 95% CI: 1.02-1.33) and proportion of cows purchased per year in the last 5 years (OR=5.44; 95% CI: 1.23-23.98) were significantly associated with a positive MAP herd status. The results of this master’s thesis provide a large compilation of available information about risk factors associated with MAP herd status evaluated using a RAQ. Some risk factors are apparently more consistent across studies. However, results should be interpreted in the light of the quality and risk of bias of each study. Management practices aiming to prevent the introduction of new animals into the herd and to reduce the contact of newborn calves with adult animals or their feces are key elements to minimize MAP introduction and transmission into a herd. These elements should be prioritized in control programs.

471	A coupled 2 x 2D Babcock-Leighton solar dynamo model. II Reference dynamo solutions	In this paper we complete the presentation of a new hybrid 2 × 2D flux transport dynamo (FTD) model of the solar cycle based on the Babcock–Leighton mechanism of poloidal magnetic field regeneration via the surface decay of bipolar magnetic regions (BMRs). This hybrid model is constructed by allowing the surface flux transport (SFT) simulation described in Lemerle et al. to provide the poloidal source term to an axisymmetric FTD simulation defined in a meridional plane, which in turn generates the BMRs required by the SFT. A key aspect of this coupling is the definition of an emergence function describing the probability of BMR emergence as a function of the spatial distribution of the internal axisymmetric magnetic field. We use a genetic algorithm to calibrate this function, together with other model parameters, against observed cycle 21 emergence data. We present a reference dynamo solution reproducing many solar cycle characteristics, including good hemispheric coupling, phase relationship between the surface dipole and the BMR-generating internal field, and correlation between dipole strength at cycle maximum and peak amplitude of the next cycle. The saturation of the cycle amplitude takes place through the quenching of the BMR tilt as a function of the internal field. The observed statistical scatter about the mean BMR tilt, built into the model, acts as a source of stochasticity which dominates amplitude fluctuations. The model thus can produce Dalton-like epochs of strongly suppressed cycle amplitude lasting a few cycles and can even shut off entirely following an unfavorable sequence of emergence events.

472	Luminescence de complexes plan-carrés de nickel(II), palladium(II) et platine(II): une histoire d’interactions intermoléculaires, de pression et de température variable	This thesis focuses on the luminescence of square-planar complexes of nickel(II), palladium(II), and platinum(II) in solid-state. A comprehensive and quantitative understanding of less-explored effects of the luminescence properties, such as variation of structure, metal, and intermolecular interactions, is obtained based on experimental spectra. The emission spectra are assigned as d-d electronic transitions from the first excited triplet to the ground state singlet for all complexes studied. Application of simple theoretical models allows one to study and compare their electronic structures. Luminescence spectra are measured and compared for many complexes with bidentate ligands and the same ligator atoms, mostly in the dithiocarbamate family. Pressure and temperature variations are applied to gain further quantitative information on these effects, contrasting with current studies reported in the literature measured at only one set of conditions. Structural data is obtained by X-ray crystallography and correlated with the luminescence spectra, showing important spectroscopic effects for even subtle structural variation. These effects have a defining influence on the energy and the shape of the luminescence spectra as conditions are varied, allowing a quantitative characterization and comparison among a family of complexes. The different molecular structures and intermolecular packings allow us to characterize the effects of the metal centers, of structural variations, and of M…H-C intermolecular interactions. Among examples in the literature, it is seen that the nature of the metal affects significantly the luminescence spectra, for instance in the intensity. However, detailed comparisons of a series with 3d, 4d, and 5d metals are rare, the intensity of emission of 3d metal complexes often being poor. In this thesis, detailed comparisons between similar complexes with 3d, 4d, and 5d metals are presented, revealing intrinsic characteristics responsible for differing luminescence properties. Other studies have shown that the metal affects greatly the emission energy, especially for complexes showing metal-metal intermolecular interactions. This aspect is also studied but for the metal involved in M…H-C interactions, bringing crucial information to the understanding of the differences.  In this work, structural variations including and beyond metal-ligand bond compression are explored for molecular complexes at variable conditions instead of the more thoroughly studied inorganic salts. The effect of structural variations induced by temperature for the luminescence spectra is presented for a square-planar complex of platinum(II). The impact of the variation of the L-M-L angle as the structure changes with temperature or pressure is discussed, comparing the experimental results with those from the angular overlap model (AOM), equivalent to ligand-field theory and well adapted to the study of d-d transitions. Those characterizations supported by experimental evidence are new additions to structural variation considerations, as they are not usually taken into account in studies in the literature. M…H-C interactions are increasingly reported in the literature, and are present in some square-planar complexes with a d8 metal center. Being luminophores, the systematic comparison of the effect of these interactions on luminescence properties is performed for the first time in this thesis. By using luminescence spectroscopy at variable pressure, quantitative trends have been extracted to rationalize the relative strengths of such interactions. Other factors, such as alignment and possibility of movement of the interacting atoms, as well as the effect of deuteration, are revealed to be crucial to the characterization of the interaction. Luminescence spectroscopy at variable pressure as an experimental approach allows sensitive characterization of intramolecular and intermolecular structural changes, detecting even subtle variations in the weak M…H-C interactions. Results from this method are more direct and conclusive than those from vibrational spectroscopy at variable pressure. Thus, luminescence spectroscopy at variable pressure constitutes a promising method to gain experimental data on less-well characterized intermolecular interactions.

473	Synthèse et utilisation de benzotriazepinones comme modulateur du système urotensinergique	Peptides are potentially interesting therapeutic agents, due to their low toxicity and excellent activity. They have however disadvantages, such as rapid metabolism, poor bioavailability and potential to react indiscriminately with multiple receptors, which may lead to secondary effects. To address such issues, modified peptide analogs, so-called peptidomimetics, have been developed.  One type of peptidomimetic consists of the complete replacement of the peptide structure by a small molecule that mimics the important backbone and side chain conformation and functions for activity. In addition, certain molecules, such as benzodiazepines have been described as privileged structures, because of their affinity for many peptide receptors. The aza-analogues, benzotriazepines, have received a lot less attention than the parent benzodiazepines, in part due to difficulties in their synthesis, necessitating toxic reagents, harsh reaction conditions, and multiple protecting groups to obtain compound in low yield.  The Urotensin II (UT) receptor is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor family, and interacts with two endogenous cyclic peptide ligands: urotensin II (hUII, H-Glu-Thr-Pro-Asp-c[Cys-Phe-Trp-Lys-Tyr-Cys]-Val-OH) and the urotensin II-related peptide (URP, H-Ala-c[Cys-Phe-Trp-Lys-Tyr-Cys]-Val-OH). The so-called urotensinergic system has among various physiological roles, significance in the pathogenesis and the progression of cardiovascular diseases. The conception of ligands which can differentiate the signaling and phenotypic outcomes of UII and URP are necessary to more effectively target UT for therapeutic development.  This thesis focuses on two principle objectives: the development of new methods for the synthesis of diverse 1,3,4-benzotriazepin-2-ones, and the application of the latter as peptidomimetics that modulate selectively the endogenous ligands of the urotensinergic system. An approach featuring chemo-selective alkylation of a semicarbazone intermediate has been developed to produce diverse benzotriazepin-2-ones. In addition, the achiral benzotriazepinones were shown to have potential to serve as peptide gamma-turn mimics.  The benzotriazepinone scaffold was employed to create achiral allosteric UT modulators by mimicry of the purported turn confirmation of the tripeptide sequence, Bip-Lys-Tyr, in the biologically active UT regulator Urocontrin ([Bip4]URP). A series of 27 compounds was synthesized by our method to study structure-activity relationships for UT modulation. Certain benzotriazepinones exhibited capacity to selectively modulate the effects of hUII and URP in ex vivo studies of rat aorta contraction.  To improve antagonist activity, a N-benzylamide was installed at the benzotriazepine 8-position to mimic the phenylalanine residue in Urocontrin. Moreover, photo-reactive analogs have been pursued by introduction of a benzophenone residue towards the goal of binding UT covalently to identify the location responsible for modulation of hUII and URP activity.  In conclusion, advances have been made in the synthesis and application of benzotriazepinones as peptide -turn mimics. Methods to diversify effectively the heterocycle have empowered development of achiral modulators of the UT receptor. Fundamental and applied advancements of knowledge have thus been made in the domains of peptide mimicry and medicinal chemistry.	benzotriazepinone , chemoselective alkylation , peptide mimicry , UT modulator , urotensinergic system	en	20754.0
474	Design, synthesis, pericyclic chemistry and biomedical applications of azopeptides	The azapeptides are peptide mimics in which the alpha carbon of one or more amino acids has been replaced with a nitrogen atom. The primary goal of this doctorate study was to develop a new method for the synthesis of azapeptides by the application of azopeptides, which are azodicarbonyl analogs that possess an imino urea component. Oxidation of aza-glycine residues proved effective for making azopeptides, which were employed in pericyclic chemistry and examined by X-ray crystallography. Diels−Alder cyclization and Alder−ene reactions on azopeptides enabled respectively access to constrained aza-pipecolyl and azaallylglycinyl residues. X-ray analysis of an azopeptide in the solid state provided insight into imino urea configuration (Chapter 2). Employing the products from azopeptide chemistry as constrained valine analogs, mimics of the Ala-Val-Pro-Ile sequence from the second mitochondria derived activator of caspases (Smac) protein were synthesized and demonstrated ability to induce apoptosis in breast cancer cells (Chapter 3). Following the development of a method to synthesize azopeptides in solution, a solidphase approach was conceived to prepare azopeptides on Rink amide resin and may be amenable to combinatorial chemistry for library generation. This study was targeted on the synthesis of aza-analogs of the opioid peptides morphiceptin and endomorphins as well as the Cluster of Differentiation 36 receptor (CD36) ligand Growth Hormone Releasing Peptide-6 (GHRP-6, His-D-Trp-Ala-Trp-D-Phe-Lys-NH2). The former were examined due to their importance as opioid receptor subtype selective agonists with potential for developing novel analgesics. The latter was targeted in pursuit of selective CD36 modulators with therapeutic potential for treating diseases featuring macrophage-driven inflammation including age-related macular degeneration and atherosclerosis. Twelve aza-opioids were synthesized by replacing proline at the two position of the respective peptide ligands with different aza-pipecolate residues. Similarly, five aza-pipecolyl GHRP-6 analogs were synthesized using the solid-phase method to replace respectively the Ala3 and Trp4 residues (Chapter 4). Examination of the aza-opioids for inhibitory potency on electrically induced contractions of the guinea pig ileum and mouse vas deferens, and the aza-GHRP-6 analogs for capacity to diminish CD36-mediated overproduction of nitric oxide in macrophage cells iv after treatment with the Toll-like receptor-2-agonist fibroblast-stimulating lipopeptide, both demonstrated the utility of the aza-pipecolate methodology for studying the influence of conformation on peptide activity and selectivity. The novel methods for the synthesis of azopeptides in solution and on solid support described in this thesis are designed to enable their use in studies of structure-activity relationships with different biologically active peptides. In this respect, azopeptides have been applied in this research to make ligands of the melanocyte-inhibiting factor-1 (MIF-1), Smac, opioid and CD36 receptors. Considering the effectiveness of the synthetic methods and the potential applications of azopeptides, the findings of this thesis offer strong potential for the advancement of peptide science in the context of medicinal chemistry and chemical biology.

475	Étude de cas contextualisée des trajectoires et perspectives de femmes autochtones ayant vécu l’itinérance à Montréal et à Val-d’Or	Over the past decade, the high proportion of Indigenous people amongst the homeless population of Canadian cities has spurred the attention of a growing number of researchers. Studies have considered a wide range of aspects regarding Indigenous homelessness, including the causes and categories of said homelessness, the conditions in which intervention is possible, and the different pathways leading indigenous individuals to homelessness. This thesis presents the results of a contextualized case study drawing from qualitative and collaborative research on the perspectives and life trajectories of fourteen homeless Aboriginal women in the urban areas of Montreal and Val-d'Or. Inspired by intergenerational trauma and intersectional analytical approaches, this thesis gives priority to the reconstruction of women's life stories by situating them in their socio-historical context. In addition to presenting the similarities found in participants' childhood, adolescence and adult life trajectories, this thesis brings to light the connections between the violent and marginalizing experiences that have marked their lives and the traces left by colonial and patriarchal structures enacted by provincial and federal having intervened in past and present Aboriginal communities. Furthermore, drawing directly from Aboriginal women's perspectives, this thesis focuses on the conditions of individual and collective resurgence revealed in shared life stories, uncovering forms of resilience and supporting elements which have contributed to participants' personal healing. In placing emphasis on participants' awareness of the linkages between past and future generations, this research seeks to illustrate participant Aboriginal women's rationale about the context in which they grew up and their multiple attempts to stop the transmission of intergenerational trauma within their families and also within their communities. This thesis concludes that contextualized case studies can serve as tools which allow for the emergence of renewed perspectives regarding the realities and aspirations of homeless Aboriginal women in Quebec. Furthermore, it highlights that the Province of Quebec, like all Canadian provinces, must continue to assess its own colonial history and build on existing initiatives that recognize the impacts of this history in communities and Quebec society. In parallel, the youth protection system, which many see as a contemporary replica of the residential school system, is an example of an institution which must pursue its efforts to implement the principles of reconciliation. Finally, this thesis invites researchers and decision-makers addressing homelessness to place the perspectives of the main stakeholders at the heart of their initiatives, including those of a new generation of indigenous women leaders, artists and intellectuals. It is only by taking these voices into consideration that a future different from the past can be imagined and constructed.

476	Rôles distinctifs des inflammations de type II et III dans la progression de la fibrose hépatique	Inflammatory immune cells can modulate activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSC) and progression of liver fibrosis. Inflammation is divided in three types characterized by distinct cytokine profiles. Type I inflammation (characterized by IFN-γ production) has anti-fibrogenic properties in contrast to type II inflammation (characterized by IL-4 and IL-13 production). Type III inflammation characterized by production of IL-17 and IL-22 is implicated in many inflammatory conditions of the gut and can be counteracted by regulatory T cells (Tregs), but its contribution to liver fibrosis is still poorly understood.  In these studies, we evaluated the contribution of type III inflammation in liver fibrosis using clinical liver biopsies, in vitro stimulation of primary HSCs and in vivo mouse models. We report dysregulated type II responses during non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). This signature was validated in vivo, where we demonstrated that type II inflammation limited metabolic syndrome associated with NASH, but contributed to liver fibrosis progression. We also report dysregulated type III responses in fibrotic lesions with increased Th17/Treg ratio as well as elevated IL-17A and IL-22 production in liver biopsies. We demonstrate that IL-17A sensitizes HSCs to the action of TGF-β through up-regulation of the TGF-β-RII in a JNK-dependent manner. In addition, we also demonstrate a new pro-fibrotic function of IL-22 through enhancement of TGF-β signaling in HSCs in a p38 MAPK dependent manner. In vivo, IL-22RA1 knockout mice exhibited reduced fibrosis in response to thioacetamide and carbon tetrachloride. Blocking IL-22 production using aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) or RORγt antagonist led to reduced fibrosis.  Altogether, we identified a novel role for type III inflammation mediated by IL-17A and IL-22 in driving liver fibrosis during chronic liver injury.

477	Effets d’une supplémentation en glutamine chez des nageurs de haut niveau	Elite athletes are a very specific population characterized by a particularly rigorous and strenuous training schedule, numerous trips abroad, and the experience of psychological stress. Nutrition is undoubtedly a sizeable element that can have a direct impact on performance. Optimal periodization of nutritional intakes and the use of ergogenic aids is of paramount importance. Given that this group is represented by a relatively small pool of subjects and its participation in research projects involves many methodological challenges, very few studies have been conducted amongst this type of athlete. Intense training executed at a chronic level is linked to a decrease in plasma reserves of glutamine. Glutamine has many functions, including that of acting as a major energy substrate for enterocytes and immune cells. Studies paradoxically observed an increase in the incidence of respiratory tract infections (URTI) as well as gastrointestinal disorders (GD) in elite athletes. In addition, they showed that glutamine plays an anti-inflammatory role and, as it is involved in the secretion of heat shock proteins (HSP), essentially serves as a source of protection for the body. This study was a cross-sectional, randomized, crossover and single-blinded controlled trial with a placebo (n = 11, 3 dropouts). Data collection took place during two distinct periods of the swimming competition season (phases A and B). Each participant received either the glutamine supplement or placebo during phase A and vice versa during phase B. The initial hypothesis stipulated that supplements with glutamine (0.6 g/kg fat-free mass) administered amongst elite swimmers before (ten days), during (three days), and after (five days) a competition would limit the plasma glutamine and salivary immunoglobulin A (IgA) drop caused by the competition. Also, it was assumed that supplementation would limit the presence of inflammation (C-reactive protein and haptoglobin) while stimulating the production of HSP- 72, reducing URTI and GD incidence and positively affecting indicators associated with recovery (assessed by a questionnaire: the RESTQ-Sport). As a second hypothesis, it was stipulated that the competition would have a physiological impact on the athletes. v The results of the trial, derived from traditional statistics and exploratory unsupervised multivariate statistical analyses (principal component analysis), showed no associated benefits for the athletes who received the glutamine supplement. No significant differences were observed between experimental groups in regards to concentrations of plasma glutamine, salivary IgA, CRP, haptoglobin and HSP-72. The RESTQ-Sport values were slightly influenced by the supplement, however. Although the sum of eight URTI severity symptoms appeared reduced in the group who received the upplement, very few athletes had contracted an actual infection, according to the definition used. Within the supplemented group, the incidence of gastrointestinal disorders was only significantly reduced in Phase B of the project. Lastly, with regards to the impacts of competition, no significant differences were compiled before and after competition measures. In summary, chronic supplementation of glutamine administered before, during, and after a swimming competition does not appear to have any benefits on the supplemented group of swimmers. However, given the presence of several methodological limitations beyond the study’s control and stemming from the nature of competitive sports, it would be incorrect to assert the ineffectiveness of glutamine supplementation on elite swimmers. These challenges further emphasize the complexity associated with the study of this very specific group. Thus, in subsequent research projects, verifying the effects of glutamine supplementation on an elite group of athletes will continue to be of the utmost importance. Given the complexity of obtaining a large homogenous sample size, increasing the frequency of measures will be necessary in order to compensate for large intra- and inter-individual variability in responses.	inflammation , Glutamine supplementation , plasma glutamine , immunity , inflammation , swimming	en	20747.0
478	Évaluation des facteurs reliés à la violence familiale dans le cadre de la jurisprudence portant sur la garde d'enfants	"Violence against a family member, also called "" family violence "", is frequent in child custody cases heard by the Superior Court, Family chamber. The trial judge must therefore analyze the delicate question of determining which custody arrangement must be given to the parent who committed family violence. Is there a risk for the child’s safety, his health or his well-being ? Is shared custody still possible ? Nothing is ever black or white. Certain factors related to family violence will militate in favor of a limitation of contacts and/or a supervision between the perpetrator and his child, while other factors will have no effect. The author will therefore analyze factors relative to the people implicated in cases of family violence, who are the victim and the perpetrator. Also, she will examine factors related to the act, either by the nature, the seriousness, the recurrence and the temporal context, in order to highlight Quebec jurisprudential trends on the matter."

479	Analyse de la morphologie buccofaciale et des voies aériennes supérieures chez des porteurs de prothèses complètes souffrant des troubles du sommeil	Problematic: Controversy concerning the relationship between between anatomical parameters of the upper airways and obstructive sleep apnea exist in the literature. Although some studies have shown a correlation between some of these parameters and the presence or severity of obstructive sleep apnea, other studies have not demonstrated any association. Despite the current use of three-dimensional radiology technology, the full potential of available information does not appear to have been totally explored. Objectives: The main objective of this study was to assess the strength of the correlation between various upper airway parameters and the obstructive sleep apnea and to determine to what extent anatomical parameters can predict the presence of sleep apnea. Methods: The study used a descriptive analytical design and was nested in a large randomized controlled study on the impact of nocturnal wear of the prosthesis on the sleep apnea. Data were obtained from 28 completely edentate individuals (65≥) who had an apnea hypopnea index (AHI) ≥ 10. Obstructive sleep apnea was measured by the use of polysomnography. The information regarding the upper airway anatomical parameters and sociodemographic data were obtained by the use of Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) and auto-adiminstered questionnaires consecutively. Bivariate statistical analyses and linear regression models were used to analyse the data.. A p ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: The study participants mean AHI was 21.0 ± 10.6. Any association was found between the individual upper airway anatomical parameters (unaffected by the contact between the uvula and the posterior wall of the pharynx) and the apnea hypopnea index. The automatic regression model showed that 38% of the variance of AHI could be predicted by a combination of anatomical parameters (p = 0.004) including planes passing through the posterior nasal spine and through the tops of the uvula and epiglottis into a sagittal plan. Conclusion: A combination of anatomical parameters rather than individual parameters seems to be associated with obstructive sleep apnea.

480	Une précarité menant à l’expérimentation : limites de l’engagement syndical face aux aspirations de jeunes travailleurs québécois	Ever since the recession in 2008, global markets have faced hardships which had significant repercussion on vulnerable populations, such as professionals of generation Y.  A trend originating from Mediterranean Europe instigated a gradual disappearance of standard jobs, herein defined as salaried activity performed in a singular environment and on a regular schedule. Risking periods of unemployment, young people must embrace flexible work conditions such as part time employment, fixed-term contracts and freelance work. Faced with a systematic inability to obtain permanent jobs, young Quebecers take on community involvement on the basis that it has the potential to conform to their personal qualities and skills, even though it does not possess comparable material and social benefits. Professional and social insertion takes place for many of them through a portfolio of citizenship values, which allows young people to perceive their initiation to adulthood through elective activities. These are not part of a remunerated work arrangement, be it standard of flexible. Among the multiple means of emancipation available outside the areas of work, the renewal of unionism will be the focus of this Master’s thesis in wake of its potential to join the expressive and instrumental finalities of work. Taking the mantra of organising the disorganised, the leaders of this movement seek to expand their activities further than the sole protection of workers’ rights. However, this new direction did not resonate with the young adults who participated to this inquiry, citing the rigidness of their respective unions. In their place, they chose to get involved in a variety of activities and organisations for their ability to adapt to their needs as well as their personal values.

481	Les cultures stratégiques canadiennes et l’opinion publique : une étude de la représentativité du gouvernement libéral de 2015 à 2017	The salience of international issues during the Canadian political debates in 2015 suggests that the election of a liberal government would mark a shift in defense policies when compared to those pursued be the conservatives. In view of the ideological polarization among these elites, one could question the political representativeness of their foreign policy decision-making. Using a strategic culture approach, this paper provides an empirical assessment of the coherence between the current government’s strategic preferences and the preferences of the public. After reviewing the typical Canadian strategic cultures, a first section studies the LPC campaign platform and defence policies from 2015 to 2017. The second section examines the public’s preferences in regards to foreign affairs through the statistical analysis of a Canadian Electoral Study. Two sets of preferences help differentiate the position held by the groups: the nature of the military intervention and the nature of their strategic allies. We conclude on a general correspondence between the strategic culture shown by the government (halfway between internationalism and atlanticism) and by the population (internationalism), but acknowledge the difficulty of comparing such heterogeneous preferences and accept the idea of a tension within these cultures.

482	Le cynisme et le christianisme, un rapport de proximité et de distance	The present paper is intended to be a contribution to the debate that opposes or brings cynicism closer to Christianity, which constitute two modes of thought or at least two modes of life, each with its own doctrine, specific characteristics and conveying a message that tends for different purposes. Indeed, in view of the objectives pursued by each of them, cynicism and Christianity present themselves in the form of two diametrically opposed currents. However, paradoxically, the two ways of life meet halfway; use the same transmission belts and value each other. The aim of this study is to show how this encounter between the two wisdoms takes place without, however, making them into any fusional union. This would have been regrettable for both sides since such a situation would have destroyed their own identity and made them pass for derivatives. This survey highlights the types of relationship the Cynics have with the Greek deities. Relations that overlap between a certain form of belief and piety, recognition of the existence of the gods and even of a single god with a triumphant nihilism. Then, it addresses the thorny problem of the coexistence of the two movements. Some characteristic traits of cynical philosophy, such as religious indifference, immorality, naturally prevent a sincere and lasting union between cynicism and Christianity. Finally, thanks to the study of certain hypotheses and some cases of encounters that tradition has attested, the existence of close links between the two currents has been established. In short, despite the shattering and inevitable clashes resulting from their antithetical vision, cynicism and Christianity have forged alliances firmly cemented by aversion to the common enemy.

483	Étude des discrétisations superconsistantes et application à la résolution numérique d’équations d’advection-diffusion	This thesis develops the work of Fatone, Funaro et al. on superconsistent discretizations. We first give a precise definition of superconsistency and how it relates to consistency. We then suggest an explicit approach to constructing a superconsistent scheme from a linear operator and we apply the method to the advection-diffusion operator which we find, for example, in advective diffusive problems and the Navier Stokes equations. Both an analytical study and some numerical tests are provided. The choice of problems is made so that the diffusive term is small compared to the advective term. Solutions to such problems typically contain a boundary layer and classical centered finite difference methods may display some spurious oscillations in and near that layer. In contrast, solutions obtained with the superconsistent method are far more stable. In this work, only problems in one and two dimensions are treated since three dimensional problems would be too demanding on computational resources.

484	Virtual Sophrologist : un système de formation de relaxation par neurofeedback en réalité virtuelle	Relaxation techniques can relieve us from stress, anxiety, pain, and diseases. Many researchers succeed in relaxing subjects by various methods. However, few are concerned about the ability of relaxation. Hence, the main goal of this study is to help people relax faster. We developed a virtual reality neurofeedback relaxation training system, called Virtual Sophrologist, which immerses users in fantastic environments by a Virtual Reality headset, guides users to follow the Sophrology instructions by a female voice, and displays feedback in real time, which is translated from the Meditation Score collected by EEG. To evaluate this system, we recruited 6 subjects to participate in our 8-session relaxation training and collected their subjective data (by self-report) and objective data (by an EEG headset) to measure the psychological level and to calculate the Time Interval to Relaxation that they took to reach the maximum Meditation Score. The results show decreases in Anxiety and Depression Score from the psychological level, a decrease in Time Interval to Relaxation and an increase in the maximum Meditation Score. Therefore, our system will be useful as a training tool for users who need or want to experience a fast and deep relaxation, whenever they need.

485	Le management des services d’identité judiciaire : Pratiques et perceptions des dirigeants policiers du Québec en matière de criminalistique	Along with investigators, lawyers, judges and intelligence analysts, police decision-makers represent an integral part of a group of non-scientific actors directly involved in the use of forensic science. They especially hold powers and responsibilities which can influence the quality and role of crime scene units within the organization they lead. However, at a time when forensic science faces several challenges about its contribution to crime investigations and its ability to provide accurate and relevant evidence, very few empirical studies have shown interested in the police managers' point of view. Therefore, the present study aims to understand how Quebec law enforcement decision-makers perceive the forensic science and how they manage the resources given to crime scene units. To do this, 18 semi-directive interviews were conducted with Quebec police managers who must deal with crime scene units within the organization they run. The results particularly raise that although police leaders have a certain level of knowledge in forensic science, they conceive the latter as an exclusively reactive discipline dedicated to the identification of offenders. They also tend to perceive the work of crime scene investigators as a technical and mechanical task rather than seeing it as a scientific process. In a context where police leaders must deal with many issues, this study highlights both the interest for a better understanding of forensic science in the decision-making sphere of Quebec law enforcement agencies and the benefit of a better coordination between police managers and the scientific and academic community in the province.

486	Corridas en textes et en images : pour une esthétique de la blessure chez Michel Leiris et Ernest Hemingway	During the inter-war period, Michel Leiris and Ernest Hemingway were part of circles composed of painters, photographers and drawers invested in various collaborative projects. Michel Leiris and Ernest Hemingway represent both sides of the cult of bullfighting, to which a whole generation of artists and intellectuals have joined since the early 1920’s. In their works, the imagination of bullfighting is translated through a profusion of images, in praesentia or in absentia. Although criticism has sometimes focused on the influence of painting or on the bullfighting theme in the works of Leiris and Hemingway, a silence surrounds the entanglement yet essential between images, texts and bullfights.   When reading their literary work, a certain number of questions arises: in what way is the view indispensable to the advent of bullfighting? How are the text/picture arrangements thought? To what extent is bullfighting conceived as an art, or rather as a place where all the different arts enter into dialogue? In the course of this work, the chosen direction lies at the crossroads between the thematic criticism as conceived by Michel Collot and the intermedial approach (more precisely his study of the text/image relationship). I will report on the different types of images that punctuate the works of the corpus, essential relays of an aesthetic of the wound. In the novel L'Âge d'homme and the collection Miroir de la tauromachie by Michel Leiris, as well as in the novel Mort dans l'après-midi and the short story « L'Invincible » by Ernest Hemingway, I will discuss the singular aesthetic that binds to the bullfighting theme, expressed by the arrangement of visible wounds.

487	"""Je ne veux pas être condamnée au viol à perpétuité, et toi?""  : luttes féministes québécoises contre les violences sexuelles (1970-1983)"	"The 1970s and early 1980s saw an explosion of activity and, above all, visibility of feminist groups in the province of Quebec, many of whom worked on the issue of sexual violence. Feminist activists played a central role in the problematization of this form of violence - yet the literature about their activities remains virtually non-existent. The purpose of this work is to trace the history of feminist activist struggles against sexual violence from the early 1970s to 1983, when the Bill C-127 (Canadian sexual assault act) came into effect, by portraying their claims and their discourses. This work is based on the private archives of three Centre d’aide et de lutte contre les agressions à caractère sexuel (CALACS), on four interviews with feminist activists active during the period concerned and on the content of feminist periodic Québécois Deboutte! (1972-1974), Têtes de Pioche (1976-1979) and La Vie en rose (1980-1987). In this research, it is shown that some Québec feminist groups, by organizing themselves around the common issue of the liberation of women, have created distinctively feminist discourses on the issue of sexual violence by creating broad definitions and by attributing the cause of this violence to a harmful socialization of genders, itself maintained by a patriarchal system. At the same time, they have transformed their own understanding of the category ""woman"" and its attributes. These groups have engaged in an attempt to eradicate sexual violence through various activities, mainly within three axis: the creation of services for victims, public awareness campaigns and political actions. In the end, they built a network of Centres to help and fight against sexual violence, contributed to the debate about the laws framing this type of violence in Canada and made sexual violence a public problem in Québec by rendering it visible."

488	Validité de la Batterie Rapide d’Efficience Frontale (BREF) comme mesure prédictive de la récupération suite à un traumatisme craniocérébral	Background: The Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB) has been shown to be useful in several clinical settings. The aim of the present study was to examine the performance of patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) on the FAB and to predict their acute outcome. Methods: The FAB was administered to eighty-nine patients with mild (27=uncomplicated and 39=complicated) and moderate (n=23) TBI during hospitalization in acute care setting. The length of stay in days (LOS), the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Revised score (GOSE) and the Disability Rating Scale (DRS) scores were collected. Results. Results showed no significant differences between the three groups but age and education were significantly associated with the FAB score. Parietal lesions were associated with lower performances on the total FAB score, similarities, motor series and conflicting instructions subscales, while frontal lesions were associated with lower performance on the motor series and conflicting instructions subscales. Total FAB score was significantly correlated with all outcome measures and together the FAB total score and the Glasgow Coma Scale score explained 30.8% of the variance in the DRS score. Conclusion. The FAB may be useful clinically to acutely assess frontal and parietal lobe functions at bedside in patients with TBI and can enable clinicians to predict early outcome.

489	The embodied mind in sleep and dreaming : a theoretical framework and an empirical study of sleep, dreams and memory in meditators and controls	Recent theories of cognition have stressed that the mind is an embodied process, one involving brain, body, and environment. Many aspects of cognition, from waking sensorimotor coping with the world to other aspects of the mind, such as metaphor and abstract thought, have been explicated under this framework. Sleep and dreaming, however, have only rarely been approached by embodied mind theorists. In this dissertation, I draw on work in phenomenology, enactivism, and the cognitive science of sleep and dreaming, I aim to show that dreaming is an embodied process of sense-making in the dream world. This work has three main goals: 1) to argue that the dreaming mind is embodied; 2) to clarify the links between bodily experiences and oneiric mentation; and 3) to test whether increased bodily awareness as a trainable skill contributes to global changes in the way that the mind treats information in sleep.  The first goal is a novel proposal in dream science. In this work, I review evidence for embodied dreaming and propose a theoretical and practical framework for neurophenomenological research (Article I). I propose that dreams are embodied in a number of different ways. First, many dreams contain representations of body or bodily movement. Second, dreams are experienced from a first-person point of view, and have a spatial quality. Third, dreams are structured by emotion and affect, and thus are rooted in the body. Finally, sleeping and dreaming bodies are not independent of each other; their permeability is exemplified by intensified dreams, parasomnias (Article II), and studies of somatosensory stimuli incorporation into dream content.  The second goal is to investigate some of the concrete ways in which somatic sensations or alterations in habitual perception of the physical body affect dream content. I review the current state of knowledge on sleep paralysis as an illustration of sleep-dependent alteration in bodily experience (Article II), and conclude that bodily experiences in sleep paralysis (pressure on chest, unusual sensations, and others) provide information about the myriad ways an altered sense of the body changes one’s perception of the environment, affects qualities of one’s intersubjective relationship with the world, and provides insight into the fundamental subjective features of the sense of space. Additionally, results of our empirical study show that somatosensory ankle stimulation at sleep onset and during REM sleep produces a variety of changes in dream content.  The third goal is to study whether contemplative training, which has been shown to increase bodily self-awareness, produces changes in procedural learning, sleep architecture, sleep-dependent memory consolidation and dream content. We showed (Article III) that Vipassana meditators and controls had distinct patterns of sleep-dependent memory consolidation: improvement on a procedural learning task was associated with sleep spindle density in meditators, while control participants had a strong relationship between improvement on the task and REM sleep duration. Additionally, we found a reduced sleep spindle frequency in meditators, suggesting that body-based meditation practice may have long-term effects on sleep organisation and function.  Overall, the results of this inquiry point to the conclusion that dreaming is an embodied process of sense-making, textured by memories and affect, and that the dreamer is not disconnected from their body or the outside world. Furthermore, training in bodily awareness may produce global changes in sleep architecture and sleep cognition, including dreaming and memory consolidation. These results have theoretical and practical implications for research on functions of sleep, dreams and the role of the body in subjective experience.	stimulation somato-sensorielle , sleep , dreaming , enactivism , phenomenology , memory , meditation , sleep spindles , REM sleep , somatosensory stimulation	en	20637.0
490	Un labo à soi : l’idéologie DIYbio de démocratie des biotechnologies et la conjonction entre facultés manuelles et autonomie	After decades of social struggles over the democratization of biotechnologies, societies from all corners of the globe witness the burgeoning of « Do-It-Yourself Biology » (DIYbio). In the wake of the open-source and DIY/Maker movements, DIYbio claims that every citizen should be able to freely appropriate and make bio-artefacts. Accordingly, it undertakes the democratization of biotechnologies by putting them in the hands of the public. This doctoral dissertation seeks to understand this democratic model, to grasp the social and cultural stakes of the intertwining between individual autonomy and bio-innovation on which it is grounded, as well as and its neoliberal echoes. At the crossroads between science studies and critical theory, this study delves into the DIYbio democracy through its ideological content, understood here not in a derogatory sense, but rather as a vision of the world. Each chapiter explores the hypothesis that the democratic model of DIYbio rests on a displacement of the ideal of political autonomy, its center of gravity moving from mental towards manual faculties. This gives rise to what I call the « autonomous laboratory », a notion analogous to the concept of public sphere. The ideology of the autonomous laboratory is examined in constant dialogue with its technoscientific alter ego, namely synthetic biology. This twofold perspective highlights how both the sociopolitical and the scientific domains share a common cherishing of manual faculties as the prime medium of their activities. Conceptually, this study draws on the epistemological foundations of the hacker culture. The corpus analysed consists of qualitative interviews conducted with actors of the DIYbio network, of observations within Canadian DIYbio groups, and of documentary data. Through discourse analysis, this dissertation brings to light six pillars of the ideological structure of the autonomous laboratory: the sociocultural identities of the adherents—grouped as artists, techies and biotechnoscience academics—and their quest for individual autonomy in bio-experimental work; the ideal of a research model rooted on self-referentiality and normative self-determination, which fosters a bio-experimental laissez-faire process at the expense of social mediations (such as abstract knowledge, peer judgement, academic education) that ground the practice of science as a collective activity; the reliance of bio-experimental autonomy on the innovation regime; the technological mode of existence ascribed to living entities and the view of ethics as an individual responsible act of conduct; the democratization of intellectual property over biological entities; and lastly, the combination between a sociopolitical commitment to genetic engineering and a positivist representation of the public opposition to gene technologies. I suggest that the ideological cornerstones of the autonomous laboratory meet the exigencies of a “neoliberal democratization” of biotechnologies, and that the DIYbio hands-on approach to democracy reveals, all in all, a disengagement from deliberative democracy biddings. Rather than the ideal ethics of discussion, it favors the open-source hacker ethos ingrained in the individual autonomy on innovation.

491	Le rôle du stade 2 du sommeil non-paradoxal et des fuseaux de sommeil dans la consolidation de la mémoire motrice séquentielle	From infancy to old age, motor learning is part of our everyday life. After learning a new motor skill, our brain continues to reinforce its memory trace. This process is known as “memory consolidation”, in which sleep is thought to be a key period. However, there is still no consensus concerning the sleep stage when consolidation of a motor sequence memory trace takes place, although there is increasing evidence pointing towards stage-2 non-rapid eye movement (NREM2) sleep. Some of this evidence suggests that sleep spindles, hallmark features of NREM sleep, are associated with improvement in consolidation. Yet, these reports are only correlational in nature. Hence, the aim of this thesis is to identify the sleep stage during which motor sequence consolidation occurs and define the involvement of sleep spindles in this process. To tackle these objectives, we used a finger tapping task paired to an olfactory targeted memory reactivation (TMR) paradigm. Participants were trained to a motor sequence learning (MSL) task while being exposed to an odor. The same olfactory stimulus was used during sleep as a cue to reactivate the memory trace of the newly learned motor task. In the morning, consolidation was assessed through a retest session of the same task. The first study probed the role of sleep stages by comparing motor performance gains between groups cued in NREM2 and rapid eye movements (REM) sleep. It also assessed the effect of cuing on sleep spindles characteristics. Results showed that participants cued during NREM2 sleep showed greater gains in performance at retest than those cued during REM sleep or those not conditioned but exposed during NREM2 sleep. Furthermore, they demonstrated that cuing led to increases in frequency and amplitude of parietal sleep spindles only. Finally, we found that cue-related changes in specific spindle frequency bands predicted the overnight gains in performance. In the second study, building on our previous findings, we investigated how parietal NREM2 sleep spindles interact with other frequency bands locally and between cortical regions (connectivity). Results showed that TMR stimulation instigated increases of concomitant activity in lower frequency bands (delta [1-4 Hz], theta [4-8 Hz]) preceding and following spindles, and increases within the high-beta (25-30 Hz) band during spindles. These changes were found particularly over motor and associative areas. We also reported enhanced connectivity between task-related regions in the sigma band as well as widespread increases in the delta and theta bands. Together, both studies demonstrated the importance of sleep and its constituents, namely NREM2 sleep and spindles, in the consolidation of motor sequence memories. Indeed, they showed that the newly learned memory trace can be reinforced during NREM2 by the use of an olfactory stimulus leading ultimately to an enhanced motor performance in the morning over and above normal behaviour, while the same effect does not appear to occur with REM sleep. They also demonstrated that sleep spindles are instrumental to the consolidation process although its effect relies on a complex interaction between multiple frequency bands, including delta, theta and high-beta, both locally and inter-regionally. Overall, this thesis underlines the significance of NREM2 sleep spindles’ contribution to motor sequence consolidation. Importantly, building on decades of work, it lays the groundwork for studying the role of sleep spindles in memory consolidation within their temporal, topographical and frequential context.

492	Long-term dyadic adjustment of parents of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia : couples’ experiences from treatment completion to survivorship	Survival rates for pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have gradually improved over time, with the vast majority of children diagnosed with this chronic disease surviving. Although this is encouraging news for the patient and his family, being diagnosed and treated for this disease in childhood still requires considerable adjustment on the part of the sick child and the family, especially for the parents. Following their child’s diagnosis, parents often take on additional responsibilities to care for the sick child and these responsibilities go beyond their pre-existing parental responsibilities. Such demands can be very cumbersome for parents at individual and relational levels. Several empirical studies and reviews have focused on the psychological adjustment of parents to pediatric cancer, but only recently has the emphasis been placed on the impact of pediatric cancer on parents’ relationships. Although these studies were fundamental in deepening our understanding of couples' functioning, they mainly used individual approaches for their analysis and focused on short-term adjustment experiences either shortly after diagnosis or when the child is still being treated. There is still little data on the long-term adjustment of couples. The main goal of this thesis is to propose a dyadic approach to understand the long-term psychological and relational adjustment experiences of parents of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).  The first article served as an initial test of the selected dyadic approach, the Actor-Partner Interdependence Model, with a longitudinal cohort of parents whose child was diagnosed and treated for ALL. In particular, this article examined whether the marital adjustment of partners two years after their child’s diagnosis could be predicted by partners’ perceived mood states and their perception of family functioning at the time of diagnosis. Forty-seven couples completed self-assessment questionnaires to assess these areas at the time of diagnosis (parental moods, family functioning and initial marital adjustment) and two years later (marital adjustment). Mothers’ marital adjustment at the end of their child’s ALL treatments (two years after diagnosis) was associated with their own perceptions of family support, role conflicts and role overload at the time of diagnosis. Fathers’ marital adjustment at the end of treatment was associated with their own role conflict, role ambiguity and fatigue at the time of diagnosis, as well as the partners' perception of role conflict at the time of the diagnosis. Based on the results and experiences of this first study dyadic and extending our analysis to the survival period, our second article examined the associations between long-term adjustment of couples and memories of past relationship dynamics with their partner. A follow-up cohort of 103 couple of childhood ALL survivors were asked to think back to when her child was treated and remember the nature of the relationship changes (negative change, no change, positive change) occurring on specific relational dimensions, such as intimacy or sexuality. They were also asked to describe their current psychological well-being and relationship functioning. The results show that the partners within couples tend to agree on the nature of relationship changes that occurred after their child’s diagnosis. Mothers’ describing stronger current relationship satisfaction was associated with their own perception of positive changes in their relationship, whereas fathers’ stronger interpersonal relationship was associated with their partner’s perception of positive relationship changes. Mothers’ current psychological distress was associated with their own perception of relationship changes and fathers’ current psychological distress was associated with both their own and their partner’s perceptions of relationship changes. These results suggest that the psychological and relational adjustment of mothers of children with ALL is an individual process, while the adjustment of fathers is a mostly interdependent process, hence supporting the necessity of using a dyadic approach to understand these couples' adjustment. In order to foster both partners' adjustment, clinicians should focus on addressing each partner's needs, especially those of mothers.

493	Entraîner le contrôle attentionnel chez la personne âgée : perspective comportementale et cérébrale	The main objective of this thesis was to evaluate the effect of cognitive interventions on attentional control using behavioral measures and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The thesis comprises five empirical articles. The aim of the first study (Chapter II) was to examine the cause of age-related differences in attentional control. The results suggest that, compared to younger adults, older participants have more difficulty varying the level of attention to be allocated to each task according to the attentional focus that is required, reflecting a difficulty with attentional control. The second study (Chapter III) aimed to compare the effectiveness of three types of computerized attentionnal training in older adults. The results show specific effects depending on the type of training received. Only the older participants who followed the VARIABLEpriority training, in which they had to vary the level of attention allocated to each task across several blocks, showed improvement in their attentional control skills following training. This improvement cannot be explained by repeated practice in the tasks under focused attention or in the dual-task condition without attentional variation. The aim of the third study (Chapter IV) was to assess whether the benefits of VARIABLE-priority training could transfer to tasks similar to those trained and to tasks that are more representative of everyday life, using an immersive dual-task paradigm in virtual reality (VR). The results show that VARIABLE-priority training improves attentional control abilities and, for the first time, that the beneficial effects of this training can be transferred to a dual-task paradigm in VR in older adults. Furthermore, we show that older adults benefit as much, if not more than younger adults, from an intervention aiming to improve attentional control, and that age does not have an effect on the transfer effects observed. The fourth study assessed (Chapter V) the impact of attentional training on changes in fMRI activation. The results suggest that the brain is highly plastic, even in old age, and that the changes in activation are different depending on the type of intervention. VARIABLEpriority training, which aims to teach attentional control strategies and metacognitive abilities, is the only one that produces increases in activation in a frontal region involved in multitasking and attentional control. Repeated practice of a task under focused attention, on the other hand, causes decreases in activation in regions that were previously recruited. Finally, the aim of the fifth study (Chapter VI) was to evaluate the time course of activation changes across three fMRI sessions. An increase in activation followed by a plateau in regions related to the strategies learned for the VARIABLE-priority training is observed, while the activation changes following repeated practice are characterized by an inverse U-shape function. The results of the latter study show that activation changes are non-linear during training and, similarly to the results obtained in the fourth study, are modulated by the type of intervention followed.

494	Étude de la formation d'agrégats de défauts ponctuels et d'impuretés de lithium dans le silicium cristallin par méthodes Monte-Carlo cinétique	This thesis, including three scientific articles, split in two parts: ``Theoretical, Methodology and Algorithmic'' and ``Simulations, Analysis and Results'', concerning our results on atomistic numerical methods as well as their application on systems based on crystalline silicon.  The first part consisting of three chapters introducing the problematic about activated process followed by the use of the transition state theory to address this thematic. Then we will discuss the key point of the kinetic Monte-Carlo method, with a review of advances that has been made so far. The second chapter presents the kinetic Activation-Relaxation Technique (kART), an off-lattice kinetic Monte-Carlo algorithm with on-the-fly catalogue building based on the Activation-Relaxation Technique nouveau (ARTn). ARTn is a powerful open-ended saddle search method, handling the long-range elastic effect completely. The first part ends with our first article, which addresses in detail the recent algorithmic additions, from the five past years, made to kART.   It is followed by the second part, consisting of three chapters, whose chapter four is a contextualization of: basic properties of silicon such as its crystalline phases; a definition of the various types of points defects existing in crystals; a presentation of interatomic potentials used; an introduction about the random telegraphic signals (RTS) noise; binary phases of c-LiSi; a discussion of the quick amorphisation of the c-Si anode during the first lithiation. Chapter 5 explains the aggregation and details pathways of diffusion of intrinsic defects in crystalline silicon. Jay \textit{et al.}~\cite{Jay2017} work, with our complete and precise preliminary results, led to a better understanding of random telegraphic signal (RTS) noise observed in highly damage semiconductors by correlating the oscillatory motion of vibrational states of small clusters of intrinsic defects present in these materials. Chapter 6 characterized energy states of the various configurations of systems with low concentration of lithium impurity in crystalline silicon. Thanks to kART, we show that impurities of lithium weakly interact, formed clusters shortly dissociate due to a non-negligible configuration entropy contribution.

495	Estimation de paramètres en exploitant les aspects calculatoires et numériques	In this thesis, we are mainly interested in the estimation of parameters. It consists of three papers in which we discuss estimation problems in specific models.  In the first paper, we consider the Farlie-Gumbel-Morgenstern parametric family of copulas. The observations come from a distribution that involves both the copula and the margins, through the decomposition of the Sklar's theorem. Margins are unknown. In the estimation of a function of the parameter of the copula, pseudo-likelihood is often used instead of the likelihood. It is an approach that will generally produce non-efficient estimators, especially for small sample sizes. In pseudo-likelihood, margins are replaced by estimators that depend on the ranks. We propose to use the rank-likelihood, which is the likelihood based on the distribution of the rank statistics. This approach can be complex in practice because we work on the permutation group and we calculate multiple integrals. However, it is possible to do the calculations for the Farlie-Gumbel-Morgenstern family of copulas. We compare the estimators obtained from these approaches using the Bayesian method. The results of numerical studies are presented.    Some estimators found in the literature are ratios of normal random variables. In the second paper, we are interested in the distribution of the ratio of two normal random variables. Several authors have addressed this subject. The new parametrization that we introduced allows us to obtain new results faster and effortlessly. Firstly, we show that the expression of the density of the ratio can be written as a mixture of densities belonging to a new family that we create. We find some properties, and we give the analytic expression of the characteristic function for the new family. This new family is in fact a generalization of the family of densities of Student distributions having odd degrees of freedom. We obtain convergence results  generalizing the one for Student distributions when the degree of freedom tends to infinity. Similar results of convergence as well as some properties are developed for the distribution of the ratio. We use a Bayesian approach to estimate the ratio of the means of two normal random variables. Graphical illustrations and simulation results are presented.   In the third paper, we extend the family of distributions, resulting from the difference of two independent random variables having a gamma distribution, by considering the case where these random variables are positively correlated. The densities in this family are found. Their complex forms make tedious the estimation methods based on the likelihood. The estimation method based on the characteristic function is used, and the continuous approach is compared to the discrete approach. Moreover, we developed two simple algorithms for generating data from two positively correlated and identically distributed random variables having a gamma distribution. The best equivariant estimator for the scale parameter is obtained in the case of independence.

496	Travail du sexe chez les personnes qui s’injectent des drogues : impact sur les comportements à risque et associations avec l’infection par le VIH	Recent analyses have shown an emerging association between sex work and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) incidence among people who inject drugs (PWIDs) in the SurvUDI network, a biobehavioral survey conducted in Central Eastern Canada since 1995. The main objective of this study was to identify correlates of HIV infection among people who inject drugs and report sex work (PWID-SWs) in this network, after stratification by sex, and to compare these correlates to those of sexually active participants who did not report sex work. HIV prevalence was higher among PWID-SWs than among their non-SWs counterparts, and PWID-SWs were particularly vulnerable to HIV infection as a result of higher levels of vulnerability factors and injection risk behaviours. Risk taking patterns also varied according to gender, with a large proportion of injection risk behaviours being associated with HIV among women and, conversely, a stronger association between sexual behaviors and HIV prevalence being observed among men. These results emphasize the need for specific interventions taking gender and sex work into account.	Canada , People who inject drugs , Sex work , Risk-taking behaviours , HIV	en	20557.0
497	Programme d’amélioration de la qualité de la surveillance de la thérapie anticoagulante orale en fibrillation auriculaire en pharmacie : une étude pilote intégrée au Réseau STAT	About 1%-2% of the general population is affected by atrial fibrillation (AF), with higher prevalence in the older population. For these patients, the risk of stroke is up to five times greater than for those without AF. Guidelines recommend oral anticoagulant agents in a majority of AF patients to prevent thromboembolic events. Close monitoring is needed to achieve adequate anticoagulation while avoiding bleeding complications. However, a practice gap exists between guideline recommendations and real world use of oral anticoagulants in patients with AF. Moreover, very few studies have evaluated the quality of anticoagulant management by community pharmacists.  A first study, involving an experts group, led to the development of a quality indicators (QIs) list to evaluate oral anticoagulant (vitamin K antagonist (VKA) and direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC)) management in AF patients by community pharmacists. A second study assessed the feasibility of implementing a quality improvement program in this field through a practice-based research network (Réseau STAT) and explored the impact of the program on the quality of therapy management and pharmacists’ knowledge. The program included an audit with feedback based on QIs previously developed and specific training activities. The results suggest the program is relevant in community pharmacy. Indeed, although the time in the therapeutic range of international normalized ratios (INRs) for patients on VKAs and adherence to DOACs were initially high, the overall quality of oral anticoagulant management and pharmacists’ knowledge at baseline were low. The feasibility of providing the program through the Réseau STAT was demonstrated. Participation and satisfaction rates were relatively high. Lack of time was the most important reported barrier. Finally, over a six-month period, improvements in the quality of clinical practices and pharmacists’ knowledge were observed.

498	The Effects of Neuroligin-2 Absence on Sleep Architecture and EEG Activity in Mice	Sleep disorders are comorbid with most psychiatric disorders, but the link between these is not well understood. Neuroligin-2 (NLGN2) is a cell adhesion molecule that plays roles in synapse formation and neurotransmission. Moreover, NLGN2 has been associated with schizophrenia, but its implication in sleep remains unexplored. In the present thesis, the effect of Nlgn2 knockout (KO) on sleep architecture and EEG activity in mice has been investigated. Two electroencephalography (EEG) electrodes were implanted above the right hemisphere in Nlgn2 KO mice and littermates to record EEG for four consecutive days. Vigilance states (wakefulness, rapid eye movement sleep [REM sleep], non-REM sleep [NREM sleep]) were identified on 4 sec epochs and vigilance state duration was calculated. Spectral analysis was performed on epochs without artifact using a Fast Fourier Transform. Nlgn2 KO mice showed more wakefulness and less NREM and REM sleep compared to wild-type (WT) mice. The changes in wakefulness and sleep durations originated from alterations during the 12h dark period because KO mice exhibited normal sleep/wakefulness duration during the 12h light period. The relative power spectra showed a significant genotype effect for fast frequencies (25-50Hz) during all vigilance states, with KO mice having less activity than littermates. The KO mice exhibited increased spectral activity at 2-5 Hz during NREM sleep. Moreover, abnormal burst of EEG activity was identified in the KO mice during wakefulness and REM sleep. These data suggest that NLGN2 participates in the regulation of sleep duration as well as EEG activity during wakefulness and sleep.

499	Rôle de la Galectin-3 extra cellulaire dans la migration des cellules B à travers les barrières du système nerveux central dans le contexte de la sclérose en plaques	Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS), hallmarks of the disease are an important infiltration of immune cells and demyelinating lesions in the CNS of patients. A key event in the disease is CNS barriers’ loss of integrity that allows the migration of immune cells, including B cells, from the blood to the CNS. Migration is regulated by many parameters, among which, the expression of molecules enabling adhesion to the endothelial cells of the CNS barriers. Proteomic data from our lab identified galectin-3, a pro-inflammatory protein, as potentially involved in B cells’ migration toward the CNS. Moreover, galectin-3 could add to B cells pathogenicity. Our results show that healthy donors’ whole blood B cells as well as effector B cells in vitro express galectin-3 on their surface. Moreover, effector B cells are able to secrete galectin-3. In vitro assay revealed that galectin-3+ effector B cells express more pro-inflammatory cytokines than galectin-3- effector B cells. However, a temporary decrease of IL-6 and IFN-γ expression is induced when effector B cells are treated with galectin-3. Furthermore, exogenous galectin-3 can bind to B cells’ surface but it doesn’t influence their migration through in vitro models of the SNC barriers. In addition, we could detect galectin-3 in MS patients’ cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum, the latter showed increased concentration compared to healthy donors’. Moreover, we evidence that MS patients’ B cells express more galectin-3 on the cell surface than healthy donors’. In conclusion, our results don’t support the initial hypothesis that galectin-3 enables B cells’ migration through CNS barriers and galectin-3’s influence on B cells pathogenicity in vitro seems to depend on its concentration. But galectin-3’s increased expression in MS patients suggests that it could be implicated in the disease.	migration , galectin-3 , multiple sclerosis , central nervous system , central nervous system barriers , B cells	en	20537.0
500	Changing chronic disease primary care patients' participation through web training : does it make a difference?	Context: Effective communication between physicians and patients can improve health outcomes. We propose that increases in patient participation can lead to better recall of treatment information and reaching treatment goals. Few experimental studies evaluate recall and physiological health outcomes. Objectives: To assess, in patients suffering from chronic diseases and not reaching treatment targets, 1) the impact of a web-intervention promoting patient participation on health outcomes as compared to usual care (study A); 2) Assess what characteristics of physician-patient communication predict patient recall of medication information discussed during the encounter (study B).  Methods: This study used a single blind randomized controlled trial. Patients were randomized into three groups: a) usual care, b) web intervention (e-Learning) and c) combined web intervention and workshop (e-Learning + workshop). Physicians, coders and research assistants extracting data from patients’ charts were blinded to patient allocation. Context: This study was performed in nine urban primary care ambulatory clinics in Ontario between March 2009 and September 2010. Population: Physicians were chosen using a convenience sample and the following eligibility criteria: 1) been in practice at least five years and 2) had a practice orientation including adult chronic disease patients. Patients were considered eligible if they met the following criteria: 1) 40 years or more of age 2) ability to speak English, 3) comfortable using a computer for routine activities such as regular access to the web and e-mail, 4) have a routine follow-up visit scheduled within three to four months of study enrollment, 5) allowed access to their medical records, and 6) not meeting Canadian guidelines for treatment targets and pharmacologically treated for at least one of the following three diseases: hypertension, type II diabetes, and/or dyslipidemia. Study interventions: The web intervention was based on Cegala’s PACE communication approach (Prepare, Ask, Check, Express). Participants in the e-Learning + workshop group benefited from an additional workshop that role-played the same skills. Variables and instruments: Medical encounters were audio-recorded. Physician-patient communication was analyzed with MEDICODE and the Roter Interaction Analysis System. Health outcomes, such as meeting target goals on recommended blood pressure, glycated haemoglobin and lipid profiles were assessed through values extracted from medical records (study A). Patient recall was assessed through answers to a post visit questionnaire completed immediately following the encounter answers compared to audio-recordings (study B). Statistical analyses: Reaching treatment goals was analysed with a modified Poisson regression. The analysis of recall was performed with linear mixed models.  Results: Of the patients meeting eligibility requirements (n=322), 221 participants came to their follow up medical visits. Participants in the e-Learning group had a greater likelihood of meeting their treatment goals compared to usual care (RR=1.52, 95% CI [1.008-2.30]) (study A). For recall analyses, 159 patients were included. Out of six possible medication themes two and a half were broached and less than one was recalled. Discussions with more medication themes, greater dialogue and patient initiative were significant predictors of improved information recall (study B). Conclusion: The results of the two studies provide evidence that patient participation in medical encounters has positive impacts on reaching treatment goals and recall of treatment information. Web-based tools promoting patient participation are important additions in managing chronic disease.

501	Induction de lexiques bilingues à partir de corpus comparables et parallèles	"Statistical models try to generalize knowledge starting from the frequency of probabilistic events in the data. If more data is available, events are more often observed and models are more e cient. Natural Language Processing approaches based on those models are therefore dependant on the quantity and availability of these resources. Thus, there is a permanent need for generating and updating the learning data. This dependency touches Statistical Machine Translation, which requires multilingual resources. This thesis refers to four articles tackling two tasks that contribute signi - cantly to this dependency: the Bilingual Documents Alignment (BDA) and the Bilingual Lexicons Induction (BLI). The  rst publication describes the system submitted for the BDA shared task of the WMT16 conference. Developed on a search engine, our system indexes bilingual web sites and tries to identify the English-French pages linked by translation. The alignment is realized using a ""bag of words"" representation and a bilingual lexicon. The tool we have developed allowed us to evaluate more than 1,000 con gurations and identify one yielding decent performances on this particular task. The three other articles are concerned with the BLI task. The  rst one focuses on the so-called standard approach, and proposes a breadth parameter exploration in the Semantic Web context. The second article compares the standard approach with more recent techniques based on interlingual representation of words, or the so-called embeddings, issued from neural networks. The last contribution reports the enhanced global performances on the task, combining the outputs of the two studied approaches through supervised reclassification."	corpus comparable , embedding , Parallel corpus , Comparable corpus , Alignment , Bilingual lexicons induction , Word representation , Supervised reclassification	en	20488.0
502	Rôles de Trio dans la migration des interneurones GABAergiques corticaux	Epilepsy can result from a loss of balance between the levels of excitation and inhibition in the brain. Epileptic seizures manifest themselves by uncontrolled limb movements and epileptic activity on brain wave recordings (EEG). Possible defects in the development of inhibitory neurons may cause an increased excitability of the brain cells and underlie such seizures. To better understand the genetic causes of epilepsy, the laboratory of Dr. Rossignol conducted a gene sequencing study of a large cohort of children diagnosed with infantile spasms, a severe form of early-onset epilepsy. Among the newly identified genes, sequencing revealed mutations in the TRIO gene. In the literature, this gene was already associated with intellectual disability and was noted as a vital participant for axonal guidance and cellular motility in various organisms. However, little is known about the role of this particular gene in the development of inhibitory neurons. The objective of the study is to investigate the roles of Trio in the migration of these inhibitory interneurons in mice by exploring the processes that lead to the migration of these inhibitory neurons to their final position. With the utilization of ex vivo electroporation and a shRNA driven by the Dlx5/6 promoter, we repressed the Trio gene in cortical GABAergic interneurons during the prenatal stages of mouse development. Our results demonstrate that the loss of function of the Trio gene in embryonic mice leads to defects in the morphology of inhibitory neurons and in a reduced number of interneurons reaching the cortical plate. Our rescue experiment suggests that defects in interneuron morphology might result from deregulation of the RhoA signalling pathway. Overall, our results expand our understanding of the roles of TRIO in the regulation of cortical circuits development.

503	L’elocutio en 1 Corinthiens : inventaire, stratégie et herméneutique	This dissertation analyzes 1Co as a work of Greek literature from the 1stcentury. The heuristic hypothesis is as follows: there is an epistoral style which Paul used to convey his message the best he could. As the letter was meant to be read, and is also a discourse, it played with the modalities of both writing style and orature, which is what makes its style distinctive. This research focuses on elocutio, an element that defines style in rhetorics, and which covers all processes, whether lexical, syntactic or poetic, that characterize the mode of expression. Our study proposes a thorough, in-depth reading of 1Co, allowing the text to reveal its aural dimension. The methodology includes a phase of identification of the most frequent processes that support the orality of Paul's writing. With this inventory, the main stylistic traits are identified. The poetic process illuminates the thematic development of the missive, whose dynamics is proper to dialogue and whose sound cartography suggests that the letter has to be voiced aloud. The conclusion reached by such a reading is that orality is an essential component of Paul's strategy in 1Co. There is a link between the style used by the author and the purpose of the letter. We can then speak of a hermeneutics of orality. Based on the criteria which Walter Ong suggested to distinguish orature, this thesis proposes a definition of the elocutio of 1Co, which shows to what extent Paul’s poetics was meant to serve his policy. This one is twofold: to rectify and to edify. Between a fighting style and a style of reconciliation, the letter deploys a discourse fully oriented towards the figure of the resurrected Christ. What had been so far unheard of in Paul’s kerygma gives rise to a stylistic creativity which subverts rhetorics in the broader sense of the term to change it into a rhetorics of conversion.	style , elocutio , 1st century , New Testament , Paul of Tarsus , 1 Corinthians , Epistolary , Rhetoric , Orality , Walter Ong	en	20448.0
504	Methods and physical chemistry of resin-based dental composites	The properties of dental resin composites have improved significantly since their inception, but the fundamental physics behind their properties remain to be explained or modeled comprehensively. The aim of this thesis is therefore to study the fundamental trends and relationships between the filler particles constituting these materials and the resulting properties. Photocalorimetry (pDSC) methods have been used previously to measure the degree of conversion in dental resins, but the measurement parameters have never been adequately assessed. Through systematic variations of the analysis sequence, sample mass, temperature, light intensity, and atmospheric composition, an optimized protocol was established to yield reliable and reproducible results. A series of dental composites was then formulated with spherical silica particles of graded sizes from 75 to 1000 nanometers at different loading levels. The viscosity of these composites before polymerization was measured and used to expand the classic KriegerDougherty suspension viscosity model to account for filler surface area in addition to filler loading. This extended model (EKD) was also used to model composite conversion, resulting in the first unified model of composite viscosity and conversion using only filler size and resin composition. The maximum loading and post-cure mechanical properties of these same composites were also examined. Although the maximum functional filler loading varied according to the filler size, the ultimate flexural strength of the materials depended only on the filler loading. Further tests with these composites showed that filler size was directly responsible for transparency of the materials, with opacity increasing as a function of filler size. This work pushes the boundaries of understanding in dental composites. The newly established protocol for pDSC measurements yields more reliable conversion data, and the EKD model allows for more accurate predictions of dental composite properties directly from their component parts. The guidelines established here can now be used to design new composites with the desired properties of viscosity, conversion, mechanical strength, and transparency.

505	Caractérisation du rôle de SCL dans la mégacaryopoïèse et la thrombopoïèse chez les souris transgéniques	SCL is a transcription factor member of the bHLH family. SCL is expressed in red blood cells, megakaryocytes, platelets and masts cells. SCL deficient mice die at embryonic day 9.5 due to complete absence of primitive erythropoiesis. Two main isoforms of SCL have been identified, a long isoform and a short isoform. SCL’s long isoform is well characterized but little is known about SCL’s short isoform. To understand both isoform’s function in megakaryopoiesis and thrombopoiesis, the laboratory designed transgenic mice overexpressing each isoform under GATA-1 transcription factor regulatory elements. Mice overexpressing SCL’s long isoform produce ~40% more megakaryocytes and twice as much platelets than non-transgenic mice. At the opposite, mice overexpressing SCL’s short isoform produce ~50% less megakaryocytes but thrombopoiesis is not affected. Moreover, both isoforms seem to modulate 2 signaling pathways (c-Mpl/TPO and c-Kit/SCF) involve in megakaryopoiesis. Therefore, these results suggest that megakaryocytes differentiation program is modulated by SCL. Molecular and cellular characterization of both isoform’s function in vivo can help elucidate their different functions. Moreover, these studies could lead to the identification of therapeutic targets in coagulation disorders.

506	Studying cross-talk between different transcriptional pathways controlling azole resistance in Candida albicans	Tac1p and Mrr1p are both important transcriptional regulators of azole resistance in the yeast Candida albicans. Gain-of-function mutations in these factors are responsible for the constitutive upregulation of azole resistance genes in several C. albicans clinical isolates. Both factors can also be transiently activated by specific chemical compounds. Based on the results suggesting that these two pathways may interact, we studied whether Mrr1p is involved in the Tac1p-mediated transcriptional pathway. First, we investigated whether Mrr1p functions in fluphenazine-induced transient upregulation of CDR1 and TAC1, both of which are Tac1p target genes and encode important effectors of azole resistance. The results suggest that Mrr1p plays a complicated role in this process and might suppress the transient induction of TAC1. Second, we studied the role of Mrr1p in hyperactive Tac1p-mediated constitutive upregulation of CDR1 and TAC1 as well as the resulting azole resistance in a well-characterized azole-resistant clinical isolate 5674. We found that Mrr1p contributes to the resistance of isolate 5674 to fluconazole, but that the deletion of MRR1 in isolate 5674 had no impact on the mRNA levels of CDR1 and TAC1. Moreover, we have also shown that the TAC1 transcripts in isolate 5674 have a long 5’ untranslated region and that Mrr1p is not implicated in producing this long TAC1 mRNA. Since some of the results are preliminary, further experiments will be needed to confirm these results and address remaining questions.

507	Analyse comparative des conflits de lois et de juridictions relatifs au contrat d'assurance	This thesis is concerned with the study of the conflicts of laws and jurisdictions relating to the insurance contract. Since insurance contracts are a type of contract that is commonly used, it is worth understanding, notably in the context of economic globalization, what specifically happens to the contract of insurance within the framework of international private relations. In this sense, the rules of conflict of laws and jurisdictions relating to the insurance contract will be considered with regards to the framework of the Rome I Regulation, the Brussels I Bis Regulation and the Lugano Convention, as well as with respect to the private international law of Quebec. Therefore, a comparative law approach will be adopted through this study. It will be noticed among other things that the insurance contract has given rise to various methodological treatments with regards to the resolution of conflicts of laws and jurisdictions. It will therefore be interesting to compare these approaches in order to determine which approach could best achieve the specific objectives of the insurance contract, in particularly, the protection of the weaker party.

508	Les contrats collectifs en droit québécois	"Collective contracts in Quebec law are presented as bilateral acts with the particularity that one of the cocontracting parties detains the power of binding many persons, neither parties, nor represented, nor successor, and such, without obtaining from these persons a personal consent. This particularity creates an important derogation to the relativity of contract principle, a derogation for which the rules for mandate and those of stipulation for another cannot account for. Notwithstanding the term ""contract"", it is tempting to doubt the true bilateral nature of these acts.  After following the evolution of the notion of the collective act, (or unilateral collective act), of which the origins emanate from Germany, then spread to Italy, and subsequently to French law, it is clear that this notion and that of the collective contract are mistakenly mingled.  In Quebec, considering that the notion of a juridical collective act is not yet part of doctrine or jurisprudence, the term collective contract seems to encompass acts, that may well be collectively formed, but that do not necessarily constitute contracts.  This thesis undertakes to adequately categorize three acts, presently assimilated by doctrine and jurisprudence as collective contracts: i) the declaration of co-ownership; ii) the Tendering Code, and iii) group insurance, by classifying them within one of the two classic juridical acts in Quebec's obligation law. To this end, a detailed analysis of the formation of each of these acts is carried out herein, exposing the various privities between the different parties concerned by each of these acts. If the reader is convinced that group insurance truly constitutes a bilateral act, the same is not so for the declaration of co-ownership and the Tendering Code, which rather seem to correspond to unilateral acts."

 la recherche d'un cadre juridique entourant la publicité comportementale"	The emergence of online advertising has allowed advertisers to increase their visibility and to extend their control over the simplest decisions we make every day, ranging from the purchase of a cereal box to the media we consume. To better understand the consumers and to reach them with an unparalleled simplicity, technology has evolved and now allows online tracking of Internet users through the use of tracking cookies. Data aggregators collect unprecedented amount of information about each and everyone, which they use to deliver targeted ads, reflecting the interests and preferences of the individual who receives them. This tracking, generally carried out without the knowledge and consent of the users, often frighten those who discover its existence. The commercial practices surrounding behavioural advertising are little known and the industry seems to want to pursue its activities in the shadows. As a result, it can more easily circumvent its legal obligations with respect to consumer and privacy law. This thesis aims to shed light on corporate practices regarding behavioural advertising, the technologies that support it and the legal framework that governs it.

510	Evaluation et quantification de différents facteurs influençant le temps de traitement orthodontique	INTRODUCTION: One of the main concerns of orthodontic patients is the overall treatment time wearing braces. The patient’s desire is to obtain an aesthetic and functional result in minimum time. Prior to considering approaches which are supposed to reduce treatment time, it is essential to understand the factors that may lengthen it. A quick and efficient correction of the malocclusion is both beneficial to the patient and to the treating orthodontist. This reduces the potential side effects of prolonged treatment (caries, bone loss, white spot lesions, etc.), while allowing the orthodontist to better control office expenses arising from the proper functioning of the clinic. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate and quantify the variables that may influence the orthodontic treatment time. MATERIALS & METHODS: The study included records of 300 retention patients who were treated at the graduated orthodontic clinic, Faculty of dentistry, University of Montreal. Eight of them were excluded due to poor monitoring of their treatment related to health problems or because of lacking data. The following variables were evaluated: patient’s age and sex, the clinical and radiological data related to the malocclusions, the elements used in the planning and execution of treatment and the degree of patient cooperation. Uni-varied analyses (chi-square, t-test and ANOVA) were used to identify variables that affect treatment time. The data distribution normality was evaluated by the Shapiro-Wilk test. A p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Subsequently, a multiple regression analysis was used to build a model to predict the treatment time. RESULTS & DISCUSSION: We found that cooperation was an important factor in the variation in treatment time. Each missed appointment (MA) and each debonded bracket requiring rebonding increased the active time with fixed appliances by 2.3 months and 1 month, respectively. There are numerous variables affecting the duration of the active phase, ranging from planning extractions to other selected treatment protocols. For example, the use of Assure® resin and Transbond XT ™ adhesive resulted in a more effective and shorter treatment time, while limiting the number of debonded brackets. Age had no influence as opposed to the severity of the initial malocclusion (overjet [OJ] and overbite [OB]) which, for example, increased the treatment time by about 10 days per point of discrepancy index (DI) or 0.7 months per millimeter of class II according to the Angle classification. The collected data allowed us to establish the following prediction model: estimated treatment time = 12.606 months + 0.316 (if male) + 0.084 x (OJ value) + 0.301 x (OB value) + 0.339 x (per point of DI) + 0.699 x (Severity of Cl II) + X (type of adhesive) + Y (type of resin) + Z (type of bracket) + 4.297 (if extractions) + 4.163 (if elastics needed) + 1.750 (if clinician graduated more than 15 years ago) + 2.297 x (by MA) + 0.971 x (by the number of debonded brackets). CONCLUSION: This study revealed that the duration of orthodontic treatment is influenced by the following factors in order of importance: extraction (s), cooperation, initial malocclusion, adhesive and resin products, bracket type, clinician’s years of experience and patient gender.

511	L’économique de la pauvreté au cœur d'une ville prospère : perceptions d'usagers d'aide alimentaire	This memoir takes food aid services in Drummondville, an economically prosperous city, as an observatory to make light of the economic social representations of people living a situation of impoverishment and the way these social representations influence how they appropriate food aid. Therefore, we have worked on three levels of observation of the food aid relationship.   The first level of observation was constructed with social-historic and statistical documents about the city and the food aid environments in order to reveal its social morphology. The second level of observation of the food aid relationship was based upon periods of participant observation within two food aid organizations in Drummondville with the goal of grasping the social interactions taking place there. The third and final level of observation consisted of a series of individual open structure interviews with food aid users specifically selected in order to represent a variety of impoverishment types and social appropriation of food aid.  Among other things, we learn that when the social use of food aid is strictly merchant, it can contribute to the reduction of the social network, harming a potential social appropriation of the economy which would be better adapted to a situation of impoverishment. However, in cases where a merchant social use of food aid is accompanied or is gradually replaced with a use more akin to re-socialisation to the environment, resorting to food aid may promote the development of new social regularities and a renewed social appropriation of the economy. Social representations of the economy and the relation to dominant socioeconomic norms preceding the impoverishment situation become altered after facing a situation of impoverishment. A transformation of the relation to the economy occurs.	Food assistance , Economy , Social representations , Poverty , Food security , Food banks	en	20370.0
512	Pure water in the city covering the reservoirs on Mount Royal	The questions of how and why water has disappeared in the urban landscape are explored in this study of the uncovered reservoirs of the Montreal water supply system that were destined to be covered. A case study of three reservoirs, the McTavish (open from 1856 to 1948), the Côte-des-Neiges (from 1893 to 1938), and the Vincent d’Indy (from 1915 to 1964), considers how the form and function of these reservoirs changed, as the relationship between environmental factors, technological means and social concerns evolved in the developing city. In response to advantages and challenges of the city’s topography, the reservoirs were built on the flanks of Mount Royal. The potential the reservoirs offer to expand the mountain’s conservation core is explored in a reconsideration of their situation within a belt of institutional properties that delimit the heart of this principal natural and cultural landscape of the city. A shift in the focus of water supply development from quantitative to qualitative concerns, related to the rise of both public health and environmental perspectives, was a principal incentive to covering water supply reservoirs. Nevertheless, the expense of rebuilding the basins as reinforced concrete boxes covered in earth and sod, and the lack of regulations requiring covers on all reservoirs, lead to the process being delayed for decades. Furthermore, the city was in full expansion throughout this period, so that the pressure to increase the capacity of water storage rivalled that of guaranteeing water quality. The resulting focus on efficiency is embodied in the landscapes of the transformed reservoirs, in which little funds or planning resources were invested. Certain unplanned but critical consequences of this transformation are examined: the disassociation of water supply from the urban ecosystem; the loss of visibility of the waterworks; the decreased recognition of their collective value; the confusion about responsibility for these open spaces and a related lack of upkeep; the concealment of water supply and other technological functions in the mountain landscape; and the lack of integration of the reservoir sites in plans for the mountain’s conservation.

513	L’université québécoise en mutation : entre valorisation du savoir et recherche partenariale	This thesis focuses on the transformation of universities and, more specifically, the impact of their research partnerships with private companies on the role of universities in contemporary Quebec society. To achieve this, the evolution of university research is described: from its integration in the Humboldtian University as an institutional mission, to the valorization of its results in accordance with the discourse emerging from knowledge economy theories. The qualitative analysis is based on semi-directed interviews with professors-researchers experienced in partnership research projects and their designs. These interviews retrace these professors’ daily life as they work in those partnerships. Different topics such as academic freedom, the relationship with the industrial partners and the training of students were discussed. The data collected was analysed from an Habermasian’s perspective which is particularly adapted for studying science and technology development in higher education institutions.	transformation of universities , exploitation of research , university-company research partnerships , knowledge society , knowledge economy	en	20360.0
514	The Predictive Value of Head Circumference Growth during the First Year of Life on Child Traits in Early Childhood	Atypical head circumference (HC) growth during the first year of life has been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, notably autism spectrum disorders. However, its association with socioemotional, cognitive and motor development in early childhood in the normal population is unknown. The objective of this master’s thesis was to assess the predictive value of head circumference growth as an early biomarker of toddlers’ outcomes. More precisely, it investigated the relationship between HC growth from 0 to 12 months, temperament (effortful control, surgency/extraversion and negative affect), cognitive skills and motor skills (fine motor and gross motor) at 24 months in a healthy subsample of children (N=756) from the large-scale longitudinal 3D cohort study of the Integrated Research Network in Perinatalogy of Quebec and Eastern Ontario (IRNPQEO). Results indicate that postnatal HC growth inversely predicts effortful control and surgency/extraversion, but directly predicts gross motor skills in boys. Group comparisons reveal that boys with less postnatal HC growth showed significantly higher effortful control and lower gross motor skills compared to those with normal and faster head growth. This study is the first to demonstrate a relation between postnatal HC growth and specific aspects of child functioning in a healthy population. The results stress the importance of assessing neonatal HC growth and confirm the validity of HC growth as a potential biomarker of normal and abnormal early child development. Nevertheless, further research is warranted to reveal the underlying mechanisms of the relationships and support clinical importance of the findings.	cognition , Head circumference , brain development , temperament , cognitive skills , motor skills	en	20333.0
515	Study on the effects of music on the health of geriatric inpatients	Music has long been used to improve health, communication and quality of life. We used music in a similar perspective inside a Geriatric Assessment Unit. We conducted a randomized controlled study to evaluate the impact of attendance to a live music concert (intervention group, n = 20) compared to a documentary-watching session (control group, n = 16). The primary objective was to determine the effect of the interventions on mobility using the Timed Up and Go and gait speed tests. This was not fulfilled, as the mobility measures data could not be analyzed due to the high variability of the measure and small number of participants (n = 17) who completed the tests, suggesting that assessing the effect of music on mobility may not be feasible in this population. In contrast, the secondary objective of examining the effect on emotions (measured with the Visual Analog Mood Scale and the Observed Emotional Rating Scale which respectively evaluate self-reported and observed emotions) and communication skills (measured with the Communication Behavior in Dementia scale) led to clear results. The participants in the music group experienced enhanced happiness and displayed more pleasure than the participants in the documentary-watching group. Participants in the music sessions also displayed a higher increase of positive emotions and a more pronounced decrease of negative emotions, as compared to the control group. For the communication skills, analyses were not pursued due to only fair inter-rater agreement. The results of this study show that a live music concert can improve emotions in geriatric inpatients.

516	Activités parascolaires et décrochage scolaire au secondaire : liens en fonction des dimensions de la participation	The goal of this study was to examine the relationship between participation in extracurricular activities (ECA) and high school dropout among at-risk youths. Multiple dimensions of participation were considered, such as continuity and intensity, to verify if they modified this link. Based on the few studies conducted in the United-States, a lower risk of dropping out was expected among students who were involved in ECA, especially when the participation was of better quality according to a set of dimensions, like greater intensity and longer duration of participation. Theses hypothesis were tested among a sample (N = 545) of adolescents between 14 and 18 years of age (M = 16.5 SD = 0.9) recruited from 12 schools in and around Montreal, Canada. Controls variables (e.g., parental education, academic achievement) were integrated in multiple logistic regressions in addition to considering the nested structure of the data (student within schools) and the individual likelihood of being involved in ECA. Results showed that participation in ECA was associated with a lower risk of dropping out (OR = 0.32; 95% CI = 0.17-0.61), but only when the participation was maintained throughout the year. The continuity of participation has thus proved to be an important dimension of participation, unlike other dimensions which did not demonstrated any significant additional contribution to better predict high school dropout.

517	Apprentissage et productivité lors de la saisie de données chez des adultes présentant une déficience intellectuelle	Due to stigmatisation and limitations associated with their diagnosis, most adults with intellectual disability (ID) do not have access to competitive employment. Notably, individuals with ID often experience difficulties in learning new tasks as well as with achieving high productivity, which create barriers to their social participation. Considering these difficulties discussed in the research literature, we assessed the effects of different interventions on learning and productivity. First, we identified the essential components of video instruction for two participants with ID while teaching them to enter data on a computer. For both participants, video modeling (VM) and self-instruction (SI) alone did not result in learning data entry. In both cases, it was necessary to add a prompting procedure in order for them to master the skill. The results indicate that the addition of a prompting procedure to VM and SI is necessary for some individuals. Second, we assessed the effects of differential reinforcement of high rates of behavior (DRH) on the productivity of four participants with mild or moderate ID. For all participants, DRH increased productivity. However, none of the participants achieved a level of productivity comparable to the standard norm for this task. The results indicate that using DRH to increase productivity is an interesting solution, but that it may be necessary to add another intervention to maximize productivity. In general, the results show that individuals with ID can learn data entry and increase their pace of data entry when provided with adequate support.

518	Liens entre les représentations sociales des professionnels concernant les familles noires et leur décision de signaler un enfant noir à la Direction de la protection de la jeunesse	In Montreal, black children are overrepresented at the reporting stage of Child Protective Services, for situations primarily communicated by the mandated reporters who encounter them in their professional capacity, without being in greater need of protection than their non-black peers, according to the Child Protective Services assessment outcomes. This thesis explores the possibility that there is an inherent bias as it applies to professionals who are mandated to make reports, leading them to be particularly concerned about black children’s safety. A qualitative secondary analysis has been conducted on the discourse of 33 professionals mandated to report regarding their representations of the black population and their intended actions when confronted with a black child in psychosocial difficulties. The results present a typology of mandated reporters for black children in four types and two subtypes. The types are distinguished from one another by the assignement of responsibility for the difficulties encountered by the black population, as well as the professional’s cultural knowledge of the black population, among other factors. The discussion focuses on three main themes: the significant differences in actions chosen to support black families in difficulty; the centrality of corporal punishment in the reporter’s social representations of the black population; and the role of discrimination recognition in the disproportionate representation of black children at the threshold of Child Protective Services.	overrepresentation , child protective services , reporting , black families , social representations	en	20321.0
519	Perspectives critiques sur la laideur : possibilités esthétiques et artistiques	This research is an attempt at redefining the aesthetical and artistical issues related to the progressive « liberation » of ugliness from the classical paradigms of modern aesthetics. The emancipation of ugliness is foremost one from traditional art philosophy, in which ugliness is usually reduced to the mere absence of beauty. Even nowadays their remains some difficulties to consider ugliness in art from an aesthetical point of view. However, it must be made clear that the present paper is not suggesting that ugliness cannot be « unaesthetic »  – it surely can be. Therefore, this paper is to be understood as an exploration of the various possibilities related to the concept of ugliness, one of which is its participation in a full-fledged aesthetic experience. This discussion should lead us to describe and better understand the modalities of this concept and how they interact with each other. Inspired by Adorno’s aesthetics and Jérôme Stolnitz’ emotionalist account of ugliness in art, ugliness will be redefined dialectically, as describing a properly human relationship with alterity, as well as a subjective satisfaction which can be defined within the traditional account of « negative pleasures », similar to what can be said regarding the use of horror and the sublime in arts.

520	L’ontologie de la causalité adoptée par David Hume : un new Hume debate de peu de conséquence pour le monde	Some scholars argue that David Hume believes that there exists a real connexion between causes and effects beyond our perceptions. This way, they are opposed to another interpretation arguing that he would deny such a connexion. In this master thesis, I will show that he rather is an agnostic of some kind about the subject. However, I will also show that this is a false debate, because the commentators agree on all key elements. The work has four parts. First, I will summarize aspects of Hume’s philosophy that are essential to the debate: his theory of ideas, his analysis of causality, and his definition of belief. Second, I will examine the realist interpretation in order to show, despite first appearances, that it is perfectly coherent with the Humean epistemology. Third, I will evaluate its main arguments and maintain that they are all weak. Fourth, I will show that this debate is fundamentally about semantics.

521	Contrôle nerveux de la respiration chez la lamproie	Respiration is an essential rhythmic motor activity maintained throughout life. Neural networks called “rhythm generators” are responsible to produce rhythmic muscular contractions necessary for respiration in all vertebrates. These neural networks have been studied in mammals, but their detailed organization remains unknown. We used the lamprey as an animal model of a basal vertebrate to study respiratory neural networks. An important advantage of this experimental model is that we can record both groups/or single neurons in an intact brainstem preparation in vitro. Two repiratory rhythms can be observed in the lamprey: a fast rhythm (main rhythm) and a slow rhythm. Past studies have demonstrated that the fast rhythm is generated at the rosto-lateral pole of the V motor nucleus, a region named the paratrigeminal respiratory group (pTRG); whereas the slow rhythm was shown to be generated in the caudal part of the rhombencephalon by a caudal respiratory group (CRG) of neurons.  The results of this thesis have first characterized anatomically and physiologically the connections between the pTRG on both sides of the brain, as well as the connections between the pTRG and the respiratory motoneurons. We found that the pTRG contains different populations of neurons: neurons projecting towards their contralateral homologue and neurons projecting towards the respiratory motoneurons exclusively of the same side, or both sides of the brain. Our recordings of pTRG neurons have demonstrated that the neural activity of the latter is in phase with the respiratory rhythm. We have also shown that these neurons possess a complex axonal arborisation, including bilateral projections   towards groups of respiratory motoneurons in the brainstem, as well as connections linking the pTRGs on both sides.  Secondly, we have characterized, for the first time, the localization and the partial organization of the neural networks underlying the generation of the slow respiratory rhythm. Anatomical experiments have revealed the presence of populations of neurons distributed along the respiratory motoneuronal columns in the caudal part of the rhombencephalon. More precisely in the medial and lateral tegmentum, in the rdV, in the region close to the sulcus limitans, as well as through and in close proximity of the motor nucleus VII, IX and X. These neurons send projections to the other side and to the pTRG. Physiological experiments have shown that the activation of the regions comprising the different populations of neurons of the CRG, along the respiratory motoneuronal columns, is able to produce long bursts of discharges characteristic of the slow rhythm. Conversely, the bilateral inactivation of approximately one third of the caudal rhombencephalon abolishes that rhythm (VIIm/IXm/Xm (rostral part) et Xm (caudal part)). Moreover, we have demonstrated that we could abolish the slow rhythm without affecting the fast rhythm, in an intact brainstem preparation in vitro. Finally, intracellular recordings have found that the CRG region possesses neurons that show a rhythmic activity in phase with the slow rhythm.  In summary, our results demonstrate that the pTRG possesses neuronal networks presenting connection patterns capable of supporting the bilateral synchronization of the fast respiratory rhythm, as well as neurons projecting to the pTRG on the other side, adding redundancy and stability to the respiratory system. At last, our results also   demonstrate that the slow rhythm is generated by neural networks distributed bilaterally along the motor nucleus of the VII, the IX and the X, covering the whole length of the caudal rhombencephalon of the lamprey. As for the pTRG, the projections from the CRG towards its contralateral homologue, as well as the projections towards the pTRG, assure the bilateral synchronisation of the slow rhythm and its interactions with the fast rhythm.	respiration , CPG , CRG , pTRG	en	20282.0
522	Physiothérapie pour les travailleurs blessés indemnisés : exploration des enjeux éthiques, organisationnels et systémiques dans trois provinces canadiennes	In Canada, physiotherapists play significant roles in the care of injured workers with musculoskeletal injuries who are supported by a workers’ compensation board. As part of their practice with these patients, physiotherapists face many challenges, including ethical ones that can influence the provision of care. However, the experiences of physiotherapists working with this clientele remain underexamined. This thesis has two main objectives: 1) conduct an in-depth empirical exploration of ethical tensions experienced by physiotherapists when treating injured workers supported by a workers’ compensation board; and 2) examine how policies from workers’ compensation boards and physiotherapy clinics influence physiotherapy care for these patients. To meet these objectives, we used a qualitative framework called Interpretive Description. We first conducted two focus groups with six physiotherapists and seven physiotherapy technicians from Quebec. Next, we conducted individual interviews with 30 physiotherapists and 10 leaders or administrators working with professional groups or workers’ compensation boards in three Canadian provinces (British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec).   In the first section of the thesis, results demonstrate that physiotherapists would like to offer care that is equitable, competent and respectful of their professional autonomy, but that many challenges limit the actualization of these three values in their practice with injured workers (objective 1). These challenges include the difficulty for physiotherapists to manage some aspects of the return to work process, their lack of knowledge about the compensation system, barriers to sharing professional responsibilities with other providers, and the need to resist stereotypes regarding injured workers.   In the second section of the thesis, results illustrate how current workers’ compensation boards and physiotherapy clinics’ policies modulate the organization of care and physiotherapists’ practices with injured workers (objective 2). Participants highlighted policies that they viewed as contributing to better patient care and also those that had a detrimental effect on the care they provide.    In sum, this thesis provides new insights into the ethical, political, organisational and systemic dimensions of physiotherapy care for injured workers supported by workers’ compensation boards in Canada. These analyses provide a new and rich understanding of the experiences of physiotherapists working with this clientele.

523	Méthode acoustique basée sur l'agrégation érythrocytaire pour le suivi non invasif de l’inflammation	"Any patient undergoing major surgery is at risk of developing a systemic inflammatory syndrome. When disproportionate inflammation occurs, the blood becomes very viscous and the transfer of oxygen to the tissues is weakened. This often causes organ failure and ultimately death. Nevertheless, inflammation is less harmful if detected and treated early. Currently, detection of inflammation is based on the monitoring of vital signs, such as body temperature and respiration rate, or on the estimation of blood markers of inflammation. The first method has the disadvantage of lacking specificity. Blood markers, on the other hand, are direct and quantitative measurements of the patient's inflammatory state but involve blood sampling and processing delays that prevent continuous monitoring of the patient. These difficulties the automation of the evaluation of inflammation and can delay the diagnosis and the associated treatment, especially in the cases of perioperative cares. This thesis presents a set of works aimed at the noninvasive detection and monitoring of inflammation by analyzing the ultrasound signal backscattered by blood. The motivation of the proposed methodology is to continuously monitor the patient's inflammatory response and reduce the time before treatment. The general principle used in the method exploits the collective reaction of red blood cells to the presence of acute phase inflammatory proteins, in particular fibrinogen. Indeed, the concentration of these macromolecules correlates positively with the force of intercellular attraction. Thus, under low flow conditions, the level of erythrocyte aggregation serves as a surrogate marker of the patient's inflammatory state. Although the erythrocyte aggregates are not large enough to be observed in an ultrasound image, they leave a spectral signature on the backscattered blood signal. By fitting the blood spectrum to physical or mathematical models of acoustic diffusion, it is possible to obtain quantitative parameters of clinical interest, such as the size or spatial organization of the aggregate. This type of analysis belongs to the field of quantitative ultrasound which seeks the characterization of tissues from its spectral signatures commonly referred to as the backscattering coefficient. The first objective of this thesis is to evaluate from a clinical point of view the interpretation of the parameters obtained from the ultrasound signal of the blood. Five mathematical models of acoustic backscattering, including both classical and recent versions, were evaluated. In ex vivo experiments and in a preclinical study, we observed that when the erythrocyte aggregation increases, in particular by an inflammatory process, certain parameters offer an excellent contrast and allow its classification. It is concluded that the ""structure factor and size estimator"", ""effective medium theory considering a structure factor"" and the ""Gaussian"" models allow the characterization of several levels of erythrocyte aggregation and are good candidates for the evaluation of the inflammatory reaction in clinics. Pioneer works on the measurement of inflammation required that ultrasound acquisition would be done in an invasive fashion. This fact plays against the general interest of the technique and makes its use impossible in the intensive care room. A second objective of this thesis is thus to propose a protocol for the non-invasive measuring of erythrocyte aggregation. The analyzed solutions concentrate on the compensation of the confounding factors intrinsic to the in vivo measurement, in particular the blood flow. It was observed that the cessation of blood flow rendered the technique sensitive to the previous flow conditions and played against its repeatability. Conversely, ex vivo experiments showed that maintaining a low-flow provided repeatable measures and could distinguish between normal and high extents of erythrocyte aggregation. Validations on a cohort of eleven volunteers showed that the low-flow protocol also offers good in vivo repeatability and correlates significantly with ex vivo laboratory tests of erythrocyte aggregation. Finally, by aiming at the transfer of technology to clinics, the third objective of this thesis was to evaluate the reproducibility of results using ultrafast imaging methods and clinical ultrasound machines. Indeed, previous works on the characterization of erythrocyte aggregation were done with single element transducers, typically used in fundamental research. However, the transducers used in the clinics are equipped with more than a hundred of piezoelectric elements. This configuration allows the formation of focused ultrasound beams as well as ultrafast imaging techniques. Our ex vivo validations demonstrated that the use of these new technologies is quite possible for the characterization of erythrocyte aggregation and leads to results comparable to those of previous technologies."

524	Caractérisation immunogénétique des cellules dendritiques non-conventionelles dans un contexte auto-immun	Dendritic cells (DC) play a key role in the immune system by bridging the innate and adaptive immune system using their Antigen Presenting Cell (APC) function. They can be subdivided into several subsets with distinct features, which are involved in either tolerogenic or inflammatory processes. Variations in the in vivo number of those DC subsets have been associated with genetic susceptibility to certain diseases, such as autoimmune diabetes.  However, proving a causal connection from these correlations remains a challenge, as we have not identified the factors involved in the specific regulation of the DC subsets number, limiting our ability to modulate theses phenotypes independently. Thus, we aimed to identify genetic determinants responsible for the specific regulation of DC subset numbers using linkage analysis in mice, to then determine if autoimmune diabetes susceptibility varies following DC subset modulations.  We have shown an increase in pDC number in NOD mice, which is genetically susceptible to autoimmune diabetes. This phenotype is regulated by a dominant locus on proximal chromosome 7, but it not associated with diabetes incidence in congenic mice. In contrast, we also observe an increase in the number of a novel DC subset, termed mcDC, which is regulated by a distal chromosome 2 interval. This locus, termed Idd13, is also associated with diabetes genetic susceptibility, suggesting a vital role of mcDC in disease, possibly through their T cell anergy reversal function.    These results show that DC subsets are regulated by distinct determinants.. Despite the correlation between pDC/mcDC number and autoimmune diabetes susceptibility, our results demonstrate a divergent contribution of DC subsets to pathogenesis. We shall investigate further to refine genetic intervals and identify the candidates genes involved in the regulation of both pDC and mcDC in vivo number.	immunologie , Dendritic cells , Auto-immunity , Genetics , Diabetes , Immuno-deficiency	en	20265.0
525	L'autonomie reproductive des femmes et leur prise de décision vis-à-vis du Test Prénatal Non-Invasif : étude comparative Liban-Québec	Non Invasive Prenatal Testing (NIPT) based on the detection of cell free fetal DNA in maternal blood has transformed the landscape of prenatal care by offering clinical benefits over existing prenatal screening tests. Requiring a simple blood test, NIPT is non-invasive and thus carries no risk of pregnancy loss and detects fetal aneuploidies such as trisomy 21, 18 and 13 with high specificity and sensitivity as early as the 10th week of gestation. NIPT has expanded rapidly and is currently commercially available in most of the world. As NIPT spreads globally, culturally sensitive and ethically sound implementation will require policies that take into consideration the social and cultural context of prenatal testing decisions. In a western context, the main ethical argument for providing access and public funding of prenatal tests is the promotion of reproductive autonomy, by enabling pregnant women and couples to access information about the fetus in order to choose a certain course of action for pregnancy management: either to continue the pregnancy and to prepare for the birth of the future child or to terminate the pregnancy. In this thesis, we aim to explore how the framework of reproductive autonomy is operationalised in a non-Western cultural context and what are the factors that come into play when pregnant women and couples accept or decline NIPT testing. Therefore, we used Quebec, Canada and Beirut, Lebanon as case studies to explore what ethical considerations related to reproductive autonomy should guide the implementation of the test in various cultural contexts. To answer this question, we conducted a qualitative study based on semi-structured interviews to 1) explore the perceptions, values and preferences of pregnant women and their partners about NIPT and 2) to examine how these perceptions, values and preferences influence reproductive autonomy and NIPT decision-making in these two cultural settings, Lebanon and Quebec. The data analysis showed that all participants in Quebec and Lebanon considered NIPT to be a positive advance for prenatal testing technology. However, when comparing NIPT decision-making processes we identified several significant differences and some important similarities with respect to the different factors deemed to influence couples’ and pregnant women’s NIPT decision-making. Among others, the presence of the technology itself, the personal beliefs or views of couples and pregnant women on abortion and pregnancy management, the relationship with the partner and the healthcare professional and the financial resources, including NIPT cost and its coverage by the healthcare system or insurance companies. Decision-making surrounding NIPT is a complex process requiring a consideration of the different elements that come into play to shape such decision. Therefore, an understanding of the socio-cultural context and the diverse factors that play a role in the decision-making process is crucial to preserve women’s and couples’ contextual reproductive autonomy and to guide any clinical or policy implementation decisions.

526	Caractérisation de la régulation des nouvelles cibles transcriptionnelles du facteur de transcription ETV6 dans la leucémie lymphoblastique aiguë	B-cells acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) accounts for 22% of all childhood cancer cases. Among the genetic aberrations identified in B-ALL, the translocation t(12;21)(p13;q22) is the most frequent one. This translocation generates a chimeric protein between the transcription factors ETV6 and RUNX1. Although some oncogenic phenotypes have been associated to ETV6-RUNX1, its presence alone is not sufficient to induce leukemogenesis. The deletion of the 12p13 locus bearing the ETV6 gene is observed in approximately 70% of t(12;21) positive B-ALL cases, suggesting that the complete inactivation of ETV6 is a complementary event required for leukemic transformation. Despite the high occurrence of ETV6 abnormalities observed in hematological disorders, few studies have focused on its molecular function. To better understand the impact of ETV6 inactivation in B-ALL, I used expression data from leukemic cell lines and patients to identify its transcriptional targets. Together with the mapping of ETV6 binding sites obtained from chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments, I constructed its regulatory network and highlight the complexity of its transcriptional function. Functional studies have unveiled a new function for the CLIC5 target gene in protecting cells against oxidative stress.  To further characterize ETV6 at the molecular level, I designed a genome wide shRNA screen and identified genes involved in its transcriptional function. The impact of some of these genes on ETV6 transcriptional network confirmed their role as modulators. In this regard, AKIRIN1, COMMD9, DYRK4, JUNB and SRP72 are broad modulators of ETV6 function whereas some others act specifically on certain targets. This study is the first to have focused on genes involved in the functional regulation of ETV6 in leukemia. The results obtained throughout this thesis have greatly improved our knowledge of the ETV6 transcription factor in B-ALL. The integration of various approaches has highlighted the complexity of its regulation and will allow a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying its role in hematological disorders.

527	L'indifférence à l'avenir : réification et aliénation	Philosophy, according to Theodor Adorno, should be the knowledge of the reasons “why the world—which could be paradise here and now—can become hell itself tomorrow” (“Why Still Philosophy”). It is in this perspective that this master’s thesis explores how the phenomenon of indifference, understood as a posture that ensues from a mediated detachment from the world and which manifests itself notably through apathy, powerlessness and the coldness of individuals toward others and the social order, can help to explain why possibilities for a better future appear blocked. To this end, we limit our analysis to two concepts that have greatly influenced Adorno and that provide precious indications with respect to the causes of this indifferent detachment: reification (Verdinglichung) and alienation (Entfremdung). We start from the hypothesis that this indifference is essential to the reproduction of the logic of capitalism. In the first chapter, we begin by studying Georg Lukács’ 1923 essay “Reification and Class Consciousness” in order to learn what his ideas of “contemplative attitude” and of “indifference of form towards content” may teach us about this indifferent detachment. We complete this first chapter by examining what the figure of Odysseus, as analyzed in Theodor W. Adorno’s and Max Horkheimer’s Dialectic of Enlightenment (1947), tells us about the fundamental ambiguity of indifferent detachment which, as constitutive of thought itself, is capable of engendering the worst, while also holding a promise of justice. The second chapter is dedicated to Marx’s Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844 and to his notion of alienated labor. We show how alienated labor contributes to the reproduction of this detachment from the world which, in turn, tends to block the possibility of real collective action. This analysis of labor nevertheless hints toward ways to fight back against this indifférence à l’avenir.

528	Rôles non-canoniques des arrestines dans la signalisation et l’endocytose des récepteurs couplés aux protéines G	G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) form the biggest family of membrane receptors and are involved in numerous physiological processes. Collectively, these receptors are also prominently targeted by the pharmaceutical industry due to their implications in multiple diseases and disorders. GPCR signaling is tightly regulated. Several kinases, activated downstream of the receptor, initiate negative feedback loops; and arrestins play a crucial role in these regulatory processes by desensitizing the ligand–activated receptor and promoting its endocytosis. By doing so, arrestins control the duration and the amplitude of signal transduction at the cell surface. In the last few years, several non-canonical roles have also been attributed to arrestins, such as the post-endocytic activation of several signalling pathways, or the regulation of crosstalks between GPCRs and various other signalling events. My thesis project was aimed at providing a better understanding of the non-canonical functions of arrestins.  The first objective of my research work was to investigate a possible reciprocal effect of the activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) on GPCR signaling. We demonstrated that stimulation of ERK1/2, either by a cell surface receptor or a constitutively active mutant, leads to a reduction in steady-state expression levels of many GPCRs at the cell surface. This receptor redistribution mechanism is dependent on beta-arrestins phosphorylation. In vitro kinase assays combined with complementation experiments in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) lacking beta-arrestins, revealed that beta-arrestin-2 phosphorylation on Ser14 and Thr276 is essential for the ERK1/2-promoted GPCR sequestration. This ERK1/2- and arrestins mediated regulatory process was found to result in a global dampening of cell responsiveness. The second objective of my research work was to identify and develop a small organic compound that inhibits the interaction between arrestins and the adaptor protein AP-2, without interfering with the recruitment of arrestin to the receptor. This inhibitor, named Barbadin, was found to specifically block endocytic processes that are dependent on the interaction between arrestins and the appendage domain of the b-subunit of AP-2. We demonstrated its value as an analytical tool in studying the role of the arrestins in GPCR signaling, such as cAMP production and ERK1/2 activation. These results support the concept that beta-arrestin/AP-2-dependent signaling is important to both G protein-dependent and -independent pathways. The third objective of my research work was to develop a BRET-based biosensor able to detect signal-dependent PTEN conformational changes. This biosensor was validated by monitoring PTEN activation induced by targeted mutations affecting key intramolecular interactions or by modulating signalling pathways that impact PTEN function. We also demonstrated the value of this biosensor in studying PTEN/protein interactions using two known interactors that activate PTEN, beta-arrestin-2 and RhoA. Finally, we uncovered PTEN activation by several GPCRs, previously unknown as PTEN regulators. Given the central role of the tumor suppressor PTEN in oncogenesis, this biosensor could also provide a precious tool for anti-cancer drug research. To conclude, my research work highlighted non-canonical mechanisms for arrestins to activate GPCR-dependent signaling pathways, such as cAMP, ERK1/2 and PTEN, as well as negatively regulate GPCR signaling upon phosphorylation by ERK1/2. This work was made possible by the development of new tools: a beta-arrestin inhibitor named Barbadin and a PTEN BRET-based biosensor that have both shown their usefulness in studying beta-arrestin noncanonical signaling.

529	Le sens dans la vie revisité par Susan Wolf	“What gives my life meaning?”  This question reaches new perspectives with the work of the philosopher Susan Wolf. The purpose of my master’s thesis is to present the account of Susan Wolf’s in Meaning in Life and why it matters and to discuss the interest and the limits of the conditions that she exposes. Wolf distinguishes two dimensions of an action (or an engagement, interest or project) that gives meaning: the subjective and the objective. They are both required as conditions that an action must fulfill to possibly contributes to the meaningfulness of a person’s life: «Meaning arises when subjective attraction meets objective attractiveness» (Wolf, 1997, 305; Wolf, 2010, 9). Thus, her account invites us to recognize new reasons in normative ethics to justify an action. These are “reasons of love”. According to Wolf, this type of reason bears its own legitimacy and cannot be reduced nor be subsumed under the concepts of happiness or morality, essentially because it has an intrinsic value. The implications of this theory open the way both to a better understanding of the human being and to a conception of the good life which is more inclusive in normative ethics. Wolf suggest that no one can tell another what should give meaning to their life, but each one must develop the reflexive capacity that permits the narrative and subjective endorsement of what makes his life better and meaningful as well. And that’s the role of philosophy.	Susan Wolf , meaning , meaningfulness , value , ethics , reasons of love , love , philosophy , normativity , objectivity	en	20223.0
530	Nouvelles fonctions du co-activateur transcriptionnel PGC1A dans le foie	The inability of the liver to respond to metabolic stresses such as high fat diets causes the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It is a liver disease that affects 25% of the population of industrialized countries. It can progress to a more severe stage: steatohepatitis, characterized by inflammation, oxidative stress and fibrosis. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is strongly associated with the development of insulin resistance, that is, the body's inability to respond to insulin, and with type 2 diabetes. NAFLD is difficult to diagnose early and we lack tools to understand molecular mechanisms underlying its progression. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC1A) is a transcriptional coactivator, able to bind to transcription factors to regulate their function in response to metabolic stresses. Reduction of PGC1A expression in the liver has been associated with the development of insulin resistance and NAFLD. Moreover, genetic variants of PGC1A are also associated with the development of type diabetes and NASH. However, the causal role of PGC1A in the development of these diseases, and its role in molecular mechanisms of hepatic insulin response are unclear. We hypothesized that lack of PGC1A expression in the liver aggravates the progression of NAFLD to steatohepatitis and affects the liver's response to insulin. In this thesis, we show that PGC1A is necessary for the hepatic response to oxidative stress - especially in female mice. Indeed, PGC1A is able to bind to the estrogen receptor to induce the cellular antioxidant response. Lack of PGC1A causes liver damage and the appearance of severe steatohepatitis. We also show that PGC1A controls the hepatic response to insulin during fasting by modifying the adapter proteins Insulin Receptor Substrate 1 and Insulin Receptor Substrate 2. Finally, by proteomic methods, we have discovered potential biomarkers of NAFLD. This would allow the development of an early diagnosis method of the disease.  In conclusion, this thesis sheds new light on the activity of PGC1A in the liver in response to metabolic stress and its importance for liver health.

531	Caractérisation du nouveau rôle de la phosphatase dOCRL durant la division cellulaire	Cytokinesis is a dynamic process that requires a precise coupling of actomyosin forces with the plasma membrane. In metaphase, a uniform distribution of actomyosin forces through the plasma membrane allows the characteristic cell rounding. During anaphase, the cytokinetic machinery becomes concentrated at the equatorial cortex to allow the cleavage furrow formation. The mechanisms underlying the localization of the cleavage furrow are not fully understood. Here we demonstrate that the phosphoinositide PI(4,5)P2 acts as a spatial cue for cytokinetic machinery recruitment. We have shown in Drosophila S2 cells that when the 5- phosphatase dOCRL is knocked down, ectopic accumulation of PI(4,5)P2 on endomembranes recruits the cytokinetic machinery. dOCRL is the ortholog of the human OCRL1 protein. Mutation in OCRL gene is responsible for Lowe syndrome, a rare, multisystemic X-linked disorder. Our further investigations demonstrated a new and unexpected function of the phosphatase PTEN that rescued the cellular manifestation of the Lowe syndrome. This work allowed us to find a small molecule capable of rescuing the cellular and in vivo manifestations of Lowe syndrome. Our results could represent a new therapeutic avenue to treat this disease.

532	Étude de la marche aléatoire biaisée en milieu aléatoire	The main goal of this Master thesis is to provide an introduction to the random walks in random environments (RWRE). This is a vast domain, our interest will be on models where the walk is directionnally transient in order to study asymptotical behavior. We will present severals models and associated mains results. We will see some basic techniques used in this field. One of the tools that has made the most progress is the renewal structure which allows us to answer questions about the speed of the biased random walk. This is the subject of this thesis, we deal with the following question : Is the speed of the biaised random walk on a Galton-Watson tree monotonous with respect to the environnement ? We answer in the affirmative for a high bias.	Random walk in random environment (RWRE) , Galton-Watson tree , Velocity of the biased random walk in random environment , Renewal structure	en	20205.0
533	«Sur la figure des colonnes» de Lagrange revisité	"The column's bucking load problem was formulated by Lagrange around 1770. There were many solutions proposed, but all contained some errors. Lagrange himself claimed the solution had a straight cylinder section, which was found to be suboptimal later. False solutions were mainly caused by the non-differentiability of the problem. In 1992, Cox and Overton revisited the problem using Auchmuty's dual principle and Clarke's generalized gradient. They established the existence of a solution by only considering columns whose  profile is bounded above and below by some positive constants.  According to Egorov, Cox and Overton's a priori hypothesis excluded  possibly degenerated column's profiles and, as a consequence, they cannot   justify and claim the existence of solutions.   In this Master's thesis, we will study the optimal shape/profile  problem and look for all the available information without assuming the existence of a priori bounds. Firstly, we will study the discrete form of the problem which will allow us to restrict the problem in finite dimension and guarantee the existence. Nonetheless, the problem will still be non-differentiable as it will keep his important characteristics.  Essentially, in both continuous and discrete versions, we want to maximize the first generalized eigenvalue under a constant volume constraint.  Since the problem is Hadamard semidifferentiable, a necessary optimality condition can be obtained.  But in this work we rather concentrated on including possibly degenerate profiles by enlarging the  Sobolev space of inflections for the minimization problem. Those new ""custom-made"" spaces are better suited for our purpose but, at the same time, they introduce new mathematical challenges.   The column's bucking load problem can be viewed as a generic problem of optimizing the least non-simple eigenvalue. Therefore, this work is relevant in a broader perspective for mathematical and numerical purposes."

534	Estimation des modèles à volatilité stochastique par l’entremise du modèle à chaîne de Markov cachée	The problem of estimating the parameters of stochastic volatility models by direct maximisation of the likelihood is addressed. To this end, we present an algorithm that numerically approximates the optimal filter from the methodology proposed by Kitagawa (1987) for solving the filtering problem in non-linear and/or non-Gaussian systems.  We show that this algorithm corresponds to running the Hamilton filter (the Hamilton filter offers an optimal solution to the filtering problem for a hidden Markov model on a finite state space) on a discretization of the continuous latent variable. The proposed solution significantly improves the computation time and produces results at least as good as stateof-the-art approaches in the field.  Subsequently, we present and demonstrate a generalization of this algorithm in the case of stochastic volatility models incorporating leverage and jumps. Several Monte Carlo and empirical studies are conducted to evaluate the quality of the approach for approximating the log-likelihood and estimating the parameters. We also present a comparison of this approach to the continuous particle filter approach.

536	Évaluation de politiques de séquençage d'arrivées d'avions par Simulation Monte Carlo	With the air traffic increase, airport runway management is becoming a critical issue both at the operational and safety levels. Runways have limited capacity and a minimum separation distance must be maintained between two consecutive aircrafts during both takeoff and landing phases due to wake turbulences. The minimum separation between two aircrafts depends on their size, influencing their sensitivity to turbulence. As a result, the ordering of takeoffs and landings affects the minimum total waiting time for a sequence of takeoffs or landings, as well as the delays imposed on passengers. Various scheduling policies have been proposed to reduce the delays, usually based on heuristics as the sequencing problem is NP hard. In addition, little attention is usually paid to the random factors influencing take-off and landing times. We focus on landings as they are more critical than takeoffs and propose a discrete event simulation tool to evaluate different landing scheduling policies, taking account of the operational constraints on separation as well as the uncertainties on the arrival times in the airport area. We then compare several popular policies, based on various measures of performance. Contrary to the usual assumption of deterministic flight durations, we consider the noise between the expected arrival time and the realized arrival time and examine the impacts on the scheduling performance.

537	Les commandes de photographies documentaires dans le studio Notman (1858-1909) - Naissance d'une mythologie canadienne de l'âge moderne	Our thesis studies selections from three photographic bodies of work commissioned for the Notman studio – the most important photographic studio of Montreal in the second half of the nineteenth century – between 1858 and 1909.  In 1858, the Grand Trunk Railway of Canada commissions William Notman to photograph the construction of the Victoria Bridge. Then, in 1871, Notman chooses Baltzly to accompany the Geological Survey of Canada and the Pacific Railway Survey in British-Columbia. Finally, William McFarlane Notman is hired to document the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway and to advertise the Canadian West through its landscape and wilderness. The commissions were renewed and lasted until 1909.    Considering these three bodies of photographic works, we investigate on two fronts: firstly, inquiring into why these clients resorted to photography, which was at the time a new, costly and cumbersome medium, secondly, understanding the impact that photography had on a wider public. The systematic analysis of the composition of these photographs, whose identification as artistic work is problematic, has allowed us to affirm that they convey a Canadian mythology of the modern age, linked to a pioneering spirit and to the Industrial Revolution. These myths are the following: the myth of progress, the domination of man over nature, the conquest of the Canadian West and Nation-building.

538	"Le corps de l'acteur au cinéma et au théâtre : vers une conception du corps intermédial. 
Recherche-création sur la médiation du cinéma et du théâtre à travers la figure de l’acteur"	In this essay, we look at how an actors’ body is one of the means of expressions available to a director, and at how intermediality influences this dynamic. Firstly, following Charles Taylor and M. H. Abrams’ thoughts on expression as a basic human need, we investigate the means of expression that are available to the actor and to the director. In each case, we find that the actor’s body is of critical importance to their respective expression. Secondly, we review the key ideas of intermediality, after work from David Bolter and Richard Grusin. We then explain how mediation on screen and on stage differ from one another, especially because the theatre is a hypermedia, as defined by Chiel Kattenbelt. We propose that an actor’s play is primarily remediated by the medium where it is manifest. Thirdly, we distinguish the “filmic body” and the “scenic body” on the basis of their specific mediations (Peter Brook, André Bazin, Vincent Amiel). Further, we examine the actor’s work within two intermedial set-ups, that of Denis Marleau and that of the Wooster Group. Lastly, we explore the creative process that supported our stage adaptation of Persona. To this end, we look at the intermedial aspect, the stage set and the themes of the adaptation. The outcome of this research opens to the concept of an “intermedial body”, form which two problematics are examined: the presence (Philip Auslander) and juxtaposition of expressions (Robert Bresson).

539	Le féminin et le diable : possessions et exorcismes comme manifestation de la répression sexuelle féminine	This paper examines the correlation between female sexual repression in American society and the production of possession films. It is a matter of seeing how this repression affects the way in which the possessed woman is represented on the screen. Using the psychoanalytic approach and feminist theories, I examine the subtext of the exorcism films as the manifestation of the return of the repressed. These films are the symptom of a patriarchal society that is still deeply anxious about the emancipation of women. This study looks at the analysis of the repetition of common characteristics between possession films produced following the success of The Exorcism of Emily Rose (Derrickson 2005) to finally make the observation that the body in revolt of young women struggling with a demonic entity is the very expression of the sexuality that is denied to them. Finally this essay is interested in the question of the spectacular attraction of the scene of exorcism by analyzing the staging and the physical performances that unfold there.	possession , Diable , Vagina dentata , horror movie , exorcist , Horror movies , Exorcism , Women , Gender	en	20164.0
540	Tomboys and Crossdressers de Sadie Lee, vers une esthétique butch	This thesis explores the butch aesthetic of the painter Sadie Lee’s series of portraits, Tomboys and Crossdressers. Using masculine codes as a yardstick, definitions of butch lesbian identity frequently lack nuance, failing to attend to fine, yet crucial, distinctions that manifest within that identity. In order to provide a corrective to this heavy-handed approach, I tease out the subtleties of butch lesbian identity by bringing Sadie Lee’s works into dialogue with photographs by Del LaGrace Volcano and Catherine Opie. My cumulative consideration of these works, which each manifest butch aesthetics in distinct ways, pays particular attention to gesture as it contributes to the performance of masculinity, and also as it functions as a vehicle for communicating emotion. I then contextualise my analyses of gesture through an examination of trauma. My focus on trauma is rooted in the desire to counter a positive turn in queer studies that tends to erase longstanding denigrations of queer existence. My consideration of different media, namely painting and photography, permits me to highlight differing narratives of this trauma. My readings of the works of Volcano, for example, enhance understanding of the role of photography in the historical construction of images of sexual and gendered deviancy. The centrality of corporeality in Volcano’s artistic work offers a valuable means to appreciate the versatility of butch identity as an expression of gender and also demonstrates that butch aesthetics has numerous points in common with transgender aesthetics. In their turn, Catherine Opie’s self-portraits destabilise my prior conclusions. Opie redefines butch identity – and, concomitantly, the butch aesthetic – moving beyond trauma and offering, instead, an image of pleasure. Through these differing case studies, I demonstrate that the butch aesthetic is always dynamics, continually resisting the essentialisation of gender and sexual identity.

541	Innovation in tradition : women's voices in hellenistic literature	This study looks at poems about women written by Greek female poets, so that we can have a better comprehension of the image of women. Greek female poets are very few and the majority of them appear during the Hellenistic period. Their work is mostly written in the form of epigrams. Anyte from Tegea, through her funerary epigrams about dead unmarried girls, draws attention to the relationship between daughter and parents. She depicts original scenes of mourning parents who find consolation in the memory of the qualities of their daughter, such as beauty and wisdom. In the Distaff, Erinna offers us an authentic image of the strong bond between herself and her friend Baukis, and gives a new dimension to marriage, which is linked to death. Nossis from Locri writes about feminine sexuality and creates a new image of a woman who openly praises the delights of Eros, yet she rejects the notion that sexuality should serve as a criterion for her honor and respectability.

542	"Approches du regard-image dans Auschwitz et après, Aucun de nous ne reviendra de Charlotte Delbo 
et Écorces de Georges Didi-Huberman"	Charlotte Delbo’s and Georges Didi-Huberman’s works are related to each other in some aspects. In Aucun de nous ne reviendra, the poetic testimony attests to Delbo’s experience at the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp, as well as it specifies in an unique way what to see and perceive. At the very heart of Delbo’s situation as a concentration-camp victim lies the question of knowing how to set up space and perspective. Should one look around and understand (and consequently survive)? Or not to look around and not see one’s fellows (thus also oneself) die? In Écorces, a work punctuated by photographs, the historian of art and philosopher Georges Didi-Huberman peers around, searching for traces from the past that have survived, looking for “the” place where his grand-parents were executed. He compares what he can see today to what he knows could be seen yesterday. It is also from four photographs taken by members of the Sonderkommando, a group of Jewish prisoners assigned to the crematoria as forced laborers, and themselves dead men on leave, that Didi-Huberman challenges our minds. Because of their overriding importance, the photographic heritage as well as what these images show, hide or unveil, open up our thinking. By questioning the scope of both poetical testimonies, and the creative use of the imagination in aesthetics, we aim at closely examining how looking at these images produce image-based literary or pictorial forms which turn out to be key threads in recollecting and transmitting the past.

543	Droit de cité: représentations de Paris et expériences de l'altérité dans Le syndrome d'Ulysse de Santiago Gamboa et Black Bazar d'Alain Mabanckou	"This memoir aims to show how Santiago Gamboa’s Le syndrome d’Ulysse (2005) and Alain Mabanckou’s Black Bazar (2009) contribute, each in their own way, to the development of a ""new narrative identity"" of Paris (Régine Robin) through the description of the socio-cultural alterity experienced by the depicted characters. Both novels present ""foreigners"" who live in Paris and have a different perception of the cultural codes, conceptions of history and social practices prevailing in their new home town. If their situation leads them to take a critical look at these codes and practices, it also often confines them to the margins of society and underlines the communities' worrying tendency to isolate themselves from one another. Situated in the field of sociocriticism, this study explores the various rhetorical, narratological and semiotic processes by which these texts criticize or reject different discourses proposing problematic conceptions of social life that oppose, ignore or compete with each other."

544	Analyse comparative de la mortalité et de la morbidité par accident de la route au Québec et en Ontario, 2000 à 2010	Mortality and morbidity due to road accidents are less frequent in Ontario than in Quebec. The main objective of this study is to analyze the rates of Quebec mortality and morbidity to those of Ontario to determine the characteristics of road accidents that cause Quebec to register higher rates. To meet this main objective, comparative analyses and logistic regression are used.  The analyses show that several variables explain the differences between Quebec and Ontario. Age and sex of involved drivers and victims, category of road users, the severity and the time of the accident are all characteristics for which Quebec has higher mortality and morbidity rates than Ontario.  Laws on graduated licensing program are more restrictive in Ontario than in Quebec. Logistic regression is used to verify if those laws could have a positive impact if they were applied in Quebec. The results identify that the odds of being involved in a car accident during the night (between midnight and 5hAM) are higher in Quebec than in Ontario for drivers aged 18-24 years old, men, women and when there is no passenger or one or more aged between 16 and 24 years old only. The influence of the driver license is not shown to be a significant distinguishing factor in the comparison of the two provinces.  This research provides a comparative portrait of mortality and morbidity due to road accident in Quebec and Ontario to help reduce them in Quebec.

545	L'usage du rapport présentenciel (RPS) par les juges dans un contexte de durcissement législatif	The purpose of this study is to understand whether and how the massive arrival of sentencing restrictions has altered the practice of pre-sentence report (PSR) by criminal court judges of the Court of Québec. Nine interviews were conducted with judges at the Court of Québec. The results show that pre-sentence report still seems to be useful and frequent in two specific contexts: when the maximum sentence is two years or less and in cases of a sexual offence. Results also reveal that all the judges of this study use the report in order to individualize the sentence, even if the individualization is done differently. In fact, the penal restriction context changes the judges’ underlying motivations for individualization, which evolve to a risk management one. Moreover, this study reveals that the arrival of penal restrictions brought new reasons of using RPS: to prepare files for constitutional challenge to mandatory sentencing and to decide the destiny of the charges regulated by mandatory sentence. Finally, Bourdieu’s (1990) theoretical concept of hysteresis provides an analytical framework to explain why judges maintain the use of PSR in sentencing restrictions context.

546	La flânerie et la ville intelligente : appropriation et co-construction	This research project explores the concepts of flânerie (strolling) and the smart city. By considering that cities, and the way they are organized, can influence the way people live in the city, and its culture, we ask what are the potential effects of this new phenomenon, the smart city? This city is perceived as the culmination of the internet of things, connected, and with the promise of a more open governance, aims at improving the quality of urban life for citizens. Using an ethnographic approach, an analysis of texts produced by the flâneurs, and semi-directed interviews, the thesis analyzes the motivations of strollers, the ways they move about the city, their different uses of information and communication technologies and their perceptions of this new space. By considering the act of flânerie as a cultural phenomenon, and an act of urban appropriation, this thesis tries to shed some light on potential effects of the smart city on flânerie. But also, by considering the flâneurs as producers of texts, this research tries to see how they might shape the smart city and points out some mechanisms that make it difficult. This thesis is about communication, urban sociology, mobility, uses of TIC and opens on several questions such as the efficiency of the smart city, the governance, and the civic engagement.	flânerie , appropriation , co-construction , TIC , strolling , smart city , mobility , data , urban , civic engagement	en	20085.0
547	Comprendre l'expérience vécue par les patients en oncologie active et leur famille en milieu rural	Cancer is the leading cause of death in Canada (CSC, 2017a). It is expected that an average of 206 200 people will be diagnosed in 2017 and there will be 80 800 deaths from cancer (CSC, 2017a). When diagnosed, the life of the person and his family is totally disrupted, as people often continue to associate cancer with death (Bernard, Stiefel, De Roten, and Despland, 2010). The treatment period is particularly difficult since it is accompanied by a struggle to preserve as much as possible the physical and psychological integrity of the person affected. Although the experience of cancer patients is generally known, studies are still insufficient to fully understand the experience lived by active oncology patients and their families specifically in rural areas. This is all the more important because rural areas have some differences, such as physicians who are less available, transport gaps, limited formal resources, lower socio-economic status (lower incomes), services that are inadequate because they do not respond well to the needs of the population, etc. Inspired by the humanist model of the Université de Montréal, this qualitative study of phenomenological type is to better understand the experience of patients, over 50 years, in active oncology and their families in rural areas. To reach our goal, semi-directed interviews were conducted with eight families. A logbook, socio-demographic questionnaires, a genogram, and an ecocard are the data collection tools. The main results indicate that the experience lived by the participating families is tinged with a balance between the disadvantages and the advantages of living in rural areas. The disadvantages of rural living with cancer documented in this study are limited access to specialists and treatments, lack of confidentiality and privacy, limited formal resources and lack of coordination in services. On the other hand, the benefits of families are that they have a broad network of support, their entourage is charitable and helps families, care is less impersonal, and rural areas are more peaceful.	cancer , nursing , family , rural , cancer , experience , qualitative , oncology , treatments	en	20079.0
548	Intégration pédagogique des technologies de l'information et de la communication (TIC) en pédagogie médicale à l'Université Cheikh Anta Diop de Dakar au Sénégal	Information and communication technology (ICT) has pride of place in the university arsenal of teaching tools. This thesis investigates how the University Cheikh Anta Diop (UCAD) in Dakar, Senegal strengthened their medical program by prescribing an ICT integration policy. Our objectives were to examine teachers’ perceptions of how ICT was integrated into the medical program, determine how the teachers used ICT, and assess what is needed for effective ICT integration. We considered three research questions. 1) How did the FMPO teachers perceive the ICT integration into the medical education? 2) How did the teachers use ICT? 3) What is needed for effective ICT integration? We used a mixed research methodology that combined a quantitative and qualitative approach to collect data from medical teachers who volunteered to participate in this research. In all, 70 teachers responded to the survey and 15 others were interviewed. Our findings on UCAD’s ICT integration policy and process contribute to the knowledge on ICT integration by highlighting signs of progress in an emerging research field, namely ICT integration into education. Although this topic has been relatively neglected in our universities, it has become increasingly relevant as ever more teachers, with or without proper training, use ICT for teaching. This calls for official university frameworks to support ICT integration. The needs analysis performed in this study could serve as a roadmap for policy makers and administrators.

549	Représentations sociales des enseignants et pratiques pédagogiques en contexte d'inclusion des étudiants en situation de handicap non visible au collégial	Over the past 15 years, the number of CEGEP students with neurological disorders or mental health problems has increased dramatically. The law requires educational institutions to implement services in order for students diagnosed with a disability to pursue their studies with accommodations that are lawfully appointed to them. This relatively new situation has teachers contending with challenges for which they are not necessarily prepared. In fact, specific training in education is not required to teach college. Moreover, the services currently offered are essentially student-oriented and do not take into account the needs of teachers. However, several studies show that the process of inclusion of students with disabilities cannot be achieved without the participation of teachers (Lombardi, Murray & Dallas, 2013). This study was conducted in eight colleges across Quebec. First, teachers were surveyed on their degree of agreement with pedagogical strategies inspired by the Universal Design for Instruction framework (Scott, McGuire & Shaw, 2003). Second, teachers were recruited from the survey respondents to participate in an interview about their teaching experience in the context of the inclusion of students with non-visible disabilities such as mental health disorders, language disorders, etc. The analyses of these interviews revealed the social representations constructed by these teachers about their work with students who have diversified profiles and whose characteristics can sometimes be atypical. The results of the statistical analyses indicate that pedagogical training, age and years of experience are factors that influence openness to a pedagogical approach marked by flexibility and openness to diversity. The analysis of social representations was carried out within the framework of the Central Core Theory (Abric, 2003). Based on a theoretical sample of nineteen interviews, it other factors also emerged. Thus, teachers who have positive perceptions of both students with disabilities and their own abilities to face the challenges of inclusion are more open to the survey proposals than their colleagues. The same is true of teachers who have values of openness, universalism and benevolence. Finally, teachers who display positive values and perceptions are also those most likely to use strategies that promote inclusion.

550	Systèmes d’accountability basés sur la performance : types, logiques instrumentales et effets sur l’efficacité et l’équité scolaires des systèmes éducatifs d’Europe et du Canada. Une étude comparative à partir des données PISA 2012	In the last decades accountability, has become a centerpiece of the renewed governance of the education systems. Under the influence of New Public Management, the introduction of performance-based accountability systems (PBAS) is considered a political solution to the supposed crisis affecting education systems. While PBAS are aimed at improving student performance and at closing the achievement gap, there is little evidence that PBAS have a positive impact on school effectiveness and equity in education systems. This international comparative quantitative study aims to provide some insights into the relationship between PBAS, effectiveness and equity (equal opportunities of results, equality of outcomes and equality of basic skills) in the European and Canadian education systems. It uses a broad but operational acceptance of the concept of accountability that takes into account the result-based regulation tools that are put in place at the school level in order to steer the system. The study is based on a secondary analysis of OECD PISA 2012 data. It is based on a sample of 59 education systems and use multivariate analyses (principal component analysis, cluster analysis, ANOVA, simple and multiple regressions) to characterize the PBAS in the education systems of Europe and Canada on one side, and to analyse their impact on effectiveness and equity in these education systems on the other. Three instrumental logics emerge from the results, which underpin PBAS: 1) a logic that rests on monitoring and evaluating the actors’s performance at the school level; 2) a logic that relies on direct incentives for teachers; 3) a logic that rests on school performance comparisons and involves internal mechanisms aimed at improving school results. Underpinned by distinct regulation tools, these logics are articulated within empirical types of PBAS which allow us to differentiate between the education systems of Europe and Canada: 1) an accountability of lesser intensity, 2) an accountability focused mainly on evaluation and performance monitoring, 3) an accountability articulating performance monitoring, external comparison/internal improvement of school performance, 4) a high intensity accountability favoring incentives for teachers.  Nevertheless, we find little evidence that PBAS have a significant influence on effectiveness and equity in education systems. The effects of PBAS, if any, are in most cases weak and are cancelled out when other key factors are taken into account (public spending in education, variation in student socioeconomic backgrounds, horizontal and vertical stratification of education systems). However, incentives for teachers and PBAS that favor this type of device seem to be significantly linked to lower effectiveness levels, and to higher inequalities in outcomes and basic skill levels. In the end, our results suggest that PBAS do not provide the effectiveness and equity in education systems they promise.

551	L’appropriation des connaissances visuo-orthographiques par des élèves de la première à la quatrième année du primaire	Reading and writing are fundamental skills for school learning. Learning to spell represents a major challenge for many pupils, whether they have a learning disability or not. Yet, the growth of spelling skills is closely associated with reading and writing development. The French spelling system, due to its structure and its opacity, requires that learners amass knowledge about the phonological properties of words, and also their morphological and visual properties, to succeed in reading and spelling all words. Research has shown that the visual properties of words, which can be classified according to forms of visual-orthographic phenomena, represent orthographic properties which are particularly difficult to master in the primary grades. Furthermore, working memory and processing speed are required for processing the orthographic components of words. Empirical data have shown that memory and rapid naming abilities are linked to reading and spelling performance. The general goal of this study was to investigate the extent to which visual-orthographic processing, phonological and visual memory, and rapid naming performance play a role in the reading and spelling performance of 119 pupils enrolled in the first to the fourth grade of primary school. The specific objectives were to describe their overall performance, examine the relationships among the variables being studied, and identify which one(s) best explain(s) reading and spelling performance.  A word recognition task, a reading comprehension task, and a spelling production task were administered to assess reading and spelling skills. A matching test in which nonword sequences were presented orally and a matching test with visual sequences as stimuli were used as phonological and visual memory measures. A rapid object-naming task (R.A.N.) and a rapid color-naming task were used as measure of processing speed. To observe their visual-orthographic processing skills, the participants were given a word-pseudohomophone choice task and retrieval tests (oral and written).  Results indicated that visual-orthographic processing skills increased with grade level. Correlational analyses revealed that grade was related to each variable, that reading and spelling skills were linked to each other, and that visual-orthographic processing skills appeared to be the variables most strongly correlated to reading and spelling skills. Regression analyses indicated that grade level best explained performance in spelling production, word recognition, and reading comprehension and that the word-pseudohomophone choice task represented the only variable making an additional and significant contribution to reading and spelling performance. These results suggest that the visual properties of words should be taught in class so as to support the development of learners’ reading and spelling skills. It should be the subject of future research intending to explain how these properties are acquired and develop.

552	Je vlog donc je suis : analyse multimodale de la performance des vloggers gais, lesbiennes et bisexuel.les	Video blogs, or “vlogs” as they’ve come to be known, have experienced an incredible increase in popularity over the last few years. Offering us an intimate insight into their lives, vloggers create a particular relationship with their audience acting sometimes as a friend and other times as a mentor. This research uses a symbolic interactionist perspective, as well as concepts and tools from multimodal analysis and cultural studies to analyse the profiles and videos of 4 vloggers who identify as gay, lesbian, or bisexual.  This paper will discuss the importance of sexual identity and the ways it is performed in the vlogs, how different modes are used in the process of sense-making, and the relationship between vloggers and their audiences.

553	Les personnages féminins des blockbusters américains : représentations et rapports de pouvoir	Nowadays, American blockbusters are dominant cinematographic productions. Sciencefiction, as it is defined by that type of productions, is very popular, due to the advent of sagas and production studios as Marvel, DC Comics, Star Wars, Alien, Termination, etc. Men and super heroes’ representations are numerous in these productions. However, women and super heroines are less represented, which illustrate a relation of power between genders. It might be suspected that cinematographic productions’ representations create and convey discourses, but what are they? Are they hegemonic discourses? Normative and stereotype discourses? Feminist discourses? At the intersection between cultural studies, feminist studies and research-creation, this thesis focuses on women’s bodies representations in science-fiction blockbusters. Through an exploration of four characters, the representation process is studied as a tool allowing both to create and to question gender norms and stereotypes. Following interviews, this thesis also tries to understand women’s interpretations and perceptions of female representations in sciencefiction cinema. As part of a research-creation project, the data collected during interviews is gathered and analyzed through a fictional story, allowing an experimentation of the creative process methodology for academic purposes. Fiction, and representation, are studied through different points of view, through both exploration and creation.	blockbusters , representation , norms , feminism , research-creation	en	20045.0
554	Étude de la spéciation et de la biodisponibilité du samarium en présence de matière organique naturelle avec l'algue verte Chlamydomonas reinhardtii	As technological interest for rare earth elements (REE) is growing, it is becoming more important to assess their potential environmental impact. Thus, the present study focuses on the speciation and bioavailability of these metallic elements, concepts at the center of which is the free ion, the metal species considered as the best predictor of metal bioavailability. According to the currently used toxicity models, the complexation of metals by organic ligands should reduce the free ion concentration and thus, decrease its bioavailability for aquatic organisms. However, recent studies have shown higher levels of REE internalization than predicted by the models in the presence of simple organic ligands. Thus, it seemed necessary to evaluate the influence of natural organic matter (NOM), composed of complex organic ligands, on the speciation and bioavailability of REE. In this study, samarium (Sm), a lanthanide of intermediate atomic weight, and the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii were used. The free ion concentration was experimentally measured on a cation exchange resin (IET) in dynamic mode and modeled by thermodynamic calculations. Short-term biouptake experiments were used to determine the internalization flux of Sm in algae. The effect of 4 types of NOM, of different origins and composition, was evaluated. The results clearly show that the presence of NOM induces a significant decrease in the internalization fluxes of Sm and that humic acids appear to be responsible for stronger complexation than fulvic acids. The results also suggest that the experimentally measured free ion concentrations allow a better prediction of the Sm internalization than the total or modeled concentrations with the existing equilibrium constants used in thermodynamic calculations.	samarium , Chlamydomonas reinhardtii , Bioavailability , Biouptake , Chlamydomonas reinhardtii , Ion exchange resin	en	20043.0
555	L’Archaïque récent au Costa Rica, contribution des sites Piedra Viva et Linda Vista à l’histoire culturelle	"The following paper is based on the analysis of two archaeological sites located in the Turrialba valley in Costa Rica, that where excavated for the present master’s thesis: the Piedra Viva (C-306 PV) and Linda Vista (C- 230 LV) sites. The Piedra Viva site has revealed lithic artefacts associated with an archaeological context C14 dated at 6,820 ± 30 rcyBP, (cal AA 7,690 - 7,610), constituting the third site in the country presenting an occupation dated to the Late Archaic via radiocarbon. Our study aims to situate chronologically and culturally the various lithic assemblages studied and to understand the correspondence with the available information in Panama. We have therefore carried out a techno morphological analysis of the lithic assemblages of these sites. On the basis of the comparison with the Piedra Viva collection, our assemblages would correspond to the same unifacial lithic industry, dating to the Late Archaic period (7,000 to 3,600 rcyBP), different from the lithic industries already occurring in Costa Rica. From a technological standpoint, the groups that occupied our sites seem to have abandoned the bifacial knapping technique and preferred local lithic materials for the elaboration of various unifacial lithic tools. Despite the absence of organic remains on the sites, we have tried to understand the subsistence of the occupants of the Piedra Viva site, through a study of the paleobotanical remains obtained from the surface of some of the tools. We have therefore proceeded to the extraction of phytoliths and starch grains on a grinding stone and on a chipped stone knife from the Piedra Viva site. The paleobotanical analysis demonstrated that these tools where used around 14C at 6,820 ± 30 rcyBP in the processing of cultigens such as maize (Zea mays) and cassava (Manihot esculenta) in addition to squash (Cucurbita sp.) and possibly starch-rich tubers such as arrowroot (Maranta arundinacea), as well as achira (Canna sp.) and ""wild"" resources such as palms.  The sites examined seem to subscribe to the model recognized for the Late Archaic in Panama, both in terms of the types chipped stone tools and ground stone tools (grinding stone) in use, as well as the settlement and subsistence pattern which are similar. Our archaeobotanical data also support the view for the time being, that the first traces of maize south of Mesoamerica seem to appear around relatively the same period near ± 7000 rcyBP (± 7 900 cal. A.A). Moreover, the traces of manioc on Piedra Viva’s grinding stone of would be almost contemporary with the oldest known traces found in Panama dating around 6 910 ± 60 rcyBP. These data suggest that the occupants of our sites also constituted actors of the domestication and of the initial diffusion of these cultigens. These transformations in lithic technology and subsistence pattern perceptible on our sites would be characteristic of a surge of changes of greater amplitude at the Late Archaic, at the scale of the Isthmo-Colombian and Caribbean regions and beyond, in the settlement pattern and the quantity and density of occupations. The advent cultigens of capital importance such as corn and cassava were certainly one of the driving forces behind this cultural transformation."

556	Habiter et aménager l'espace au Nunavik : le rôle de la mobilité dans l'appropriation sociale et culturelle de l'environnement bâti du village d'Aupaluk	Recent transformations of the built environment in Nunavik (from 1950 to the present day) have made it possible to highlight the Inuit's effort to express their relationship with the territory through a new political and economic framework. Even if the provincial and federal governments' investments in sociosanitary conditions have strongly contributed to the emergence of villages as privileged places of daily life, the inhabitants continue to maintain and redefine mobility on their territory. By being attached to a specific mode of geographical knowledge, hunting activities and general mobility on their territory persist as strong identity values (Collignon, 1996). It thus emerges that the village and the territory exist as two spaces embodying values that can sometimes be contradictory and/or complementary. This is not only reflected in the organization of the built and institutional framework of the Inuit, but also in their lifestyle (Collignon, 2006, Gombay, 2010, Martin, 2003). As mentioned by Augustin Berque, successful development takes into account the reciprocal and dialectical relationship between a natural environment and a human environment (Berque, 2010). In the context of a reflective modernity in Nunavik (Martin, 2003), the role of space planning and the built environment in northern communities is paramount. Ultimately, this paper seeks to understand how the Inuit design, build and inhabit their contemporary spaces.

557	Le rapport d’usagers de maisons d’hébergement en santé mentale à leur environnement immédiat : une étude socio-écologique	During his life, one in five Canadians will suffer from a mental illness, diagnosed or not, according to the data of the mental health action plan (2015-2020). Furthermore, mental disorders constituting the “13 % of the total load of morbidity at the world level” in 2004 (WHO, 2013), are intended to represent the main cause of morbidity in 2030 (Fleury and Attic, on 2012).  In response to these observations, numerous plans, at a national and international levels, have been implemented, and underline the urgency of new care solutions but also housing solutions for people diagnosed with a mental health disorders. Because the concept of housing is very large and includes not only the residential structure as such, but also its immediate environment, it is essential to perceive it in all its complexity. Investigating the functioning of persons with mental illness in the contexts of their housing and the surroundings of it, becomes a major stage of the mental health-housing research agenda. Considering, as WHO already advanced, that the environment is one of the health, determinants, mental health included, we are interested in the study of the trajectories of the residents of mental health housing to answer the following research question: What relationship do residents of mental health housing establish with their living environment and their neighborhood?  Understanding how these people use the space, appropriate the space, move around it, but also which obstacles and which supports they find there, helps us to determine the best interventions on the territory to make, as much as possible, the environment favorable to the health and the well-being.  To answer our research problem, we designed a methodological two-phase plan and we implemented it in 4 mental health supported houses. Initially, 14 residents answered at 26 open questions during a structured individual interview, at the end of which they drew a mental map of their neighborhood. Then, we organized 4 focus groups, one in each supported house, involving all the participants of the first phase which live there.  Our body of data allowed us to suggest a few recommendations for choosing the new implantation sites for mental health housing. These recommendations concentrate on four aspects of the immediate environment, whether spatial or social: local services, public transportation, natural elements and community.  Our conclusions allow a more comprehensive look of the immediate environment surrounding the mental health supported houses, because the perspectives and experiences of their users are directly considered. Consequently, our recommendations provide the decision makers with an additional tool in the process of selection of the new implantation sites.  Finally, we encourage research to deepen the effects of the environmental features emerged from this study, on the well-being of the residents living in supported mental health houses.

558	How do social Interactions with a significant other affect PTSD symptoms? : an empirical investigation with a clinical sample	Social support and coping are both related to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, but the mechanisms underlying their relationships remain unclear. This study explores these relationships by examining the perceived frequency of supportive and countersupportive interactions with a significant other in PTSD patients. Ninety-six participants with PTSD were recruited and completed questionnaires assessing social interactions, ways of coping, and PTSD symptoms. Associations of social interactions (r2 = 4.1%–7.9%, p < .05) and coping (r2 = 15.9%–16.5%, p < .001) with symptoms were independent, and suggested a direct association between social interactions and PTSD. Countersupportive interactions were more associated to symptoms than supportive interactions. Our findings suggest the development of psychotherapies that integrate social support interventions.

559	Responsible Conduct of Research in Research-Creation: Moving into Uncharted Terrain	Responsible conduct of research (RCR) is ubiquitous, and present in most areas of research. One area that has received little attention is Research-Creation (RC): • an emergent  eld at the interface of academic research and creative activities • in Quebec, Canada, RC is de ned as “research activities or approaches that foster the creation or interpretation/ performance of literary or artistic works of all types” Researcher-Creators – who are at the same time researchers and practising artists, musicians, or designers – may be faced with very di erent issues or challenges from colleagues in the rest of academia. • How do researcher-creators reconcile their dual obligations to creation and to research? • Are the usual research ethics guidelines (e.g., TCPS2, ICH relevant and how do they apply? • How do the creative/artistic dimensions of research a ect evaluations by grant committees and REBs? To better understand how RCR issues are articulated in the very heterogeneous RC community, we combine here results from a literature review and an international survey on RCR in RC.

560	Perspectives juridiques quant à l'implantation du programme REDD+ dans les pays en développement: développement durable et participation locale	"The problem of tropical forest in developing countries is troubling. Carbon dioxide emissions deriving from deforestation are about 1.6 GtCO2 / year, or 17% of global emissions of ""greenhouse gases"". Under the United Nations’ Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation has been negotiated to fight this deforestation and degradation of forests. This dissertation is aimed to analyze the implementation modalities of that internationally adopted program at the level of States, especially in the Developing Countries. The analysis will be based on the case of Democratic Republic of Congo. From that angle, my goal in this research is to demonstrate that, a sound implementation of that Program for a sustainable governance requires an approach based, not only on the international regulations for the management of forests and sustainable development because such implementation in Developing Countries’ legislations may yield controversial results, but also by integrating the socio-cultural, ethical and other aspects that take into account the perception and the adhesion or rejection of the program by local communities. Hence, I will use the various forestry projects applied and implemented in the Developing Countries. As a matter of fact, harmonizing legal instruments with the practices of local communities may permit reducing efficiently Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation mechanism, as a reference to electively supporting communities that depend on forest resources. This harmonization tasks may be conducted by involving local communities in the design, interpretation and implementation of forestry policies in general and, especially the Reduction of Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation."

561	Exploring urban resilience to disasters : the role of planning in the long-term community rebuilding of Kalamata after the 1986 earthquake	This research explores the relationship between planning, reconstruction and resilience, through the in-depth analysis of the long-term recovery of a city hit by disaster. The purpose of this research is to further understand the concept of resilience in order to operationalize it. Firstly, to contribute a new perspective to resilience research as a theoretical concept. Secondly, to contribute to the operationalization of resilience with a new assessment method. To explore this problematic this research uses as case study a medium sized city that has been hit by a disaster in the past. The city of Kalamata, Greece was hit by an earthquake in September 1986, which left it devastated. The development trajectory of the city that is in an ongoing long-term recovery phase offers an ideal opportunity to explore such characteristics.  This research examines the planning interventions and practices that have influenced the city’s resilience equilibrium levels during the pre-disaster and post-disaster periods and it focuses on the interpretation of the findings in the long-term recovery process. It questions if and how planning choices influence the recovery of the city as well as its resilience. The concentration on the long-term recovery is crucial as it reveals the success or fail of the recovery process and it comes to fill a void in literature given that studies are mostly concentrated on short-term recovery results.   Resilience is already a widely popular and at the same time extensively contested theoretical concept that has been adopted by several fields of research and used differently in most of them. Within the field of planning resilience is currently being extensively adapted and is today a much-anticipated process and outcome of planning research and practice. Long-term recovery and hazard mitigation are the least explored phases of post disaster reconstruction. Although much research is orientated towards response and reconstruction strategies, little attention is given towards the long-term recovery and the hazard mitigation phases.  The innovation of this research is that it offers a new perspective by examining how reconstruction has impacted places over the long term. How they have improved their resilience? In the aftermath of a catastrophic event, all dynamics are immediately mobilized towards immediate relief and reconstruction. These dynamics unfortunately remain motivated for only a short term after the catastrophic event. Soon life finds a new rhythm and the signs of the catastrophe are absorbed into the needs and deeds of everyday life. However, the impacts of the decisions taken shortly after the disaster are only revealed on the long term, during the long-term recovery phase. For disaster recovery to be successful, a long term resilient rebuilding vision is imperative.  Within this research, the conceptualization of resilience is both a challenge and a necessity to take a first step towards the outlining of what constitutes a long-term resilient post-disaster community rebuilding. With this long-term perspective, this research explores the contribution of planning practices towards the amelioration of the resilience equilibrium of an urban area. To analyze the relationship between planning and resilience of an urban community on the long term, a model for assessing resilience within this specific framework is created. The objective is to give an insight in the ways planning can affect resilience. In this way, the importance of hazard mitigation and adaptation in the field of planning is highlighted.	resilience , vulnerability , planning , adaptation , reconstruction , long-term , disaster risk reduction , Kalamata , reconstruction , Kalamata	en	19969.0
562	Household recovery and housing reconstruction after the 2003 Bam earthquake in Iran	Post-disaster housing reconstruction is a complex process that plays a crucial role in promoting affected households’ recovery. In the last few decades, researchers have examined housing recovery programs (through resilience, vulnerability, and sustainable development lenses), and made considerable endeavours to determine the variables behind their success or failure. However, several knowledge gaps about, for instance, unequal level of recovery among differently affected household categories, compromises on recovery objectives, and insufficient collaboration between stakeholders in housing reconstruction programs, still exist. This dissertation aims at explaining why and how housing reconstruction projects typically fail to fulfill recovery objectives. It seeks to reveal the main challenges in initiatives aimed at helping affected households to recover sustainably.  This study is based on a detailed, longitudinal, qualitative case study of the housing reconstruction program conducted after the earthquake that struck the city of Bam, Iran, in 2003. It specifically examines Bam’s experience from four perspectives: recovery objectives, policy, strategy, and implementation. The study adopts a deductive reasoning strategy, in which detailed literature reviews led to the formulation of theoretical propositions based on the resilience and the vulnerability theories and additional concepts borrowed from the housing, urban planning, and project management fields. These theoretical propositions were later empirically tested to explore whether the expected patterns actually occurred. Findings from the case of Bam were thus matched with predicted patterns, allowing us to validate (but also to nuance) the theoretical propositions.  Results highlight four main challenges typically faced in housing reconstruction programs. First, housing reconstruction policies often overlook the diversity of affected households, notably with regard to their pre-disaster status and post-disaster situation. As a consequence, the common one-policy-for-all approach cannot adequately lead to the recovery of affected families. The recovery of different household types requires the coexistence of a multiplicity of measures and programs to allow them to choose the solution that best fits their needs, conditions, and expectations. Second, the integration of general housing policy and specific reconstruction policies is necessary to both address vulnerabilities and ensure long-term recovery. Third, challenges in involving the diversity of stakeholders in participatory decision-making often threaten the fulfillment of recovery objectives. Finally (and as a consequence of the latter), housing reconstruction programs need to address stakeholder conflicts and institutional fragmentation through appropriate governance structures and mechanisms. These results remind us that housing reconstruction programs are complex, dynamic processes where affected households’ recovery depends on several variables such as their pre- and post-disaster conditions, recovery policy’s sensitivity to families’ varied needs and desires, households’ active participation in decision-making, and successful collaboration between stakeholders. Indeed, further research is still required to explore the cause and effect relationships between variables in this complex process.

563	Robust design in monotonic matching markets : a case for firm-proposing deferred-acceptance	We study two-sided matching markets among workers and firms. Workers seek one position at a firm but firms may employ several workers. In many applications those markets are monotonic: leaving positions unfilled is costly as for instance, for hospitals this means not being able to provide full service to its patients. A huge literature has advocated the use of stable mechanisms for clearinghouses. The interests among workers and firms are polarized among stable mechanisms, most famously the firm-proposing DA and the worker-proposing DA. We show that for the firm-proposing DA ex-ante incentive compatibility and ex-post incentive compatibility are equivalent whereas this is not necessarily true for the worker-proposing DA. The firm-proposing DA turns out to be more robust than the worker-proposing DA under incomplete information when incentives of both sides of the market are important.

semantics in French"	We investigated task effects on violation ERP responses to Noun-Adjective gender mismatches and lexical/conceptual semantic mismatches in a combined auditory/visual paradigm in French. Participants listened to sentences while viewing pictures of objects. This paradigm was designed to investigate language processing in special populations (e.g., children) who may not be able to read or to provide stable behavioral judgment data. Our main goal was to determine how ERP responses to our target violations might differ depending on whether participants performed a judgment task (Task) versus listening for comprehension (No-Task). Characterizing the influence of the presence versus absence of judgment tasks on violation ERP responses allows us to meaningfully interpret data obtained using this paradigm without a behavioral task and relate them to judgment-based paradigms in the ERP literature. We replicated previously observed ERP patterns for semantic and gender mismatches, and found that the task especially affected the later P600 component.

565	Utilisation des outils phylogéographiques pour explorer la diversité génétique de Borrelia burgdorferi et le paysage génétique de la maladie de Lyme au Canada	Lyme borreliosis is the most reported zoonotic infectious disease in temperate zones with significant consequences for human health. In Canada, it is considered to be emerging due to the expansion of the Ixodes scapularis tick vector to new areas in southern Canada where it has become established. Therefore, endemic areas of Lyme disease continue to grow, and are being promoted by climate change. These events coincide with adaptive radiation of B. burgdorferi in North America.  Within this problem, the phylogeographic pictures of the pathogen and its vector show surprisingly little correlation despite their intimate ecological association. The environmental risk assessment of Lyme disease requires a clear comprehension of the different patterns acting and driving the expansion of the pathogen and its vector. This picture is made more complex by considering the genetic diversity of B. burgdorferi which is important to its probable effects on diagnostic test performance and the differential pathogenicity amongst strains.  Some answers to these problems may be found by study of the bacterial genetics of this pathogen to improve knowledge of its relationship with its vector and hosts.  In this study we investigated the diversity and the genetic structure of B. burgdorferi sensu stricto populations in southern Canada and northern US by using phylogeographic tools: i) phylogenetic methods to explore the historical and the evolutionary processes of B. burgdorferi and ii) geo-spatial modeling to define the spatial distribution of different strains and their patterns of spread.  A total of 750 samples of B. burgdorferi (477 samples are from US and Canada which are available in the pubmlst.org/bburgdorferi/, and 273 samples collected using active surveillance in Canada and analyzed for the first time in this study) were used to reconstruct the phylogenetic relationship between different strains genotyped using MLST approach. Two other complementary approaches were used to strain-type B. burgdorferi, the outer surface protein C (ospC) and the ribosomal spacer rrs-rrlA (IGS).  It was found that the genetic diversity of B. burgdorferi in Canada is relatively similar to that of the US but only 1/5 strains are common to the both countries. This shows that the phylogeographic image of B. burgdorferi in North America appears to be more complex than previously known: i) geographic complexity because strains of various geographical origins form significant clades and others which have the same geographical origin but are genetically more distant dispersed on different clades (this is a probable signal of refugial populations) and ii) a genetic complexity since 90% of genetic exchanges occur within closely related phylogenetic groups. Such genetic structure can be driven by an ecological process, and we hypothesized that the associations of B. burgdorferi genotypes with specific hosts reduced gene flow between different groups. Statistical modeling allowed the identification of different associations between genotypes and certain rodent host species: CC34 and ospC G with Eastern Chipmunk; CC403, ospC A and RST1 with the white-footed mice; and CC4, ospC H and IGS 2D with the deer mice.  However, the phylogeny also showed that strains associated with chipmunk are older relatively to those associated with mice, which appear to have evolved more recently.  Studies based on the chipmunk fossil data in North America corroborate this hypothesis. In fact, this species was one of the few small mammals that survived during the glacial-interglacial periods which thought allowed the B. burgdorferi surviving. It had undergone a southward migration, whereas mice known to be more sensitive to climatic conditions had experienced a Northward migration after the last Pleistocene which led all these small mammals to share a common history. Therefore, host adaptations may have shaped the contemporary phylogeography of the pathogen in North America, which may be the driving force behind the differential pathogenicity of B. burgdorferi genotypes. Geo-spatial modeling using conditional probabilities showed that rodent-associated strains (e.g. ST1 of CC403 that is associated with white-footed mice) exhibit specific patterns of occurrence of dispersal driven by the landscape characteristics of forest connectivity. This study provides i) a first comprehensive phylogeographic picture of B. burgdorferi in southern Canada that is essential to understand the evolutionary epidemiology of Lyme disease in Northern America, ii) knowledge of the high genetic diversity in Canada that may be key to understanding geographic variations in occurrence of pathogenic strains and improving the specificity and sensitivity of diagnostic tests, and iii) understanding the methods of dispersion of B. burgdorferi in Northern America. Together these findings will improve our ability to predict risk from Lyme disease in Canada, and will drive research into new diagnostic methods.	typage multi-locus , Lyme disease , Phylogeography , Evolutionary history , Multi-locus typing , Landscape connectivity , Spatial modeling	en	19878.0
566	Using the dual-criteria methods to supplement visual inspection: An analysis of nonsimulated data	The purpose of our study was to examine the probability of observing false positives in non-simulated data using the dual-criteria methods. We extracted data from published studies to produce a series of 16,927 datasets and then assessed the proportion of false positives for various phase lengths. Our results indicate that collecting at least 3 data points in the first phase (Phase A) and at least 5 data points in the second phase (Phase B) is generally sufficient to produce acceptable levels of false positives.

567	"From theoretical concepts to policies and
applied programmes: the landscape of
integration of oral health in primary care"	Background: Despite its importance, the integration of oral health into primary care is still an emerging practice in the field of health care services. This scoping review aims to map the literature and provide a summary on the conceptual frameworks, policies and programs related to this concept. Methods: Using the Levac et al. six-stage framework, we performed a systematic search of electronic databases, organizational websites and grey literature from 1978 to April 2016. All relevant original publications with a focus on the integration of oral health into primary care were retrieved. Content analyses were performed to synthesize the results. Results: From a total of 1619 citations, 67 publications were included in the review. Two conceptual frameworks were identified. Policies regarding oral heath integration into primary care were mostly oriented toward common risk factors approach and care coordination processes. In general, oral health integrated care programs were designed in the public health sector and based on partnerships with various private and public health organizations, governmental bodies and academic institutions. These programmes used various strategies to empower oral health integrated care, including building interdisciplinary networks, training nondental care providers, oral health champion modelling, enabling care linkages and care coordinated process, as well as the use of e-health technologies. The majority of studies on the programs outcomes were descriptive in nature without reporting long-term outcomes. Conclusions: This scoping review provided a comprehensive overview on the concept of integration of oral health in primary care. The findings identified major gaps in reported programs outcomes mainly because of the lack of related research. However, the results could be considered as a first step in the development of health care policies that support collaborative practices and patient-centred care in the field of primary care sector.

568	Early lactation extended therapy against Staphylococcus aureus intramammary infections in heifers	Intramammary infections (IMI) in heifers caused by Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) are challenging to treat using standard protocols. Recent evidence suggests that an extended treatment protocol with pirlimycin is the most effective way to treat S. aureus IMI in North America. Using on farm culture methods with the PetrifilmTM Staph Express Count (STX) plates can help with the early detection of IMI. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the cure rate of an extended pirlimycin treatment on heifers in early lactation positive for S. aureus IMI identified using the STX plates. The secondary objective was to assess Petrifilm characteristics when used in a protocol for early lactation detection of infected quarters in heifers. Milk samples were collected from heifers (n=946) in the first few days of calving (mean= 5 days). Heifers with a laboratory-confirmed IMI caused by S. aureus (n=72) were randomly allocated in two groups. The treatment group (n=55 quarters from 39 heifers) received a sterile intramammary infusion of 50 mg of pirlimycin for 8 consecutive days in the infected quarters; the control group (n=43 quarters from 33 heifers) received no treatment. Mammary quarters treated showed a statistically significant cure rate of 64% compared to the control group (33%). Quarters treated were 3.6 times more likely to be cured then the control group. With the STX, a total of 38% of S. aureus positive quarters were identified as other staphylococci with standard culture. The study reveals that a high cure rate for S. aureus IMI can be achieved in dairy heifers if an extended treatment protocol is used soon after calving. Use of Petrifilm for identification of S. aureus infected heifers could lead to many unnecessary treatments because of false positive results.

569	Syndrome de tremblements épisodiques de la tête chez le bouledogue anglais : prévalence, sémiologie et investigation diagnostique	Many English bulldogs (EB) were presenting head tremors. The 3 objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence of Episodic Head Tremor Syndrome (EHTS) in Quebec’s EB, to characterize the semiology of the syndrome and to determine if there is an underlying cause to this syndrome. The prevalence study was completed by contacting all the owners of EB presented to the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vétérinaire between 2005 and 2012. Twenty-two of 116 owners confirmed the presence of EHTS episodes, resulting in a prevalence of 19% (CI 95% 12.3-27.3%) of EHTS in Quebec’s EB. A male sex predisposition was identified (p=0.017). The retrospective study was conducted using an online detailed survey submitted to affected EB’s owners that voluntarily enrolled in the study. The 71 retained surveys were analyzed using descriptive statistics. EHTS is characterized by rapid head tremors that start at approximately 1.7 years of age (median), are less than 30 minutes in duration, of variable frequency, occasionally triggered by stress, and can sometimes be interrupted. The tremors cause anxiety but are otherwise benign and have a spontaneous resolution rate of 40%. Amongst the 5 affected EB that underwent diagnostic testing (neurological examination, bloodwork, urinalysis, endocrine function testing, brain magnetic resonance imaging, electroencephalography, electromyography and cerebrospinal fluid analysis), no underlying anatomical or metabolic abnormality was identified. In conclusion, EHTS is a common but benign condition in EB. The pathophysiology is still undetermined. This syndrome needs recognition to avoid useless and potentially harmful treatment.	dog , English Bulldog , tremors , dyskinesia , epilepsy	en	19805.0
570	Multiple proteins differing between laboratory stocks of mammalian orthoreoviruses affect both virus sensitivity to interferon and induction of interferon production during infection	In the course of previous works, it was observed that the virus laboratory stock (T3DS) differs in sequence from the virus encoded by the ten plasmids currently in use in many laboratories (T3DK), and derived from a different original virus stock. Seven proteins are affected by these sequence differences. In the present study, replication of T3DK was shown to be more sensitive to the antiviral effect of interferon. Infection by the T3DK virus was also shown to induce the production of higher amount of β and α-interferons compared to T3DS. Two proteins, the μ2 and λ2 proteins, were found to be responsible for increased sensitivity to interferon while both μ2 and λ1 are responsible for increased interferon secretion. Altogether this supports the idea that multiple reovirus proteins are involved in the control of induction of interferon and virus sensitivity to the interferon-induced response. While interrelated, interferon induction and sensitivity can be separated by defined gene combinations. While both μ2 and λ2 were previously suspected of a role in the control of the interferon response, other proteins are also likely involved, as first shown here for λ1. This also further stresses that due caution should be exerted when comparing different virus isolates with different genetic background.	Reovirus , Interferon , Reverse genetics	en	19801.0

572	"Moving beyond the residential neighbourhood to explore social inequalities in exposure to
area-level disadvantage: Results from the Interdisciplinary Study on Inequalities in Smoking"	The focus, in place and health research, on a single, residential, context overlooks the fact that individuals are mobile and experience other settings in the course of their daily activities. Socioeconomic characteristics are associated with activity patterns, as well as with the quality of places where certain groups conduct activities, i.e. their non-residential activity space. Examining how measures of exposure to resources, and inequalities thereof, compare between residential and nonresidential contexts is required. Baseline data from 1,890 young adults (18 to 25 years-old) participating in the Interdisciplinary Study of Inequalities in Smoking, Montreal, Canada (2011- 2012), were analyzed. Socio-demographic and activity location data were collected using a validated, self-administered questionnaire. Area-level material deprivation was measured within 500-meter road-network buffer zones around participants’ residential and activity locations. Deprivation scores in the residential area and non-residential activity space were compared between social groups. Multivariate linear regression was used to estimate associations between individual- and area-level characteristics and non-residential activity space deprivation, and to explore whether these characteristics attenuated the education-deprivation association. Participants in low educational categories lived and conducted activities in more disadvantaged areas than university students/graduates. Educational inequalities in exposure to area-level deprivation were larger in the non-residential activity space than in the residential area for the least educated, but smaller for the intermediate group. Adjusting for selected covariates such as transportation resources and residential deprivation did not significantly attenuate the education-deprivation associations. Results support the existence of social isolation in residential areas and activity locations, whereby less educated individuals tend to be confined to more disadvantaged areas than their more educated counterparts. They also highlight the relevance of investigating both residential and non-residential contexts when studying inequalities in health-relevant exposures.

573	Introduction: Welcome to the Dark Side	"Published by the MIT Press in the ""Platform Studies"" series, this is a book about the Super Nintendo Entertainment System that is not celebratory or self-congratulatory. Most other accounts declare the Super NES the undisputed victor of the “16-bit console wars” of 1989–1995. In this book, Dominic Arsenault reminds us that although the SNES was a strong platform filled with high-quality games, it was also the product of a short-sighted corporate vision focused on maintaining Nintendo’s market share and business model. This led the firm to fall from a dominant position during its golden age (dubbed by Arsenault the “ReNESsance”) with the NES to the margins of the industry with the Nintendo 64 and GameCube consoles. Arsenault argues that Nintendo’s conservative business strategies and resistance to innovation during the SNES years explain its market defeat by Sony’s PlayStation.   Extending the notion of “platform” to include the marketing forces that shape and constrain creative work, Arsenault draws not only on game studies and histories but on game magazines, boxes, manuals, and advertisements to identify the technological discourses and business models that formed Nintendo's ""Super Power"". He also describes the cultural changes in video games during the 1990s that slowly eroded the love of gamer enthusiasts (""Spoony Bards"") for the SNES as the Nintendo generation matured. Finally, he chronicles the many technological changes that occurred through the SNES's lifetime, including full-motion video, CD-ROM storage, and the shift to 3D graphics. Because of the SNES platform’s ""Silverware"" architecture, Arsenault explains, Nintendo resisted these changes and continued to focus on traditional gameplay genres."	video games , game studies , business studies , video game history , platform studies , economics of innovation , Nintendo	en	19620.0
574	L’apprentissage social chez les pirates informatiques : Analyse de l’influence des relations d’entraide et de conflit sur le processus d’apprentissage	Technology has evolved at an unprecedented pace for several years, with no sign of slowing down in the years to come. Likewise, delinquent techniques and practices associated with computer piracy and hacking are also developing at the same speed. Hence, in order to remain prevailing, the individuals involved in such activities must remain on the lookout for technological advances and must be willing to learn those new techniques. As scholars have stated before, learning is a fundamentally social process and hackers form a community that relies on sharing information and knowledge. Several studies have addressed the offenders learning process and others have addressed the process of information sharing within the hacker community. However, few studies have combined the two subjects to try and understand the learning process that is taking place within the hacker community through information sharing.   Using a methodology based on social network analysis and a theoretical framework based on theories of differential association and social learning, this study seeks to understand the influence of collaboration and conflict on the social learning process in the hacker community. The analyses that made it possible were produced using data from an on-line discussion forum from which the edges of mutual support and conflict between the participants were noted. The results of these analyses show that the observed community presents specific members that concentrate the links of mutual assistance and conflict thus serving as the main mentors or tyrants and distributing the information (positive or negative) in a dispersed way and to several recipients. This research therefore illustrates the propensity of the hacker community to rely on the teachings or criticism of a minority, that will reach a majority of actors.

575	"Activation of Smad2 but not Smad3 is required to mediate TGF-β
signaling during axolotl limb regeneration"	Axolotls are unique among vertebrates in their ability to regenerate tissues, such as limbs, tail and skin. The axolotl limb is the most studied regenerating structure. The process is well characterized morphologically; however, it is not well understood at the molecular level. We demonstrate that TGF-β1 is highly upregulated during regeneration and that TGF-β signaling is necessary for the regenerative process. We show that the basement membrane is not prematurely formed in animals treated with the TGF-β antagonist SB- 431542. More importantly, Smad2 and Smad3 are differentially regulated post-translationally during the preparation phase of limb regeneration. Using specific antagonists for Smad2 and Smad3 we demonstrate that Smad2 is responsible for the action of TGF-β during regeneration, whereas Smad3 is not required. Smad2 target genes (Mmp2 and Mmp9) are inhibited in SB-431542-treated limbs, whereas non-canonical TGF-β targets (e.g. Mmp13) are unaffected. This is the first study to show that Smad2 and Smad3 are differentially regulated during regeneration and places Smad2 at the heart of TGF-β signaling supporting the regenerative process.

Moreover, a refined sound-field rendering tool dedicated to computer-assisted composition is introduced.	improvisation , Performance , Python , Max/MSP , Compositional process , Scientific theories , Electroacoustic , Contemporary music with electronic , Real-time processing , Physical modelling , Sociological modelling , Computer-assisted Composition , Spatialization software , Python Max/MSP , Ableton Live	en	19569.0
577	Enhancing infotainment applications quality of service in vehicular ad hoc networks	The fact that vehicular ad hoc network accommodates two types of communications, Vehicle-to-Vehicle and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure, has opened the door for a plethora of interesting applications to thrive. Some of these applications, known as infotainment applications, focus on enhancing the passengers' experience. They have rigid requirements in terms of delivery delay and throughput. Numerous approaches have been proposed, at medium access control and routing layers, to enhance the quality of service of such applications. However, existing schemes have several shortcomings. Subsequently, the design of new and efficient approaches is vital for the proper functioning of infotainment applications.   This work proposes three schemes. The first is a novel routing protocol, labeled SCRP. It leverages real-time vehicular traffic information to create backbones over road segments and connect them at intersections using bridge nodes. These nodes are responsible for collecting connectivity and delay information, which are used to select routing paths with low end-to-end delay. The second is an altruistic service channel selection scheme, labeled ASSCH. It first collects real-time service channels information and feeds it to a stochastic model that predicts the state of these channels in the near future. The least congested channels are then selected to be used. The third is an analytical model for the performance of the IEEE 802.11p Enhanced Distributed Channel Access mechanism that considers various factors, including the transmission opportunity (TXOP), unexploited by IEEE 802.11p.

578	L’influence du système scolaire français sur le système scolaire iranien de l’inauguration de l’école Dar ol-Fonoun jusqu’à la fin de l’époque des Qâdjârs (1851-1925)	The present work concerns the evolution of the educational system in Iran during the Qâdjâr dynasty and the role the French state and French actors played in this evolution. It seeks to highlight the influence of the French educational system on that of Iran, while at the same time avoiding a comparison between the two systems. This is a work of historical research, that aims to study the process of the creation of a modern educational system in Iran between 1851 and 1925. In seeking out the West, early 19th century Iran looked to make up for its tardiness in relation to industrialised European nations by borrowing their knowledge, technology and methods. Putting in place an educational system radically different from the preexisting system based on Quranic schools, called maktab, was a part of this movement and was seen by the progressive elite as a necessary condition for the modernisation of the country. The French educational model seemed to them to be the best one to follow, and with it French language and culture spread throughout the country. In this doctoral thesis, I intend first to analyse the socio-political backdrop of the installation of this new educational system via the creation of modern schools in Iran. I will then look at the modalities of the implementation of the system by both state and private actors, both Iranian and French.

579	Démographie et conflit : une analyse de la fécondité en Israël et en Palestine	Demography is central to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the consequences of high Palestinian and Israeli fertility have interested many scientists, as population balance is a key determinant in a potential peace settlement. Many researchers from various disciplines such as sociology, political science, or even philosophy contributed to the general understanding of the origins of the conflict and of its consequences on human populations. It goes without saying that to fully understand the issues and consequences of the conflict, a multidisciplinary approach is required. However, because this is a thesis in demography, we limit ourselves to the demographic aspects of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. For a more holistic approach, many important works are available.  The exceptionally high fertility in the region is often described as a “war of the cradles” ultimately aimed at gaining majority over the land. Such theories implying a political fertility have never been tested empirically simultaneously on both Palestinian Arabs and Jews (in Israel and the settlements in the Palestinian territories). The objective of this thesis is thus to explore different avenues allowing to expand knowledge on fertility dynamics in the region and to contribute to the existing literature on the demography of conflict and more precisely, on the consequences of an endemic conflict on fertility behaviour.  In the first of three articles, we are producing a descriptive portrait of fertility among Israelis and Palestinians living in Israel and the Palestinian territories of the West Bank and Gaza Strip with a particular interest for a number of fertility determinants such as contraception, age at marriage, immigration, and religiosity among others. Despite a clear heterogeneity between the subgroups, we aim at finding some resemblances among them, all exposed at different intensities to the consequences of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This represents the first attempt to analyze all groups in the same project using survey data.  The aim of the second article is to highlight the differences in fertility behaviour of the Jewish population living in Israel and to that of the Jewish population living in the settlements of the West Bank and Gaza Strip and to distinguish the effects of various determinants of Israeli fertility (nationalism, religiosity, and socioeconomic status) in both regions and over time using data from the 1995 and 2008 censuses. Even though many articles have studied the impact of such determinants of fertility in Israel, none yet has put the emphasis on the largely unknown settler population that has a significantly higher fertility than their counterparts in Israel.  In the last article, we are interested in quantifying the impact of individual and contextual factors on Palestinian fertility in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. We thus specifically evaluate the impact of contextual variables (number of checkpoints and year of violent uprising) and nationalism (proportion of Jewish settlers living in the same district) associated with the conflict while controlling for various socioeconomic and demographic variables often used in fertility studies. Even though the consequences of the conflict are often brought up as an explanation for the high Palestinian fertility, no research has tried to empirically test the validity of such hypotheses using survey data.  This thesis brings important contributions to the literature on fertility in this region. Indeed, it appears a though the usual determinants of fertility change do not seem to have an important effect on these populations. The inefficiency of such determinants can be partly explained by the consequences of the conflict. They led to an increased religiosity among many population groups, to a strong nationalist sentiment, and to institutions trying to alleviate most of the obstacles to fertility by generous fiscal incentives. In an uncertain social and political climate, traditional values such as family provide stability.

580	Le lien entre les cognitions, la victimisation sexuelle et la coercition sexuelle chez les femmes et les hommes universitaires	Feminist movements in the 1970s and 1980s brought about profound social changes in North America, such as the occurrence of sexual assaults. These social changes were translated into legislative modifications in Canada, as of 1983. The studies following these changes examined sexual coercion in non-delinquent populations. One of the notable conclusions of these studies is the existence of a significant dark figure with respect to sexual assaults. Indeed, studies done in the 1980s did not take into account female aggressors, as the phenomenon was perceived to be typically one attributed to males. Academic interest in sexual coercion committed by females is rooted in studies published in the 1990s. It was revealed that certain attitudes and beliefs are associated with the trivialization of sexual assault in women and in men. Similarities were also established between sexual coercion committed by males and females.   Little studies on the prevalence of sexual coercion have considered both men and women as potential aggressors. It is important to examine the attitudes and beliefs related to sexual coercion in the non-delinquent populations of Quebec.  An online survey was conducted using Survey Monkey. This survey contained four measures to examine attitudes associated to erroneous beliefs regarding rape, hostility against females, tolerance of interpersonal violence, as well as antagonistic beliefs and sexual conservatism. A fifth instrument was used to measure sexual experiences, both in terms of victimization and coercion. The sample contained 354 students of the Université de Montréal coming from various student associations.  The main results showed that females report less antagonistic beliefs than males. However, no differences were found between females and males regarding rape myth acceptance, hostility toward women, acceptance of interpersonal violence, adversarial sexual beliefs and sexual conservatism. In terms of sexual behaviors, females reported more sexual victimization than males. Little sexual coercion was reported in females and males. Results, however, showed that males had committed more sexual coercion than females. Additionally, it was found that hostility towards women predicted sexual victimization in females. Further, erroneous beliefs on rape predicted coercive sexual behaviors in women, whereas sexual conservatism predicted sexual coercion in women. Finally, sexual victimization predicted coercive sexual behaviors in both females and males.

581	Comprehension of concrete and abstract words in semantic variant primary progressive aphasia and Alzheimer’s disease: a behavioral and neuroimaging study	The aim of this study was to investigate the comprehension of concrete, abstract and abstract emotional words in semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and healthy elderly adults (HE) Three groups of participants (9 svPPA, 12 AD, 11 HE) underwent a general neuropsychological assessment, a similarity judgment task, and structural brain MRI. The three types of words were processed similarly in the group of AD participants. In contrast, patients in the svPPA group were significantly more impaired at processing concrete words than abstract words, while comprehension of abstract emotional words was in between. VBM analyses showed that comprehension of concrete words relative to abstract words was significantly correlated with atrophy in the left anterior temporal lobe. These results support the view that concrete words are disproportionately impaired in svPPA, and that concrete and abstract words may rely upon partly dissociable brain regions.

582	L’insertion professionnelle des enseignants en éducation physique et à la santé au primaire et au secondaire au Québec	In this research, we are interested in the process of professional induction of new physical education teachers. More precisely, we seek to identify the main factors influencing their professional induction as well as their perception on the knowledge acquired during their initial training and mobilized during this crucial stage. Thus, for several years, Quebec has undergone various economic and political changes. They affected the world of education and brought educational reforms, resulting in many transformations in education (Lessard and Tardif, 2004). Many writers expose these new challenges that teachers face, including the complexity of the teaching task, which has led several researchers to want to deepen the process of induction and the difficulties associated (De Stercke , 2014, Mukamurera, 2011, Mukamurera, Bourque and Gingras, 2008). Several find that the situation is marked, among other things, by burnout and dropping out of teachers, but also its transposition in other countries (Karsenti, et al., 2008; Cattonar, 2008). However, few studies focus on professional induction within the singular context of physical education and health (Grenier et al., 2014, Spallanzani et al., 2012, Blankenship and Coleman, 2009). It therefore seems appropriate to look at the situation and draw a representative portrait of Quebec. To achieve this, our theoretical framework is designed around the multidimensional model of Mukamurera (2013). The dimensions of this model will be related to the perception and the experience of each participant as to their induction as well as the knowledge resulting from their initial training. We hope that this will allow us to describe the conditions of professional induction of elementary and high school teachers in Quebec, to identify and analyze the factors influencing their professional induction experience and the knowledge mobilized during this stage. As part of this interpretative research, we have adopted a qualitative approach in order to better understand the reality of these teachers at the beginning of their careers. The fourteen participants in the sample were selected on a voluntary basis and were subjected to a semi-structured interview whose questions were developed according to the dimensions of the Mukamurera model (2013). The processing of the data took place in an inductive logic, and their analysis, by thematic content with the QDA-Miner software. It can be established that the perception of initial training is mixed. Teachers seem to have enjoyed the moments on the ground, but found several courses too theoretical and unrealistic. The results obtained also gave an overall picture of the induction process and to identify the structures that may influence the induction and the programs that offer support the new teachers.

583	L'implantation valvulaire aortique par cathéter : évolution des résultats cliniques suite aux avancées technologiques et techniques	Context: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is a relatively young procedure intended to treat patients with severe aortic stenosis who are at high risk for conventional surgery, or inoperable. This procedure underwent multiple technological improvements (successive generations of devices) and multiple technical improvements (simplification of various steps in the procedure).  Objective: We intend to describe the clinical impact of a technological improvement (the transition from the second to the third generation of the Edwards device in a high-volume center) and that of a technical improvement (TAVI without pre-dilatation, known as direct TAVI). Methods: We first describe, through a meta-analysis, the state of TAVI at the beginning of its widespread use, in 2012. Next, we describe, through a single-center retrospective study, the clinical impact of the transition from the second to the third generation of the Edwards device in 507 patients. Finally, in a retrospective study with matching, we tested three pre-dilatation strategies: systematic pre-dilatation, selective pre-dilatation, and direct TAVI. Results: In the article describing the initial TAVI experience, the 30-day mortality rate was between 5 and 18%. One-year mortality was estimated at 23% by meta-analysis (random effects model). Stroke rate at 30 days was between 0 and 6.7% and major vascular complication rate was between 2 and 16%. The transition from SAPIEN XT to SAPIEN 3 resulted in a non-significant reduction in 30-day mortality (from 8.7 to 3.5%; p=0.21) and 30-day stroke rate (from 2.8 to 1.4%; p=0.6), and a significant reduction in major vascular complications (from 9.9 to 2.8%; p<0.0001). However, there was a significant increase in permanent pacemaker rate (from 9.8 to 17.3%; p=0.03). Next, we found no adverse effect of performing direct TAVI in terms of mortality or vascular complications at 30 days. We found a trend towards a reduction in stroke rate with direct TAVI (3 vs. 1%; p=0.11), particularly in patients with mildly or moderately calcified valves. However, in those with extensive valvular calcification, the risk of device malposition was numerically higher. In all three studies presented, there was little variation in 1-year mortality (20 to 25%).  Conclusions: Short-term adverse events were reduced by the transition towards the third-generation Edwards device. Direct TAVI is feasible and safe. However, both of these improvements have limitations and should be considered carefully.

584	Fonction auriculaire gauche dans la maladie de Fabry par analyse échocardiographique de la déformation myocardique	Background: Fabry disease (FD) is characterized by the accumulation of sphingolipids in multiple organs including the left atrium (LA). It is uncertain if the LA reservoir, conduit and contractile functions evaluated by speckle-tracking echocardiography are affected in Fabry cardiomyopathy and whether enzyme replacement therapy can improve LA function. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, LA strain, strain rates and phasic LA volumes were studied in 50 FD patients and compared to 50 healthy controls.  Results: All three LA phasic functions were altered. The peak positive strain (reservoir function) was 38.9 ± 14.9 % vs. 46.5 ± 10.9 % (p=0.004) and the late diastolic strain (contractile function) was 12.6 ± 5.9 % vs. 15.6 ± 5.3 % (p=0.010). In 15 patients who started enzyme replacement therapy during the study, most of the LA parameters improved at one-year follow-up (peak positive strain from 32.0 ± 13.5 % to 38.0 ± 13.5 %; p=0.006) whereas there was a trend towards deterioration in 15 patients who never received treatment (peak positive strain from 47.3 ± 10.8 % to 41.3 ± 9.3 %; p=0.058). Nine FD patients (21%) experienced new-onset atrial fibrillation or stroke during four-year follow-up. By univariate analysis, peak positive strain and early diastolic strain demonstrated significant associations with clinical events, surpassing conventional echocardiographic parameters and clinical characteristics. Conclusions: Left atrial reservoir, conduit and contractile functions by speckle-tracking echocardiography were all affected in FD. Enzyme replacement therapy improved LA function. Left atrial strain parameters were associated with atrial fibrillation and stroke.

585	Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase de classe II : aspects structural et dynamique dans le mécanisme réactionnel	Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase catalyzes the reversible aldol reaction in glucose metabolism interconverting dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) into D-fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP). Aldolases are furthermore classified based on their reaction mechanism: class I aldolase (e. g. human aldolase) forms a covalent Schiff base intermediate with substrate, whereas class II aldolase utilizes a divalent metal cation in catalysis.  Class II aldolase is commonly found in pathogenic organisms such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis (tuberculosis), Giardia lamblia (giardiasis), Escherichia coli (diverse infections) and  Helicobacter pylori (ulcer and gastric cancer) but not in mammals. This distribution makes class II aldolase a potential target for drug discovery. Structure driven drug design depends on an explicit knowledge of the reaction mechanism of class II aldolase and its three-dimensional structure. Our current knowledge is lacking; existing aldolase crystal structures with reaction intermediates and with competitive inhibitors are not coherent with proposed mechanisms in literature.   The present study focuses on the catalytic role of two residues, each located on a mobile loop of  H. pylori class II aldolase and each implicated in a critical proton transfer step. Single mutants H180Q and E142A were characterized enzymatically and crystallized for X-ray structure determination. Crystal structures of reaction intermediates formed with substrate were determined. The catalytic mechanism requires proton abstraction at the FBP C4 hydroxyl group to initiate C3-C4 bond cleavage, first step of the retroaldol reaction. Our data supports His180 situated on the mobile loop beta6-alpha8, as the residue responsible for this proton transfer. Notably, His180 chelates the zinc ion in the native structure. The structural change induced due to C1 phosphate binding of FBP releases His180 to promote cleavage. Displacement of the catalytic zinc ion ensues, facilitating substrate binding and subsequent stabilization of the enediolate intermediate. Our results do not support the previous hypothesis of a catalytic role for Asp82 in C4 hydroxyl group proton abstraction; it rather plays an important role in maintaining structural integrity for active site binding. Displacement of the nascent aldehyde G3P and concomitant stereospecific protonation of the enediolate species generates the obligate triose phosphate, DHAP. Dissociation of DHAP from the active site completes the catalytic cycle. The residue responsible for initiating enediolate protonation was identified as residue Glu142, situated on mobile loop beta5-alpha7, and this is in agreement with previous kinetic studies of enediolate protonation in other class II aldolases, attributing the same role to this conserved residue. We devised a molecular dynamic simulation method to follow the catalytic loop folding event, further investigating details of the role of Glu142 in catalysis. We gained further knowledge of the cleavage event, although work remains to elucidate missing details of the catalysis and integrate our findings. By attributing a role in catalysis to loop beta6-alpha8 not limited to substrate binding, this loop of class II aldolases becomes a potential target in drug design. In addition, ligand independent zinc ion migration suggest it is possible to chelate the metal and restrain it far from the active site.

586	L'entrée sur le marché du travail des jeunes adultes : enquête longitudinale auprès de diplômés de second cycle à Montréal	Based upon a longitudinal study about ten graduate students in Montreal, this research uses a short temporal perspective of entering into labour market, and highlights the subjective tensions between personal fulfilment at work through constant learning, and economic independence through employment. Monthly interviews from may to december 2016 were made, from witch four consecutive phases emerged : the phase of professional prospection (through the formulation of a professional project), the phase of waiting and delay (by adjusting to new rhythms and autonomous learning), the phase of confrontation with the job market reality (with the potential achievement of professional project), and the phase of professional choice (characterized by labour market integration and by youth and adulthood representations). To that end, this study emphasizes the relationship between work and employment of young adults and its symbolic components, linked to the in-betweenness of emerging adulthood.

587	Le marketing politique chez les partis politiques québécois lors des élections de 2012 et de 2014	"This dissertation studies the adoption of political marketing by the political parties in Québec. We hear by political marketing a succession of integrated steps (marketing process) which allows a political party to identify a need from the electorate and to create a product to answer it. Thereby, to the question, ""Did the four main political parties in Québec (Parti Québécois, Parti libéral du Québec, Coalition Avenir Québec and Québec solidaire) used political marketing during the past provincial elections of 2012 and 2014?"" we had the hypothesis that the Québec context, in 2012 and 2014, did not allow the political parties to adopt a marketing approach during their campaign. In this respect, we led a qualitative study based on interviews led with political campaign managers from each party, who worked during the past elections of 2012 and 2014. A collection of qualitative data and an analysis based on two elements (political marketers and the way they followed the marketing process) allowed us to counter our initial hypothesis and to establish that the some political parties used the political marketing during the elections of 2012 and 2014, while others focused on tactical marketing."

588	Consommation d’alcool du jeune et de ses amis et style d’attachement à l’adolescence : étude des mécanismes de sélection et de socialisation	Alcohol use (AU) in adolescence is often linked with immediate or long-term negative consequences. Among the best-known predictors of adolescent AU is friend use.  Two mechanisms can explain this association: socialization and peer selection. Studies comparing both mechanisms have had inconsistent results, perhaps because of methodological variations or limitations. Thus, further studies are needed and examination of possible moderator is advised. Adolescent attachment is an interesting potential moderator as it is closely linked with interpersonal relationships.  Study aims. Thus, using cross-lagged models to account for bidirectional associations and independent assessments of adolescent and friend alcohol use, this study aims to examine in a cohort of 14-year-old children followed over two years (1) the relations between participant and friend self-reported alcohol use and binge drinking frequency and (2) the moderating role of attachment style in these relations.  Method. Participants come from a Quebec longitudinal study where 182 adolescents and up to five of their friends reported annually on their AU and binge drinking (BD) frequency between 14 and 16 years. Participants completed the “Avoidance of social relations” and “Preoccupation with being loved” scales of the Attachment Style Questionnaire at 15.  Results and conclusion. Results show that the cross-lagged path coefficients between participant AU at 14 or 15 and friend use a year later were stronger than the ones between friend use at 14 or 15 and participant use a year later for both the AU and BD models. As such, the selection mechanism prevails over the socialization one between 14 and 16. Two significant moderation using the avoidance scale in the AU models were found, showing that selection (14-15 years old) and socialization (15-16 years old) weights were weaker for avoidant adolescents, suggesting that adolescents with low avoidance are more susceptible to peer influence related to alcohol use.	adolescence , consommation excessive , peer influence , alcohol use , binge drinking , socialization , peer selection , attachment , avoidance	en	19388.0
589	Placement automatique de sondes d’irradiance	Diffuse global illumination within a 3D scene can be approximated in real time using irradiance probes. Probe placement typically relies on significant human input, and final quality of the approximation is often left to the subjectivity of a lighting artist. As demand for realism in rendering increases, the need to enhance the quality of such approximations is greater. We propose a method to automatically place probes in a scene by minimizing an error function. We guide probes to optimal sampling locations by applying gradient descent to an error function that represents similarity between our interpolated results and reference irradiance values. Using weighted nearest neighbour interpolation, we were able to reliably construct probe sets with minimal input in three scenes. Comparing our results to those produced by a set of probes placed on a 3D grid, we were theoretically successful in one scene, in which we could obtain lower error values with fewer probes. We obtained partial success in the other scenes, depending on the number of samples used.

590	Michel-Ange et le motif des genitalia : signification, perception et censure	We propose a study on the male genitalia in Michelangelo’s production, in order to grasp the significance in different works of art depending on the subject that they represent. By focusing on four pieces of art of the Florentine artist, we would like to clarify the visual impact of the male genitals unveiled and the perception from the Italian audience of the fifteenth century and sixteenth century. The Bacchus (1496-1497), The David, (1501-1504), The Risen Christ (1519-1520) and The Last Judgment (1536-1541) have been chosen for the variety of the topics they illustrate and for the different contexts of production and exhibition. We compare religious pieces of art to profane pieces of art to identify specific issues that result in every case. The decision to stick to only Michelango’s artistic production also implies looking at a specific type of male figure, directly inspired by the Antiquity.   For a better understanding of what results from the genitalia’s unveiling, we define essential notions like nude, nudity, sexuality, masculinity and virility in the Renaissance. With a historiographical approach based on The Sexuality of Christ in Renaissance Art and in Modern Oblivion, written by Leo Steinberg, we support his hypothesis about the representations of Christ’ genitals. And with a historical approach we suggest some hypotheses about the nudity of iconic figures realised by Michelangelo.  By focusing mainly on the pieces of art mentioned above and the detail of genitalia, we notice that artists, such as Michelangelo, did not represent this detail by chance, but because this part of the body is rich of signification and can serve to express many concepts.

591	Entre proximité et distance : comique et rire bergsonien dans le théâtre de Fabien Cloutier	Fabien Cloutier’s plays spark copious laughter in spectators, but said laughter is often accompanied by a sense of discomfort which takes over the theatre. What part does the comic play in Fabien Cloutier’s work, and what is the function of audience members’ laughter during performances? This paper argues that laughter, as provoked by Fabien Cloutier’s theatre, serves a fundamentally critical purpose. Using the dynamics of both identification and distanciation at play in Fabien Cloutier’s theatre, this paper proposes that the critical function of laughter in plays Scotstown, Cranbourne, Billy [Les jours de hurlement] and Pour réussir un poulet be studied in light of the Bergsonian theory of laughter, which conceives of laughter as a social corrective.

592	Sa disparition, suivi de fragmentation, répétition, subversion : le procédé du sampling chez Olivier Cadiot	On the morning of April 28th, the narrator arrives at the center where her grandmother, Aline Martin, has been living, only to find that she has disappeared. Deeply shaken, the young woman refuses to leave the residence until her grandmother has been found. The story of Sa disparition builds itself around fragments of discourses drawn from various sources – interviews with residents in care centres, on-line family support groups, ministry policies, reports from NGOs, journalistic coverage – and becomes an investigation whose goal is not so much to find Aline as to shed light on the discourses that have been constructed in our political space in order to justify the disappearance of the elderlies from our social radar. This fragment-based writing is related to Olivier Cadiot’s sampling method, by which he collects, organizes and shakes up oral and textual objects in an attempt to disarticulate prevailing discourses. The essay examines Cadiot’s sampling method by analysing three important aspects of his novel Le colonel des zouaves: the subversion of citations, the loop structure and the fragmentation of the subject.

593	Examen des difficultés psychosociales chez des adolescents, neuf (9) mois après une tragédie ferroviaire	Objectives: To examine the psychosocial difficulties in a group of exposed adolescents aged 14 to 18 nine months after the railway accident. Compare adolescents who reach the clinical level of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) to those who do not, depending on range severity of exposure and on symptoms of depression, anxiety and other related issues. Methods: The analyses were conducted on a suitability sample of 227 young people, with an average age of 15.96 years, in secondary levels III, IV and V, and living in the Mégantic sector of the Eastern Townships in the province of Quebec. Results: Almost half (41.5%) of adolescents report being severely exposed to the railway accident and one third (29.6%) has described severe PTSD symptoms reaching the clinical threshold. In addition, there appears to be a tendency for a higher proportion of girls compared to boys to have PTSD problems and depression and anxiety symptoms. The majority of adolescents report a non-problematic use of psychoactive substances, while 8% are at risk or problematic. Delinquency, mainly non-violent, is more common among boys. Adolescents who reach a clinical threshold of PTSD symptoms have been more severely exposed to the tragedy and report feeling more depressed and anxious. There was no significant relationship between PTSD and externalized behaviours. Conclusion: The results of the study highlight the relationship between a traumatic event such as the railway accident and the presence of PTSD symptoms as well as of internalized behaviours in a group of adolescents.	adolescents , consommation de substances psychoactives , Railway accident , post-traumatic stress disorder , depression , anxiety , use of psychoactive substances , delinquency	en	19346.0
594	Sentiment de justice chez les personnes victimes : le rôle de l'information et du contact humain	Victims’ needs are numerous and have been repeatedly listed as needs of information, reparation, psychological support, status within the criminal justice system, protection and practical needs. With procedural and interactional justices as background, information and human contact are assessed in terms of responding to the victims’ needs. The sample represents 188 victims in the Quebec legal process between December 2003 and March 2004. Information on support services and contact with those services are, in bivariate level, directly related to the sense of justice. At the finish line, however, the multivariate level tells us that information about the investigation remains the only variable related to this sense of justice. Finally, in terms of human contact, contact with the Crime Victims Assistance Centers (CAVAC) and sustained contact with the police are important variables.

595	Nitric oxide signalling in astrocytes	In the brain, astrocytes are the most abundant glial cells and play various roles including maintenance of tripartite synapses and regulation of CBF. An endogenous signal molecule that has a potential to have an effect on regulation of both synaptic activity and CBF is nitric oxide (NO). Previous studies have demonstrated that NO is produced in endothelial cells and neurons by endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), respectively. However, the source of NO production in astrocyte remains uncertain. Therefore, we propose that constitutive NOS signalling pathways may exist in astrocyte and can be activated by different neurotransmitters. The aim of this thesis is to identify the sources and activators of NO production in mouse cortical astrocytes. Identification of constitutive NOS isoforms done by means of electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry revealed the expression of both eNOS and nNOS in astrocytes. All preparations were performed in astrocyte cultures and brain slice preparations labeled with 4- amino-5-methylamino-2',7'-difluorescein (DAF-FM) diacetate, a cell-permeant NO indicator that becomes cell-impermeable once inside cells. Therefore, I took advantage of this feature to evaluate NO production exclusively in astrocytes using single and multi-photon confocal microscopy. We then tested whether cholinergic and glutamatergic agonists that have the capacity to increase intracellular Ca2+ concentration can induce an increase in astrocytic NO. Both in vitro and ex vivo, NO production levels indicate that cholinergic and glutamatergic stimulations can induce astrocytic NO increases, which was abolished by the non-selective NOS inhibitor L- NG -Nitro-arginine. Moreover, the NO response to ACh was absent in eNOS-/- mice, while trans-1-aminocyclopentane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid (t-ACPD) barely affected NO production in nNOS-/- mice. These results imply that astrocytic eNOS and nNOS can be triggered discretely by distinct activation cascades (cholinergic and metabotropic glutamatergic). Furthermore, studies on cytosolic Ca2+ mobilization point out the importance of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ as key in the mechanism of NO production, and suggests a signalling pathway that t-ACPD causes IP3Rs to elicit RyRs-mediated Ca2+ efflux, which in turn, activates adjacent nNOS and leads to NO production. Furthermore, superfusion of in vitro and ex vivo preparations with N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) evoked an increase in NO in eNOS-/- and nNOS-/- mice. The NO production was attenuated through removal of PSD-95/nNOS complex. This result posits that astrocytic NMDA receptor may comprise the functional NR2B/PSD- 95/nNOS signalling cassette. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that: i) cortical astrocytes express both eNOS and nNOS; ii) nNOS colocalizes with ryanodine receptor 2 and 3, whereas membrane nNOS colocalizes with NR2B-containing NMDA receptor; iii) neuronal stimulation has the capacity of inducing eNOS- and nNOS-produced NO in astrocytes via different activation signalling; iv) activation of cytosolic nNOS requires the activation of ryanodine receptors. Collectively, these data suggest a compartmentalized and specific NO production following neuronal stimulation probably for a fine and polarized regulation of astrocytic functions. This work provides new insight into physiological consequences for neuronal and vascular functions and ameliorates our understanding of astrocytic NO function in the brain.

596	Regulation of chromosome condensation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae during mitosis	Chromosomal condensation is a vital process required for sister chromatid separation during cell division and for maintaining the structural integrity of the chromatin. The central effector of this process is a highly conserved pentameric protein complex known as condensin. The condensin complex is found in all eukaryotes and is essential for viability.  However, it is not clearly known how condensin initiates chromosome condensation at the onset of mitosis. Condensin is a target for various cell cycle kinases during mitosis. So we hypothesized that post-translational modifications might play an important role in activating condensation in early mitosis. Consistent with our hypothesis, we showed that Cdk1 phosphorylates Smc4 in the condensin complex during early mitosis and initiates chromosomal condensation process. Importantly, the Smc4 phospho-mutant experienced defects in condensation. We have also uncovered an intermediate stage during this process, the intertwist. We further demonstrated that the CDK-dependent modification of condensin regulates the dynamic binding of the complex to chromatin, thereby promoting effective chromatin compaction during cell division. We showed that the dynamic binding of condensin is regulated by VCP/p97/Cdc48 (AAA-ATPase), a molecular chaperon known for extracting chromatin-bound proteins. Supporting this idea, we have observed chromosome condensation defects in three conditional-lethal mutants of CDC48 (cdc48-3, cdc48-6 and cdc48-9). We determined that the role of Cdc48 in chromosome condensation requires the activity of Cdc48 co-factors Ufd1-Npl4 and also this process depends on protein ubiquitylation. Finally, we show that the kinetics of condensin mobility on chromatin is dependent on Cdc48. These observations suggest that Cdc48 is acting as a molecular chaperone to facilitate the removal of condensin from chromatin thereby promoting chromosome condensation. Taken together, our work highlights novel regulatory mechanisms responsible for effective chromosome morphogenesis during cell division.

597	""" Un peuple se sauve lui-même"" Le Solidarity Movement et la restructuration de l'activisme afrikaner en Afrique du Sud depuis 1994"	The thesis aims at understanding the restructuration processes of the Afrikaner movement following the South African democratic transition. Despite the collapse of Afrikaner nationalism caused by the end of the apartheid regime and the seizure of political power by a non-racist and non-ethnic party in 1994, we have seen a renewal of the Afrikaner identity movement since the 2000s. The aim of this thesis is therefore to understand the emergence of this new ethnic activism since the democratic transition. To deepen our understanding of the phenomenon, we ask the following questions: how can we explain the renewal of Afrikaner activism in the « new » South Africa? How are the new attributes of the Afrikaner category redefined? How do the ethnopolitical elites restructure their strategies to ensure the reproduction of the category within the new national context? What does the resurgence of a renewed Afrikanerity tell us about the state of social cohesion in South Africa and the ethnolinguistic mobilization in general? The literature on the post apartheid movement makes consensus on the death of the racist Afrikaner nationalism but offers little empirical analysis to understand the dynamics of this new phenomenon and the links with the many writings on Afrikaner nationalism are not made. To remedy these empirical shortcomings, our argument is that the new Afrikaner activism is in continuity with the trajectory of Afrikaner nationalism, more precisely with the conservative current. Ethnopolitical entrepreneurs follow the paths traced by their predecessors by reproducing political and institutional strategies as well as an ideological structure whose foundations are similar to those of the nationalist movement. However, continuity means that institutions must adapt to changing contexts in order to persist over time. In our case, the democratic transition has paved the way for institutional adaptation processes and historical awakening. Afrikaner activism is restructured through three processes. Ethnopolitical entrepreneurs are engaged in a framing process of the new attributes of the category in which community self-sufficiency is defined as the heart of Afrikanerity. Then, these elites try to institutionalize a new category as the new foundation of the political action of the movement. This is how ethno-political entrepreneurs mobilize what they call discriminated racial and ethnic minorities. This group-making process aims to stimulate collective action by depicting a frame of injustice to prove that Afrikaners are discriminated against by the government. This political strategy is deployed both nationally and internationally to exert pressure on the ANC government. Finally, ethnopolitical entrepreneurs have set up a network of ethnic organizations to ensure the reproduction of Afrikanerity and ensure ethnic survival. These ecological niches make it possible to replace the State by offering the members of the community services and by creating spaces for the routinization of Afrikanerity.

598	Pour une poétique historique du point de vue médiatisé au cinéma	Since the 1990s, a formal pattern that has become increasingly popular in film is the combined use or “conjunction” of the intradiegetic camcorder and the mediated point of view, two devices that are represented respectively by a camcorder integrated to a filmic narration and the point of view of what an intradiegetic camera (camcorder or not) is shooting in a given scene. Taking this observation as a starting point, this dissertation proposes to examine some of the characteristics of these devices, using the tools of Kristin Thompson’s neoformalism and David Bordwell’s historical poetics, with concern both for their uses in movies and their evolution in the history of cinema. This research problem is divided into two aspects. The first is analytical and is concern with a corpus of movies that make salient use of the intradiegetic camcorder or the mediated point of view: American Beauty (1999), The Blair Witch Project (1999), Caché (2005) and Le journal d’un coopérant (2010). The objective is to reveal a series of functions, strategies, norms, conventions and alternatives that are characteristic of the use of these devices. To achieve this, the main corpus will be compared with a larger one composed of a variety of movies from classical as well as modern cinema. The second aspect is historical and is concerned with the particular stylistic evolution of these two devices and their conjunction, primarily in classical Hollywood cinema. On the one hand, the study of intradiegetic cameras prior to the 1980s (during the period before the invention of the camcorder) elucidates the differences and similarities between previous and actual cinema. On the other hand, the recent evolution of the intradiegetic camcorder and the mediated point of view since the 1980s provides insight into the way in which this conjunction has developed in parallel with other phenomena such as the development of the amateur mode, the new possibilities offered by shooting in video for the film industry, the expansion of pornographic gonzo cinema or the popularization of the run and gun style and of the hand-held camera. Using these observations, we will determine the extent to which the popularity of the conjunction of the intradiegetic camcorder and the mediated point of view is representative of a fragmentation or an intensification of the style of contemporary cinema compared to the cinema of previous periods.

599	Le développement de collections de jeux vidéo dans les bibliothèques universitaires en Amérique du Nord : étude exploratoire	Video games are culturally and socially important; they are part of daily life for most North Americans and were the most profitable leisure industry of 2014. Interest in this document was sparked in the academic community and several disciplines have studied it, such as psychology, sociology and information science. Some universities have created entire departments devoted to the study of video games: Game Studies. This rise in interest sometimes leads to the creation of a video games collection in academic libraries; this issue is not addressed in academic literature, however, only professional. This research aims to bring a scientific and objective viewpoint to an issue many academic libraries may experience. To do so, we conducted a multiple case study and interviewed librarians, members of the libraries’ staff, teachers and students of two universities, one Canadian and the other, American. This qualitative approach was chosen to answer our four research questions: [1] What are the elements influencing the development of video game collections?, [2] How do professionals treat video games in their collection development activities?, [3] How are video games used by patrons of academic libraries?, and [4] What is the impact of video games on the libraries’ employees tasks?  The results show that the elements influencing the development of video game collections in academic libraries are mostly organisational and financial and that technological elements have to be taken into account when doing retrospective collection development. The development of video game collections differs from that of traditional documents in academic libraries, because librarians choose titles one by one and the important selection criteria include the users’ demands and the support to access the information in the game. Furthermore, clerks and other employees may have to clean and repair objects that are not working properly. The potential users of these collections – teachers and students using video games for teaching or for research – do not use the library’s resources, mainly because they are unaware of them, but also because they cannot borrow them and bring them home. Finally, other than the tasks related to the development of the video game collection, the impact on the employees is minimal, notably because these resources are isolated in the libraries and because employees do not work with other types of documents.

600	La fin du Dorsétien au Nunavik : l'assemblage lithique de KcFs-2 (Iles Nuvuk)	This thesis presents the technological analysis of a Late Dorset lithic assemblage from the Nuvuk Islands in Nunavik. The technological approach and the chaine opératoire have been used to define the “technological system” of the occupants of House 3 at KcFs-2, dated between 940±20 and 970±15 BP. The technological analysis has provided information about many spheres of technological behavior related to the acquisition of raw material, to the management of blanks and preforms, to production objectives, to knapping techniques and finally to the “volumetric conceptions’’ of the site’s occupants. In order to question the actual chronocultural framework and to overcome problems associated with the typological approach traditionally used in the Eastern Arctic, this data has been compared to the data from the GhGk-63 (Kuujjuarapik) and Tayara (KbFk-7) sites, which have been use to define the Classic Dorset in Nunavik (Desrosiers 2009). The comparative analysis of Classic Dorset and Late Dorset “technological systems” has shed light on the continuities that characterise Dorset technological traditions over approximatively a millennium.

601	L’efficacité du CD154 monomérique dans le traitement des complications thrombotiques	CD154 has emerged as an important player in the pathogenesis of several autoimmune diseases, as well as vascular dysfunctions. CD154 is a member of the tumour necrosis factor family of pivotal importance in humoral immunity. However, CD154 also shares critical inflammatory functions through its interaction with its classical CD40 receptor or recently identified binding partners, namely αIIbβ3, α5β1 and αMβ2. These responses imply CD154 as a key factor in chronic inflammatory disorders including autoimmune diseases and thrombosis. Disrupting the interaction of CD154 with its receptors through anti-CD154 Abs significantly inhibits the development of these diseases, albeit serious side effects have been associated with these therapies. To overcome these adverse effects, other approaches such as knockout, antisense oligonucleotide and siRNA targeting were developed. These approaches were focused on the CD154/CD40 interaction and did not address the interaction of CD154 with its other receptors. Thus, there is a need for novel CD154 treatments for the prevention/abrogation of inflammatory or autoimmune diseases that address all CD154 receptors. Our group profoundly investigated the structural/functional interaction of CD154 with its various receptors. Given the importance of the trimeric structure of CD154 for its biological activity, we generated monomeric form of the molecule that can specifically bind to one receptor without inducing intracellular activation. This agent represents a potential therapeutic tool for the treatment of CD154-mediated diseases such as thrombotic events.	CD154 , Mutant , Receptor , Monomer , Thrombosis	en	19251.0
602	Objective and subjective measures of sleep among preschoolers: Disentangling attachment security and dependency	Many scholars have proposed that parent-child attachment security should favor child sleep. Research has yet, however, to provide convincing support for this hypothesis. The current study used objective measures of sleep and attachment to assess the longitudinal links between mother-child attachment security and subsequent sleep, controlling for child dependency. Sixty-two middle-class families (30 girls) were met twice, when children were 15 months (Wave 1; W1) and 2 years of age (Wave 2; W2). At W1, mother-child attachment was assessed with the observer version of the Attachment Q-Sort. At W2, children wore an actigraph monitor for 72 hours. Results indicated that children more securely attached to their mothers subsequently slept more at night and had higher sleep efficiency, and these predictions were not confounded by child dependency. These findings suggest a unique role for secure attachment relationships in the development of young children’s sleep regulation, while addressing methodological issues that have long precluded consensus in this literature.		en	19228.0
603	Associations between early maternal sensitivity and children's sleep throughout early childhood	Despite strong theoretical reasons to believe that the quality of parent-infant interactions should influence child sleep, the empirical evidence for links between maternal behavior and children’s sleep is equivocal. Notably, it is unclear at which ages such influences might be particularly salient. The current study aimed to examine prospective longitudinal associations between early maternal sensitivity and children’s sleep during early childhood. Maternal sensitivity was assessed at 12 months during a home visit. Children’s sleep was measured at 12 and 18 months as well as at 2, 3, and 4 years, using a sleep diary completed by mothers. Results revealed significant or marginal positive associations between maternal sensitivity and children’s sleep consolidation (percentage of nighttime sleep) at 2, 3 and 4 years, but not at the most proximal assessments of 12 and 18 months. These findings suggest that child age could potentially be a key factor in the associations between maternal behavior and children’s sleep.

604	Une activité d’apprentissage favorisant le développement d’un sentiment d’efficacité personnelle en soutien à la compétence de rigueur scientifique	Despite its importance in providing quality care, evidence-based clinical decision-making remains sub-optimal in nursing practice (Forsman, Wallin, Gustavsson, & Rudman, 2012; Melnyk, Fineout Overholt, Gallagher-Ford & Kaplan, 2012; Pravikoff, Tanner, & Pierce, 2005), which would be linked to nurses individual factors such as skills in research (Jones, Crookes, & Johnson, 2011, Melnyk et al., 2012), attitudes (Squires, Estabrooks, Gustavsson et Wallin, 2011) and self-efficacy on evidence-based practice (EBP; Kajermo et al., 2010). To support EBP, nursing baccalaureate programs should promote the development of these factors (ACÉSI, 2010).  An innovative learning activity was developed and tested with 248 undergraduate nursing students. Using the flipped classroom method, the activity was aimed at fostering the development of scientific competence and a positive self-efficacy in EBP. This report presents, in the form of an article, the development and testing of this activity as well as the evaluation of its impact on self-efficacy, attitudes regarding EBP and research utilisation among nursing students.

L’écriture de l’enfance dans « Du côté de chez Swann » et « Mort à crédit »	"From the thematically and chronologically close works that are ""Du côté de chez Swann"" and ""Mort à crédit"", this article tries to think together the autobiographical dimension of the coming-­‐ of-­‐age story with the discovery of the modern world that is orchestrated and put to crisis within those novels. The starting point of this reflection is to be found in the literary theories of the philosophical archeology of Foucault, for whom literature is a redistribution of the signs of the society and also a margin in which the order of history comes to fail and to be redistributed. In Proust’s as in Celine’s works, childhood’s naivety is reloaded with a primitively charged critique that allows a reflexive resumption of existence and writing."	Proust, Marcel	en	19174.0
606	Développement de méthodes analytiques par LC-MS/MS pour la caractérisation de l’activité et de l’expression des CYP450s chez l’humain	This research project is divided into two sections, both aiming at the development of sensitive and specific LC-MS methods to evaluate activity and expression of CYP450 and finally, looking at their clinical application. The first section of this research project focuses on the development of analytical methods by LC-MS/MS for a seven CYP450 probe-drug cocktail. Although these cocktails have shown value they also suffer from many limitations. Our objective was to develop and validate highly sensitive and selective LC-MS/MS assays allowing the determination of CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 3A4/5 and 2E1 activities following administration of low oral doses of a modified CYP450 probe-drug cocktail in patients. These methods can be used to phenotype CYP450 activities, evaluate inter-individual variabilities, study the impact of pathological conditions on drug metabolism and elimination, and evaluate drug-drug interactions. Our CYP450 cocktail assays have been successfully applied to phenotype CYP450 activities in type 2 diabetic patients. The second section of this project aims at the development of a LC-HRMS method for the characterization and absolute quantification of CYP1A1, 1A2, 1B1, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 2J2, 3A4, 3A5, 3A7 and 4F2 in the human small intestine. Our hypothesis suggests that CYP450 isoenzymes found along the small intestine can significantly affect the first-pass effect of certain drugs administered orally and thus influence their pharmacological and/or toxic effects. My participation in this project allowed to identify proteotypic peptides by in silico and in vitro digestion and to develop LC-HRMS methods allowing the absolute quantification of CYP450. This project is a first step in the characterization of the main CYP450 along the small intestine. This project will allow a better understanding of inter-individual variability in drug response associated with intestinal absorption of drugs, a better prediction of variability in drug bioavailability and to develop more complex pharmacokinetic models.

607	Les effets du fentanyl sur la douleur et la motricité suite à une hémorragie intracérébrale induite chez le rat	The pain associated with traumatic brain injury is linked with the central nervous system sensitization and chronic cephalalgia when pain is not treated. However, analgesics in human patient must be done with caution since they are associated with cognitive and motor deficits. The present study aims to assess the efficiency of fentanyl to treat pain and evaluate motor behaviors on a rat model of intracerebral hemorrhage (IH).   Twenty-one male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent a stereotaxic surgery to produce a collagenase-induced IH with an injection of 2 µL of colagenase (0.5 UI) in the right caudoputamen nucleus. The control group (n=6) received saline subcutaneously (SC), and experimental groups received either 5 (n=6), 10 (n=6), or 20 (n=3) µg/kg of fentanyl SC, 2h following surgery and on the 2 subsequent days. The rat grimace scale, a neurological examination, balance beam test and rotarod test were performed for 5 consecutive days postoperatively to evaluate pain and motor performance. At the end of the experimentation, the animals were euthanized, the brains were collected and evaluated to determine hematoma volume, the number of reactive astrocytes and necrotic neurons.  When compared to controls, the grimace scale has showed that 5 µg/kg fentanyl significantly alleviated pain on day 2 only (p<0.01) and that 10 µg/kg alleviated pain on days 1 (p<0.01), 2 (p<0.001), and 3 (p<0.01). For the rotarod test, only the 10 µg/kg group showed significant decreases in performance on days 5 (p<0.05) and 6 (p<0.02). The neurologic exam was not significantly different between groups, but only the hopping test showed a poor recuperation for the 5 and 10 µg/kg fentanyl group when compared to saline (p<0.01). During brains exams, no differences were found between groups for the results of the 3 parameters.  Fentanyl, at a dose of 10 µg/kg SC, has provided a substantial analgesia following a collagenase-induced intracerebral hemorrhage in rats; however it can alter motor performance following analgesic treatments.

608	Sensibilité non-visuelle à la lumière et décalage du cycle éveil-sommeil	Problem: Some people suffer from having a delayed sleep schedule that they can’t modify to satisfy school/work requirements. These individuals suffer from sleep deprivation and sleepiness when they have to comply with a socially acceptable schedule. Despite its high prevalence, the etiology of a delayed schedule remains unknown.  Objective: This study aims to elucidate factors that might contribute to the maintenance of a delayed sleep schedule in young adults.  Methods: Fourteen young adults (8 women) complaining of delayed sleep schedule were compared to matched subjects with an adapted sleep schedule. Habitual bedtime (HB) was after midnight in all delayed subjects and before midnight in all adapted subjects. Subjects were admitted 5h before HB and kept in dim light for 6h. They were then exposed for 1.5h to blue light. Salivary melatonin and subjective sleepiness were assessed every 30 min. Melatonin suppression was used to measure circadian sensitivity to light. Dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) was used to estimate circadian phase.  Results: DLMO was later in the delayed than in the adapted group. There was no difference for melatonin suppression over the 1.5h of light exposure. However, in the delayed group, there was a significant correlation between DLMO and melatonin suppression. There was a smaller increase of subjective sleepiness in the delayed subjects than in the adapted subjects before HB.  Conclusions: Our results suggest that a delayed circadian phase, a slower build-up of sleep propensity and an enhanced circadian sensitivity to evening light contribute to the complaint of a delayed sleep schedule.

609	Développement et validation des ateliers d’éducation culinaire et nutritionnelle du projet VIE : Valorisation, Implication, Éducation	Context. Cancer is still the main cause of death by illness in children. Furthermore, two third of the survivors will present treatment-related late effects in adulthood. As it will be described in this thesis, the VIE program (Valorisation, Implication, Education) at the Sainte-Justine University Hospital Center aims to implement an intervention program to raise awareness of patients ongoing cancer treatments and their family to the benefits of adopting a healthy lifestyle and to support them with expected behavior change. One component of this program consists in nutrition and cooking education workshops. Objectives. The main objective of this project is to develop and validate a nutrition and cooking education workshop curriculum which will address concerns specific to on-treatment pediatric oncology patients and help prevent cardiometabolic late effects. A second objective is to develop an evaluation tool for the workshops. Methodology. The workshops’ themes, specific objectives and content have been subject to an eight-steps development and validation process, including steering committee consultation. The recipes in demonstration have been developed and standardized by two research staff registered dietitians and their nutritional value analyzed with a nutritional analysis software. Evaluation tools have been developed in accordance with the workshops learning objectives, inspired by existing tools and reviewed by expert. Results. Six nutrition and cooking education workshops based on scientific evidence and clinical experience of three pediatric oncology registered dietitians have been developed and validated. Twelve recipes related to the workshops themes, two for each workshop, have been developed, standardized and their nutritional value validated. Six questionnaires have been developed for each workshop to measure participants’ perception of knowledge acquisition, behavioral intention and satisfaction. Conclusion. It is, to our knowledge, the first nutrition and cooking education workshop curriculum elaborated specifically for families of an on-treatment pediatric oncology population. We think that this program will address the needs specific to pediatric oncology patients and their family, while contributing to raise awareness to the importance of adopting and maintaining healthy eating habits during and after cancer treatments.

610	Les coalitions hétérogènes comme stratégie de renouveau syndical : une étude de cas en contexte québécois	This study puts into light the legitimacy crisis that Quebec trade unions are experiencing today, which is threatening their survival. More specifically, this study provides an analysis of the sources of this crisis and its consequences on the labour movement. In this respect, this paper associates this crisis to the decline of trade unions’ ability to maintain relationships with different community groups. In response, the academic literature demonstrates that heterogeneous coalitions are an efficient strategy in achieving union renewal. In essence, this study proposes a hypothesis in which the way that trade unions create coalitions will positively influence the potential of union renewal. From an analytical perspective, this study examines the influence of various identity theories and of the validation of a democratic process on the ways that Quebec trade unions will involve themselves in coalitions. Our empirical data derives from archives of these coalitions, from non-participant observations and from nine semi-structured interviews with representatives from both trade unions as well as from community groups. Firstly, our results demonstrate that an identity of protest would foster stronger relationships between the trade unions and the community-based organizations. Conversely, an identity of regulation would promote more transactional relationships. Secondly, our results show that there exists a relationship, whether positive or negative, between the validation process of trade unions and their members’ involvement in the different levels of action within the coalition. Thus, the presence of the members in the coalitions will impact the trade union's capacity to create new activists which will work toward changing the institutional and technocratic status quo. Thirdly, this study shows that the identitary and democratic structure of the trade union may influence the transformational potential of the strategy associated to heterogeneous coalitions.	coalition , union renewal , organizational structure , democracy , trade union	en	19126.0

Following Bernard Perron’s research on emotion in video games, our purpose is to explore how, through player control and gameplay, gameplay emotions find their place along fictional and artifact emotions. We will observe how all these contribute to an experience for the player to understand through his sensibility and agency, and not exclusively through the high-level story written by the game developers. To this end, a range of videogames are analyzed: Heavy Rain, Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons, The Walking Dead, Life is Strange and Papo & Yo. Prolonging Roger Odin’s work, the thesis opens up a new type of attunement: emotional attunement.

613	La perception du boulangisme par la presse britannique	During the second half of the 1880s, French political life was marked by the emergence of Boulangism. This short-lived anti-establishment movement formed around General Boulanger gathered members of both the Left and the Right thanks to a program mainly summed up in the slogan «Dissolution, constituante, révision». By opposing itself to the parliamentary regime of the Moderate Republicans, Boulangism threatened the Third Republic and also aroused fears throughout Europe as it was apprehended that a victory from the «général Revanche» would lead, willingly or not, to a new European war.  This thesis’ aim is to increase the knowledge about the perception of Boulangism outside of France by analysing the content of four British newspapers (the Birmingham Daily Post, the Manchester Guardian, the Scotsman and the Times) which were chosen as to offer a geographical and political representation. The first two chapters tackle the perception of the impact of Boulangism on the European scene and the French political scene, while the last chapter covers the British press’ image of General Boulanger as an individual. What emerges from this analysis is a mostly negative perception of Boulangism.

614	Espaces de retour : dynamiques spatiales, mémorielles et identitaires dans Le premier jardin d’Anne Hébert et Surfacing de Margaret Atwood	This work examines the interrelations between space, memory and identity in Le premier jardin by Anne Hébert and Surfacing by Margaret Atwood. We seek to know how the concepts of space and place can provide a better understanding of the memory and identity dynamics involved in return narratives. Based on a common experience, that of returning to homeland, we will study how the characters’ difficulties in recalling, situating, living or simply being are linked to their conflictual relationship to space. Even if they are tempted by oblivion, the return to the places of childhood imposes on the protagonists a sensuous memory. The return also shows how beings are linked to place, even shaped by it, and how they can however act on it. The desire to exist through a coherent identity is also one of dwelling and belonging to space. Finally, we will see how Alexis Nouss’ concept of non-place of makes it possible to rethink the space of return.

Following the work produced in the 60’s and the 70’s at Palo Alto and at the Esalen Institute, the goal of this research is to better understand paradoxical implications of second order cybernetics, such as double bind, solipsism and autopoiesis. Half way between a manifesto for a new digital cosmogony and a survival kit for spiritual cyborgs, this essay relates the metaphysical dimension of my trajectory, from cybernetics to gnosis.

616	L’accessibilité à la justice pour les travailleurs temporaires : le cas d’une filiale française à Trinidad et Tobago	This research focuses on an exploratory comparative study on the non-accessibility to justice in labor dispute for temporary migrant workers and local workers, based on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Port-Of-Spain (Trinidad and Tobago) in a French construction company named French Touch Construction. Building from Foucault's thought, I analyze the non-accessibility to justice as a negative effect of the international labor migrations on temporary migrant workers (North and South) and Trinidadian workers.  As a result, I argue that the transformation of work and workers’ rights are not only an issue for temporary migrant workers but also for Trinidadian workers. Effectively, international labor migration involve competition between employees and thus deteriorate the social status of Trinidadian employees in the French Touch Company. Indeed, employees have to be more flexible and less demanding of their rights to be included in this new work economy. To sum it up, I suggest that the international labor migrations, which encourage the worker to perceive himself as a holder of limited rights, also favor a managerial conflict resolution that is unfavorable for the employee.

617	The politicization and depoliticization of ethnicity : a constructivist approach to power-sharing	Since the 1990s, power-sharing has become the favoured option for peacebuilding in multi-ethnic societies. An important literature has however shed light on the limits of this approach and put into question its capacity to establish sustainable peace. This thesis questions three elements of powersharing theory: its approach of ethnicity, institutions and its elite-bias. It proposes to approach power-sharing theory through the lenses of a constructivist theory of ethnicity, which acknowledges the multiplicity and limited fluidity of ethnic identities; a neo-institutionalist approach of institutions, which pays attention to the interaction of institutions with their environment; and in paying attention to citizen-elite linkages. Three main arguments are developed: 1-The politicization of the ethnic cleavage is problematic since it hinders the good functioning of a democratic system, threaten the sustainability of peace, and transform the nature of violence. “Success” of power-sharing is thus defined as the depoliticization of ethnicity. 2-The politicization of ethnicity is not natural but results from a process in which formal and informal institutions as well as violence pay a key-role. 3-The depoliticization of the ethnic cleavage is, at least theoretically, possible if sufficient guarantees for the political representation and the security of the groups are established, and incentives are provided for the mobilization of non-ethnic identities. These principles may guide the design of power-sharing systems. This “theory proposing” thesis is complemented by a plausibility probe which focuses on the crucial case of Burundi.

618	La mixité d'usages verticale depuis une perspective habitante : étude de cinq produits immobiliers résidentiel et commercial montréalais récents	Mixed use has become a key planning principle, promoted as essential for urban quality, vibrancy, and sustainability. However, in practice, mixed use remains mostly a tool for the intensification – notably on a vertical dimension – of inner-city districts with tight housing market and land scarcity. Still, in that context, it encounters cultural barriers. It is therefore appropriate to examine the opportunities and issues – from the perspective of occupiers – in vertically mixed residential and commercial development (functions usually considered as complementary and compatible, and frequently combined at the building scale), and the conditions in which such experiences arise. To address this, semi-structured interviews were conducted with ten residents and six retailers of five new vertically mixed residential and commercial properties located in Montreal. Benefits in terms of proximity to retail stores and services, economic vitality, quality of the built environment, vibrancy, perceived security and community life have been highlighted. Land-use conflicts (direct), conflicts of scale, conflict of interest (indirect), and space and use constraints have been discerned from the cross-case analysis. The study illustrates a dialectic relation between building-complex and local scales; the difficult task of implementing a mix limited to compatible functions; and the challenge of integrating various uses to capitalize on synergies and prevent conflict and constraints. In this last respect, the study considers the opportunity presented, in Quebec, by the by-law on conditional use. It also points out the significance afterwards of the property management in the harmonious integration of various uses.

619	Modifications de la connectivité cérébrale au sein du réseau attentionnel ventral lors du vieillissement normal	Attention is necessary for most of daily life’s tasks. During aging, these cognitive abilities are changed. Studies suggest that the neurofunctional activity of the frontoparietal network, which upholds the attentional capacities, differ between young and older adults. However, age-related changes of the ventral frontoparietal network, also called the ventral attention network, have been less investigated. Such question has to be raised in context of recent models of neurofunctional changes in aging, who report possible functional transformation that could occur both at the intrahemispheric and interhemispheric levels. The goal of the present thesis is to determine how aging affects the ventral attention network and describe the nature of such changes that can occur on the intrahemispheric and interhemispheric axis. To do so, functional connectivity methods were favoured because of their capacity to measure the neurofunctional interaction between the regions of a network.  The first study of the present thesis has allowed describing the age-related intrahemispheric modifications of functional connectivity in this network by comparing young and older adults while they respond on a selective attention task during a functional magnetic resonance imagery scan. On the task, aged adults performed significantly slower and made more errors than the young adults. At the functional connectivity level, the results show higher level of the functional connectivity between all frontoparietal regions of this network for the older group. Further, the integration level of functional connectivity in anterior regions of the network seems to be less integrated for the older participants, while posterior regions have more neurofunctional signal dependency. Also, the level of integration of functional connectivity is higher in older adults between anterior and posterior regions. Thus, results from this study suggest that the anterior and posterior regions of the ventral attention network interact differently during aging and that the posterior regions play a more important role with age in this network. This hyperconnectivity in the parietal regions could represent an unsuccessful intrahemispheric compensation attempt (i.e. recruitment of additional regions in posterior part of the brain) since older adults perform significantly less well than younger adults.  The second study has investigated interhemispheric alterations of functional connectivity in the same functional network by comparing young and older adults. Like in the first study, younger adults were faster to respond on task and were more accurate. Regarding the neurofunctional lateralization of the network, the degree of functional connectivity is lower in older adults for the left hemisphere’s frontoparietal and temporal regions. However, older adults have a higher degree of functional connectivity in the right frontal, parietal, temporal and subcortical regions of the same network. Also, the results also show that the interhemispheric integration level is superior for the older adults. Thus, this study suggests that the level of functional connectivity with the right hemisphere’s regions of the ventral attention network increases with age, which could suggest an age-related lateralization of this network towards the right hemisphere. In this context, increased interhemispheric functional connectivity could be interpreted as a failed interhemispheric compensation attempt (i.e. recruitment of homologous regions) since the performance of older adults on task was significantly lower than younger adults. In short, this work has allowed contributing to our understanding of the impact of aging on the ventral attention network both on the intrahemispheric and interhemispheric axis. These various results bring up new hypothesis that needs to be investigated in further studies and eventually that could lead to the establishment of intervention that promote an optimal healthy cognitive aging.

620	Les acquisitions du Musée d'art contemporain de Montréal 1992-2012	The aim of this thesis is to document and examine 20 years of collecting at the Museum of Contemporary art of Montreal between 1992 and 2012, a period during which the collection went from 3300 works of art to more than 7700. We investigate the development of the collection and its representation via exhibitions organized by the Museum. We seek to report what the acquisitions tell us about the institution, the orientation it is giving its collection and the message it seeks to transmit. Our research based on analysis of facts collected in public documentation examines the composition and functioning of the various decision committees responsible for acquisitions, and the financing of the institution. It details acquisitions made via purchase and gift, looks at the style and date of the works selected. It documents the arguments (justifications) brought forward in order to acquire the work and add it to the collection. It observes the image the Museum wants to convey of its collection through its exhibitions. Our study draws a factual portrait of collection during the mandates of the 3 directors in charge of the Museum over a 20 year period  and the idea of the collection they tried to communicate via exhibitions.

621	Le pluralisme des systèmes juridiques et les perceptions de la justice : une ethnographie des conflits matrimoniaux chez les Mossi de Koudougou, Burkina Faso	This thesis aims to contribute to the development of empirical knowledge in the scientific fields of legal anthropology and the study of kinship in Burkina Faso. More to the point, it focuses on the understanding of the consequences of legal pluralism in matrimonial dispute cases among the Mossi society in Koudougou, the country’s third most populous city. Marriage is a social indicator and a fundamental institution which allows the reconstruction of the social organization and kinship systems, a process which highlights the transversal effect of customary justice. This situation of legal pluralism induces the creation of processes such as innovation, resistance and legal interbreeding. It engenders a phenomenon of forum shopping, whereby social actors navigate through a multiplicity of tactics, among several legal orders, and is being analyzed through the lens of the perception of justice concept.

622	Regulation of the Early Growth Response Protein-1 in vascular smooth muscle cells	Aberrant vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferative responses contribute to the development of neointimal lesions. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is believed to inhibit VSMC proliferation, and vascular diseases are associated with impairments in cAMP-induced signalling responses involving protein kinase A (PKA) signaling. An enhanced expression of the early growth response protein-1 (Egr-1), a zinc finger transcription factor, has been reported in models of vascular diseases and, a crucial role of Egr-1 in regulating the expression of genes implicated in neointimal formation leading to atherogenesis has been suggested. Various vasoactive factors have been shown to modulate Egr-1 expression in VSMC via mechanisms which remain to be completely understood. Angiotensin-II (Ang-II) is one of the key vasoactive peptides implicated in the pathogenesis of vascular diseases. Ang-II elevates intracellular calcium (Ca2+) through activation of voltage-gated calcium channels as well as store-operated calcium channels. The store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) involves an inositol-3-phosphate receptor (IP3R)-coupled depletion of endoplasmic reticular Ca2+ and a subsequent activation of the stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM-1) /Orai-1 complex. Although Egr-1 has been demonstrated to be upregulated in a Ca2+-dependent fashion in response to several stimuli, the involvement of STIM-1/Orai-1-dependent signaling in Egr-1 expression in VSMC has never been addressed. Besides, whether Ang-II-induced signaling leading to Egr-1 expression is modulated by cAMP-dependent signaling pathway remains unexplored. Therefore, in the present studies, we have examined the role of Ca2+ signaling in Ang-II-induced Egr-1 expression in VSMC and investigated the contribution of STIM-1 or Orai-1. Additionnaly, we have examined the effect of cAMP on Ang-II-induced expression of Egr-1 and have investigated the associated signalling pathways. Pharmacological blockade of IP3R and SOCE by 2-aminoethoxydiphenylborate (2-APB) decreased Ang-II-induced Ca2+ release and attenuated Ang-II-induced enhanced expression of Egr-1 protein and mRNA levels. Egr-1 upregulation was also suppressed following blockade of calmodulin and CaMKII. Furthermore, RNA interference-mediated depletion of STIM-1 or Orai-1 attenuated Ang-II-induced Egr-1 expression, as well as Ang-II-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and CREB. Moreover, isoproterenol (ISO) and forskolin (FSK), two respective receptor and non-receptor activators of adenylate cyclase, attenuated Ang-II-induced Egr-1 expression in a dose-dependent fashion. Similar responses were observed using non-specific (dibutyryl-cAMP) and PKA-specific (Benzoyl-cAMP) analogs of cAMP, as well as a broad spectrum inhibitor of intracellular phosphodiesterase activity (isobutylmethylxanthine). The inhibition of Ang-II-induced Egr-1 expression was accompanied by an increase in serine 157 phosphorylation of the vasodilator-activated phosphoprotein (VASP), a marker of PKA activity, and this was associated with a concomitant decrease in ERK phosphorylation. Pharmacological blockade of PKA using H89 decreased VASP phosphorylation, restored Ang-II-induced ERK phosphorylation and abolished ISO- and FSK-mediated inhibition of Ang-II-induced Egr-1 expression.  In summary, our data demonstrate that STIM-1/Orai-1/Ca2+-dependent signaling pathways mediate Ang-II-induced Egr-1 expression in A-10 VSMC and suggest that PKA-mediated suppression of Ang-II-induced Egr-1 expression and phosphorylation of ERK may be among the mechanisms by which cAMP exerts its vasoprotective effects. In addition, our data supports the notion that stimuli-induced regulation of Egr-1 expression involves the participation of signaling cascades downstream of ERK in VSMC.

623	Fate and trophic transfer of rare earth elements in temperate lake food webs	Many mining projects targeting rare earth elements (REE) are in development in North America, but the background concentrations and trophic transfer of these elements in natural environments have not been well characterized. We sampled abiotic and food web components in 14 Canadian temperate lakes unaffected by mines to assess the natural ecosystem fate of REE. Individual REE and total REE concentrations (sum of individual element concentrations, ΣREE) were strongly related with each other throughout different components of lake food webs. Dissolved organic carbon and dissolved oxygen in the water column, as well as ΣREE in sediments, were identified as potential drivers of aqueous ΣREE. Log10 of median bioaccumulation factors ranged from 1.3, 3.7, 4.0, and 4.4 L/kg (wet weight) for fish muscle, zooplankton, predatory invertebrates, and nonpredatory invertebrates, respectively. [ΣREE] in fish, benthic macroinvertebrates, and zooplankton declined as a function of their trophic position, as determined by functional feeding groups and isotopic signatures of nitrogen (δ15N), indicating that REE were subject to trophic dilution. Low concentrations of REE in freshwater fish muscle compared to their potential invertebrate prey suggest that fish fillet consumption is unlikely to be a significant source of REE to humans in areas unperturbed by mining activities. However, other fish predators (e.g., piscivorous birds and mammals) may accumulate REE from whole fish as they are more concentrated than muscle. Overall, this study provides key information on the baseline concentrations and trophic patterns for REE in freshwater temperate lakes in Quebec, Canada.

624	Étude visant à intégrer les perspectives cognitive et psychodynamique sur le lien entre l’instabilité affective et le concept de soi dans une population présentant des traits de la personnalité limite	This research project investigates two diagnostic criteria of the borderline personality disorder: affective instability and self-concept instability, and the relationship between the two. Previously, competing theories to try to understand the nature of this relationship have been postulated. While factorial studies of the manifest symptoms of the borderline personality disorder are not conclusive, those issued from the cognitive research, in particular a study from Stein (1995), seem to contradict the psychodynamic theory of Kernberg (1976). This study aims to explore the link that exists between affective instability and self-concept instability in a population presenting with borderline personality traits, and tries to reconcile the opposition between Stein’s results and Kernberg’s theory.  In order to do this, we tested the hypothesis that the differences between these theories lies only at the surface, and that it would be possible to resolve by taking into account the level of treatment information. More precisely, we proposed that the interdependence (or unity) between the attributes of the self-concept will be positively correlated to the affective instability when the self-concept is measured in a task appealing to conscious attributes. Conversely, the integration between the attributes of the self-concept will be negatively correlated with affective instability when the self-concept is measured by a task appealing to unconscious representations. Initial results obtained in this study did not support these hypotheses. However, we have also described various limitations of the study, such as low statistical power, and discussed how to improve future research in this area.

625	Perceptions du public face à une intervention policière impliquant l’emploi de la force : analyse des principaux facteurs d’influence	Although the police have the legal power to use coercive force in their law enforcement role, this use of force, whether justified or not, is controversial. Cases of police misconduct regularly making headlines in the media, public perceptions and attitudes towards the police may be affected. Because public opinion is the foundation of police legitimacy, law enforcement organizations have an interest in maintaining positive relationships with the community they serve. The overall objective of this report is therefore to understand the reasons why an individual may perceive acceptable or unacceptable police intervention. The data obtained in this study are from group interviews with students at the University of Montréal. It was thus possible to identify the individual, contextual and situational factors that may affect their perception. In the light of the results, it is possible to observe that the situational factors relating to the context of the intervention and the state of the individual detained are variables of great importance in the evaluation of an intervention. Some contextual factors such as police knowledge, reference patterns and group influence were also considered as variables of interest.

626	Postvaccinal reovirus infection with high mortality in breeder chicks	A broiler breeder flock was subcutaneously vaccinated at the hatchery with a live avian orthoreovirus (ARV) vaccine against viral arthritis. Chicks began to die at 3 days of age and postmortem examination revealed massive subcutaneous hemorrhages and edema on the dorsal aspect of the neck at the site of vaccination, a severe necrotic hepatitis, and pulmonary edema. Microscopically, the main lesion was a multifocal vacuolar degeneration and necrosis of randomly distributed small groups of hepatocytes with presence of apoptotic and multinucleated syncytial cells. Necrotic foci were also found in the lungs as well as a hemorrhagic, granulomatous, and heterophilic cellulitis and myositis of the neck and a generalized depletion and lymphocytolysis of lymphoid organs. At 8 days of age, birds also began to show hock swelling histologically characterized by a fibrinoleucocytic inflammation of the articulation and tendon sheaths, with hyperplasia of the synovial membrane, and lymphoplasmocytic infiltration. PCR and viral culture of livers were positive for ARV. Partial sequencing of the S1 gene from the virus isolate showed 99.2% to 99.8% homology with three vaccinal strains (ARV S1133, 1733, and 2408). Viral particles compatible with reovirus virions were observed at transmission electron microscopy. Investigation at the hatchery revealed that chicks were inadvertently administered an S1133 reovirus vaccine labeled for water administration in 10- to 17-week-old chickens. This human error is most likely the reason for this unusually severe viremic reovirus infection that affected this flock at such an early age.

627	"Mechanistic insights into the directed assembly of hydrogel
blocks mediated by polyelectrolytes or microgels"	In this study, we report the directed assembly of hydrogel blocks mediated by       electrostatic interactions. We compared two different assembly mechanisms, one       mediated by microgel particles and another mediated by direct interaction between       oppositely charged blocks. The system consisted of hydrogel blocks made of an       interpenetrated network of (hydroxyethyl)methacrylate-poly(ethylene       glycol)dimethacrylate (HEMA-PEGDMA) and either positively charged       polyethylenimine (PEI) or negatively charged hyaluronic acid (HA). Positively       charged hydrogel blocks were pretreated with negatively charged microgel       particles (MG) made of N-isopropylacrylamide-methacrylic acid. Both systems       (PEI/HA and PEI/MG) demonstrated spontaneous directed assembly, meaning that       positive blocks were systematically found in contact with oppositely charged       blocks. Directed assembly in water of PEI/HA blocks resulted in large and open       aggregates, while PEI/MG blocks exhibited more compact aggregates. Effects of       salt and pH were also assessed for both systems. Inhibition of blocks aggregation       was found to appear above a critical salt concentration (CSalt*) which was       significantly higher for the PEI/HA system (80 mM) compared to the PEI/MG system        (5-20 mM). The observed difference was interpreted in terms of the nanostructure        of the contact area between blocks. Blocks aggregation was also found to be       controlled by the content of negatively charged groups in the microgels as well       as the concentration of MG in the suspension (CMG) used to treat the hydrogel       block surfaces. Our results shine light on the subtle differences underlying the        adhesion mechanisms between hydrogel blocks and suggest new routes toward the       design of innovative complex soft materials.

628	Association entre les mouvements périodiques des jambes au cours du sommeil et l’intégrité de la matière blanche cérébrale	Periodic leg movements during sleep (PLMS) are repeated and stereotyped nocturnal motor activity characterized by dorsiflexion of the toes and ankle. Recent studies showed a temporal association between PLMS and activation of the sympathetic nervous system, characterized by a repeated increase in blood pressure and heart rate. The PLMS might be involved in the genesis of cardiovascular damage and favor the occurrence of cerebral injuries via an arteriolosclerosis process. In the present study, thirty-seven healthy subjects aged between 55 and 82 years old were recorded for one night of in-laboratory polysomnography and participated to a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) session. Regression analysis were performed between the four PLMS severity variables, namely the PLMS index (PLMSI), the average time interval between PLMS, the PLMS mean duration and the number of PLMS associated with a micro-arousal (PLMS-MA) and neuroimaging variables (white matter hyperintensities, white matter structure through diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and gray matter volume through voxel-based morphometry (VBM).  Our results showed that a higher PLMSI and PLMS-ME have been associated with reductions in white matter integrity in fronto-temporo-parietal regions. Also, reduction in grey matter volume was associated with a longer time interval between PLMS in the middle frontal gyrus. Associations observed in our sample suggest that PLMS may modify the microstructure of the brain and affect cerebrovascular integrity in middle-aged and older individuals.

629	Natriuretic peptide receptor-C activation regulates vascular smooth muscle cell hypertrophy : molecular mechanisms	Hypertension is associated with vascular remodelling due to hyperproliferation and hypertrophy of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). We earlier showed the implication of enhanced expression of Gqα and PLCβ1 proteins in VSMCs from 16- week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). The present study was undertaken to investigate whether C-ANP4-23, a natriuretic peptide receptor-C (NPR-C) agonist that has been shown to inhibit vasoactive peptide-induced enhanced protein synthesis in VSMCs, could attenuate VSMC hypertrophy in rat models of cardiac hypertrophy and to explore the underlying mechanisms contributing to this inhibition. For these studies, aortic VSMCs from 16-week-old SHR were used. The protein synthesis, a marker of hypertrophy, was determined by (3H)leucine incorporation and the expression of proteins was determined by Western blotting. Cell volume was determined by three-dimensional confocal imaging. The protein synthesis was significantly enhanced in VSMC from SHR as compared to WKY and C-ANP4-23 treatment attenuated the enhanced protein synthesis to WKY control levels. In addition, the enhanced expression of the AT1 receptor as well as Gqα and PLCβ1 proteins, enhanced levels of superoxide anion (O2 -), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase activity, as well as the increased expressions of NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4) and p47phox exhibited by VSMC from SHR were all attenuated by C-ANP4-23 treatment. Furthermore, C-ANP4-23 also attenuated the enhanced activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R), platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGF-R), insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) and the enhanced phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2), AKT and c-Src. These results indicate that C-ANP4-23, via the activation of NPR-C, attenuates VSMC hypertrophy through its ability to decrease the overexpression of the AT1 receptor and Gqα/PLCβ1 proteins, the enhanced oxidative stress, the increased activation of growth factors and the enhanced phosphorylation of the MAPK/AKT signalling pathway. Thus, it can be suggested that C-ANP4-23, an activator of NPR-C, may be used as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of vascular complications associated with hypertension and atherosclerosis.

630	Le rôle des canaux potassiques dans la résolution des paramètres du syndrome de détresse respiratoire aiguë	Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterized by alveolar-capillary barrier damage, resulting in the formation of pulmonary oedema and an exacerbated inflammatory response. Without rapid recovery of these parameters, there is a gradual development of fibrosis, leading to respiratory failure. It has been established that alveolar regeneration is a critical step for the resolution of ARDS. A better understanding of alveolar epithelial repair mechanisms is hence necessary to identify new therapies for ARDS, for which no effective treatment exist. It has been shown that repair mechanisms are regulated by membrane proteins, not only by growth factor receptors and integrins, but also by ion channels, in particular potassium channels. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to characterize the impact of KCa3.1 and KvLQT1 potassium channels modulation in the resolution of ARDS. First, our results have shown the cooperative role of the potassium channel KCa3.1, the extracellular matrix and the β1-integrin in alveolar epithelial repair processes in vitro. We have shown that the fibronectin matrix and KCa3.1 are involved in the migration and repair of primary cultures of rat alveolar cell monolayers. Our data also revealed a putative relationship between Kca3.1 and the β1-integrin. Second, we studied the impact of KvLQT1 potassium channel modulation on ARDS pathophysiological aspects with in vivo models. We showed that KvLQT1 was not only involved in alveolar epithelial repair, but also in the resolution of pulmonary oedema and inflammatory response. Taken together, our data demonstrate that potassium channels, such as KCa3.1 and KvLQT1, may be identified as potential therapeutic targets for the resolution of ARDS.

631	Correlates of Long-term Immune Protection in Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Exposed Non-reinfected Individuals	The majority of HCV infected individuals develop persistent viremia. Correlates of long-term protective immunity remain undefined. Generation and maintenance of polyfunctional CD4 and CD8 HCV-specific T cells that produce multiple cytokines like IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-2 correlates with spontaneous resolution of acute primary HCV and can be predictive of long-term protection. The presence of neutralizing antibodies (nAb) was associated with reduced magnitude and length of viremia upon reinfection. The aims of this project were: 1) to define correlates of protective immunity in HCV-resolved high risk people who inject drugs (PWIDs) repeatedly exposed to but resistant to reinfections; and 2) to compare protective immune responses in PWIDs with spontaneous versus treatment-induced clearance. We hypothesized that PWIDs resistant to reinfections harbor an immune response of high magnitude, breadth and quality of the HCV-specific memory T cells as well as higher nAb responses. Using IFN-γ enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT), intracellular staining for cytokines, and pseudoparticle neutralization assays, we examined cellular and humoral immune responses in long-term protected versus reinfected PWIDs. We observed long-lived HCV-specific T cell responses in spontaneously resolved and treatment resolved PWIDs who are protected against reinfection. We did not observe a difference in the nAb responses nor in the functionality of HCV-specific T cells. Our results suggest that protection from reinfection in PWIDs is associated with a sustained high frequency of HCV-specific cellular immune responses.

632	Transfusions de globules rouges en néonatologie et syndrome de défaillance multiviscérale aiguë	In the first few months of life, the level of hemoglobin (Hb) in the newborn normally decreases. This physiological anemia is more severe in neonates admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), who frequently require a red blood cells (RBC) transfusion. In neonatal medicine, the indications for transfusion are controversial and practices are highly variable. To better understand those practices, we conducted the prospective study: «Epidemiology and determinants of red blood cells transfusion in a neonatal intensive care unit: a cohort study». Among the patients consecutively admitted to NICU during the study period, 13.4% received at least one RBC transfusion. Although premature babies born at less than 28 weeks gestation received the majority of transfusions (62.2%), term neonates admitted to NICU were also frequently transfused (4.9% of transfusions). The main justifications for giving a RBC transfusion were: low Hb level, underlying illness and to improve oxygen delivery. We also observed a wide range of Hb thresholds that triggered a decision to transfuse (from 62 to 137 g/L). The multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), which is defined as the simultaneous dysfunction of at least two organs or systems, is highly associated with mortality and morbidity in critically ill children. The association between MODS and transfusions is also well described in this population. Two sets of criteria of pediatric MODS are currently used in the medical literature: one by Proulx, and another by Goldstein. We did the prospective cohort study «Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome in critically ill children : clinical value of two lists of diagnostic criteria» to validate and compare the diagnostic value of those two definitions of MODS. We observed that the epidemiology of MODS varies according to which list of criteria is used: the incidence was 21.4% vs. 37.3% with Proulx and Goldstein criteria, respectively. Both sets of criteria have a good inter- and intra-rater reproducibility. The diagnostic of MODS according to Proulx criteria is associated with higher 90-days mortality (17.8% vs. 11.5%, p = 0.038). MODS is also described in neonates, using a score adapted to this population, the NEOMOD. Neonatal MODS represents an interesting outcome measure in clinical trials in neonatal transfusion medicine. However, prior to that, it needs to be better characterized.

633	Effets du diabète de type 2 sur l’expression et l’activité des cytochromes P450 hépatiques et extra-hépatiques chez la souris C57BL/6 sous une diète riche en gras	Around 387 million people worldwide suffer from type 2 diabetes (T2D).  Patients with T2D often require polypharmacy, not only to ensure glycaemic control, but also to prevent and control micro- and macrovascular comorbidities associated with T2D. However, clinical practice reveals that some diabetic patients show highly variable responses to different drugs in comparison with non-diabetic patients.  Variable drug dosages and effects are observed for drugs such as clopidogrel, warfarin, cyclosporine and tacromilus. This intersubject variability in drug response in diabetic patients is an important issue as it may results in treatment failure, adverse effects or even drug toxicity. One of the underlying mechanisms suggested to explain the intersubject variability in drugs responses in diabetic patients is their modified ability to eliminate drugs through metabolism. Evidence support the association between inflammatory diseases, such as T2D, and an activity modulation of metabolism enzymes. It is known that these inflammatory processes can modulate the expression and activity of enzyme proteins, such as the cytochromes P450 (CYP450s), a major enzyme system in drug metabolism. Moreover, several organs express various CYP450s isoenzymes that may contribute to the local drug metabolism, thus influence the drugs concentration within the target organs. Therefore, the aim of this study is to assess the effects of T2D on the expression and activity of CYP450s in order to identify their responsibility in the intersubject response variability to drugs using diet-induced obesity (DIO) mice as a model.  The work carried out as part of this thesis shows that there is a modulation of the expression and activity of CYP450s isoenzymes in the DIO mouse model. Our results indicate that this modulation occurs in an isoenzyme-specific and tissue-dependent fashion. This work supports that the presence of diabetes with obesity affects hepatic and extrahepatic CYP450s, which may influence the systemic and local drug concentrations, respectively.  In a future and translational perspective, our study will lead to a better understanding of the drug elimination capacity in diabetic patients, and thus will prompt an appropriate dosage adjustment for drugs metabolized by CYP450s in diabetic patients: a step forward towards a more personalized medicine approach.

634	Évaluation de la survie et de la progression de la maladie des patients diagnostiqués avec un sarcome métastatique des tissus mous traité par chimiothérapie palliative	High-grade sarcomas present a metastatic progression in approximately 50% of cases. The effectiveness of palliative chemotherapy as a treatment of systemic metastases is still modest. The main objective of this study is to assess disease progression and survival of patients diagnosed with metastatic soft tissue sarcomas treated with palliative chemotherapy. A retrospective chart review of 68 patients treated with palliative chemotherapy for metastatic soft tissue sarcomas between 2003 and 2013 at Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital was achieved. Data for control group of 36 patients with metastatic soft tissue sarcomas not treated with chemotherapy was collected retrospectively. Median overall survival with chemotherapy treatments was more than two times overall survival without treatments, which were 20 months and 7 months, respectively (p=0.0001). Overall survival was improved for all histologic subtypes with chemotherapy treatments, especially for leiomyosarcomas and synovial sarcomas, even though the difference in survival was not statistically significant between treated and untreated groups. When chemotherapy was given in combined therapy during first line of treatment, event-free survival was statistically longer (p=0.0184) and favorable responses rates were doubled. In conclusion, results have shown a significantly improved overall survival in all histological groups with chemotherapy treatments. Nevertheless, patients with favorable response to chemotherapy have poor outcomes. Additional treatment options are needed.

635	Fragmentation et stagnation : enjeux de mobilisation du mouvement LGBTIQ aux Philippines	This Master’s thesis investigates the development of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans, Intersex and Queer (LGBTIQ) movement in the Philippines from the fall of Ferdinand Marcos’ dictatorship in 1986 to the present moment. Since then, the LGBTIQ movement has developed rapidly. It was among the first in Southeast Asia to organise a Pride March and to constitute an LGBTIQ political party. However, despite this dynamism, LGBTIQ communities are still discriminated in the workspace, schools, and the healthcare system. Moreover, they are still the victims of homophobic crimes. To the present day, the movement has not been able to secure political protection for the rights and the safety of these communities. Although the current situation can be attributed to a certain extent to conservatism in the ruling class or the strong influence of Catholicism and homophobia, this thesis argues that the fragmentation and the lack of coherence of the movement iii has itself complicated the formulation and implementation of concrete policies. My analysis of the movement’s development throughout the last 30 years will highlight four fundamental conflicts resolving around 1. the definition of one collective identity, 2. the framing used to conceptualize these issues, 3. the different ideologies underlying the social activists’ actions, and 4. the divergence in organisational modes and strategies. As such, this thesis shifts attention from external factors to internal conflicts within the LGBTIQ movement of the Philippines. My arguments are based on 17 interviews with social activists, conducted between May and October 2015 in Manila. In the first two chapters of this thesis, I review current scholarship on social movements in general and about the Philippines and South East Asia in particular. This review will provide the theoretical foundation necessary to identify and understand the four identified social factors and their role on the fragmentation of the movement. In chapter four, I analyse the fragmentation of the movement based on the social activists’ scales of action, their targets of mobilization, and their mobilization trajectories. In chapter five, I analyze this fragmentation through the identified factors in the literature.

636	Le rôle modérateur du genre sur l’impact d’attributs organisationnels sur l’attraction organisationnelle une étude quasi-expérimentale	This dissertation explores the effect of organizational attributes on the attraction of new talent. Specifically, it examines the impact of innovative perks, training and development opportunities, as well as the presence of strong ethical ideals within an organization. Moreover, the presence of a moderating effect of gender within these relationships is also investigated. In order to carry out the objectives of the study, several different hypotheses were developed in line with the reviewed literature and theoretical frameworks. The first hypothesis, which is divided into three sub-hypotheses, stipulates that the offer of innovative perks, the presence of many training and development opportunities as well as the extent to which an organization emphasizes ethical behavior, each increase organizational attractiveness. The second hypothesis suggests that an organization offering a combination of innovative perks, training and development opportunities, as well as emphasizing strong ethical ideals further increases attractiveness. The final hypothesis suggests that gender moderates the relationship between the three organizational attributes and attractiveness. The current study utilizes data gathered through a quasi-experimental study conducted among 340 future graduates from two universities in Montreal. The results reveal that innovative perks, the presence of many training and development opportunities, as well as strong ethical ideals each positively influence organizational attractiveness. Moreover, the results indicate that organizational attractiveness is further increased when innovative perks are combined with very few training and development opportunities. The effect of innovative perks in combination with the presence of strong ethical ideals also further increases organizational attractiveness. Finally, the results reveal that gender plays a moderating role in the relationship between only one organizational factor and attractiveness. More precisely, the results reveal that for women, the presence of innovative perks leads to increased attractiveness whether organizations have few or many training and development opportunities. For men, however, the presence of innovative perks leads to increased attractiveness only in situations with few training and development opportunities. Thus, the interaction effect of innovative perks on attractiveness is nuanced by gender. This dissertation provides a discussion of the results and suggests strategies that could be implemented by managers to improve workforce attraction, which constitutes a major issue currently faced by organizations. In light of the empirical results found in this study, it can be concluded that the presence of innovative perks, which is part of the indirect compensation an organization offers to its employees as well as two specific organizational practices (training and development and strong ethical ideals) can give organizations a competitive advantage with regard to attracting new talent. Finally, the finding revealing a moderating role of gender can be useful for managers in the context of employment equity.

637	Pouvoir conjugal et immigration chez des couples colombiens immigrants à Montréal	The effects of immigration on individuals as the result of social, cultural and economic influences of the new context are well known in the scientific literature. So for those who immigrated as a couple, the immigration experience leads them to renegotiate their roles in order to adjust to the conditions of the new environment. This renegotiation makes changes in the distribution of marital power and allows the adaptation of the partners in the new society and the return to balance in the couple. However, this adaptation is not done evenly between men and women. This research aims to predict changes in the distribution of marital power among a group of thirty Colombian couples who immigrated to Montreal, depending on length of stay and degree of identification with the host society (Canada and Quebec). Marital power is evaluated in this study according to the perception of the partners about their responsibilities in making global decisions and in four specific categories before and after immigrating to Montreal. About the length of stay, the data obtained show that, for women, the time lived in the host society predicts changes in the distribution of marital power. These results also confirm that these changes favour the empowerment of women within the couple in two of four categories: « leisure time and social activities » and « care and education of children ». However, the perception of women is not shared by men ; for men, the time spent in the host society does not predict changes in the distribution of marital power. Regarding the degree of identification, our data show that for the women interviewed, identification with Canada can predict changes in the distribution of marital power globally. Regarding the degree of identification with Quebec, it predicts changes in the distribution of marital power in the « care and education of children » category for both men and women.

638	Pitch direction perception and auditory global local processing in autism and typical development	Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) often present atypical auditory perception. Previous work has reported both enhanced low-level pitch discrimination and superior abilities to detect local pitch structure on high-level melodic tasks in ASD. However, it is unclear how low and high levels of auditory perception are related in ASD or typical development (TD), or how this relationship might change with development and rate of stimulus presentation. To these aims, in the present study, children with ASD and TD children matched in age were tested on a low-level pitch direction (PD) task and a high-level melodic task. Groups performed similarly on both pitch tasks. Moreover, lowlevel pitch direction ability predicted performance in high-level global-local (GL) pitch perception, but this relationship was stronger in ASD. Age did not affect the relationship between low-level and high-level pitch performance in either ASD or TD. However, there was a more positive effect of age on GL task performance in TD than ASD after accounting for the effect of low-level PD performance. Finally, there was no effect of stimulus rate upon the relationship between low-level and high-level pitch performance in either group. The present findings provide a better understanding of how perception is associated across levels in ASD versus TD. This work is key to better understanding individual differences in auditory perception and to refine ASD phenotypes.

On the other hand, not all conflicts are negative. Indeed, in a context where parents use positive resolution strategies, conflicts can become a learning environment for young children and allow them to reuse these models to be more socially competent. This study aims to evaluate the relationship between marital conflict resolution strategies and the social competence of preschool children depending on the sex of the parent and the child's sex. Data were collected from 160 families with a child aged between 4 and 6 years old. This is a transversal research design. Results show marital conflict resolution strategies are marginally related to the level of social competence of the children, but only for the fathers. In addition, children's gender marginally moderate this relation, boys being more socially competent when more exposed to a high ratio of positive resolution strategies from their fathers. A significant difference was observed between boys and girls as to their level of social competence, girls being more competent socially than boys.	marital conflict resolution strategies , marital conflict , preschool aged , social competence , social learning , emotional security , differences between genders	en	18806.0
640	Implantation d’une sonde d’absorption photo-induite dans une expérience de spectroscopie bidimensionnelle d’excitation sur le système polymérique modèle PCDBT:PCBM	This master’s thesis present the implemantation of a photo-induced absorption probe to a collinear phase modulated two-dimensionnal excitation spectroscopy experiment. This type of spectroscopy studies the correlations between different elctronic states of a material on an ultrafast timescale to know better about the system’s dynamics. This new probe, combined to this experiment gives insight on materials where a coupling prevents from understandin the dynamic of the system. If there is such coupling between two states, it is impossible to probe the relaxation directly with light. Studying the correlations between the states, is it possible to learn more about this coupling. To prove that this new technique brings valid information on a studied material, we want to compare the results obtained with the photoinduced absorption probe to those obtained with a photoluminescence one for a system where we expect these results to be the same, PCDTBT:PCBM. Since the two-dimensionnal spectroscopy experiment enlightens the correlations between the excited states and the final products, if we probe the same final products with different probes, we should obtain the same results. Even though it was impossible to compare the results with the photoluminescence probe since the emitted signal was too low to be detected, the validity of the new probe was shown by comparing with data already known in the litterature and by making sure that the sample’s response was linear when it was expected to be. Also, the signal obtained with the new probe came from the excited states of the PCDTBT:PCBM, hence of the absorption. Finally, these results were compared to the ones obtained by a photocurrent probe. The quantum efficiency of the obtained results by the both probes was almost identical, proving the validity of this new probe to study correlations in different materials.

641	La forme du dialogue chez Platon : une étude « poétique » du Phédon	This master’s thesis, which adopts the dialogical approach to Plato studies, aims to clarify the concept of Plato’s dialogue form by means of a “poetic” analysis of the Phaedo. Firstly, after having studied the meanings of the notion of dialogue form in a range of studies that fall within the dialogical approach framework, we propose a provisional definition of the dialogue form: it is a poetic, literary or dramatic form, designed as a whole composed of parts, governed by the “logographic necessity”, and characterized by a “pedimental” structure (a structure in which the most important things are put in the centre, by analogy with the figures that are arranged in the triangular pediment of a Greek temple). Secondly, having supposed that this notion could be further clarified by applying Aristotle’s analysis of tragedy in the Poetics to Plato’s dialogues, we attempt to justify this application. Finally, the analysis of the Phaedo from Aristotle’s “poetic” perspective reveals this dialogue’s “pedimental” dynamic form, which is organized in three movements and seems to translate – or “visualize” – the movement of Socrates’ thought (i.e. of his quintessentially rational soul) while constructing the method of hypotheses, and, more generally, a theory of science. The three movements comprise: 1) the upward (pre-scientific) movement of the first part, 2) the “theoretical” mouvement (turning and revolution) of the central part, and 3) the downward (deductive or scientific) movement of the third part.	histoire , reconnaissance , Plato , dialogical approach , Phaedo , dialogue form , pedimental form , dynamic form , Aristotle , Poetics , plot , reversal , recognition , suffering , episodes , general scheme	en	18790.0
642	L’effet de la musique : de l’espace psychique à l’image blanche, une approche créatrice à l’écoute de l’expérience	This research-creation project studies the power of music in the self-development. How does it affect our psyche? My point of view which is philosophical, phenomenological and psychoanalytical,  is elaborated according meetings and interviews with musicians that I lead during the production of my documentary. Here, I am presenting, inspired by lots of scientific theories, several levels of reception of music in movies, whether conscious, unconscious, transitional or potential. Beyond the music itself, there is the extra-musical, the film music is part of that. What emotions are triggered by music in movies? In a society monopolized by the diktat of sight; What aesthetic procedures are built to make us pay attention to the soundtrack? We will study these issues thanks to several theorists and through two documentaries Herman Slobbe (Johan van der Keuken, 1966) and The United States of Africa (Yanick Létourneau, 2011). This research explores what music gives us through affects. From childhood to adulthood, this ancient art offers opportunities that the eye can not reach. Thus, this research allows me to understand the reasons that led me to filmmaking since it is the music that led me to it. It was music which made me desire to work in the audio-visual environment.

643	La position historique des artistes issus de l'immigration : le cas de Leopold Plotek	Leopold Plotek is a Montreal artist, born in Russia, who has devoted his artistic career to painting for nearly fifty years. Contrary to the interest demonstrated by the visual arts milieu to his work, art history has not yet acknowledged its importance. The description of his career, since the beginning of the 1970s until today, namely of his paintings as well as the exhibitions and the texts about them, fills part of this gap. An intercultural perspective presents Plotek as an artist coming from immigration and as an Anglophone in Quebec, and identifies factors, based on cultural identity and language, that in part explains his absence from art history, particularly contemporary art. On one hand, this study about his work gives a significant number of factual information: inventory of paintings, exhibitions, collections, catalogues along with periodical articles. On the other hand, it shows that the study of intercultural relations helps to demystify the belief that art history remembers artists primarily according to the quality of their works.

644	De l’espace de jeu au temps du joueur : une épistémologie engagée du jeu en général, et du jeu vidéo en particulier	The game constitution as an object of science and the institutionalization of the video game oust the essence, and therefore the meaning of the subject they intend to define. The game itself and its playful representation took precedence over the experience of the player. The game phenomenon remains a subjective object: when defining the object, this subjective dimension and its experiential variables are subjectively minimized, especially time and movement. Based on multidisciplinary theories such as phenomenology, semiotics and cognitive linguistics, this paper seeks to rehabilitate the time, the player and the experience of playing. The first chapter examines the ambiguity of the word game, which refers to both the object and the game playing activity, and questions the primacy of game over play in the game studies. The second chapter questions the dualistic conception of game, as conveyed by the magic circle model, which opposes gaming to reality. Chapter three provides the conceptual metaphor of time suspended in space to explain firstly, the structuring role of space in the cognitive process, and also the spatial outbid of the video game discourse. Finally, it is about holding and maintaining the dynamic balance between the gaming structure and the experience of playing, and stress the importance of space-time unity.

645	Concevoir l’international : le Comité national d’études sociales et politiques d’Albert Kahn, 1916-1931	During the heat of the Great War, Albert Kahn, banker and philanthropist, founded the Comité national d’études sociales et politiques (CNESP). Bringing together members of the French elite, the CNESP held meetings every week until 1931, to hold intellectual discussions about current affairs. Even though the members were exclusively French, the committee invited a considerable number of international speakers. This thesis, whose fields of research are linked to those of intellectual history and international history, places emphasis on this committee’s interest in international topics and studies its conceptualization of internationalism during the interwar period.   This survey of the CNESP’s meetings reveals that the committee had a vision of internationalism that was expressed on two different levels. First, the committee understood the international as an objective structure: the international system had to be organized around principles of law and international problems had to be resolved by the objective methods of science. Second, study of the subjective considerations behind those pretentions of objectivity reveals that the conceptualisation of internationalism was influenced by a strong belief in the universalism of French values. This conceptualisation of internationalism therefore implies dynamics of exclusion that are expressed more particularly through a metaphoric discourse linked to the family.

646	Par rapport au monde : la dimension internationale comme point de ralliement entre la Résistance intérieure et le général de Gaulle (1940-1944)	After the abrupt defeat to Germany during the Second World War, resistance movements, refusing the proposed armistice, organized in France to fight the German occupation and the Vichy regime. Exiled to London, Charles de Gaulle, between 1940 and 1944, pushed to obtain the leadership of the resistant organisations and succeeded. Our MA thesis analyses the Resistance’s adhesion to Gaullism from a new perspective, both by exploring the dynamics between the French Resistance and the global scene as well as how international factors impacted this adhesion process. Based on the analysis of resistant press and radio propaganda, our research exposes the importance both mediums afford to international matters as well as General de Gaulle’s favourable association to these topics. Moreover, it reveals the strong links between the French Inland Resistance’s relation to the global scene and what General de Gaulle represents to the resistant activists. Our research shows significant evidence for how international factors influenced the Resistance’s adhesion to Gaullism. Providing nuance and precision to the traditional political conception of the relationship between the French inland resistance and General de Gaulle, this detailed analysis thus offers a more in-depth and subtle comprehension of the phenomenon of resistance in France.

647	Reconstitution des taux récents d’accumulation de carbone et des conditions paléoécologiques de la tourbière boréale Degerö Stormyr, Suède	In the event that the important carbon reservoir sequestered in peatlands were to be destabilized, the impacts on global climate could be major. However, the factors influencing carbon accumulation rates at decadal and centennial scale in peatlands have not yet been clearly identified and past and contemporary carbon accumulation dynamics of the same study site have rarely been compared. This project aimed to (1) reconstruct fine scale (cm) carbon accumulation rates for the Degerö Stormyr peatland (Sweden), (2) identify the key factors influencing accumulation rates and (3) compare the reconstructed rates to modern carbon fluxes measured at the site. Two complementary methodological approaches were used: paleoecological reconstructions and modelling. The main conclusions of this thesis are that: (1) Apparent rates of carbon accumulation are mainly related to hydroclimatic conditions in the acrotelm, but are influenced by the vegetation composition of the peat in the catotelm. (2) True rates of carbon accumulation for the recent period (≈ last 130 years) are similar to the net ecosystem carbon balance measured on site. (3) The comparison between recent and long-term carbon accumulation dynamics suggests that Degerö Stormyr has sequestered more carbon over the past decades. The results of this thesis highlight the importance of studying factors influencing carbon accumulation rates at different time scales and suggest that emphasis should be placed on decadal and centennial scales.

648	Catalogue raisonné des maies en Grèce antique	Among the plethora of highly comprehensive books dedicated to agricultural processing workshops in ancient Greece, there is no publications to date that specifically concerns the study of press-beds. Yet, a detailed analysis of this essential component of ancient presses, whose functions were to support the loads to be pressed and redirect the liquid extracted during the operation to a collection vessel, is not without interest. Made in various shapes and with a wide variety of materials, it was used in the production of many goods: oils, cosmetics, wines, cheeses, dyes and textiles. It is a crucial element for archaeologists when it comes time to restore the production line surrounding the creation of these products. This thesis aims to fill this gap, both in establishing a catalogue of most press-beds that were discovered in the territory belonging to modern Greece, as well as analyzing and commenting on the data resulting from this operation, despite all methodological issues inherent in this type of study. The result is a picture of the distribution, both in space and time, of these press-beds, which can be used with elements provided by other researchers, to provide a fresh look at productions using presses.	production , minoen , press-bed , press , oil , wine , archaeology , Greece , Minoan , Archaic , Classical , Hellenistic , Roman	en	18719.0
649	Recréer et comprendre les mécanismes de liaison des biomolécules à l'aide d'un modèle d'ADN	"Molecular recognition plays a central role in almost every biological and biotechnological process.  Over the last 60 years, two molecular recognition mechanisms have been used to appropriately describe the coupling between binding and conformational change in biomolecules.  The induced fit mechanism takes place when ligand binding to the inactive state of the biomolecule induces the conformational change leading to the active state.  On the other hand, in the conformational selection mechanism, where active and inactive states exist in equilibrium, the ligand binds selectively to the active state of the biomolecule and shifts the equilibrium towards this state by stabilizing it.  Even though these mechanisms have been widely studied, it is still unclear if they differ in performance or how each mechanism can be modulated.  Such a fundamental understanding of the differences between these mechanisms would shed light on the reasons for an apparent selective pressure driving the use of a specific mechanism for a given biomolecule and would also allow us to engineer new biomolecules which would benefit from the strengths of these mechanisms.   To date, both mechanisms have been exclusively studied in the context of naturally occurring biomolecules, mainly proteins, whose structural and dynamic complexity as well as diversity seem to prevent comparison and manipulation of specific and individual thermodynamic parameters.  Consequently, only little progress has been made towards characterizing the role of certain key thermodynamic parameters on the selection and performance of the mechanism.  To circumvent this limitation, we have reproduced these mechanisms using simple fluorescent DNA constructs allowing for reliable prediction and variation of both structure and thermodynamics as well as real time monitoring of the activation process in presence of a DNA target.  These DNA ""switches"" allowed us to determine that an induced fit mechanism occurs when the binding site is partially available in the inactive state and that this mechanism allows for a faster activation and deactivation (up to four orders of magnitude) compared to a conformational selection mechanism, which in contrast corresponds to a slower activation and deactivation, leading to a longer activation period.  The observed kinetic differences between these mechanisms points towards potential uses for both in different areas of biotechnology as well as some rationale behind evolution favoring one mechanism over the other for a given protein."

650	Études structurales d’interactions protéine/protéine impliquées dans la leucopoïèse	Hematopoietic development is regulated through a combinatorial interplay between lineage-specific activators and the general transcription factors that enables cell-specific patterns of gene expression. In this study, the transcription factors KLF2 and KLF4 play crucial roles in lymphocytes B and T development by activating transcription of specific genes through interactions with the co-activator (CBP). These interactions involve the transactivation domains (TAD) localized in the N-terminal region of KLF2 and KLF4 factors. Previous studies have shown that TADs are also found in the tumor suppressor protein p53 and these TADs are responsible for the interactions between the p53 protein and the coactivator CBP. Recently, several structures of p53TADs in complex with the TAZ2 and KIX domains of CBP have shown that these TADs are acidic and possess a ΦΧΧΦΦ motif crucial for the formation of the interaction. Interestingly, these TADs are similar to the ones found on KLF2 and KLF4. This thesis provides a structural and functional characterization of the interactions formed by the transcription factors KLF2 and KLF4, which have opposing roles, and competes for the same interacting partner CBP to activate transcription. The analysis is done using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and a yeast activation assay. This study brings a greater understanding on the opposing roles yet complementary of KLF2 and KLF4 proteins involved in B and T lymphocytes specific lineages selection and also provides information for potential therapeutic research regarding disease such as leukemia.

651	Vers l’exploration de la créativité tactique dans les sports d’équipe	Tactical creativity (TC) has been identified as an essential component of exceptional performance in sport, more specifically in team sports where the athletes have to invade the opposition’s territory to score a goal (Altavilla et Raiola, 2015; Memmert, Baker et Bertsch, 2010). The creative athlete is one who can generate original, flexible and varying decisions in specific game situations (Greco, Memmert et Morales, 2010; Memmert et Roth, 2007). The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore in greater depth the phenomenon of tactical creativity as it is perceived and experienced by university-level athletes and coaches involved in certain invasion sports. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with head coaches of different teams and their athletes who were identified as being creative players. Transcripts were analyzed using content analysis. Results pointed to common attributes shared by creative players, the most important ones were game vision, non-conformity/novelty and quick decision-making. From a developmental perspective, TC was linked to diversification between and within sports as well as a high volume of experience. The microstructure of practice activities also contributed to the development of creative abilities, more specifically game-centered exercises that promote decision making and problem solving. Unlike previous studies, the present results revealed that autonomy-supportive coaching and a positive coach-athlete relationship facilitate the development of creativity allowing us to make links to the self-determination theory. Finally, TC was associated with social and performance related consequences. Interestingly, our results suggest a functional role for tactical creativity in the use of adaptive coping mechanisms. The practical implications of this study are twofold. First, the results of this study will provide coaches with specific guidelines in order to establish an ideal environment that enhances the development of TC. Second, the results will provide athletes with an awareness of the importance of certain developmental and environmental factors that contribute to maximizing their creative potential.	tactical creativity , invasion sports , athletes , developmental experiences	en	18635.0
652	Les conséquences juridiques de la coexistence de l’obligation d’accommodement raisonnable et du régime public de réparation des lésions professionnelles	Following the review of the genesis of two fundamental regimes in Quebec labour law, the public system that provides repairs to injured workers, established by the Act respecting industrial accidents and occupational diseases, and the duty to provide reasonable accommodation arising from the right to equality under section 10 of the Quebec Charter, this thesis focuses on the development of the normative conflict and the jurisdictional conflict stemming from the parallel evolution of these two sources of obligations for employers. Both of these are based on the reinstatement of disabled workers and the continuation of their employment relationship. This study proposes to explore the legal consequences of the solution adopted by the Quebec Court of Appeal in Caron’s case, dated June 2015, in which the Court decided to overlay the employer’s duty to accommodate onto the Workers’ Compensation public system. Thus, emphasizing on the role that the right to equality plays in public law and discussing its impact on the separation of powers, this thesis shows the consequences from the approach used in the Caron judgment and its particular results through Canadian constitutional and Quebec quasi-constitutional principles. Furthermore, this significant change gives rise to many difficulties regarding the particularities of administrative law, and more specifically, the role and the limited powers of C.N.E.S.S.T. and T.A.T.-D.S.S.T. Finally, this analysis highlights that the solution held by the Court of Appeal infringes on the balance attempted by the public system based on an important social compromise.

653	The challenge of industry challenges : the uneasy encounter between privacy protection and commercial expression	This essay uses the example of Industry Challenges - a technique deployed by companies to promote the hiring and advancement of certain members of society - to explore a conflict that could arise in Quebec between the individual’s right to privacy as protected by An Act Respecting the Protection of Personal Information In the Private Sector  and the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act , and that of an organisation to use personal information relating to its workforce to market itself. It briefly reviews privacy protection in jurisdictions with the greatest legal influence on Quebec and Canada: the European Union, the United States and the United Kingdom (Chapter 2). It demonstrates how a blend of these influences is reflected in the Quebec and Canadian approaches to privacy and how existing privacy legislation might prevent a company from effectively and efficiently responding to Industry Challenges (Chapter 3). Finally, the last two chapters respectively explore the interpretive and legislative amendments that could be made to PPIPS and PIPEDA to enable companies to respond to Industry Challenges (Chapter 4) as well as the possible legal action a company could take on the ground that Quebec’s privacy legislation violates its right to express itself commercially under s. 2(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  (Chapter 5).

654	Acceptance and use of mHealth tools by auxiliary midwives in Myanmar : a qualitative study	Myanmar’s lack of midwives led to shifting of pre- and postnatal care tasks to auxiliary midwives (AMWs). However, the limited training and supportive supervision AMWs receive compromise the quality of their services. To improve their performance, an NGO implemented an mHealth project in Dala Township in 2014, providing Smartphones to AMWs with an application consisting of electronic patient registration and electronic clinical decision-support (eCDS). Behavioral theories suggest that algorithm-based clinical decision-support modeling may contribute to improved clinical compliance, which may increase the quality of care and, ultimately, decrease maternal mortality. As it was Myanmar’s first point-of-care mHealth project, the study’s objective was to explore whether AMWs would accept and use the mHealth tools (call option and application). In a qualitative explorative design, perceptions of all AMWs participating in the pilot (n=20) were explored through semi-structured interviews and focus groups. The Framework approach was used for data analysis. The study was guided by a conceptual framework based on technology acceptance theories that claim that acceptance predicts use. The framework’s premise is that AMWs will accept mHealth tools if they are perceived as easy to use, as useful, and when important others in the social environment of AMWs support their use. However, barriers and facilitators in the implementation context are expected to influence the use of mHealth tools directly.  Our study suggests that acceptance of mHealth tools by AMWs in Dala Township was high. mHealth tools were generally perceived as easy to use, useful, and important others in the social environment of AMWs were mostly supportive of AMWs using mHealth tools. However, AMWs admitted needing ongoing training, technical support, and supervisory support. Internet network problems represented the key contextual barrier, but unexpected socioeconomic facilitators in Dala Township facilitated the use of mHealth tools. This study especially highlights, however, that acceptance and use of mHealth tools by AMWs in Myanmar were notably determined by their belief in mHealth and their public-spirited professionalism, which were in turn reinforced by an ethos of service and political support for mHealth. Despite the barriers they encountered, AMWs were determined to embrace mHealth tools, as they believed them to be superior to the traditional system, the future norm and in the best interest of their communities and health system.	mHealth , Acceptance , eCDS , Smartphone , Auxiliary Midwives , Technology , Acceptance Theories , Myanmar , Framework Approach	en	18620.0
655	The role of evolution in the genetic susceptibility of intracranial aneurysm	Nunavik Inuit is a group of Arctic indigenous people, who have historically presented as a small and isolated population across the Nunavik region of northern Quebec (Canada). The unique genetic profile of Nunavik Inuit is the result of years of adaptation to their living condition, and it is likely responsible for their increased susceptibility to certain pathological conditions. Prior studies have shown that as a consequence of neutral evolution or past adaptive events, today’s Inuit are predisposed to cardio-cerebrovascular disorders, e.g. hypertension and intracranial aneurysm (IA).  IA is defined as localized cerebrovascular weakness which leads to vascular dilation or ballooning, and such distortions are susceptible to disrupt the affected vessels and lead to subarachnoid hemorrhage. It is a complex disorder with a high prevalence (4-8%) and certain populations have been observed to present an increased risk of developing IA. Both environmental and genetic factors are deemed to contribute to the development of IA and in regards to the latter, independent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified multiple loci associated with IA. Nonetheless, there is still a large portion of the genetic heritability of IA, especially in different populations other than Finnish and Japanese that remains unexplained. However, fewer IA genetic studies have taken in consideration the contribution of population specific genetic variants. To address some of the IA missing heritability that is deemed to be accountable to its genetic heterogeneity and low penetrance, we have combined high throughput sequencing (HTS) with SNP-chip genotyping to examine the genetic signatures of two founder populations from Quebec that are predisposed to IA, including Nunavik Inuit and French-Canadians (FC). Because these populations have distinct genetic characteristics, we used different approaches for the identification of genetic risk factors. Nunavik Inuit is an indigenous population and many aspects of its genetic signatures differ from those of separate world-wide major populations; therefore we chose to conduct extensive population genetic studies in regards to their genetic history and genomic profile before we undertook to test if any association could be established between genomic loci and disease susceptibility. We observed many genetic components that are specific to the Nunavik Inuit population, including its homogeneous Inuit ancestry, increased linkage disequilibrium (LD) and genetic signatures which reflect the population had a long history of adaptations to their environment. Previously unidentified signals of natural selection, which focused on coding regions of the genome revealed an accumulation of genetic variants in genes involved in the processes of cell adhesion and immune responses (e.g. CPNE7 and ICAM5). Further analyses revealed a variant in CCM2 to be under positive selection and significantly associated with IA in Nunavik Inuit. In regard to the genetic etiology of IA in the French-Canadian population, we took a different approach and used French-Canadian specific variants that were identified by whole exome sequencing to generate a list of potential risk genes; which were further prioritized using a gene based burden association test. RNF213 emerged as a prime candidate gene that had undergone possible genetic drift and the follow-up genetic and functional examinations further supported its potential contribution to the development of IA among French-Canadians. The results presented in this thesis highlighted the importance of taking into consideration the specific genetic background brought by natural selection or genetic drift, both are driving forces of evolution, when a complex disease is being studied. It also further confirmed that variants in a specific gene (e.g. RNF213 or CCM2) may contribute to the development of different pathogenesis when examined in distinct populations. Overall as our genetic findings identified new genetic “pieces” that further completed the missing heritability “puzzle” of IA genetics; evidence for these “pieces” were interestingly highlighted through population genetics.

656	The roles of STRA6, EFNB1/B2 and ARMC5 in T cell function and autoimmune diseases	Receptor tyrosine kinases are a group of key signaling molecules, which have dual functions: sensing the environmental stimuli outside the cells and transmitting them into the cells. 20 years ago, our laboratory started to study the function of Ephb6 kinase, a receptor tyrosine kinase highly expressed in T lymphocytes. As both Efnb1 and Efnb2 are the ligands for Ephb6, we then proceeded to study their roles in T cell function in vitro and in vivo. T cellspecific Efnb1, Efnb2 single gene knockout (KO), as well as Efnb1/b2 double KO mice were generated, but only the double KO mice showed compromised thymocyte development, Th1 and Th17 function, IL-6 receptor signaling, and anti-virus responses. Strong evidence indicates that T cells play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Thus, we postulated that T cell-specific Efnb1/b2 double KO in mice may protect mice from collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), a mouse model for human RA. We found that Efnb1 and Efnb2 in T cells were essential for pathogenic antibody production and T cell migration to the inflamed paws in mice with CIA. Our clinical study suggests that the expression of EFNB1 in T cells might be a useful parameter for monitoring RA disease activity and treatment responses. Naïve T cells have the ability to expansion and differentiation into effector cells once they encounter foreign antigens, during which a large number of molecules are modulated. Some of these molecules play essential regulatory roles, while others exert house keeping functions and/or act as supporters to cope with increased or changed metabolic demands. To fully elucidate events in the T cell activation program, we undertook unbiased exploration with DNA microarray analysis to identify molecules that were differentially expressed in WT versus Ephb6 KO T cells in the early T-cell activation stage. About 30 molecules were up- or down-regulated more than three folds in WT T cells compared with KO T cells. Stra6 (stimulated by retinoic acid gene 6) and Armc5 (Armadillo repeat-containing 5) were among those that had been validated for their altered expression. We generated mice with these two genes deleted to study their roles in T cell function in vitro and in vivo. STRA6 is a high-affinity receptor for plasma retinol-binding protein (RBP) and mediates cellular vitamin A uptake. Stra6 KO mice manifest normal spleen and thymus in size, cellularity and lymphocyte subpopulations. KO and WT T cells were similar regarding proliferation, differentiation and anti-viral immune responses to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). Thus, the up-regulation of Stra6 is either a parallel event which is not essential for the T cell activation program or it is so critical that heavy redundancy exists. ARMC5 is an intracellular protein containing seven tandem armadillo repeats and one BTB domain. Functions of ARMC5 in the immune system are not known previously. Our in situ hybridization results showed high expression of Armc5 in the thymus and moderate expression in the spleen and lymph nodes. A transient increase of Armc5 expression in T cells after TCR activation was found. To investigate its roles in T cell function, Armc5 KO mice were generated. The KO mice weighed 40% less than their WT counterparts. Lymphoid organs (the thymus, spleen and lymph nodes) of the KO mice appeared to be of normal size, weight, cellularity, and lymphocyte subpopulations. Intriguingly, Armc5 KO T cells presented decreased proliferation and compromised differentiation towards Th1 and Th17 in vitro. The KO mice were resistant to experimental autoimmune encephalitis induction and were compromised in anti-LCMV immune responses. Using yeast 2-hybrid assay, we have identified 8 ARMC5-assciating proteins, which have known functions in cell cycling and apoptosis. Further mechanistic study is underway. Our results reveal that Armc5 is vital in the T cell activation/proliferation /differentiation program. Our studies have augmented our knowledge about EFNB1, EFNB2, STRA6 and ARMC5 in T cell biology and their relevance to immune disorders in animal models as well as in humans.

657	Structural and biochemical characterization of the irganomercurial Lyase MerB	Mercury is introduced into the environment from either natural occurrences (volcanoes) or from human activities (combustion of fossil fuels). Mercury exists as elemental mercury (Hg0), ionic mercury (HgII) or organic mercury like methylmercury (MeHg) and these forms are in constant flux with each other as part of the natural biogeochemical cycle. Organomercurial compounds like MeHg are the most toxic form because of their hydrophobicity and their ability to efficiently permeate membranes and bioaccumulate in organisms. High levels of MeHg have been found in fish in many areas around the world, and therefore human consumption of contaminated seafood represents a serious danger for human health. Bacteria isolated from mercury-contaminated environments have evolved a system that allows them to efficiently convert both ionic and organic mercury compounds to the less toxic elemental mercury. The mercury resistance is due to the acquisition of a transferable genetic element known as the mer operon. The mer operon encodes for several proteins including two enzymes, the organomercurial lyase MerB and the mercuric ion reductase MerA. MerB catalyzes the protonolysis of the carbon-mercury bond of organomercurial compounds to produce a reduced-carbon compound and inorganic ionic mercury HgII. MerA catalyzes the reduction of HgII to elemental mercury Hg0, which is volatile and less toxic. Due to their ability to cleave MeHg and reduce the resulting HgII product, MerB and MerA are considered crucial to bioremediation efforts to clean up MeHg from contaminated waterways. A clear understanding of the mechanistic details of how MerB and MerA function together at the atomic level is crucial for appropriate utilization of the mer system in bioremediation efforts. We have been using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography to structurally and mechanistically characterize E. coli MerB. Based on previous structural studies of E. coli MerB, three residues (Cys96, Asp99 and Cys159) have been identified as a catalytic triad which is required for carbon-Hg bond cleavage. As a follow up to the earlier studies, my project involves using X-ray crystallography to define the roles of Cys96, Asp99 and Cys159 in substrate binding and cleavage.  Two different approaches were implemented to fulfill this goal. Firstly, MerB mutants were tested to define the role for the catalytic residues. Secondly, MerB inhibitors and other potential non-organomercurial substrates were used to probe MerB active site. The Cys,-Asp-Cys catalytic triad found in E.coli MerB is conserved in all MerB variants except four variants where aspartic acid is replaced by a serine. To understand the role of Asp99, we compared a serine-containing MerB variant (Bacillus megaterium MerB2) and an E. coli MerB mutant (MerB D99S) to wild type E. coli MerB. Interestingly, the purified MerB D99S protein was found to contain a pink color. X-ray crystal structure indicated the presence of a bound metal in the active site of MerB D99S. Analysis by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and X-ray fluorescence indicated that MerB D99S binds copper in the active site. Further, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and NMR studies identified the copper as CuII. Addition of organomercurial substrate displaces bound CuII but MerB D99S shows diminished catalytic activity. In contrast, MerB2 did not co-purify with copper although the X-ray structure of MerB2-Hg complex is virtually identical to the structure of the MerB D99S-Hg. This suggests that the aspartic acid residue is crucial for the cleavage of carbon-Hg bonds of organomercurials as well as metal-binding specificity. Furthermore, the binding of copper to the MerB D99S protein suggests a possible evolutionary link between MerB and its structural homolog, the copper-binding protein NosL. In the second approach, we probed the active site of MerB through testing its binding to organotin and organolead compounds. The known MerB inhibitor triethyltin (TET) binds to Asp99 without binding to any of the active site cysteines. A similar binding has been observed with trimethylead (TML). Dimethyltin (DMT) inhibits MerB using an alternative mechanism. It first binds to Asp99 then Cys96, which induces a dramatic change in the active site by disrupting a cation-π interaction between Try95 and Arg155. In contrast, diethyltin (DET) and diethylead (DEL) were found to be substrates for MerB, where both ethyl groups were cleaved and the SnIV and PbIV products bound to the active site in a similar manner to HgII. DMT, DET and DEL show higher binding affinity to MerB than its initial substrate MeHg. These results suggest that organomercurials may not be the only substrates for MerB and Asp99 is the first residue to bind to organometals followed by subsequent binding to Cys96 and Cys159. In addition, these observations suggest that there are other possible applications for employing MerB in bioremediation of organolead and organotin contaminated sites while other organometals may have implications when using MerB in bioremediation systems.

658	The effect of exercise training on cholesterol and bile acid metabolism in ovariectomized rats	There has been accumulating evidence in recent years that the estrogen deficient state in ovariectomized (Ovx) animals and in postmenopausal women results in substantial liver triglyceride (TG) accumulation. However, evidence of disturbances in cholesterol metabolism in link with estrogen deficiency is limited to observations of higher plasma total cholesterol levels found in human as well as in animals. In fact, the impact of estrogen withdrawal on liver cholesterol metabolism has received little attention and shows some controversies. Therefore, the three studies presented in this thesis have been conducted in Ovx rats, as an animal model of post-menopausal women, to investigate the effects of estrogen withdrawal on key molecular markers of cholesterol and bile acid metabolism in liver and in transintestinal cholesterol excretion (TICE), and also to determine the potential role of exercise training as a positive alternative intervention. It has been shown that exercise training can improve plasma cholesterol levels. An enhanced transport of peripheral cholesterol toward the liver for subsequent secretion into bile and excretion from the body has been suggested; however, the underlying mechanism for this action is not fully understood.  In the first study, we showed that estrogen withdrawal was associated with higher (P < 0.05) liver total cholesterol under the standard diet and the standard diet + cholesterol diet, while liver triglyceride (TG) content was higher in Ovx than in Sham rats in all three dietary conditions which are the standard diet, the standard diet + cholesterol and the high fat diet + cholesterol. Surprisingly, the standard diet + cholesterol was associated with lower (P < 0.001) plasma total cholesterol and TG levels in Ovx than in Sham rats, suggesting a decrease in very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion. Accordingly, several transcripts of key markers of VLDL synthesis including microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) and apoB-100 were decreased (P < 0.05) in Ovx compared to Sham rats under the three dietary conditions and even more so for MTP and apoB-100 when rats were fed the standard diet + cholesterol. To go one step further, in the second study we determined the effects of exercise training on hepatic key markers of farnesoid X receptor (FXR)-small heterodimer partner (SHP)-cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) (FXR-SHP-CYP7A1) pathway, involved in cholesterol conversion into bile acid and excretion from the body, in Ovx cholesterol fed rats. Our main experimental group was Ovx rats fed a high cholesterol diet (Ovx-Chol) that was compared, on one hand, to a group of Ovx rats fed a standard diet (Ovx-SD) to observe the effects of the diet and, on the other hand, compared to a group of Sham operated rats fed the cholesterol diet (Sham-Chol) to observe the effect of estrogen withdrawal. Results of this study showed that plasma and liver total cholesterol levels were not affected by exercise training in any of the experimental conditions. Cholesterol feeding in both Sham and Ovx rats resulted in significantly (P<0.001) higher hepatic cholesterol accumulation than in Ovx-SD rats. A main effect of training (P< 0.05) was, however, found for transcripts of SHP and CYP7A1. The SHP and CYP7A1 transcripts were increased by training. These results suggest that exercise training through up-regulation of genes involved in bile acid formation may modulate cholesterol metabolism in Ovx animals. Finally, a recent growing body of evidence suggests that reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) can also proceed through a non-biliary pathway known as transintestinal cholesterol excretion (TICE). Indeed, both liver and intestine are involved in excretion of the excess cholesterol from the body. Based on this concept, we expanded our research to determine whether exercise training has an effect on intestinal membrane cholesterol receptors involved in TICE pathway in intact and Ovx rats fed a normal and a high cholesterol diet. Results of the third study showed that exercise training increased (P< 0.01) transcripts of intestinal LDL-R and PCSK9, which are involved in intestinal cholesterol uptake from circulation, and their nuclear transcription factor, intestinal sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP2) (P< 0.05) in both Sham and Ovx rats compared to rats remaining sedentary (Sed). On the other hand, hepatic LDL-R and PCSK9 gene expression was suppressed (P< 0.01) by cholesterol feeding but not affected by exercise training. Flavin monooxygenase 3 (FMO3) gene expression, as a cholesterol balance regulator in liver, was significantly decreased (P<0.01) by cholesterol feeding in both Sham and Ovx rats compared to rats were fed the SD diet but unchanged following exercise training and estrogen withdrawal. An up-regulation of intestinal gene expression of LDL-R and PCSK9 following voluntary wheel running in intact and Ovx rats suggests that exercise training may contribute to increased cholesterol elimination through the TICE pathway. Overall, our results indicate that a high cholesterol diet and ovariectomy combine to decrease the gene expression of key markers of VLDL synthesis suggesting a reduction in cholesterol excretion from the liver. Alternatively, it seems that reduced hepatic LDL-R transcript found in Ovx animals might be due to hepatic cholesterol accumulation. Moreover, our findings introduced exercise training as an appropriate non-pharmacological intervention to stimulate the excretion of the excess cholesterol from the body through upregulation of genes involved in bile acid biosynthesis in liver and intestinal basolateral cholesterol transporters in TICE.

659	Les enjeux éthiques de la pratique privée de l’ergothérapie : perceptions d’ergothérapeutes	In Quebec, 31% of occupational therapists work in the private sector, which is constantly growing. To date, no studies have specifically documented the ethical issues involved in this practice. The objective of this study was to explore these issues, that is, situations that could compromise the respect of an ethical value. Using a phenomenology-inspired research protocol, seven occupational therapists were interviewed in semi-directed individual interviews. Based on the conceptual framework of Swisher and colleagues, the interview questionnaire permitted the identification of different types of ethical issues. The results show that several values are likely to be compromised: patient well-being, patient autonomy, public safety, distributive justice, quality of interventions, competent practice, professional independence, honesty and professionalism. Although occupational therapists are concerned about the well-being of patients, there are a number of factors that appear to contribute to compromised values, including dual-loyalty situations experienced by occupational therapists, third-party interference in the clinical process, and the funding of clinics. Moreover, the ethical issues of private practice occupational therapy are mainly macroscopic. The ability of occupational therapists to perceive some of these issues seems to be related to some of their characteristics, that is, their ethical sensitivity and the fact that they are novices. The results of this study are generally in line with those documented in the physiotherapy literature and demonstrate the lack of support available to occupational therapists, notably novices, to help effectively overcome these issues.	occupational therapy , private practice , ethics , dual loyalty , ethical dilemma , ethical temptation , ethical distress	en	18505.0
660	Évaluation du développement et de la mise en oeuvre d'un référentiel de compétences pour favoriser l'utilisation des connaissances issues de la recherche en éducation	To foster research knowledge utilization, the Centre de transfert pour la réussite éducative du Québec and the Équipe RENARD de recherche sur le transfert des connaissances wished to empower school practitionners to play the role of intermediate agents. To do so, they developped and implemented a competency model : the Référentiel d’agir compétent à l’intégration de connaissances favorables à la réussite éducative des jeunes du Québec. This thesis has three objectives : 1) present and analyze the program theory of this competency model’s elaboration process; 2) present and analyze the program theory of the implementation of this competency model and 3) present the results of the evaluation of the process and mecanism of the project. In order to achieve these objectives, a qualitative methodology has been used, based on the Integrative process/outcome evaluation approach described by Chen (2015). The first article of the thesis present the competency model’s elaboration process and analyze this process comparing it with the best practices in the field. The second article present the components of the action model and those of the change model. In comparing the action and change model’s components with the litterature, the second article demonstrate that the program theory of the project is plausible. The third and last article of the thesis shows that the project has had an influence on the way the participants perceive there role in fostering knowledge utilization. This article also reveals that the participants have been able, to some extent, to utilize in their practice the ressources they acquired in the project. Finally, this article also present an analyze of the components that have helped or hindered the achievements of the project.

661	Recherche de la matière sombre à l’aide de détecteurs à liquides surchauffés dans le cadre de l’expérience PICO/Picasso	Dark matter makes up 85% of the matter content of the universe and we still don’t know what it is made of. The Picasso experiment, now named PICO, has been searching for it for several years with the use of superheated liquid detectors. Following the interaction of a particle with a superheated liquid freon of the CXFY family, a bubble is formed through a phase change and is detected with several types of sensors, telling us about the nature of the event. Located at SNOLab, in Ontario, these detectors produce some of the best results in the field.  The present work will go through three types of superheated liquid detectors. A full description of the working principles will be presented for each of them. In addition, the fabrication, the operation mode and the data analysis will be shown. Detector calibration techniques will then be presented with different particle sources. Finally, the most recent results will be discussed, demonstrating the performance of the superheated liquid detector technique.

662	L’argent ne fait pas le bonheur : les discours sur la société de consommation et les modes de vie à Montréal, 1945-1975	This dissertation examines discourses on consumer society in Montreal between 1945 and 1975, during a period known as the “golden age of capitalism.” Relying on a variety of sources that reflect a diversity of perspectives — namely mainstream periodicals, “feminine” magazines, social work theses, commissions of inquiry, and publications produced by financial institutions, parent associations, unions, Catholic organizations, and community associations — this dissertation reveals how a wide array of commentators perceived the beginnings of mass consumerism in Montreal and its repercussions on lifestyles. It also explores, to an extent, how so-called ordinary people experienced these beginnings and repercussions in their everyday lives. Although economic indicators display a relative prosperity, this dissertation first offers a quantitative analysis that shows that consumer society did not truly begin in Montreal (or Quebec more generally) before the 1960s. This study then proceeds to a qualitative analysis of discourses concerning Quebec’s and Canada’s economic situation. Apprehensions surrounding the economy persisted throughout this period — most notably around inflation, despite its being under control — and several experts continued to view prosperity as fragile. This dissertation then looks at the positive, ambivalent, but more frequently negative reactions to the beginnings of mass consumerism and the changes in values it entailed. It then finally examines discourses that addressed the repercussions of consumer society on household financial practices, on familial relationships and identity construction within the home, and on poverty. This dissertation suggests that French-Québécois experts resisted mass consumerism to a greater extent than their anglophone colleagues and that the arrival of consumer society reinforced patriarchy (at least discursively). It also highlights a rupture within discourses on consumerism sometime around 1965 as the conservatism of the previous two decades gave way to ideas linked to the social unrest of the mid-to-late 1960s and early 1970s. From the mid 1960s onward, most commentators began to understand phenomena like debt and poverty as fundamentally connected to consumerism as they developed an oftentimes militant socializing rhetoric that increasingly viewed consumption itself as a structural and collective problem.

663	La stratégie pétrolière de la France en Algérie, 1962-1971	After an eight-year war, Algeria gained full independence. Saharan oil, a major reason for the extension of the war, became the property of the new independent republic. On the other hand, French petroleum companies, which had a quasi-monopoly over the oil industry, kept their former privileges. Nevertheless, the Evian Accords of March 1962, which guaranteed these privileges, were challenged by the new Algerian authorities meeting in Tripoli, Libya, a few months later. This was in line with the will of the Algerian governing party to nationalize the gas and oil industry. Finally the adoption of the socialist path by the new leadership, in addition to the departure of the majority of the European population, compromised the French strategy to keep control of Saharan supplies, the more so that they were payable in French francs. This thesis asks the following question: what strategies did France adopt to safeguard its interests in anticipation of the nationalization of the oil industry it considered inevitable? A chronological approach makes it possible to show the evolution of Franco-Algerian relation in the field of oil between 1962 and 1971. Sources are mainly the archives of the French petroleum company TOTAL and the French Foreign Affairs ministry. For the Algerian side, it makes uses of the personal archives of the Algerian minister of industry and energy at the time, Abdesselam Belaïd. The dissertation demonstrates that, starting from the beginning of 1960’s, the main goal of France was to diversify its sources of supply and to diminish its dependency towards Algerian oil. Saharan resources were part of the strategy. In addition, this research shows that, starting in the middle of the 1960’s, French petroleum companies diminished their level of engagement in Algeria to the minimum. Finally, the thesis highlights the limits of the French strategy of diversification of its oil supply.	France , Pétrole , Diversification , Algéria , Petroleum , Nationalization	en	18464.0
664	Hic et Nunc : forces et limites de l'esprit chez Ivan Illich	"This thesis explores the foundations of Ivan Illich’s thinking and its implications for language and for our ways of relating to one another. His thinking is rooted in a singular vision of the human being as a creature who achieves perfection by establishing a relationship that is free and fully incarnate. I explore this fundamental idea through three major lines of thought running through Illich’s oeuvre : relations between self and other; the role of institutions; the practice of language. In the first chapter I examine this vision through Illich’s way of thinking together with friends, a convivially practiced search for truth. He thus places himself in the filiation of the Good Samaritan from the parable of the Gospels. In Illich’s highly personal interpretation, which stands outside the mainstream Christian tradition, this parable bears on the relationship between faith and reason. In Illich’s view, Jesus reveals that no rule dictates who is my neighbor: the Samaritan’s gesture of charity toward the Jew is completely gratuitous and comes from a deeply felt unease (Illich refers to the Hebrew word rhacham, often translated as mercy). In the second chapter I discuss the worldview that results from such an interpretation. For Illich, the Gospels open up a unique opportunity to be with each other beyond the rules that frame various groups (clan, tribe, nation etc). This thinking leads him to perceive the institutions and organizations of Western society as resulting from a perversion of that opportunity, because they seek to guarantee—through a structure or a service—precisely what should remain a freely-chosen, personal inclination. Illich demonstrates that by renouncing any guarantee and power in the world, we can still be with each other and live up to our personal inclination as creatures. Jean-Luc Nancy’s thinking on being-one-with-another offers here a counterpoint to Illich’s intuition and shows how this intuition goes beyond the Christian tradition by fully adhering to the human condition. Finally, in the third chapter, I approach language as the intangible reverse side of the irreducible condition of being with one another. According to Illich, the language we speak has also been corrupted through institutionalization. He traces the origin of this corruption to the Middle Ages, with the emergence of the notion of ""mother tongue"" and of its transmission via teaching. Through both his practice and his writing, however, Illich shows that uncorrupted speech remains possible, when punctuated by the silence of asceticism and listening. The iv words of Paul Celan on the persistence of speech in a corrupt world relays and responds to Illich’s thoughts on this theme, thus opening a rich dialogue on the possibility—always present, but never guaranteed—to speak with one another. Interwoven throughout these themes is the temporal dimension of hic et nunc, the here and now between us, which constantly surfaces in Illich’s writings yet remains difficult to grasp with the human mind."

665	The use of candida antarctica lipase B for the synthesis of macrocycles and polymers based on natural products	Materials used in biomedical applications need to be biocompatible and ideally biodegradable. Bile acids are natural occurring compounds found in humans, and their polyesters possess hydrolyzable bonds, thermal shape memory and tunable flexibility. Until now, the synthetic pathway to obtain such materials required transition metal catalysts for the macrocyclization step, which is necessary to perform ring-opening polymerization (ROP). To circumvent the need for such catalysts, enzymatic ring closing was performed using lipases. Conveniently, two synthetic steps were replaced with a single step, using a renewable and reusable catalyst, with 58 % yield and a colorless product. The bile acid-containing macrocycles were then enzymatically polymerized as described in our previous work, while optimizing the reaction time. In 15 hours, relatively high Mw of 40 000 g/mol were obtained, while maintaining the dispersity ≤ 1.4 and a glass transition temperature of about 12 °C. As a proof-of-concept, conditions for the enzymatic ring closure of thapsic acid with 1,10-decanediol were determined beforehand. While optimizing for enzyme amount and reaction time, enzymatic ROP conditions to obtain di- and tetralactones from these monomers were established. The resulting semi-crystalline polymers also possess relatively high molecular weight and low dispersity. Hence, the use of lipases for both ring-closing and ring-opening reactions now shows potential for large, rigid moieties in addition to more mobile structures, using the same enzyme. This is a step towards the production of more biocompatible polymers, with a synthetic pathway that follows many green chemistry principles.

666	À la rencontre des esprits brésiliens : la construction des relations avec l’au-delà chez les adeptes du Santo Daime au Québec	The Santo Daime, an Amazonian Brazilian religion, expanded into the Belle Province almost twenty years ago. This syncretic religion, stemming from indigenous traditions, Afro-Brazilian religions, Catholicism, European esoteric currents and Spiritism, is intrinsically connected to Brazilian culture and more specifically to the Amazon rainforest through the use of ayahuasca, a hallucinogenic substance. The fardados (uniformed members) make contact with the divine thanks to this entheogen called Daime. This thesis examines the expansion of Santo Daime in the province of Quebec through the history of a group we call the Église daimiste québécoise. An ethnography of the Daimista group will help us to explore the mechanisms that are implemented by members to make sense of this culturally distant religion. Inspired by both experiential and phenomenological approaches, this research aims to understand the religious experience amongst Quebec’s Daimistas, in which they build special relationships with the beings of the Astral, the beyond. In that sense, mystical experiences and clairvoyance are two phenomena that we will address as a catalyst of these relationships. By examining how Santo Daime enters into members’ everyday life, we will see that the process of learning the religion establishes an understanding of the language and the symbols of Santo Daime. Along with this apprenticeship, and connecting elements of Santo Daime with the other faiths they have experienced forms an intelligible ensemble that can be integrated into their everyday life. We will see that from this point on, a commitment of the members to the beings of the Astral is possible and that a real disciple (the members) / master (the spirits) relationship can develop.

667	La pierre polie à l'embouchure de la rivière Sainte-Marguerite : caractérisation pétrographique, technologique et spatiale d’un locus de production de l’Archaïque moyen à supérieur	Located on Baie Sainte-Marguerite, close to the Saguenay fjord, station B of the DbEl- 10 site was host to Maritime Archaic groups. Many polished stone tools made out of a wide  variety  of  raw  materials  were  maunfactured  in  situ  and  maintained  on  the  site.  Through  a  multidisciplinary approach that combines petrographic, technological and spatial analyses, we  seek to better understand the manner in which polished stone tool production was organized on  DbEl-10B.    Based on the type of rock, on the concentration of artifacts around identified hearths, and their  association with specific production stages and tools, it is possible to identify specialized areas  without the site being a specialized production workshop. While this thesis provides a better  understanding of the occupation of the DbEl-10B site, it also brings to light behaviours that were  inspired by economic and cultural choices.     Chaînes  opératoires  associated  with  eight  distinct  raw  materials  are  described  and  reveal  different adaptations based on the physical properties of the stones. The spatial distribution of  production steps and of tool fragments allows the formulation of hypotheses concerning the  location of distinct activities practiced by the occupants of the DbEl-10B site.

668	Le vêtement, outil d’inclusion sociale pour femmes baby-boomers en situation de handicap, potentiellement en situation de handicap et en processus de vieillissement : le manteau d’hiver	This cross-sector study in clothing design and occupational therapy targets women of the baby boomer generation with disabilities, eventual disabilities, and in the process of ageing. Often these women tend to isolate themselves because, for example, their coats are simply inadequate in winter. Supported by principles of universal and inclusive design, this study helps identify how the concepts of HEDONISM, COMFORT, and FUNCTIONALITY are expressed and articulated, and which insights could inform the design of a winter coat from an Aging in place perspective. The on-going relationship between body and clothes allows to analyze the ageing process, both on the physiological and cultural realms. This thesis proposes the study of how these phenomena affect ageing women. Julia Twigg’s work is an essential point of reference here. In order to deduce the parameters of design, a qualitative research includes interviews with four women, direct observations, as well as individual fittings of their own winter coats. The ensuing data brought forth a new concept, and this concept is TEMPORALITY (the progression of ideas and perceptions linked to clothing and women undergoing with disabilities, eventual disabilities, and in the process of ageing). Time acts like an umbrella under which we find the three main concepts mentioned above. Criteria for designs are thus revealed. For one point, affordability promotes social inclusion. Accessories are unavoidable considerations when modeling attire. Sportswear technology is of primary importance for HEDONISM, COMFORT and FUNCTIONNALITY clothing, as is versatility. The creation of specs sets for an interdisciplinary design of an eloquent coat suitable for harsh winters is the goal of this study. These winter coats should be pleasing to the contemporary tastes of women of the baby boomer generation. In conclusion, this systemic approach to clothing design for the baby boomer woman offers a new way to shoulder old age.

669	Une étude de la relation entre les homicides et la disponibilité des armes à feu dans 150 pays	Objective. This study estimates the relationship between firearms availability and homicides in 150 countries. More specifically, this study compares the predictive validity of three different firearms availability indicators: (1) the percentage of homes owning a firearms; (2) the percentage of persons carrying a firearm; and (3) the rate of firearms per 100 populations. Carrying a firearm is conceptualized as a central dimension of a self-defense culture and it should display a stronger association with homicides than the two other indicators. Methodology. Data comes from the Enquête Mondiale sur l’Homicide, Small Arms Survey and other publications from the United Nations. Descriptive, bivariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to assess the relationship between firearms and homicides. Results. Results show that, in general, the percentage of persons carrying firearms is positively associated with the homicide rate and the proportion of homicides committed with a firearm.  Economic inequalities and corruption within the criminal justice system are both positively associated with homicides. Conclusion. Results do not support the self-defense thesis. Conversely, firearm carrying is associated with high homicide rates, which is in keeping with studies showing that a firearm is the perfect crime facilitator. Hence, technologies developed by forensic and information sciences represent promising avenues to track firearms transactions and support criminal investigations.

670	BRCA Previvors: Medical and Social Factors That Differentiate Them From Previvors With Other Hereditary Cancers	In this paper, I outline some of the reasons why BRCA “previvors” (i.e., “survivors of a predisposition to cancer”) are different from previvors with other hereditary cancers. I examine how the absence of a standard of care for breast cancer risk for women with a BRCA mutation, coupled with a broad range of genetic penetrance and lower mortality, makes BRCA different than other hereditary cancers that have clear and established guidelines. In addition to these medical differences, social factors like the cultural prominence of breast cancer and the social significance of breasts have engendered a more complicated individual previvor identity for and cultural response to women with a BRCA mutation.	previvor , BRCA , hereditary cancer , breast cancer	en	18389.0
671	De la Beat Generation au beatnik : la massification d’une contreculture souterraine par la presse écrite, 1945-1965	In the New York underground scene of the 1940s, the Beat Generation earns its name as well as its countercultural essence thanks to the union between the avant-garde literary pursuit and the unconventional lifestyle that its inspirers spontaneously create. The sensibility proclaimed by the Beats from the very beginning – their desire for spiritual liberation – builds up in the middle of the American Century, between the nuclear threat of the Cold War and the hipster activity exalted by jazz. Nevertheless, a decade after this period leading to the publication of Howl and Other Poems (1956) by Allen Ginsberg and of On the Road (1957) by Jack Kerouac, a new social figure enters the orbit of the Beat Generation : the Beatnik. Conceived by a journalist, the neologism reflects the stereotypes attributed to the movement, soon subdued by the forces of consumer society. This master’s thesis focuses on the insertion of counterculture into mass culture, while noting the key role played by the written press. Beyond the proverbial harshness of the critics acknowledged by the historiography, this study argues that newspapers and magazines, in opening the field of representations associated with the Beat Generation, participate in the arrival of the Beatnik, also echoed in other media. In the end, the meaning of counterculture depends on both its founding ideas and the pressure mass culture exerts on it; the junction of these two antagonistic elements reinforces the historical importance of the Beat Generation as a social movement in the United States.

672	Critical Junctures and Missed Opportunities: The Case of Lebanon's Cedar Revolution	This article addresses three shortcomings in the path dependency literature on critical junctures: the neglect of negative cases, non-state actors and of power asymmetries. The 2005 Cedar Revolution had the makings of a critical juncture. Yet despite the rise of alternative nongovernmental organizations (ANGOs) seeking to change the sectarian political system, a public ready for change, renewed donor interest and funds, little came of this juncture; Lebanon’s ANGOs are now inactive. This paper questions why. Building on fieldwork conducted between 2006 and 2010, it argues that the Cedar Revolution was a critical juncture and that this critical juncture was marked by a substantial power asymmetry between ANGOs and Lebanon’s sectarian political actors. Nonetheless, the renewed donor interest in promoting a stable and democratic Lebanon could have reduced this power gap; however, the politics of Western democracy promotion ultimately reinforced the hold of sectarian leaders on Lebanon’s political scene.

673	Social Cohesion as Peacebuilding in the Central African Republic and Beyond	Social cohesion has increasingly been touted as a tool of peacebuilding. Theoretically, the concept is linked with efforts to address inequality and build social capital. Practically, social cohesion is bandied about in post-conflict settings such as the Central African Republic (CAR) as an important objective to build sustainable peace. We argue that peacebuilding scholars focus more on social cohesion as an end goal than they do on the policy making and implementation aspects of the concept. After reviewing two key social cohesion initiatives in CAR, we find practitioners equally remiss in thinking about process. Both communities involved in the initiatives also face challenges in grasping the complexity of the horizontal and vertical linkages that sustain conflict and which need to be restructured to build social cohesion. The paper documents these shortcomings and suggests tentative ways forward.	République centrafricaine , Cohésion sociale , Consolidation de la paix , Relations État-société , Inégalités	en	18311.0
674	Systematic observation of barroom incidents in a large Montreal venue	On the basis of previous studies by Macintyre and Homel and Winlow et al, this article utilizes systematic observation in order to describe and understand the pattern of incidents on a micro level – the barroom. Systematic observation combines ethnography with a quantitative outlook. This research counts, locates and describes incidents within a single building over a substantial period of time. For a period of 258 nights of observation in a Canadian barroom, bouncers completed reports on each intervention and provided specific information regarding what happened, when and where within the venue. We can distinguish (1) incivilities and violations of house rules, (2) violent criminal behavior, and (3) non-violent criminal behavior. Incidents are unevenly distributed, producing internal hotspots and ‘rush hours’. Shifting hotspots are evident, moving from the entrance and table areas earlier in the evening towards the ‘carousing’ zone (bars, dance floor and its proximity) later in the night. The barroom is highly dynamic, with long peaceful periods interrupted by sudden incidents. The barroom’s routine activities modulate the work of its security personnel. Knowing these internal patterns can support and guide responsible drinking programs and situational crime prevention initiatives.

675	Le Phonopostale et les sonorines : un échec riche d’idées	Reflecting on a resounding technological failure such as the Phonopostale and its pretty “sonorines”, one can surmise about the relationship that inevitably binds the conception of a medium to its uses, as well as the theoretical and ideological tendencies prevailing at a given time. By the turn of a socio-technological evolution at the beginning of last century, which seemed to be heading towards simultaneous oralisation, or indeed telephony, of remote communication, the Phonopostale constitutes a strange and disturbing object, arriving late whilst prematurely ahead concerning the future of the recording and communication medium. The ideas implicit in this device raise very old and new questions, the interest of which becomes even more evident in the digital age. Some very popular applications today use the same principle as the Phonopostale while integrating them to the telephone, with which the Phonopostale attempted to compete. However, this prophetic and premature technological failure shows us, as does the development of our mobile phone ergonomics (which today are less means for speaking than instruments of writing and recording), that no teleological perspective can anticipate what will constitute the main routes of technological development charted by the user community.		en	18300.0
676	La rétroaction corrective à l’écrit et la révision des apprenants de français langue seconde	Corrective feedback (CF) is defined as “an indication to a learner that his or her use of the target language is correct” (Lightbown and Spada, 2006, p.197). When the written product is revised, the learner reacts to corrective feedback in different ways. This study focuses on two aspects: it focuses on the various CF techniques used by teachers of French as a second language in six ‘accueil’ classrooms in Montreal, and it focuses on the reaction of 64 students in these classrooms, to these techniques in their revision process. How the teacher’s corrective feedback was incorporated in the revision process varied according to the student’s proficiency level (weak or strong), their grade level (elementary or secondary), their learning difficulties, their error types and the CF techniques used. The student’s written product, composed of 150 words, was analyzed. The results indicate that the teachers of French as a second language vary their CF techniques according to the variables. Corrective Feedback, overall, effected the student’s revision.	Revision , Feedback , Proficiency levels , Error types , Learning difficulties , Second language	en	16440.0
677	A qualitative impairment in face perception in Alzheimer’s disease : evidence from a reduced face inversion effect	Prevalent face recognition difficulties in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) have typically been attributed to the underlying episodic and semantic memory impairment. The aim of the current study was to determine if AD patients are also impaired at the perceptual level for faces, more specifically at extracting a visual representation of an individual face. To address this question, we investigated the matching of simultaneously presented individual faces and of other nonface familiar shapes (cars), at both upright and inverted orientation, in a group of mild AD patients and in a group of healthy older controls matched for age and education. AD patients showed a reduced inversion effect (i.e., larger performance for upright than inverted stimuli) for faces, but not for cars, both in terms of error rates and response times. While healthy participants showed a much larger decrease in performance for faces than for cars with inversion, the inversion effect did not differ significantly for faces and cars in AD. This abnormal inversion effect for faces was observed in a large subset of individual patients with AD. These results suggest that AD patients have deficits in higher-level visual processes, more specifically at perceiving individual faces, a function that relies on holistic representations specific to upright face stimuli. These deficits, combined with their memory impairment, may contribute to the difficulties in recognizing familiar people that are often reported in patients suffering from the disease and by their caregivers.

678	Physical therapy for urinary incontinence in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis or low bone density : a randomized controlled trial	Objective: To assess the effectiveness of 12 weekly physical therapy sessions for urinary incontinence (UI) compared with a control intervention, for reducing the number of UI episodes measured with the 7-day bladder diary, at 3 months and 1 year postrandomization.       Methods: A single parallel-group randomized controlled trial was conducted at one outpatient public health center, in postmenopausal women aged 55 years and over with osteoporosis or low bone density and UI. Women were randomized to physical therapy (PT) for UI or osteoporosis education. The primary outcome measure was number of leakage episodes on the 7-day bladder diary, assessed at baseline, after treatment and at 1 year. The secondary outcome measures included the pad test and disease-specific quality of life and self-efficacy questionnaires assessed at the same timepoints.       Results: Forty-eight women participated (24 per group). Two participants dropped out of each group and one participant was deceased before 3-month follow-up. Intention-to-treat analysis was undertaken. At 3 months and 1 year, there was a statistically significant difference in the number of leakage episodes on the 7-day bladder diary (3 mo: P = 0.04; 1 y: P = 0.01) in favor of the PT group. The effect size was 0.34 at 1 year. There were no harms reported.       Conclusions: After a 12-week course of PT once per week for UI, PT group participants had a 75% reduction in weekly median number of leakage episodes, whereas the control group's condition had no improvement. At 1 year, the PT group participants maintained this improvement, whereas the control group's incontinence worsened.

679	Conservative management for female urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse review 2013 : summary of the 5th International Consultation on Incontinence	Aims  The objective of the 5th International Consultation on Incontinence (ICI) chapter on Adult Conservative Management was to review and summarize the new evidence on conservative management of urinary incontinence (UI) and pelvic organ prolapse (POP) in order to compile a current reference source for clinicians, health researchers, and service planners. In this paper, we present the review highlights and new evidence on female conservative management.   Methods  Revision and updates of the 4th ICI Report using systematic review covering years 2008–2012.   Results  Each section begins with a brief definition and description of the intervention followed by a summary, where possible, of both the state and level of evidence for prevention and treatment, and ends with a “grade of recommendation.” The paper concludes with areas identified as requiring further research.   Conclusions  For UI, there are no prevention trials on lifestyle interventions. There are, however, few new intervention trials of lifestyle interventions involving weight loss and fluid intake with improved levels of evidence and grade of recommendation. Outside of pre- and post-natal pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) trials for the prevention of female UI, there is a dearth of PFMT prevention trials for women with UI. PFMT remains the first-line treatment for female UI with high levels of evidence and grades of recommendation. Bladder training levels of evidence and grades of recommendation are maintained. For POP, new evidence supports the effectiveness of physiotherapy in the treatment of POP and there are now improved levels of evidence and grades of recommendation.	pelvic organ prolapse , urinary incontinence , women	en	16376.0
680	Assigning Refugees to Landlords in Sweden: Stable Maximum Matchings	The member states of the European Union received 1.2 million first time asylum applications in 2015 (a doubling compared to 2014). Even if asylum will be granted for many of the refugees that made the journey to Europe, several obstacles for successful integration remain. This paper focuses on one of these obstacles, namely the problem of finding housing for refugees once they have been granted asylum. In particular, the focus is restricted to the situation in Sweden during 2015–2016 and it is demonstrated that market design can play an important role in a partial solution to the problem. More specifically, because almost all accommodation options are exhausted in Sweden, the paper investigates a matching system, closely related to the system adopted by the European NGO “Refugees Welcome”, and proposes an easy-to-implement algorithm that finds a stable maximum matching. Such matching guarantees that housing is provided to a maximum number of refugees and that no refugee prefers some landlord to their current match when, at the same time, that specific landlord prefers that refugee to his current match.

681	Pedagogical Appropriation of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) by West African Educators = Appropriation pédagogique des technologies de l’information et de la communication (TIC) par les éducateurs ouest-africains	This research investigates how and why educators in West Africa, in Mali in particular, pedagogically appropriate information and communication technologies (ICT) and with what effects. Appropriation involves integrating newness into one’s very being and mobilizing it strategically to meet contextualized objectives, often in resistance to the status quo. It is assumed that ICT use is shaped by the values and objectives of users as well as by the local and global hierarchies of the milieus in which they are used. Qualitative research methods and interpretive approaches revealed meanings educators give to their reality and experiences. Interviews were conducted with 31 persons: 23 primary through high school teachers, six university professors, and two administrators. As educators digested ICT, it became part and parcel of their beings and everyday lives. As they adapted it to their milieus, they worked as cultural agents, mediating between ICT and society. The professors in particular expressed desires to use ICT to facilitate and enhance African participation in global debates and scholarly production and to transform how Africa and Africans are projected and perceived. Educators harnessed ICT for its transformative possibilities. The changes apparent in student-teacher relations (more interactive) and classrooms (more dialogical) suggest that ICT can be a catalyst for pedagogical change, including in document-poor contexts and ones weighed down by legacies of colonialism. Learning from the perspectives and experiences of educators pioneering the use of ICT in education in Africa can inform educational theory, practice and policy and deepen understandings of the concept of appropriation as a process of cultural change.

682	Conceptualisation de l’activité pédagogique en contexte d’apprentissage hybride et développement professionnel des enseignant(e)s universitaires	The integration of new technologies in higher education should not be seen as a mere fad, but rather a framework for redesigning the new orientations to be given to the University of the 21st century, in terms of institutional culture, organizational resources and achieving the objectives of research and teaching programs. Indeed, the emergence of a new trend of higher education, that is blended learning, has impacts on the pedagogical practices. Yet, there are no satisfactory models in the literature that describes the link pertaining to the relationship between teaching in the context of blended learning and faculty development. Throughout the whole semester of fall 2014, we collected data, by the means of participant observations and self-confrontation interviews, on the teaching activities of one full-time lecturer, in sociology of work, and one part-time lecturer, in project management, with one undergraduate class of each lecturer in the programs of certificate at HEC Montreal. The data analysis, using the conceptual categorizations, brought about theoretical statements underpinning the dynamics of the relationships between the phenomena of blended learning and faculty development. Scientifically, our research has shed a new light on the processes of professional identity construction in faculty development, regarding the technological, sociocultural and economic changes that the University, in general, and, especially, the teaching and learning practices undergo. Our inductive approach has helped to elucidate the structure of the interactions of the two phenomena, from the point of view of the two lecturers, and to construct models of pedagogical practices rooted in their daily teachings. Therefore, socially, these models translate a grammar of thought and action, anchored in the very values of the lecturers. We took into consideration the paradigm of the actual task, versus that of the prescribed task, in terms of implementation of the pedagogical processes, so that the results of this study be meaningful to the practice. The emerging models, from our redesign of the dialogical thinking processes of the two lecturers, can be used for the training of the faculty integrating online solutions to face-face instructions.

683	Les récepteurs GPR91 et GPR99 et leur implication dans le développement du système nerveux visuel	G Protein-Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) show a greater role in activating mechanism usually associated to transcription factors or cell adhesion molecules. New evidence shows that some of these receptors have an impact on axon guidance, the mechanism by which neurons’ axons are able to grow from their origin and reach their anatomical target. Guidance is mediated via a structure at the tip of the axon called the growth cone, which can interact with surrounding molecules. Axons from retinal ganglion cells (RCGs) navigating from the retina to the cerebral nuclei associated with vision, are sensitive to some of the GPCR ligands. These GPCRs are the cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2 and the GPR55, a receptor for lysophosphatidylinositol. GPR91 and GPR99, respectively receptors for succinate and α-ketoglutarate, are expressed in RGCs making them prime candidates to have an impact on axon guidance. In this thesis, we will test the role of GPR91 and GPR99 ligands on RCG axon growth and guidance.   To assess the impact of these receptors and their ligands on axon growth and guidance, first we evaluated their effects on growth cone morphology. To achieve this, we measured growth cone size and filopodia numbers, when exposed to 100 µM of succinate or 200µM of α-ketoglutarate. The effects of these ligands on axon growth were evaluated by measuring the total axon outgrowth from retinal explants. The role of GPR91 and GPR99 on growth cone turning, was determined by exposing a growing axon to a gradient of these ligands, originating from a micropipette situated 100 µm and 45° from the growth cone. The expression of these receptors in the retina was evaluated using immunohistochemistry.  Results showed that the addition of 100 µM succinate induced an increase in both growth cone size and filopodia number. It also increased total axon growth. α-ketoglutarate, at a concentration of 200 µM, produced similar results. Noteworthy, both ligands had no effect on growth cone turning.  In brief, these results indicate that GPR91 and GPR99 agonists induce an increase in RGC growth when present during development. They, however, have no effects on RGC growth cone turning. These new data provide a better understanding of the mechanisms controlling RGC development.	GPR91 , GPR99 , Visual Nervous system , RCG , GCPR , Development	en	16321.0
684	Cartographie des anciens cours d’eau, lignes de creux et des bassins versants de l'île de Montréal	"The cartography of the island of Montreal's former watercourses is lacking and must be redone in the most documented and transparent way possible. Two maps are currently used as references: ""Carte topographique de l'île de Montréal de 1542 à 1642"" [Topographic map of the island of Montreal from 1542 to 1642], drawn around 1930 by architect and researcher Aristide Beaugrand-Champagne, for which sources were not provided, and which contains numerous hydrographic incoherencies; and ""Montréal - Ruisseaux et fossés"" [Montreal - Streams and ditches], drawn by the Eaux et Assainissement [Water and Sanitation] division of Montreal’s Public Works Department in 1958, which covers part of the island, and for which some of the sources referenced have disappeared from the city’s archives.  A new survey of the island's watercourses has been undertaken by the team of Valérie Mahaut, assistant professor at the school of architecture of the Faculté de l’aménagement, Université de Montréal. After consulting more than one hundred original historical maps, some thirty were selected, geolocalized, and plotted; they form the core of the compilation work conducted in this study. From this data, several new maps were produced and made available online for free to serve as references for various disciplines and users. This surveying work is merely the first step in a broader project which promotes integrated rainwater management in urban areas. The data collected was interpreted so that the maps produced also show the thalwegs and crest lines (ridge lines or watershed boundary lines) of the island of Montreal's former watercourses with the goal of establishing ""New Urban Rivers""."

685	Les représentations de l’infirmière chez les étudiantes nouvellement inscrites au baccalauréat en sciences infirmières	Some researchers claim that the main reason why a person would choose to become a nurse is attributable to vocational aspects and not to the desire to exercise a profession that requires knowledge and skills inherent to the complexity of care (Prater & McEwen, 2006; Price, McGillis Hall, Angus & Peter, 2013). One of the main reasons for students attrition in nursing educational programs would be the dissonance between the initial representation they have of a nurse and the profession requirements (CNA, 2004). An exploratory study was conducted among newly enrolled students in a Nursing Bachelor’s degree (N=11), to better understand their representations of nurses and their expectations towards the profession. Moscovici’s Theory of Social Representations (1961) is the framework that supports this study. The qualitative analysis of semi-structured interviews suggests that Quebec students have a representation of nurses as people who help patients as much as doctors. New students expect to work hard through their studies as well as in their future job in health care settings. Nonetheless, they are ready to commit to nursing, because of a desire to help others and because they recognize themselves in the qualities they consider necessary for the practice of nursing such as relational skills, which include listening, empathy and patience. Therefore, these results suggest that the historical context in which nursing has evolved in Quebec, in addition to medias that do not seem to refresh the image they project of nursing, could have an influence on these new students representations of nurses. The results of this study could help define future research perspectives to a better understanding of the involvement of representations of nurses for students attrition, while also having implications for nursing practice, nursing policies and nursing training.	perceptions , students , nursing , social representations , expectations	en	16294.0
686	Effets des variations dans l’implantation d’un programme sur le risque cardiométabolique dans six CSSS de Montréal sur les résultats chez les patients	In 2011, the Agence de la santé et des services sociaux de Montréal (ASSSM), in partnership with the Health and social service centres (CSSS) of the region, coordinated implementation of an integrated and interdisciplinary program for prevention and management of cardiometabolic risk. The program, based on the Chronic Care Model and designed for patients with diabetes and hypertension, consists of a two-year sequence of individual follow-ups with a nurse and a nutritionist, group classes and physical activity sessions. The objective of this master’s thesis is to assess the impact of variations in implementation of some aspects of the program in the six CSSS participating in this study on patients’ health outcomes. Five aspects of implementation have been selected: resources, conformity to the clinical process proposed in the regional program, maturity of the program, internal coordination within the CSSS team and external coordination with primary care physicians. Analysis of difference in differences, including propensity scores that make the groups comparable, have been calculated to assess the impact of those aspects on four health outcomes: glycated hemoglobin, reaching the blood pressure level target and reaching two targets of lifestyle habits regarding the distribution of dietary carbohydrates and the practice of physical activity. The results show that the program yielded expected effects in regard to patients’ selected health outcomes, regardless of implementation variations among the studied CSSS. Indeed, few analysis revealed a significant impact of the implementation variables on those outcomes. Results suggest that beneficial effects of this program depend more on services provided to patients than on specific organisational aspects of its implementation.

687	Rôle de la signalisation Wnt non-canonique dans l’étiologie de l’ostéoarthrose chez l’humain	Clinical and in vitro studies suggest that subchondral bone sclerosis due to abnormal osteoblasts (Ob) is involved in the progression and/or onset of osteoarthritis (OA). Human Ob isolated from sclerotic subchondral OA bone tissue show an altered phenotype, a decreased canonical Wnt/ß-catenin signaling pathway (cWnt), and a reduced mineralization in vitro. Besides the cWnt pathway, at least two non-canonical signaling pathways, the Wnt/PKC and Wnt/PCP pathway have been described. These pathways are activated when a non-canonical Wnt ligand like Wnt-5a binds to a Wnt receptor coupled with non-canonical co-receptors. This activates, respectively for Wnt/PKC-Ca2+ and Wnt/PCP, the phosphorylation of PKC (pPKC) and the phosphorylation of JNK (pJNK) and their effect on downstream targets. However, there are no reports of either pathway in OA Ob. Here, we studied if alterations of the non-canonical pathways could be observed in OA Ob. We prepared primary human subchondral Ob using the tibial plateaus of OA patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty, or from tibial plateaus of normal individuals at autopsy. The expression of genes involved in Wnt/PKC and Wnt/PCP was evaluated by RT-qPCR and their protein production by Western blot analysis, in addition to p-PKC and p-PCP and NFAT and AP-1 activity with luciferase. Alkaline phosphatase activity and osteocalcin levels were evaluated respectively by substrate hydrolysis and ELISA respectively, and mineralization levels were evaluated with Alizarin red staining. OA Ob showed an increased alkaline phosphatase activity and osteocalcin release. The expression of Wnt5a was increased in OA Ob compared to normal. The expression of LGR5 was significantly increased in these cells. Moreover, the expression and production of LGR5 is directly modulated via the stimulation or inhibition of Wnt5a. However, Wnt5a did not stimulate the expression of LGR4. Wnt5a increased the phosphorylation of PKC and JNK as well as NFAT and AP-1 activity. Mineralization levels as well as alkaline phosphatase activity and osteocalcin secretion levels were also linked with changes in Wnt-5a levels. These data indicate that Wnt5a, which is increased in OA Ob, can directly stimulate the Wnt/PKC and Wnt/PCP pathways and this can affect the phenotype and mineralization observed in human OA Ob.

688	Understanding the role of CAP proteins in the polarization process of C. elegans	Asymmetric cell division is a crucial step in organism development, as it allows the generation of cellular diversity. In order to achieve asymmetric division cells need to polarize their cell fate determinants and properly orient their mitotic spindle before division. The C. elegans embryo is a powerful and widely used model to study asymmetric cell division. In the embryo the sperm entry site determines the anterior-posterior axis of polarity. In the newly fertilized embryo, shortly after meiosis, the cortex is uniformly contractile and the conserved PAR-3/PAR-6/PKC-3 complex (hereafter referred to as the PAR-3 complex) is localised on the entire cortex. Entry of the sperm triggers posterior smoothening and anterior-directed cortical flows. Asymmetric cortical contractions result in the formation of an anterior domain containing the PAR-3 complex, while the posterior-pole cortex, depleted of the PAR-3 complex, is enriched in PAR-2 and PAR-1 proteins. Therefore PAR domains define an anterior and a posterior pole of the embryo in response to cytoskeleton remodelling. The PAR-4 and PAR-5 proteins remain localized uniformly throughout the embryo. Intriguingly, the PAR proteins exert a feedback regulation on cortical contractility. PAR-5, one of the lately identified PAR proteins, was shown to be an ortholog of the adaptor protein 14-3-3 and to play an important role in cortical contractility. Despite its central role in cortical contractility and henceforth the polarization process, little is known on how PAR-5 regulates cortical contractility. The aim of this project is to better understand the regulation of cortical contractions via the PAR-5 protein and its interactors, and how they control cell polarity. In a GST pull down assay we identified several new interactors of PAR-5. Among these we found CAP-2 (actin capping protein), which was also pulled down with 14-3-3 in three different model systems. CAP-2 has been implicated in actin regulation. Interestingly we found that depletion of CAP proteins by RNA interference in wild type worms results in increased embryonic lethality, suggesting an important role in embryonic development. Live imaging of embryos depleted of CAP proteins shows that these embryos have decreased cortical contractions with a less stable pseudo cleavage furrow, indicating a defect in the regulation of the actin-myosin cytoskeleton. This was further confirmed by the decreased velocity and the number of NMY-2::GFP foci in CAP depleted embryos. Furthermore, these embryos show mild decrease in PAR-2 domain size during the polarity establishment phase. cap-2(RNAi) embryos also show a delay in cell cycle progression, however the role of the cell cycle delay in the regulation of cortical contractions has to be determined. The characterization of CAP proteins, which are cytoskeleton-remodeling regulators, will improve our understanding of the mechanisms underling the establishment and maintenance of cell polarity, and thereby asymmetric cell division.

689	Programme d’exercice en douceur basé sur le yoga Bali chez les personnes atteintes d’insuffisance cardiaque : les premiers pas	Heart failure is an increasingly important issue  associated with  disturbances of the  immune, cardiovascular,  and  autonomic  nervous  systems.  These  disturbances  contribute  to  several  incapacitating  physical  and  psychological  symptoms.  Research  to  date  on  yoga-based  exercise  programs has shown some promise in addressing these symptoms in heart failure. Nevertheless, there  remain  limitations  in the literature  concerning the  populations tested, lack of attention  to  psychological dimensions of heart failure, follow-up  of treatment  adherence  at home and daily symptom experience. This pilot project aims to develop a complementary yoga-based  program for patients with heart  failure,  to  evaluate  feasibility  and  acceptability  of  the  program  within  a  mainly  francophone  community, and  to obtain preliminary data on the impact  of this intervention  on  quality of life  and  physical  and  psychological  symptoms.  The  first  two  participants  enrolled  in  the  pilot  study  are considered for  this  memoire. They attended eight weekly  sessions in which were dispensed instructions  on  Bali  yoga  postures,  in addition to  psychoeducation, relaxation exercises,  and meditation. Sessions  were completed  at  the Montreal Heart Institute by a certified instructor. The development  of  tools  necessary for  the  program, including a  teaching  manual  and patient DVD, the feasibility and assessment  of  the  effects  of  the  program  on  the  physical  and  psychological  symptoms  are  amongst  the  topics  discussed. The results, though preliminary, seem to  suggest  improvement of physiological correlates  related to heart failure, including in autonomic nervous system control of the heart and inflammatory processes.

690	Origine de la réduction de la durée de vie des photoporteurs dans le InGaAsP implanté à basse température	A semiconductor material used in the manufacture of terahertz (THz) antennas, the InGaAsP quaternary (E_g = 0,79 eV), is Fe-ion implanted followed by Rapid Thermal Annealing (RTA) in order to improve its emission properties. The annealing is required to recrystallize the layer that was amorphized during implantation, resulting in a polycrystal filled with recrystallization defects. However, the Fe-implanted materials provide better performance than those simply damaged with Ga. In order to disentangle the effect of recrystallization defects and of Fe impurities, Deep-Level Transient Spectroscopy (DLTS) measurements, current DLTS (I-DLTS) measurements and Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) were carried out on non-implanted and on recrystallized samples. The DLTS et I-DLTS measurements aim to characterize deep levels generated by these two post-growth fabrication processes, while identifying the role of Fe impurities on the formation of these deep levels. In addition, a study of the vicinity of Fe atoms in the recrystallized material was performed using ToF-SIMS measurements. The DLTS measurements on recrystallized material were inconclusive because the capacitance measurements were distorted by the high resistivity of the material. On the other hand, the I-DLTS measurements on recrystallized material allowed us to conclude that the Fe impurities are responsible for the formation of a wide variety of energy levels lying between 0.25 and 0.40 eV, while structural defects induce levels lower than 0.25 eV. The Fe concentration is high compared to the solubility threshold of Fe in the material. It is therefore possible that Fe clusters are formed. However, this hypothesis is invalidated by the absence of a peak at the mass channels corresponding to the molecule ^(56)Fe_2^+ on ToF-SIMS mass spectra. Moreover, a simple model is used to estimate whether certain masses present on ToF-SIMS spectra correspond to actual bonds in the recrystallized material, not induced by the measurement. While no bonds with Ga and As were detectable, this model does not exclude the possibility of preferential binding between with In.	DLTS , ToF-SIMS , ion implantation , THz antennas	en	16202.0
691	La question de l'histoire chez Husserl	This thesis is concerned with Husserl’s historical understanding of phenomenology in his last work, The Crisis of European Sciences and Transcendental Phenomenology (1937). In chapter 1, we examine David Carr’s account of the historical turn of Husserlian phenomenology. The idea of the historical turn of phenomenology is inaccurate. The transcendental theory of history represents the necessary outcome of Husserl’s philosophy. In chapter 2, we examine the manner by which Husserlian phenomenology is supposed to re-establish European cultural identity. Husserl, through his criticism of the objectivistic prejudice of modern science, claims that phenomenology represents the teleological accomplishment of philosophy. We finally examine Husserl’s attempt to reunite the Modern schism between thought and action. We conclude that Husserl’s main ethical principle, the notion of authenticity, is in itself insufficient to explain the implications of responsibility.

692	Étude de l’impact de la prise de médicaments dans le traitement de l’arthrite juvénile sur les événements néfastes à l’accouchement chez la mère et son bébé	Most women diagnosed with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) continue to suffer from arthritis in adulthood. Some of the drugs used to treat arthritis such as corticosteroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are not recommended during pregnancy. The objective of this thesis is to estimate the impact of these drugs on adverse birth outcomes in women previously diagnosed with JIA and their baby. Administrative data on drug prescriptions and hospitalizations in a cohort of 1756 women with a history of JIA were used to determine individual histories of drug use for the treatment of arthritis during pregnancy and during the year leading to the pregnancy. Two sub-cohorts of women who suffered from JIA were created : one corresponding to the pregnancy and the other to the pregnancy and the year leading to the pregnancy. The events of interest were : congenital anomalies, neonatal adverse outcomes, maternal adverse outcomes and small for gestational age babies. Proportions of the events ranged between 11,52% and 37,08%. Drugs were modelled in terms of use or duration of use during each of the study periods. Logistic regression models were fitted to measure the association between drugs and each of the events, adjusting for the following potential confounding variables : hypertension before pregnancy, maternal age and graduating from high school. The consumption of corticosteroids was associated with a statistically significant increased risk of congenital anomalies but had no impact on the other adverse events. No statistically significant associations were observed between consumption of NSAIDs and the adverse events of interest.

693	Analyse et représentation de la variation terminologique et de la multidimentionalité dans un thésaurus : le cas du métalangage de la terminologie	This thesis proposes a model to represent theoretical and practical concepts of terminology as well as their terminological relationships in the form of a thesaurus. According to the ISO 25964-1:2011 standard, “a thesaurus is a controlled and structured vocabulary in which concepts are represented by terms that have been previously arranged in order to show explicitly the relations among concepts (…)”. Our objective is to create a pedagogical tool that is grounded in a theoretical reflection about different theoretical perspectives within this discipline. The issues associated with the classification of concepts in certain fields of knowledge (especially those with different perspectives) require further study in the field of terminology and information science, and in the literature relating to thesauri. Indeed, how does one describe concepts that are subject to theoretical dissent and different schools of thought? How can the different relationships between theoretical concepts and practical applications of a discipline be classified? To these questions is added the additional challenge of reflecting these difficulties in a thesaurus. Our first step consists in delimiting and organizing the main concepts of the field. Then, by means of a corpus containing different publications associated with different approaches in terminology, we study the linguistic realizations of those concepts and their relationships in context, with the objective of describing, classifying and defining them. We then encode this data using thesaurus management software that respects the relevant ISO standards. Finally, we produce visualizations of this data to make it more user friendly and understandable. To conclude, we present the fundamental characteristics of the Thésaurus de la terminologie. We have analyzed and presented a sample of 45 concepts and their related terms. Different phenomena related to these descriptors, such as multidimensionality, conceptual variation and denominative variation, are also represented in our thesaurus.	terminologie , thésaurus , Terminology , conceptual variation , multidimensionality , denominative variation , thesaurus , knowledge classification , theoretical dissensions	en	16188.0
694	La manipulation idéologique dans l’édition et deux traductions de la Description de l’Afrique de Hassan El Wazzan / Jean-Léon l’Africain	In Rome in 1526, Hassan Al-Wazzan / Ioannes Leo Africanus completed the writing of the Libro della Cosmographia Dell’Africa, a major work of the Renaissance which was seen in Europe as one of the main sources of knowledge about the African continent. In 1550, a Venetian scholar named Giovanni Batista Ramusio published an Italian version of Leo’s work in a collection of travel narratives. This edition entitled Descrizione dell’Africa (Description of Africa), however, differs considerably from Leo’s original manuscript. Ramusio made numerous changes so as to produce a text that would meet European expectations and foster an image of the Muslim world that corresponded with the preconceptions of the Christian West. This version has served as the source text for many of the translations that followed. The first French translation was by Jean Temporal in 1556, a publisher and printer based in Lyon.  A second translation was first published in 1956 and then reissued in 1980. This version by Alexis Épaulard is partly based on Leo’s original manuscript, but mainly on Ramusio’s version. This thesis compares the two French translations with Ramusio’s text. The thesis shows that the two French translators heavily intervened in the translated text in order to serve colonialist and expansionist goals. This research highlights the translators’ position as well as the ideologies conveyed by their interventions. The analysis is done at the text and the paratext levels. It also focuses on the historical, political, and ideological context surrounding these translations. Particular attention is paid to lexical choices, allusions and the strategies used by the translators and editors. The works by Maria Tymoczko on translation and political engagement, as well as the texts of Edward Said on orientalism and postcolonial studies, provide the theoretical framework for this research. The analysis shows that the French translations are tinged with a Eurocentric ideology which aims to reinforce hegemonic ambitions in Africa.

695	A study of culture specific items and translation strategies in Bahram Beyza'i’s play “Marionettes”	The focus of this research project is to provide an analysis of the Persian literary play by Bahrām Beyzā'ī “Aroosak-ha” in 1963 and its English translation (Marionettes) in 1989 to compare and contrast the culture specific items (CSI) and translation strategies in the 20th century. The relevant problematic forms of the cultural differences will be investigated and the procedures suggested by Newmark (1988) will be examined to see how they fit in the translation of cultural differences from Persian to English. The play was translated by a team of translators, Sujata G.Bhatt, Jacquelin Hoats, Imran A. Nyazee and Kamiar K. Oskouee. (Parvin Loloi and Glyn Pursglove, 2002:66) Beyzā'ī’s plays are based on Iranian traditions and folklore. His outlook is philosophical, “wrapped in a cloak of complex similes to the extent that many of the characters in his work wander between mythology and historical or social symbols.” (M.R. Ghanoonparvar, John Green 1989, p.xxii) The marionettes characters are modeled from traditional Iranian puppet shows. The classification of cultural elements by Newmark (1988) is as follows: “Ecology, material culture, social culture, organization, customs, ideas, gestures and habits” (Newmark 1988:95). A focus on the suggested procedures to translate CSI and translation strategies by Newmark will also be employed. These procedures include: “Literal translation, transference, cultural equivalent, neutralization, functional equivalent, descriptive equivalent, synonymy, throughtranslation, shift or transpositions, modulation, recognized translation, translation label, compensation, componential analysis, reduction and expansion, paraphrase, couplets, notes, additions, glosses” (Newmark 1988:81-93) to see if the suggested procedures are in fact applicable in the translation of CSIs from Persian to English and what are the most frequently used by translators.

696	Development of new scenario decomposition techniques for linear and nonlinear stochastic programming	In the literature of optimization problems under uncertainty a common approach of dealing with two- and multi-stage problems is to use scenario analysis. To do so, the uncertainty of some data in the problem is modeled by stage specific random vectors with finite supports. Each realization is called a scenario. By using scenarios, it is possible to study smaller versions (subproblems) of the underlying problem. As a scenario decomposition technique, the progressive hedging algorithm is one of the most popular methods in multi-stage stochastic programming problems. In spite of full decomposition over scenarios, progressive hedging efficiency is greatly sensitive to some practical aspects, such as the choice of the penalty parameter and handling the quadratic term in the augmented Lagrangian objective function. For the choice of the penalty parameter, we review some of the popular methods, and design a novel adaptive strategy that aims to better follow the algorithm process. Numerical experiments on linear multistage stochastic test problems suggest that most of the existing techniques may exhibit premature convergence to a sub-optimal solution or converge to the optimal solution, but at a very slow rate. In contrast, the new strategy appears to be robust and efficient, converging to optimality in all our experiments and being the fastest in most of them. For the question of handling the quadratic term, we review some existing techniques and we suggest to replace the quadratic term with a linear one. Although this method has yet to be tested, we have the intuition that it will reduce some numerical and theoretical difficulties of progressive hedging in linear problems.

697	The impossible anamesis. Memory versus history in Hubert Aquin’s « Blackout »	"Soon after joining the Canadian Confederation in 1867, the province of Quebec adopted the phrase « Je me souviens » (""As I recall"") as its ""national"" motto, although many Québécois do not remember today what they were supposed to memorize, as collective subject, when their government voted this motion. My thesis is that contrary to other countries which have a strong sense of history based on a secular tradition, this process was more complicated in Quebec — as if a collective memory loss lied at the heart of it's history. Through a rereading of Hubert Aquin's cult novel, Trou de mémoire (in its English translation Blackout), first published in 1968, I try to illustrate this paradox and to emphasize the heuristic functions of memory blanks, gaps and lapses in certain postmodern narratives, after the historical breakdown of ""the great narratives"" (Lyotard). In this perspective, the example of Quebec, through the voice of one of its more gifted yet controversial novelist, can be seen as emblematic of what happens when the mnemonic impossibility of rewriting history opens up new possibilities for writing fiction."

698	Pérennité du dilettantisme néo-vaguien. Rémanence et filiations des masculinités oisives dans le cinéma français	As the cinematic installment of a social revolution, the French New Wave was able to embody the changes that disrupted european societies during the early sixties. From sexual emancipation to its interest for a troubled and often rebellious youth, it is safe to say that the New Wave became the cinematic mirror of a liberation that ushered Europeans into a new era. If a new conception of cinema is usually enough to give a prominent place to the movement in film history, its trailblazing directors (Truffaut, Godard among others) also contributed to forge a new figure of male heroism in the French cinematographic landscape. Taking its distances from the blandness of academism or the trademark melancholy of poetic realism’s heroes that preceded it, the New Wave conception of heroism breathed lightness, idleness and carelessness to characters whose actors’ Jean-Pierre Léaud and Jean-Paul Belmondo (for example) arguably constituted the epitome. This masters thesis will mainly aim to examine how this singular breed of heroism seems to have tainted the voices of contemporary French cinema who have offered a vast array of reinterpretations (from pastiche to reappropriation) and remodelings of a similar kind. As a movement whose influence do not seem to have dried up – its legacy is still claimed by many filmmakers – and that goes beyond the sphere of cinema, we will primarily aspire to account for the sustainability of the New Wave through the examination of the body of work of new generations that have perpetuated its legacy. Thus, this thesis will try to establish a model definiton of the contemporary French cinema hero who does not seem so far removed from the one advocated in the sixties by French New Wave pioneers.

699	Paléoécologie d’une tourbière à pergélisol en dégradation du sud des Territoires du Nord-Ouest : implications pour le cycle du carbone	Peatlands have contributed to cool the Earth's climate during the Holocene by accumulating a large carbon pool. In the Canadian boreal forest, perennially frozen soils (permafrost soils) are abundant and they are located mainly in peatlands where they form elevated plateaus. Thawing permafrost caused by atmospheric warming or other disturbances lead to the collapse of plateaus and soil saturation, impacting vegetation cover and carbon cycling. Models suggest that northern latitudes will be the most severely affected by global warming as we are already observing a decline in permafrost cover. It is important to understand how permafrost thaw affects the peatland carbon sink function as feedbacks on the climate are possible if a large amount of greenhouse gas is emitted or sequestered. I use a chronosequence representing the time since permafrost in a Northwest Territories peatland to understand the factors influencing aggradation and degradation of permafrost in peatlands and to evaluate the effect of thawing on the carbon accumulation and preservation. The carbon accumulation rates associated with the presence of permafrost in the past and present are slow, and the peat is less decomposed in areas that have been affected by permafrost longer. In sum, permafrost reduces surface carbon accumulation but allows for better preservation of the carbon already accumulated.

700	Boris Vian adaptateur de la légende arthurienne : étude comparée de la pièce de théâtre et de l'opéra Le Chevalier de Neige	This masters thesis questions Boris Vian's unknown role of adapter. In 1953, he wrote a play – Le Chevalier de Neige – based on Arthurian literature, at the request of the organizers of Le Festival dramatique de Caen. This play later became an opera, performed in Nancy in 1957. In spite of the success of both shows, the memory of Le Chevalier de Neige did not last. Only the texts and music scores remain because none of the performances have been recorded.  Thus, the main objective of this dissertation is to highlight the adapting and rewriting process of this well known author of the XXth century, mostly famous for his novels and songs, who furthermore dedicated his last years to a total work combining text, music and staging. A few questions need to be asked. What can be known of the elaboration of Le Chevalier de Neige? What is the importance of the medieval and contemporary intertext in both rewritings? And what are the adaptation processes implemented in each of these texts, the play and the opera? This thesis attemps to answer all of these questions, so as to discover the importance as well as the interest of Le Chevalier de Neige in Boris Vian's literary life.

701	Les tableaux homonymiques, principe d’unité du Cornet à dés de Max Jacob	This dissertation treats the structure of Le Cornet à dés (1917), a collection of prose poems written by Max Jacob. Upon reading this collection, one notices that things and events referring to the different definitions of the word “tableau” are repeatedly employed : paintings, visual descriptions, window and door frames, elders (vieux tableaux), living pictures (tableaux vivants), theater scenes and also blackboards. This dissertation, divided into three chapters, starts by exploring how these homonyms are employed as paintings in the poems. In-between fixity and movement, the descriptions and the narrations bring literature closer to pictorial art. This contributes to the aesthetic of doubt found in Max Jacob’s written work. The second chapter analyzes different kinds of repetitions and the way they build links between the poems. By employing the theories of movement and repetition, this dissertation demonstrates how the various motifs, similarly to a pair of dice, form different combinations from one poem to another. Inspired by the cubist painters who simultaneously show all the angles of an object, Jacob thoroughly examines the word “tableau”. In the last chapter, it becomes evident that the juxtaposition of the poems gives access to additional significance: certain arbitrary elements, such as obscure titles, suddenly make sense. A reflection on the act of reading concludes this dissertation, since the numerous repetitions are stored in the reader’s memory. This work falls within the field of collection studies and mainly relies on poetry analysis.

702	La literatura de la neo-violencia en Colombia : manifestaciones thanáticas en el siglo XXI	This research is based on the assumption that the relationship between the Colombian society and violence is so constant and deep that the new 21st century literature is the result of this phenomenon. Despite the fact that previous academic research on violence and literature in Colombia has largely addressed the topic, this same research has usually approached “violence” as a disruptive phenomenon having an impact on established social orders. That is the case of previous analysis addressing either the 1950s and 1960s’ La Violencia-based literature or the 1980s and 1990s’ drug trafficking literature. However, in the literature of the new generation of writers, violence is not necessarily practiced by traditionally violent actors who intentionally put social order at risk. This social order is in fact essentially violent, which turns violence into a symbolic, normalized, deeply rooted matter in society. Thus, how has “traditional” violence transformed into today’s neoviolence? Which are its attributes?  Furthermore, how does literature tell this new violence’s story? The purpose of this research is to identify these new forms of violence made evident in the literature of the first decade of the 21st century that has been produced, in turn, by writers born between the 1970s and the 1980s. The methodology, based on the analysis of novels and short stories by Colombian writers from this period, seeks to establish how overexposure to endemic violence has resulted in new forms of seeing, perceiving, feeling and recounting violence beyond the accurate description of violent facts.

703	Le retour en communauté des détenus âgés : entre marginalisation et insertion, des expériences plurielles	Nowadays in Canada, one out of five prisoners under federal jurisdiction is aged 50 and over, representing a 101% increase since the early 2000s. While everything seems to indicate that an increasing number of seniors will be released in the coming years, only a few studies have focused on life after prison. This thesis aims to understand their reentry process and to highlight the meaning they give to their experience. Our semi-structured interviews focused on the lived experiences of seventeen senior men, all of whom had served their sentence in Quebec detention centers. We found that the reentry of senior prisoners is marked by multiple difficulties, often intensified by their age, penal status and the institutional environment they evolved in. However, the reentry is experienced differently depending on whether the familial solidarity has allowed them to reach a gratifying social status and enables them to exist.

704	Représentations identitaires chez un homme ayant purgé une longue peine : aspects stables et mobiles	Numerous studies have focused on the issues of abandonment of crime and the desistance process that precedes it. While the approaches retained are diversified, they all point to the social as well as personal changes the process implies. This thesis focuses on the  identity changes of an individual who received a long prison sentence, and who later obtained a full parole. The main objective of this thesis is to understand what are the permanent aspects of identity and those that are modifiable at work in the changing path of a man sentenced for murder and has obtained full parole.  The life approach, and in a phenomenological perspective, was used to achieve the objectives of this research. A man sentenced to a life prison and who later obtained his total release was met for ten in-depth interviews each lasting between an hour and an hour and a half. Such a large number of semi-structured type interviews allowed us to deepen our understanding. The results suggest that certain representations of identity remain stable over time while others change over the life course. Indeed, from the analysis of the individual's life story two stable representations emerged that permanently mark his identity during his life trajectory, and four modifiable, which developed during his detention. The results also show that stable representations appear to be involved in both the criminogenic process and during his desistance.

705	Archivage de répétitions et médiations du spectacle vivant. Le cas du projet spectacle en ligne(s)	The article introduces the outcomes of the research program Spectacle en ligne(s), from which it reflects on the change of nature of the natively digital archive and of its cultural status. The creation of an annotated video archive of the rehearsals of two live performances opened an exploration of the mediations of archive in cultural contexts. Our concept of mediation stands here in-between institutional innovation and the scientific issues linked to the digital archive. During the project, we produced several experimentations, prototyping archive editorialisations. Based on those, the article states the idea that natively digital archive can reach the status of cultural object only through its usages, which generate intermediary forms specific to the editorialisations of the archive.

706	Une étude sur les déterminants biologiques, psychologiques et du travail de l'épuisement professionnel	This study aims at identifying factors associated with salivary cortisol secretion and burnout. Several objectives are listed below. First, it aims to better understand the contribution of the work conditions (skill utilization, decision authority, psychological demands, physical demands, irregular schedule, number of working hours, social support from colleagues and supervisors, job insecurity) on salivary cortisol secretion as well as the moderating role of personality traits (extraversion, agreeableness, neuroticism, consciousness, openness, self-esteem, control center) on the relationship between work conditions and salivary cortisol. This thesis also aims to establish the contribution of work conditions on burnout and the moderating role of personality traits on the relationship between the work conditions and burnout. Finally, this thesis aims to verify whether salivary cortisol plays a mediating role in the relationship between work conditions and burnout as well as identify the effects of moderated mediations of the personality traits on the relationship between work conditions and salivary cortisol.  The objectives of this study address some of the limitations identified in previous research, mainly the integration of biological, psychological determinants and work conditions in understanding burnout. We also propose a conceptual model that tries to identify how these different stressors can cause a salivary cortisol secretion dysregulation and evaluate if this dysregulation is associated with burnout. Finally, this conceptual model seeks to explain how personality traits can influence how these variables are interconnected, that is whether personality plays a moderating role. This model stems from four specific theories, including Selye’s (1936) biological perspective. Selyes’s work is interested in the physiological response of an organism subjected to a stressor. When faced with a threat, the body is in constant effort to maintain its balance (homeostasis) and tolerates very few changes to this balance. If excessive changes are induced, a stress response is activated to ensure maintenance of body base balance. Secondly, the conceptual model is based on Lazarus and Folkman model (1984), which postulates that the stress response depends mainly on the evaluation that individuals make of the stressful situation. Thirdly, it is also based on Pearlin model (1999), which postulates that individuals exposed to the same stressors are not necessarily affected in the same way. Finally, the conceptual model of this thesis is based on Marchand model (2004), which postulates that the individuals reactions depend on the decoding actors do regarding the constraints and the resources that affect them.  Various hypotheses therefore emerge from this theoretical conceptualisation. The first is that work conditions interact directly with salivary cortisol. The second is that the work conditions directly contribute to burnout. The third is that salivary cortisol mediates the relationship between work conditions and burnout. The fourth is that the relationship between work conditions and salivary cortisol is moderated by personality traits. The fifth is that the relationship between work conditions, salivary cortisol and burnout is moderated by personality traits. Multilevel regression models and causal path analyses were conducted on a sample of Canadian workers from SALVEO study. The results are presented as three articles submitted for publication, which are chapters 4-6 of this thesis. Overall, the integrative biopsychosocial model proposed as part of this doctoral thesis sheds light on the complexity of burnout which is a biological, organizational and individual explanations. This finding allows us to offer a broader and multi-understanding as well as contributing to the research on an issue of concern for organizations, society and workers. Indeed, the inclusion of personality traits and secretion of salivary cortisol in the study of burnout ensures an integrated and more objective analysis. This thesis concludes on the implications of these findings for research, and the benefits it brings to the workplace.

707	Soutenir l'autodétermination des personnes présentant une déficience intellectuelle : contribution de la théorie de l'autodétermination	Since the 1980s, the development of self-determination has become a priority in the intellectual disability (ID) intervention domain. Socialization agents (e.g., educators, social workers, teachers, parents) have a crucial role in its promotion through the support they offer and the learning they promote. The way they communicate and the type of relationship they establish with the person with an ID influence its development. Yet, few studies have evaluated what are the best ways to communicate and interact in order to promote self-determination in people with an ID. Anchored in self-determination theory (SDT), the present thesis focuses on evaluating the effects of a specific type of support, autonomy support (AS, or self-determination support; a way to communicate and interact that supports the need for self-determination), on the self-determination and on the behavioral, motivational and emotional benefits of people with a mild intellectual disabilities (MID), in a learning context.  Two papers will be presented in this thesis.  The first study, theoretical in nature, aims at better understanding and clarifying this concept in the light of functional self-determination theory (fSDT) and self-determination theory (SDT). Interventions studies to promote self-determination in SDT and fSDT will also be presented. Secondly, SDT and fSDT will be compared and contrasted with one another in order to elucidate their differences, similarities and complementarities, both in theory and practice. Finally, AS studied within SDT, is proposed as a promising intervention, in addition to fSDTs’ interventions, to foster self-determination as well as behavioral, motivational and emotional benefits in this population.  The second study aims at evaluating this specific proposal. Through an experimental study, we assessed whether AS can help satisfy the need for autonomy/self-determination in people with  mild intellectual disabilities (MID) and facilitate the internalization of the task value, engagement in the task as well as decrease the degree of anxiety when participants are asked to learn a new problem-solving task, an important yet tedious activity. This study compared the effects of a task carried out with or without autonomy support (experimental and control condition, respectively). Participants (N = 51) of the study all had a MID and were recruited in a “Centre de réadaptation en déficience intellectuelle et troubles envahissants du développement” in the Montreal area, in Quebec (Canada). Results showed that compared to the control condition, autonomy support increased participants’ self-determination, internalization of the task value and engagement while it decreased their anxiety level.  The meaning of these results as well as their potential implications for research and interventions are discussed.

708	Le sous titrage en français des séries télévisées américaines : normes linguistiques et pratiques professionnelles	American television series are such an integral aspect of popular culture that different audiovisual translations into French exist in various parts of the world. Not only are these series dubbed to be broadcast on television, they may be subtitled up to three times, usually in this order: by fans online; in Quebec for North American DVD sales; and in France for European DVD sales. While all subtitling endeavours face the same constraints, namely linguistic (those of the French language) and technical (for airing on the small screen), each deals with the original dialogue in its own fashion. We will start by identifying the practices of both professional and amateur translators. Next, we will analyze a number of translations and compare them to a corpus of similar television series originally produced in France or French Quebec to establish the cultural and linguistic standards applied by different translators to determine what is known as “Canadian French.” This thesis was written with a view to expanding descriptive and sociological studies. We will describe herein the professional reality of audiovisual translators, as well as the influence of fansubbers on not only professional translation practice, but also on new translation methods to train the next generation of translators. By studying several translations of the same work, we can demonstrate that the different varieties of French cannot, on account of the relatively few purely linguistic differences that exist, justify the proliferation of the number of subtitled versions available.

709	Algorithmique et complexité des systèmes à compteurs	One fundamental aspect of computer systems, and in particular of critical systems, is the ability to run simultaneously many processes sharing resources. Such concurrent systems only work correctly when their behaviours are independent of any execution ordering. For this reason, it is particularly difficult to ensure the correctness of concurrent systems.  In this thesis, we study formal verification, an algorithmic approach to the verification of concurrent systems based on mathematical modeling. We consider two of the most prominent models, Petri nets and vector addition systems, and their usual verification problems considered in the literature.  We show that the reachability problem for vector addition systems (with states) restricted to two counters is PSPACE-complete, that is, it is complete for the class of problems solvable with a polynomial amount of memory. Hence, we establish the precise computational complexity of this problem, left open for more than thirty years.  We develop a new approach to the coverability problem for Petri nets which is primarily based on applying forward coverability in continuous Petri nets as a pruning criterion inside a backward coverability framework. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by implementing it in a tool named QCover.  We complement these results with a study of well-structured transition systems which form a general abstraction of vector addition systems and Petri nets. We consider infinitely branching well-structured transition systems, a class that includes Petri nets with special transitions that may consume or produce arbitrarily many tokens. We develop mathematical tools in order to study these systems and we delineate the decidability frontier for the termination, boundedness, maintainability and coverability problems.	formal verification , computational complexity , algorithmics , Petri nets , vector addition systems , well-structured transition systems , reachability problem , coverability problem , infinite branching	en	16025.0
710	Réception de l’Histoire des colonies grecques dans la littérature coloniale des XVIIe-XVIIIe siècles	The purpose of this thesis was to bring a new point of view on the influences of European colonisalism during the XVIIth and XVIIIth centuries. Since my work on the colonies of the Greek city of Corinth during the archaic period, my objective was to go more thoroughly on the perception of colonies, through time and space. Many historians wrote on ancient influences at specific periods (Chantal Grell and the vision of Alexander the Great during the reign of Louis the XIVth, Carl Richard on the American perception of the Classics during the Revolution,…). Nevertheless, no long-term reflection was ever made about the role of ancient history and the vision of colonialism during modern area. Beside, regarding the rarity of the sources, I had to broaden the scope of my researches and included authors who used the Greek sources as an illustration of contemporary problems. During this period influenced by the apogee and the fall of the first European empires in North America, the ancient history and the history of colonizations got better known thanks to the works of a few historiogriaphs. If comparisons to ancient history were mainly propaganda or simple topos (as were the comparisons of Louis the XIVth to Alexander the Great), they were used in large-scaled polemics and rhetoric disputes. The choice of the ancient Greek history was logic, since many authors, from the first settlers to American founding fathers focused on the economic and commercial aspects of European colonies. Others colonizations, such as the Spanish colonies during the XVIth century, or the Victorian British empire in India, were inspired by Latin terminology, similar to the roman Imperium (the Spanish Monarchia Universalis).  The Article of Krishan Kumar remains one of the best references on the subject. The perception of Greek colonies during the XVIIth and XVIIIth centuries resulted from an attempt of defining colonialism as general phenomenon. It was seen as a way of situating European nations in a larger context, from the very origins of the West. As Europe increased its power on the whole world, many writers insisted on the Ancient thalassocracies, that spreaded Greek culture to the entire Mediterranean.That culture was perceived as the origin of occidental philosophy and way of live. Even the great ancient wars, as the Peloponnesian war, were percieved as omens of the wars between France and England during the whole XVIIIth century.

711	Récits du vieillir « actif » et de la citoyenneté au quotidien : l’expérience des femmes aînées au Québec	Taken as a policy framework, active aging ranks high on most supranational bodies’ agenda. The new political economy of aging portrays “active” citizenship amongst seniors as a key challenge for the years to come. Our research focuses on, first, elderly women’s everyday ‘active’ practices, their meaning and purpose, in the context of Quebec’s active aging policy framework; and second, their day-to-day practical citizenship experiences. Informed by discourse analysis and a narrative approach, the life stories of women 60 to 70 years of age allowed for the identification of a plethora of distinctive old age activity figures.      More specifically, four activity figures were identified by which respondents materialize their routine active practices, namely: (1) paid work; (2) voluntary and civic engagement; (3) physical activity; and (4) caregiving. Set against Quebec’s active aging policy framework, these patterns and set of practices that underpin them are clearly in tune with government’s dominant perspectives. Respondents’ narratives also show that active aging connotes a range of ‘ordinary’ activities of daily living, accomplished within people’s private worlds and places of proximity. Despite nuances, tensions and opposition found in dominant public discourse, as well as in active aging practices, a form of counter-discourse does not emerge from respondents’ narratives. To be active is normally the antithesis of immobility and dependence. Thus, to see oneself as active in old age draws on normative, positive assumptions about old age quite difficult to refute; nevertheless, discourses also raise identity and relational issues. In this respect, social inclusion issues cut across all active aging practices described by respondents. Moreover, a range of individual aims and quests underpin activity pattern.  Such quests express respondents’ subjective interactions with their social environment; including their actions’ meaning and sense of social inclusiveness in old age. A first quest relates to personal identity and social integration to the world; a second one concerns giving; a third centers on the search for authenticity; whereas the fourth one is connected to a desire for freedom. It is through the objectivising of active practices and related existential pursuits that elderly woman recognize themselves as active citizens, rooted in the community, and variously contributing to society. Accordingly, ‘active’ citizenship experiences are articulated in a dialogic manner between the dimensions of ‘doing’, ‘active’ social practices, and ‘being’ in relation to others, within a context of interdependence. A proposed typology allows for the modeling of four ‘active’ citizenship figures. Overall, despite the role played by power relations and social inequality in structuring aging experiences, in everyday life ‘old age citizenship’ appears as a relational process, embedded in a set of social relations and practices involving individuals, families and communities, whereby elderly women are able to express a sense of agency within their social world.	discours , Active aging , elderly women , citizenship , discourse , activity	en	16013.0
712	Faulkner revisited : narrating property, race, gender and history in William Faulkner's Go Down, Moses, Toni Morrison's Song of Solomon and Gloria Naylor's Mama Day	My thesis explores the formation of the subject in the novels of Faulkner’s Go Down, Moses, Toni Morrison’s Song of Solomon, and Gloria Naylor’s Mama Day. I attach the concept of property in terms of how male protagonists are obsessed with materialistic ownership and with the subordination of women who, as properties, consolidate their manhood. The three novelists despite their racial, gendered, and literary differences share the view that identity and truth are mere social and cultural constructs. I incorporate the work of Judith Butler and other poststructuralist figures, who see identity as a matter of performance rather than a natural entity.  My thesis explores the theme of freedom, which I attached to the ways characters use their bodies either to confine or to emancipate themselves from the restricting world of race, class, and gender. The three novelists deconstruct any system of belief that promulgates the objectivity of truth in historical documents. History in the three novels, as with the protagonists, perception of identity, remains a social construct laden with distortions to serve particular political or ideological agendas. My thesis gives voice to African American female characters who are associated with love and racial and gender resistance. They become the reservoirs of the African American legacy in terms of their association with the oral and intuitionist mode of knowing, which subverts the male characters’ obsession with property and with the mainstream empiricist world. In this dissertation, I use the concept of hybridity as a literary and theoretical devise that African-American writers employ. In effect, I embark on the postcolonial studies of Henry Louise Gates, Paul Gilroy, W. E. B Du Bois, James Clifford, and Arjun Appadurai in order to reflect upon the fluidity of Morrison’s and Naylor’s works. I show how these two novelists subvert Faulkner’s essentialist perception of truth, and of racial and gendered identity. They associate the myth of the Flying African with the notion of hybridity by making their male protagonists criss-cross Northern and Southern regions.  I refer to Mae Gwendolyn  Henderson’s article on “Speaking in Tongues” in my analysis of how Naylor subverts the patriarchal text of both Faulkner and Morrison in embarking on a more feminine version of the flying African, which she relates to an ex-slave, Sapphira Wade, a volatile female character who resists fixed claim over her story and identity. In dealing with the concept of hybridity, I show that Naylor rewrites both authors’ South by making Willow Springs a more fluid space, an assumption that unsettles the scores of critics who associate the island with authenticity and exclusive rootedness.

713	Improving photofermentative hydrogen production through metabolic engineering and DOE (Design of Experiments)	Currently, renewable and environmentally friendly biofuels are under intensive study due to increasing health concerns and diminishing fossil fuels. H2 is one of the most promising candidates due to its unique characteristics, such as a high energy density and low to non-existent generation of pollutants. One attractive way to produce H2 is through photosynthetic bacteria which can capture light energy to drive H2 production with their nitrogenase system. The major aim of this study was to improve H2 yield of the purple non-sulfur photosynthetic bacteria using a combination of metabolic engineering and design of experiments.       One hypothesis was that H2 yield could be improved by redirection of Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle flux to the nitrogenase system which catalyzes the reduction of protons to H2. Thus, a PRK, phosphoribulose kinase, knock out mutant of Rhodobacter capsulatus JP91 was created. Analysis of growth with different carbon sources showed that this mutant could only grow in acetate medium without, however, producing any H2. A spontaneous mutant, YL1, was recovered which retained the original cbbP (encoding PRK) mutation, but which had gained the ability to grow on glucose and produce H2.  A study of H2 production under different illumination levels showed that the yield of YL1 was 20-40% greater than the wild type JP91 strain.  However, there was no appreciable improvement of the H2 production rate. A kinetic study showed that growth and hydrogen production are strongly linked with electrons from glucose being mostly directed to H2 production and biomass formation. Under low to intermediate light intensities, the production of organic acids was significant, suggesting further improvement of H2 yield is possible by process optimization.       In a related series of experiments, another spontaneous mutant, YL2, which has a similar phenotype to YL1, was tested for growth in ammonium-containing media. The results showed that YL2 could only grow with acetate as carbon source, again, without producing any H2. Prolonged incubation in media not supporting growth of YL2 enabled the isolation of two interesting secondary spontaneous mutants, YL3 and YL4. Western blot analysis showed that both strains had constitutive nitrogenase expression under a range of ammonium concentrations. The genomes of YL2, YL3 and YL4 were sequenced in order to find the mutations responsible for this phenomenon. Interestingly, mutations of nifA1 and nifA2 were found in both YL3 and YL4. It is likely that a conformational change of NifA alters the protein-protein interaction between NifA and PII proteins (such as GlnB or GlnK), enabling it to escape regulation by ammonium and thus to be capable of activating nitrogenase transcription in the presence of ammonium. It is not clear how the synthesized nitrogenase is able to maintain its activity since in theory it should also be subject to posttranslational regulation by ammonium. Further evidence could be obtained by studying the transcriptome of YL3 and YL4. An initial study of H2 production by YL3 and YL4 showed that they are capable of much greater hydrogen production than JP91 in ammonium medium, which opens the door for future studies with these strains using ammonium-containing wastes as substrates.      Finally, the biological reformation of ethanol to H2 with the photosynthetic bacterium, Rhodopseudomonas palustris CGA009 was examined. Ethanol production with microbial fermentation using renewable resources has been treated as a mature technique. However, most studies of the reformation of ethanol to H2 have focused on chemical steam reforming, which usually requires a high energy input and results in toxic gas emission. Thus biological reformation of ethanol to H2 with photosynthetic bacteria, which can capture light to meet the energy requirement of this reaction, seems to be more promising. A previous study had demonstrated hydrogen production from ethanol, however, the yield or the duration of this reaction were not examined. A RSM (response surface methodology) analysis was carried out in which three key factors, light intensity, ethanol and glutamate concentrations were varied.  Our results showed that nearly 2 moles of H2 could be obtained from one mole of ethanol, 33% of what is theoretically possible.

714	Assessing microvascular function with breathing maneuvers : an oxygenation-sensitive CMR study	This project encompasses five studies, which focus on developing a new cardiovascular diagnostic approach for assessing myocardial oxygenation and microvascular function. In combination with oxygenation-sensitive cardiovascular magnetic resonance (OS-CMR) imaging, breathing maneuvers and altered arterial blood gases can be used as a non-invasive method for inducing a vasoactive response to test the oxygenation reserve, a key measurement in vascular function.  The number of prescribed cardiac diagnostic tests and interventions is rapidly growing. In particular, imaging and other non-invasive tests are frequently performed prior to invasive procedures. One of the most common uses of cardiac imaging is for the diagnosis of significant coronary artery stenosis, a critical cost factor in today’s health care system.  Non-invasive imaging techniques provide the most reliable information for the presence and location of perfusion or oxygenation deficits in patients with symptoms suggestive of myocardial ischemia, yet many current techniques suffer from the need for radiation, contrast agents or tracers, and pharmacological or physical stress protocols. CMR imaging can identify significant coronary artery stenosis without radiation and new trends in CMR research aim to develop diagnostic techniques that do not require any pharmacological stressors or contrast agents.  For this project, the primary aim was to develop and test a new diagnostic technique to assess coronary vascular function using OS-CMR in combination with breathing maneuvers as the vasoactive stimulus. Secondary aims then used OS-CMR to assess myocardial oxygenation and the coronary response in the presence of altered arterial blood gases.  An animal model was used to validate the vascular response to breathing maneuvers before translating the technique to human subjects into both healthy volunteers, and a patient population with cardiac disease.    In the animal models, breathing maneuvers could induce a significant change in invasively measured coronary blood flow and it was demonstrated that in the presence of a haemodynamically significant coronary stenosis, OS-CMR could detect a myocardial oxygen deficit. This technique was then applied in a human model, with healthy participants. In a direct comparison to the infusion of the coronary vasodilator adenosine, which is considered a standard agent for inducing vasodilation in cardiac imaging, breathing maneuvers induced a stronger response in oxygenation of healthy myocardium. The final study then implemented the breathing maneuvers in a patient population with coronary artery disease; in which myocardium compromised by a coronary stenosis had a compromised oxygenation response. Furthermore, the observed effects of arterial blood gases on myocardial oxygenation were assessed.  This demonstrated that the coronary response to breath-hold stimuli is attenuated during hyperoxia, and this causes an overall reduction in coronary blood flow, and consequently an oxygenation deficit in a coronary stenosis animal model when supplemental oxygen is provided.  In conclusion, this work has improved our understanding of potential new diagnostic techniques for cardiovascular imaging. In particular, it demonstrated that combining breathing maneuvers with oxygenation-sensitive CMR can provide a non-invasive and cost-effective method for assessing global and regional coronary vascular function.

715	"Traitement de la maladie du greffon contre l’hôte chronique par la photophérèse extra corporelle au TH9402 : m
écanisme de régulation de la maladie du greffon contre  l’hôte chronique par les cellules T régulatrices"	Graft versus host disease (GVHD) is the primary cause of mortality and morbidity following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Many patients remain refractory to current treatments, emphasizing the need to develop new therapeutic strategies. In the present study, we have used a novel therapeutic agent, TH9402, and shown that once activated by visible light (514 nm), this photosensitizer becomes specifically cytotoxic toward activated T cells while preserving resting T cells and regulatory T cells (Tregs). Preserved Tregs can display anti GVHD activity through IL-10 and CTLA-4 dependent mechanisms. Furthermore, CTLA-4 signaling was associated with an increased Treg population. This increase resulted from FOXP3 induction in CD4+CD25- cells and not selective proliferation of Tregs. In the second part of this study, we showed that CTLA-4 signaling was associated with enhanced expression of indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase (IDO). The expression of IDO results in the generation of anti GVHD activity and an increase in the Treg population following TH9402 treatment. This increased Treg population was mediated by tryptophan degradation and implied acute phase protein GCN2 activity. Finally, we show that the infusion of TH9402 treated cells in patients suffering from chronic GVHD resulted in an increase of the Treg population as early as 8 weeks after treatment initiation without causing lymphopenia or hyporesponsiveness toward viral antigens. Furthermore, the increase of IDO corresponded to patient response to treatment. These results suggest that TH9402 represents a most interesting therapeutic approach for patients with refractory chronic GVHD. IDO expression could also be used to predict patient responsiveness to the treatment. This could increase the quality of the treatment as well as the quality of life of patients suffering from refractory chronic GVHD.

716	Effets préventifs et thérapeutiques des polyphénols dans un modèle in vitro et in vivo de maladie inflammatoire de l’intestin : caractérisation des polyphénols de la pelure de pomme et de la canneberge par spectrométrie de masse	The intestinal mucosa is exposed to oxidizing agents from the ingestion of modified foods, immuno-inflammatory cells and intestinal flora. Diet high in fruits and vegetables may reduce oxidative stress and inflammation via several mechanisms. These beneficial effects may be due to their high polyphenol content. The first aims for my PhD was to define the nature of polyphenols extracted from dried apple peels (DAPP) and to determine their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory potential in the intestine. Caco-2/15 cells were used to study the role of DAPP preventive actions against oxidative stress (OxS) and inflammation induced by iron-ascorbate (Fe/Asc) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), respectively. The combination of HPLC with fluorescence detection, HPLC-ESI-MS TOF and UPLC-ESI-MS/MS QQQ allowed us to characterize the phenolic compounds present in the DAPP (phenolic acids, flavonols glycosides, flavan-3-ols, procyanidins). The addition of Fe/Asc to Caco-2/15 cells induced OxS as demonstrated by the rise in malondialdehyde, depletion of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, and alterations in the activity of endogenous antioxidants (SOD, GPx, G-Red). However, preincubation with DAPP prevented Fe/Asc-mediated lipid peroxidation and counteracted LPS-mediated inflammation as evidenced by the down-regulation of cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6), and prostaglandin E2. The mechanisms of action triggered by DAPP induced also a down-regulation of cyclooxygenase-2 and nuclear factor-kB, respectively. These actions were accompanied by the induction of Nrf2 (orchestrating cellular antioxidant defenses and maintaining redox homeostasis), and PGC-1α (the “master controller” of mitochondrial biogenesis). Our findings provide evidence of the capacity of DAPP to reduce OxS and inflammation, two pivotal processes involved in inflammatory bowel diseases.  The cranberry fruit has been reported to have high antioxidant effectiveness that is potentially linked to its richness in diversified polyphenolic content. Therefore, the second objective was to compare the results for apple to those for the cranberry. More specifically, the aim of this study was to determine the role of cranberry polyphenolic fractions in oxidative stress, inflammation and mitochondrial functions using intestinal Caco-2/15 cells. The second aim of this work was to determine the polyphenolic species that were responsible for the observed biological activity. The combination of HPLC and UPLC-TDQ techniques allowed us to characterize the profile of low, medium and high molecular weight polyphenolic compounds in cranberry extracts. The medium molecular weight fraction was enriched with flavonoids and procyanidin dimers whereas procyanidin oligomers (degree of polymerization > 4) were the dominant class of polyphenols in the high molecular weight fraction. Pre-incubation of Caco-2/15 cells with these cranberry extracts prevented Fer/Asc-mediated lipid peroxidation and counteracted LPS-mediated inflammation as evidenced by the decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6), cyclooxygenase-2 and prostaglandin E2. Cranberry polyphenols fractions limited both NF-B activation and Nrf2 down-regulation. Consistently, cranberry procyanidins alleviated oxidative stress-dependent mitochondrial dysfunctions as showed by the rise in ATP production and the up-regulation of Bcl-2, as well as the decline of protein expression of cytochrome C and apoptotic inducing factor. These mitochondrial effects were associated with a significant stimulation of PGC1α, a central inducing factor of mitochondrial biogenesis and transcriptional co-activator of numerous downstream mediators. Finally, cranberry procyanidins forestalled the effect of Fer/Asc on the protein expression of mitochondrial transcription factors (mtTFA, mtTFB1, mtTFB2). The analysis of different pathways, including absorption and transport of polyphenol species revealed which species in the three cranberry fractions have been responsible for the antioxidant activity observed. Especially, the identification of flavan-3-ols and A-type procyanidins in mitochondria suggested that these polyphenol species were responsible for the antioxidant activity in this organelle. Our findings provide evidence for the capacity of cranberry polyphenols to reduce intestinal oxidative stress and inflammation while improving mitochondrial dysfunction.  Subsequently, we evaluated the preventive and therapeutic aspects of DAPP polyphenols on intestinal inflammation while elucidating the underlying mechanisms and clinical benefits. Induction of intestinal inflammation in the C57BL6 mice was performed by oral administration of the inflammatory agent DSS (Dextran Sodium Sulfate, 2.5% for 10 days). Physiological and supraphysiological doses of DAPP (200 and 400 mg/ kg/day, respectively) were administered by gavage for 10 days pre- and during-DSS. DSS caused weight loss, shortening of the colon, dystrophic detachment of the epithelium, erosion and infiltration of mono- and polymorphonuclear cells in the colon. Additionally, the DSS induced an increase in lipid peroxidation, a down-regulation of antioxidant enzymes, a rise in MPO and COX-2 expression, and PGE2 production. However, the DAPP corrected or at least alleviated most of these abnormalities in preventive and therapeutic situations, in addition to lowering protein expression of NF-kB and inflammatory cytokines (TNF-a and IL-6) while stimulating antioxidant transcription factors (Nrf2, PGC1α). The supraphysiological dose of DAPP in therapeutic situation has corrected mitochondrial dysfunction, as evidenced by the raised ADP/ATP ratio, reduced apoptosis (Cyt C and AIF) and the DNA repair enzyme (OGG1) that eliminated DNA damage, caused by oxidative stress, thereby preventing the initiation of the ROS vicious cycle. The relative abundance of colitogenic bacteria was slightly decreased in DAPP-treated mice compared to DSS-induced colitis group. Conclusions: Polyphenols of DAPP exhibit a powerful anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory power in the intestine. Their actions are associated with the regulation of cellular signaling pathways and changes in microbiota composition. Therefore, preventive and therapeutic effects of DAPP may be clinically feasible in individuals with intestinal disorders such as colonic cancer.

717	Caractérisation des interactions établies par la région riche en prolines de la ligase de l’ubiquitine Itch	Itch is a member of the CWH (C2-WW-HECT) family of ubiquitin ligases involved in the control of inflammatory signalling pathways, several transcription factors, and sorting of surface receptors. Itch functions generally involve ubiquitylation-induced degradation of its substrates. To accomplish such function, Itch must first interact with its target. Itch possesses four well-characterized WW domains mediating most of its known interactions. In addition to these binding modules, Itch also has a unique proline-rich region (PRR) among other CWH ligases. This sequence is well conserved among vertebrates, underlying its importance. The PRR of Itch enables its interaction with SH3 (Src homology 3) domain-containing proteins. Several proteins have been found to interact with the PRR of Itch. However, little is known about the function of these complexes and how they are established. Here, we have analyzed the binding properties of a subset of SH3 domain-containing proteins involved in endocytosis and cellular signalling. We have characterized novel SH3-PRR interactions established by Itch and found that various SH3 domains can target the same proline-rich sequence with the implication of distinct residues. These results demonstrate the variety of binding properties exhibited by the PRR of Itch and its clear preference for Endophilin. Among its binding partners, Grb2 (Growth factor receptor-bound protein 2) is of paramount interest given its major implications in cell signalling. We have thus demonstrated that Grb2 is ubiquitylated by Itch and that, in contrast with Endophilin, this reaction is not associated with proteolytic functions. Itch PRR is thus a versatile binding module and the interactions established by this region can mediate distinct fates.

718	Identification des grands utilisateurs de soins de santé chez les patients souffrant de la douleur chronique non cancéreuse et suivis en soins de première ligne	Background: Chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP) has major social and economic impacts. Identifying patients at risk of being heavy health care users could be very useful; therefore, by improving their care direct health care costs could eventually be reduced. Purpose: To identify bio-psycho-social factors predicting the risk of being a heavy health care user among primary care CNCP patients. Methods: Patients reporting moderate to severe CNCP for at least 6 months with an active analgesic prescription from a primary care physician were recruited in community pharmacies on the territory of the Réseau universitaire integré de santé (RUIS), of the Université de Montréal between May 2009 and January 2010. The latter comprises six areas: Mauricie and centre du Quebec, Laval, Montreal, the Laurentians, Lanaudière and Montérégie. Upon recruitment, their bio-psycho-social characteristics were documented through self-administered and telephone questionnaires. The direct health costs were estimated for the health care services provided to patients in the year preceding and following recruitment using the database of the Régie d’Assurance maladie du Québec, RAMQ (Quebec province public health care insurance). These costs took into account the pain-related hospitalizations, emergency room visits, ambulatory care, and medication prescribed for pain treatment  and drug side effects Heavy health care users were defined as those in the highest annual direct health care costs quartile in the year following recruitment. Logistic multivariate regression models using the Akaike information criterion were developed in order to identify the predictors of heavy health care use. Results: The median annual direct health care cost incurred by heavy health care users (n = 63) was CAD 7,627, compared to CAD 1,554 for the standard health care users (n = 188). The final predictive model of the risks of being a heavy health care user included pain located in the lower body (Odds ratio (OR) = 3.03; 95% CI: 1.20 - 7.65), pain-related disability (OR = 1.24; 95% CI: 1.03 - 1.48), and health care costs in the previous year (OR = 17.67; 95% CI: 7.90 - 39.48). Other retained variables were sex, comorbidity, depression level, and patients’ attitudes towards medical pain cure. Conclusion: Patients suffering from CNCP in the lower body and having a greater impact of pain on their daily functioning were more likely to be heavy health care and services users. Previous year annual direct cost was also a significant predictor. Improving pain management in this clientele of patients may improve their health and eventually reduce their health care cost to the health care system.

719	L’environnement intérieur et l’autisme : un Centre de jour pour adultes	This thesis presents and discusses an important issue that is part of a current context, both international and local level, since it affects 1 child in 68 (CDC, 2010). We are talking about the Autism spectrum disorder (ASD). More specifically, this research focuses on young autistic adults who suddenly find themselves facing a lack of services. It suggests that an adequate adaptation of the environment should be explored in order to provide adapted day Centers to this clientele. The question of the research is the following: What are the elements of interior design that can improve the quality of life of autistic adults? It is essential to linger over it, since ASD people are characterized by hypersensitivity and hyposensitivity to the environment. Even if the subject of autism is richly documented by medical science, it appeared that it is less studied by the interior architecture domain.  The methodological strategy of this research is based on analysis of precedents, participant observation and the conducting semi-structured interviews with parents of autistic people. This study aims simultaneously to improve the understanding of the emerging practice of design as an intervention and the identification of factors (lightings, colors, materials, spatial organization) that could improve the wellbeing of autistics adults. Based on the data collected, it was noticed that, indeed, several means can be undertaken to design environments improving the well-being of adults. The results extracted from the field study lead us to clear layout proposals: making the abstract as concrete as possible, develop areas of social withdrawal, offer a variety of atmospheres, and finally provide a safe environment.

720	Expertise sportive et entraînement perceptivo-cognitif de l’athlète	To perform at the top, athletes must possess a special perceptual-cognitive ability. This talent is the capacity to extract key information from a visual scene and is reflected by sportsmen’s vision and intelligence of play. For a long time, sport science has reported perceptual-cognitive expertise inside the domain-specific sport environment of athletes. But more recently, evidence has shown that expertise could also been reflected outside of this context, in daily activities for instance. Moreover, recent theories surrounding brain plasticity have driven researchers to develop new tools to train perceptual-cognitive skills of athletes in order to increase performance on the field. Those methods are mostly contextual to the athlete’s discipline. However, a new perceptual-cognitive training methodology, called 3-Dimensional Multiple Object Tracking (3D-MOT), which is deprived of sport context, has recently been developed and took a center part in our researches. One of the main objectives was to observe athletes’ specific and non-specific expertise during the same study. We evaluated biological motion perception in soccer players and non-athletes in a virtual reality environment. Sportsmen were systematically more efficient and faster compared to novices when discriminating the direction of the biological motion during a soccer specific exercise (shot) but also during a daily action (walk). The results suggest that athletes are better capable in perceiving human biological motions performed by others. Soccer activity seems to confer a fundamental advantage that goes beyond sport specific functions. Concurrent with those discoveries, we observed the amazing ability of an athlete’s performance to process dynamic and neutral visual scenes. Soccer players outperformed novices throughout the 3D-MOT test which consists in tracking moving targets and simulates perceptual-cognitive skills. Their visual tracking speed and their learning ability were superior. The results confirm previous data obtained by sport experts. The 3D-MOT is an attentional tracking paradigm that stimulates active processing of dynamic visual information. In particular, it targets selective, dynamic and sustained attention, as well as working memory. This tool can be used to train perceptual-cognitive functions of athletes. Soccer players trained with the 3D-MOT throughout 30 sessions have shown an increase in passing decision making (15%) on the field compared to control groups. For the first time, the results demonstrate a perceptual-cognitive transfer from the laboratory to the field following a non-contextual perceptual-cognitive training program. Our research helps to understand athletes’ expertise by using both specific and non-specific approaches and also present perceptual-cognitive training tools, in particular the 3D-MOT technique, to improve performance in sport.

722	Effet préventif de la milrinone inhalée chez les patients avec hypertension pulmonaire subissant une chirurgie cardiaque sous circulation extracorporelle : une approche pharmacométrique	Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is a technique used during cardiac surgery performed thousands of times each day worldwide. Hemodynamic complications associated with difficult separation from CPB represent a leading cause of mortality in cardiac surgery and pulmonary hypertension (PH) was identified as one of the most important predictor and risk factor. Recently, inhaled milrinone administration prior to CPB was hypothesized to have a preventive effect and facilitate separation from CPB in patients with PH. However, this indication and route of administration have not yet been approved by regulatory agencies for milrinone. So far, research efforts on inhaled milrinone have mainly focused on evidence supporting hemodynamic efficacy and safety in cardiac patients although no biomarker has been established. The most appropriate dose for nebulization has never been determined, nor have pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) profiles been characterized after inhalation. The objective of the current research consisted of characterizing the exposure-response relationship for milrinone administered by inhalation in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. An improved high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analytical assay using UV detection was validated for the quantification of milrinone in plasma after inhalation and proved to be sensitive and accurate. The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was 1.25 ng/ml with mean intra-assay and inter-assay precisions (CV%) <8%. Pulmonary hypertensive patients scheduled for cardiac surgery with CPB were first recruited for a pilot (n=12) and, subsequently, a full-scale (n=28) study where milrinone (5mg) was administered by inhalation pre-CPB. In the pilot study, milrinone early systemic exposure was investigated using a jet nebulizer or a mesh nebulizer. Nebulizers performance in terms of emitted and inhaled doses were also determined in vitro. In the full-scale study, using a mesh nebulizer exclusively, in vivo inhaled dose was estimated and milrinone definite pharmacokinetics fully characterized based on blood sampling and urine collection. Mean arterial pressure to mean pulmonary arterial pressure ratio (mAP/mPAP) was selected as the PD biomarker. Milrinone exposure-response relationship was characterized during the inhalation period by studying the relationship between individual area under the effect-time curve (AUEC) and corresponding area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC). Finally, the mAP/mPAP ratio, among other variables, was explored as a potential predictor of difficult separation from bypass in a multiple logistic regression model. In vitro experiments demonstrated that emitted doses were similar for the jet (64%) and the mesh (68.0%) nebulizers. However, the inhaled dose was 2-3 fold higher (46% vs 17%) after mesh nebulization, which was in agreement with plasma concentrations. In patients, due to variations in circuit-related and ventilator-related factors, the inhaled dose was estimated to be lower (30%) and this was confirmed by 24-h recovery in urine (26%). Milrinone peak plasma concentrations (Cmax: 41-189 ng/ml) and magnitude of peak response ΔRmax-R0 (0-65%) were observed at the end of inhalation (10-30 min). Data obtained from PK analysis agreed with published data for intravenous milrinone. After the inhalation period, individual AUEC were directly related to AUC (P=0.045). Finally, our PD biomarker, expressed as ΔRmax-R0, as well as CPB duration, were both identified as significant predictors of DSB. The comparison of corresponding AUC and AUEC provided preliminary evidence of a proof of concept for the use of the mAP/mPAP ratio as a promising PD biomarker and warrants future PK/PD studies. Indeed, mAP/mPAP ratio variation in response to inhaled milrinone was found to contribute in the prevention of DSB.

723	"Valeur pronostique de CD73 et des lymphocytes T CD8 et optimisation de la vaccination de
type GVAX dans le cancer de la prostate"	The ectoenzyme CD73 has been associated with suppression of anti-tumor immunity. Its prognostic and therapeutic values have been highlighted in many types of cancer. The first hypothesis of this project is that tumor CD73 expression predicts the prognosis of prostate cancer patients. CD73 expression was determined by immunofluorescence in tumor tissues. Univariates and multivariates analysis were conducted to determine if CD73 expression could predict patients' biochemical recurrence. We determined that CD73 predicts independently the prognosis of prostate cancer patients. Moreover, we determined that CD73 expression in normal adjacent tissue or in the tumor predicts differently the occurrence of biochemical recurrence. The second hypothesis is that CD73 blockade enhances the efficacy of a therapeutic vaccine against prostate cancer. The GVAX-like vaccine was studied in CD73KO mice or in combination with an antibody against CD73. We observed that the vaccine was more efficient in mice where CD73 was absent. However, the combination with the anti-CD73 did not enhances the efficacy of the vaccine.

724	Causalité et explication causale chez James Woodward	Some philosophers claim that causal relations are based on the laws of nature.  This view is not consistent with the actual causal relations found in the biomedical and social sciences.  In order  to better reflect the actual practice in the various sciences, James Woodward puts forward a view of causation and causal explanation based on a much less demanding relation than that of law of nature, which he calls ‘invariance’.  This essay presents the concept of invariance and other related causal concepts, and identifies certain problems, in order to outline the proper use of this group of concepts.  Woodward’s conception assumes that the goal of causal inquiry is practical rather than merely epistemic :  agents use causal relationships to modify outcomes.  The conception is also non reductive ;  it uses counterfactuals and is a reflection of the experimental methods of the various sciences.  The fact that this conception is consistent with the actual causal generalizations found in the various sciences implies that the goal of universal truth associated with the notion of law of nature is set aside and is replaced by an objective of temporary reliability.  In addition, since the invariance criterion is not very demanding, other criteria must be added to identify, among causal (i.e. invariant) relations, those relations that can be relied upon to reliably modify outcomes.	intervention , invariance , Woodward , science , philosophy , epistemology , causation , explanation , law of nature , intervention , invariance , Woodward , science	en	15882.0
725	La conception néolibérale de la justice: les cas comparés de Friedrich A. von Hayek et de Walter Lippmann	"Neoliberalism, a term commonly used to describe the current paradigm of the state, is largely related to a disengagement of the state from issues of social welfare and is associated with the legitimization of socio-economic inequalities. For many critics, it also represents an ideology that does not consider justice as a collective ideal that should be pursued. This stands in contradiction with the fact that justice was a central theme in the works of many thinkers to whom we attribute the formulation of neoliberal thought. Considering this paradox, the main purpose of this Master’s thesis is to expose the conception of justice as expressed by two key neoliberal thinkers: the American journalist Walter Lippmann and the Austrian economist Friedrich A. von Hayek. This comparative perspective will allow me to single out what I call the ""neoliberal conception"" of justice, a conception that builds on a particular understanding of the market. In the first chapter, I present the central challenge of the neoliberal conception of justice by broaching the epistemological stance common to Hayek and Lippmann. In the second chapter, I present specific properties of this conception and discuss its principal blind spots. I also show that Hayek and Lippmann disagree when it comes to the notion of ""responsibility"". Finally, I compare the neoliberal conception of justice with that of libertarians, as presented by Robert Nozick in his work Anarchy, State and Utopia. In this third section, I argue that Hayek and Nozick’s respective criteria of justice drive a wedge between two otherwise rather similar conceptions. In contrast to a standard analysis that treats neoliberalism as an amoral project, I contend that recognition of the moral dimension of neoliberal discourse opens up a perspective from which it becomes possible to challenge the project on ethical grounds. Understanding the idea of justice underpinning contemporary neoliberalism, as rooted in the moral tradition presented in this essay, is necessary if we are to criticize this ideology on moral grounds."

726	Expérience précaire du monde et représentation de la poésie dans La fissure de la fiction et Désâmé de Patrice Desbiens	Diverse pieces of modern and contemporary poetry offer representations of a lyrical subject’s attitude towards the act of writing. Studying such an issue in the works of Patrice Desbiens offers a distinctively interesting perspective, especially in the case of some of his publications from the 1990s and the 2000s wherein such representations appear quite clearly. Yet the treatment of the act of writing in his work has received very little research attention. The aim of this Master’s thesis is to shed further light on how Patrice Desbiens’s works deal with representations of writing and poetry. The thesis focusses on two of his published works, La fissure de la fiction (1997) and Désâmé, (2005), with greater emphasis placed on the former, as it is in my own perspective a key piece in his poetic legacy. To begin, my work puts forth the concept that the protagonists in La fissure de la fiction and Désâmé are both characterized by precariousness, but in different ways. In La fissure de la fiction, the character of the poet is understood from the perspective of an ironic revival of the literary curse myth. The meaning this myth confers to the main character of this poetical story is also discussed. Secondly, the thesis argues that the coherence and the plausibility of the universes of La fissure de la fiction and Desâmé are undermined. In light of these analyses, one can envision the role of a poetry which, ultimately and despite everything, bears a consolatory character. It does so in spite of, or perhaps precisely because of, its grotesque aesthetic, sometimes comic, sometimes tragic, in which it is written.

727	Le processus de thermo-érosion du pergélisol dans la zone de pergélisol continu	Ice wedges polygons are very common features characterizing continuous permafrost environments. When concentrated snowmelt runoff recurrently flows into opened frost cracks in ice wedges (or nearby depressions), thermo-erosion of permafrost leading to gullies can occur. In the valley of Qalikturvik on Bylot Island (NU, Canada), rapid development of gullies due to thermo-erosion processes in wet polygons exert the following: i. forced rerouting of drainage networks, changing moisture input in wetlands adjacent to a gullied channel; ii. variation in near-surface thermal regime and moisture; iii. erosion and displacement of thawed soils outside the watershed. The objectives of this thesis are to quantify and widen the understanding of the thermo-erosion gullying geomorphology, the related impacts (as aforementioned in i. ii. iii.) and the role of such erosion in the context of the periglacial landscape evolution on a short to medium timescale.  In this study, gullies are active and dynamic: one gully triggered in 1999 (and monitored since then) elongated at a rate varying between 38 and 50 m/y during the first decade following its initiation. Its total length at the end of that decade (1999-2009) was ~750 m for an eroded surface of ~25 000 m². Sinkholes were exclusive to the active zone of a gully where alluvial levees and collapsed polygons were common in the stable zone. Thirty-five gullies were identified over the polygon terrace featuring the valley floor. 1401 polygons were consequently breached due to thermo-erosion resulting in 200 000 m³ of displaced soils and thawed permafrost.  Gullied areas were characterized by improved drainage conditions, a reduced capacity to retain moisture and a transition from dominantly surface runoff toward channelized flow. Intact wet polygons were homogeneous between each other and in their center; disturbed polygons were heterogeneous (for moisture, thermal regime and vegetation) following a breach of at least one side. Wetland polygons, when disturbed due to gullying, evolve toward an heterogeneous landscape which will become the new equilibrium for that terrain for decades to come.

728	La protection de la vie privée au temps de la biosécurité	This thesis focuses on the protection of privacy in the context of biosecurity. Biosecurity is concerned with the threats that epidemics of infectious diseases present to public health and national security. The main goal of my thesis is to challenge the idea that conducting meaningful public health surveillance necessarily implies that the scope of the legal protection given to personal health information has to be reduced. My research demonstrates that, given certain conditions, a public health surveillance conducted with carefully configured syndromic surveillance systems operating with de-identified health data would increase both the efficiency of surveillance in terms of its capacity to detect emerging epidemics and the level of informational privacy of the patients.	privacy law , biosecurity , syndromic surveillance , national security law , public health law	en	15849.0
729	Étude des relations entre le développement professionnel des enseignants du postsecondaire et leur bien-être psychologique au travail	The goal of this study is to contribute to an improved understanding of the professional development (PD) of postsecondary teachers and its link to psychological well-being at work (PWBW). Several studies have shown that numerous personal (knowledge and skill development, attitudes, teacher beliefs, etc.) and professional (professional experience, collaborative exchanges, educational practices, and key student results) factors can have a considerable influence on PD. More specifically, this study will describe the attitudes of teachers who foster their PD, explore the relationship between teachers’ professional experiences and their PWBW, and identify PWBW indicators and their interrelation with PD.  To meet these objectives, we began exploratory research with teachers (n=218) in three French-language CEGEP colleges in Montreal. A questionnaire on the Psychological Well-Being at Work Index (PWBWI) comprised of 25 questions (Dagenais-Desmarais, 2010) was submitted online via Survey Monkey. A principal components factor analysis revealed that the teachers’ PWBW was made up of five factors: fulfillment at work, interpersonal compatibility, feelings of competence, desire to get involved, and perceived recognition at work. Semi-structured interviews were conducted, after which we proceeded to qualitative cross-sectional (n=12) and vertical (n=2) case analyses. The results showed that teachers’ attitudes affect their knowledge and skill development, educational practices, collaborative exchanges, and perceptions regarding key student results. It also appears that professional experience affects various PWBW factors. For example, extensive professional experience is associated with strong feelings of competence and a desire to get involved, but also with low levels of fulfillment and perceived recognition at work.   We can therefore conclude that direct correlations exist between PD and PWBW. In addition, there is a link between teachers’ attitudes towards teaching and the personal and professional factors that affect PD, hence the importance of considering teachers’ attitudes as a vital PD factor. Teachers’ professional experience is another important factor to consider in the college context, particularly for improving the PWBW necessary for teacher PD. Finally, four different PD profiles according to PD and PWBW levels have been identified (Aware-Fixed, Aware-Reserved, Aware-Active, and Perfectionist), and the results of our mixed analyses  demonstrated a correlation between teachers’ PD and their PWBW.

731	Application of a new method in the study of pelvic floor muscle passive properties in continent women	The aim of this study was to present a new methodology for evaluating the pelvic floor muscle (PFM) passive properties. The properties were assessed in 13 continent women using an intra-vaginal dynamometric speculum and EMG (to ensure the subjects were relaxed) in four different conditions: (1) forces recorded at minimal aperture (initial passive resistance); (2) passive resistance at maximal aperture; (3) forces and passive elastic stiffness (PES) evaluated during five lengthening and shortening cycles; and (4) percentage loss of resistance after 1 min of sustained stretch. The PFMs and surrounding tissues were stretched, at constant speed, by increasing the vaginal antero-posterior diameter; different apertures were considered. Hysteresis was also calculated. The procedure was deemed acceptable by all participants. The median passive forces recorded ranged from 0.54 N (interquartile range 1.52) for minimal aperture to 8.45 N (interquartile range 7.10) for maximal aperture while the corresponding median PES values were 0.17 N/mm (interquartile range 0.28) and 0.67 N/mm (interquartile range 0.60). Median hysteresis was 17.24 N∗mm (interquartile range 35.60) and the median percentage of force losses was 11.17% (interquartile range 13.33). This original approach to evaluating the PFM passive properties is very promising for providing better insight into the patho-physiology of stress urinary incontinence and pinpointing conservative treatment mechanisms.

732	Impact of mash feeding versus pellets on propionic/butyric acid levels and on total Escherichia coli load in the gastrointestinal tract of growing pigs	Feed characteristics may influence the bacterial community composition and metabolic activities in the pig gastrointestinal tract, known to be associated with positive effects on the gut. Use of mash feed is associated with reduced Salmonella excretion, but little is known of its effect on the Escherichia coli population or of the mechanism of action. Our objectives were to assess the effect of feed texture combined with feed particle size on VFA profiles and levels, total E. coli count, and the presence of genes encoding virulence factors of pathogenic E. coli strains in the digestive tract along with their impact on pig performance of fattening pigs. Pigs (n = 840) on a commercial farm received mash or pellet diets of different particle sizes during the fattening period. Caecal and colon contents from 164 pigs were sampled at the slaughterhouse for enumeration of E. coli by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and for VFA quantification by capillary gas chromatography. The yccT gene was used to enumerate total E. coli. Improved pig performances associated with pellet texture and a 500-μm size were observed. Caecal (P = 0.02) and colon (P < 0.01) propionic acid concentrations were lower for pigs receiving pellet rather than mash feed. Similarly, caecal (P = 0.01) and colon (P < 0.001) butyric acid concentrations were also lower for pigs receiving pellet rather than mash feed, as determined by capillary gas chromatography. Moreover, caecal (P = 0.03) and colon (P < 0.001) butyric acid concentrations were higher for pigs receiving a feed with a 1,250-μm particle size rather than a 500-μm particle size. On the other hand, total caecal and colon E. coli levels were higher for pigs receiving pellet feed than for those receiving mash feed. For total E. coli enumeration, caecal (P < 0.01) and colon (P < 0.01) yccT gene copies were higher for pigs receiving pellet rather than mash feed. No effect of particle size on fatty acid concentrations or on E. coli numbers was observed. Virulence gene quantification revealed no trend. Taken together, results showed that mash feed is associated with lower growth performance but with favorable intestinal changes linked to VFA levels and E. coli reduction in the intestine.

733	La thérapie cognitive-comportementale dans le traitement du TDAH chez l'adulte: état des connaissances	Background: The international prevalence of adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is estimated at 2.5%. ADHD is associated with serious impairment in academic, occupational, social and emotional functioning. Despite the debilitating nature of this disorder, few individuals with ADHD receive appropriate help. Moreover, while psychopharmacology has long been considered the first-line treatment of adults with ADHD, it is now recognized that medication alone is insufficient. As such, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) represents a promising complementary approach. Objectives: This study aimed to review literature and investigate the efficacy of CBT, in reducing ADHD symptoms and comorbid conditions such anxiety and depression for adults with ADHD, by several studies through a meta-analysis. Methods: We searched the literature from 1946 through 2015 using especially MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO. We used a random-effects model, Odds Ratios and Hedge’s g. Results: Data from 12 randomized controlled studies were included, totaling 575 subjects. The results showed a significant reduction in ADHD symptoms (Hedge’s g = 0.95) and comorbid anxiety (Hedge’s g = 0.39) and depression (Hedge’s g = 0.30) for the CBT group in comparison with controls. Following the end of treatment, ADHD symptoms continue to improve, but not the comorbid conditions. Conclusion: In summary, in adults with ADHD, CBT represents a promising treatment.

734	Processus d’appropriation des technologies de l’information et de la communication par les enseignants : le cas des tablettes	The integration of information and communications technology (ICT) into the educational environment represents a tangible means of action in Educational Sciences. Questions are being asked by scientists, and those intervening directly on the ground, concerning the integration of technology and the means to be implemented in order ensure that this often complex process succeeds. The breadth and depth of the penetration of technology in schools has seen exponential growth in recent years and it has become vital to understand how these tools are used in the classroom. One notable example is the tablet, which has become ubiquitous in North American and European schools. Relatively new in the school context, this tool requires a careful consideration to be brought to bear on teaching practices and the different processes inherent in its integration. To answer these questions, we launched a research programme in three stages. We first developed a comprehensive picture of daily teaching practices using the touch-screen tablet in the classroom. This overview allowed us to sketch a summary of its educational uses and the issues surrounding this use. We then identified, analysed and classified the various ICT integration models presented in the literature. An analysis of these models allowed us to extract their intrinsic strengths and weaknesses. We created a synthetic model bringing together our reflections on these analyses and, in parallel, created a typology for identifying and classifying the models studied. Finally, based on the actual practice of teachers and the general model of ICT integration developed, we have attempted to understand process of integration of the tablet in the classroom. The results obtained show that the use of the tablet induces innovative teaching practices, which both facilitate teaching and promote learning. We nonetheless find that the potential of the tablet is far from being fully exploited, while certain uses should be considered within a more efficient and responsive perspective. In terms of the integration process, we identified several key elements for consideration: a process that must be iterative and constructive, internal and external factors involved, and the different levels of integration to be identified. The model thus designed specifies the means to be privileged and the ends to be considered. Following this step, we developed a model of integration dedicated to the tablet. This model, over and above the characteristics defined in the general model, presents a specific requirement for training, the involvement of the various participants, constant adjustment of teaching practices and an essential iteration. Following these considerations, we find that the appropriation of the tablet is an ongoing process and that new implementations, as for those existing, must feed into a careful analysis of the ramifications of practices mediated by the integration of this tool. At the end of the document, a summary of the results is presented, and certain recommendations are proposed to promote the integration of the tablet, and information & communications technology in general, into the classroom.

735	The French Canadian founder population : lessons and insights for genetic epidemiological research	The French Canadian founder population has a demographic history that makes it an important population for epidemiology and genetics. This work aims to explain what features can be used to improve the design and analysis of genetic epidemiological studies in the Quebec population. First we take advantage of the presence of extended genealogical records among French Canadians to estimate relatedness from those records and compare it to the genetic kinship. The kinship based on identical-by-descent sharing correlates well with the genealogical kinship, further demonstrating the usefulness of genomic identical-by-descent detection to capture complex relatedness involving inbreeding and our findings can guide the interpretation of results in other population without genealogical data. Second to optimally exploit the full potential of these well preserved, exhaustive and detailed French Canadian genealogical data we present the GENLIB R package developed to study large genealogies. We also investigate identical-by-descent sharing with simulations and highlight the fact that regional population structure can facilitate the identification of notable founders that could have introduced disease mutations, opening the door to prevention and screening of founder-related diseases. Third, knowing that French Canadians have accumulated segments of homozygous genotypes, as a result of inbreeding due to distant ancestors, we estimate the inbreeding in French Canadian individuals and investigate its impact on multiple health traits. We show how inbreeding depression influences complex traits such as height and blood-related traits. Those results are a few examples of what we can learn from the French Canadian population and will help to gain insight on other populations’ characteristics as well as help the genetic epidemiological research within the French Canadian population.

736	The economic voter and economic crisis	Theories of economic voting have a long tradition in political science and continue to inspire a large group of scholars. Classical economic voting theory assumes a reward-and-punishment mechanism (Key, 1966). This mechanism implies that incumbents are more likely to stay in power under a good economy, but are cast out under a bad economy (Lewis-Beck and Stegmaier, 2000). The economy has repeatedly been shown to be a major determinant of electoral behavior (see especially the recent book by Duch and Stevenson, 2008), but the current economic crisis seems to provide a marked illustration of how the economy affects voting. In recent elections across the Western industrialized world, most ruling coalitions lost their majority. Opposition parties, on the other hand, whether right wing or left wing, have appeared to benefit from the economic downturn.	Vote , Crise économique , Comportement électoral	en	14067.0
737	Macroeconomics, economic crisis and electoral outcomes: A national European pool	An abundance of comparative survey research argues the presence of economic voting as an individual force in European elections, thereby refuting a possible ecological fallacy. But the hypothesis of economic voting at the aggregate level, with macroeconomics influencing overall electoral outcomes, seems less sure. Indeed, there might be a micrological fallacy at work, with the supposed individual economic vote effect not adding up to a national electoral effect after all. Certainly that would account for the spotty evidence linking macroeconomics and national election outcomes. We examine the possibility of a micrological fallacy through rigorous analysis of a large time-series cross-sectional dataset of European nations. From these results, it becomes clear that the macroeconomy strongly moves national election outcomes, with hard times punishing governing parties, and good times rewarding them. Further, this economy-election connection appears asymmetric, altering under economic crisis. Indeed, we show that economic crisis, defined as negative growth, has much greater electoral effects than positive economic growth. Hard times clearly make governments more accountable to their electorates.	Vote , Macroéconomie , Élections , Crise économique	en	14066.0
738	Economic Policy Voting and Incumbency: Unemployment in Western Europe	The economic voting literature has been dominated by the incumbency-oriented hypothesis, where voters reward or punish government at the ballot box according to economic performance. The alternative, policy-oriented hypothesis, where voters favor parties closest to their issue position, has been neglected in this literature. We explore policy voting with respect to an archetypal economic policy issue – unemployment. Voters who favor lower unemployment should tend to vote for left parties, since they “own” the issue. Examining a large time-series cross-sectional (TSCS) pool of Western European nations, we find some evidence for economic policy voting. However, it exists in a form conditioned by incumbency. According to varied tests, left incumbents actually experience a net electoral cost, if the unemployment rate climbs under their regime. Incumbency, then, serves to break any natural economic policy advantage that might accrue to the left due to the unemployment issue.	Vote , Politique économique , Adhésion	en	14065.0
739	Is socioeconomic position early in life associated with physical activity during adulthood following the accumulation of risk model with additive effects?	"Physical activity enhances health, yet only 4.8% of adults in Canada meet the recommended level. Among the determinants of physical activity, socioeconomic position shows some of the strongest and most consistent associations. Its association is found cross-sectionally during adolescence and cross-sectionally during adulthood. This thesis aimed to determine if there is a long-lasting, life course association between socioeconomic position early in life and physical activity during adulthood. If there was one, a second goal was to determine which theoretical model in life course epidemiology best described its pattern.  This thesis comprises three papers: a systematic review and two original contributions. In the systematic review, Medline and EMBASE were searched for studies that assessed socioeconomic position before age 18 years and physical activity at age ≥18 years. In the two original research papers, structural equation modeling was used to compare three competing models in life course epidemiology: the accumulation of risk model with additive effects, the accumulation of risk model with trigger effect, and the critical period model. Each of the original research paper used data from a large, nationally representative prospective cohort. In the first paper, models were compared in the 1970 British birth cohort (n=16,571). Social class was used as an indicator of socioeconomic position, and physical activity was assessed during leisure time, during transports, and at work. In the second paper, models were compared in the Canadian National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth (n=16,903). Education and income were used as indicators of socioeconomic position and physical activity was assessed during leisure-time only.   In the systematic review, 10,619 publications were reviewed by two independent investigators and 42 were retained. For outcome ""physical activity"" (all types and measures), a significant association with socioeconomic position before age 18 years was found in 26/42 studies (61.9%). When the only outcome considered was leisure-time physical activity, a significant association was found in 21/31 studies (67.7%). In a subset of 21 studies with more rigorous methodology, proportions of studies finding an association were higher: 15/21 (71.4%) for all types and measures of physical activity and 12/15 (80%) for leisure-time physical activity only. In our first original research paper, using British data on social class, we found that the accumulation of risk model with additive effects fit the data best in both men and women for all three domains of physical activity studied (leisure time, transports, and work). In our second original research paper, using Canadian data on leisure-time physical activity, we found that in men, the critical period model fit the data best for education and income, while in women, the accumulation of risk model with additive effects fit the data best for income, whereas education did not fit any model.  To conclude, our systematic review suggests that socioeconomic position early in life is associated with physical activity during adulthood. Results from our two original research papers indicate that the pattern of its association may be best represented by the accumulation of risk model with additive effects."

740	La distribution ‘juste’ de la signature savante dans les collaborations de recherche multidisciplinaire en sciences de la santé	Authorship of scientific publications is a means of recognizing both a researcher’s contribution to a paper as well as their responsibility for the integrity of their work. Various approaches to author order may be used to rank individuals and convey the extent of their contribution. For example, authors may be listed by decreasing level of contribution, whereby most credit and responsibility are allocated to the first authors (common in the health sciences), or they may be named in alphabetical order, giving equal recognition to all (common in the social sciences). There are also “rules of thumb” or preferred practices that exist in the respective disciplines or research fields (e.g., corresponding author first, Principal Investigator last). In the case of multidisciplinary health research, differing norms and practices regarding authorship distribution may be held by the respective team members; and, this can give rise to disagreement and even conflict within research teams. Although researchers and scholarly organizations agree that authorship should be distributed “fairly”, a shared understanding or consensus as to what constitutes fairness, as well as its practical implementation in multidisciplinary research collaborations, remains a significant challenge.  This thesis proposes a conceptual ethical framework for the fair distribution of authorship in multidisciplinary health sciences research. At the outset, the various methods recommended by journals, learned societies, as well as in the academic literature to distribute authorship are critically reviewed; issues that may impede or complicate fair authorship distribution in multidisciplinary research are highlighted; these include, for example, power differentials, conflicts of interests, and conflicting disciplinary norms and cultures. The analysis will show that current universal normative authorship guidelines are overly broad, and therefore, are insufficient to effectively resolve many of the diverse issues that are often specific to differing contexts of research. As will be discussed, the limitations of such guidelines are particularly significant in the case of global health collaborations that involve researchers from low and middle income countries and those from high income countries. A theoretical approach influenced by T.M. Scanlon’s Contractualism is proposed as a means of achieving the flexibility needed for the diversity of multidisciplinary research contexts; mutual agreement and reasonability are used to determine whether ethical principles are “fair”. Four central and interconnected principles – desert, just recognition, transparency and collegiality – are presented as the conceptual foundation to support the development of a process for the fair distribution of authorship. This authorship distribution process integrates the detailed research tasks commonly used in “contributorship” taxonomies to delineate individual duties and roles in the research project and subsequent publication. Contributions are then compared and valued more efficiently to determine authorship order while promoting fairness in multidisciplinary health sciences research.	authorship , research integrity , responsible conduct of research , fair distribution , responsibility , merit	en	14051.0
741	Le sentiment d'appartenance à l'école : un regard conceptuel, psychométrique et théorique	Since it is tightly linked to a certain number of positive consequences (Creemers & Kyriakides, 2008; Finn, 1989; Roeser & Eccles, 2009; Tinto 1987; Wehlage et al., 1989), school belonging is considered an important element that needs to be developed and maintained by Education professionals (MELS, 2012). This emphasis on school belonging instigated our doctoral research. The purpose of this study was to investigate further the concept of school belonging. We decided that the results obtained ought to be presented in three separate research articles.   This first article outlines a conceptual analysis to clarify the concept of the sense of school belonging. It focusses on Walker and Avant’s (2011) conceptual method. This method is useful to understand fully a concept. Data were collected through a comprehensive review of French and English definitions. The literature review and empirical referents gathered show that the concept is of a multidimensional nature. Data analysis shows four specific features. A student must : (1) feel a positive emotion; (2) interact socially; (3) get involved in his(her) environment; (4) perceive some similarity with members of his(her) group (fit).   After having understood the meaning of school belonging in the article 1, the second article aims at examining the factorial structure and the invariance of the instrument Psychological Sense of School Membership (PSSM) with regards to boys and girls. The PSSM is a tool used to measure students' school belonging. This study was conducted among a sample of 766 girls and 391 boys in 10th grade. Three factors were identified, each representing students’ perceptions of their school environment: (1) quality of social relations students-students; (2) quality of social relations students-teachers and (3) feeling of acceptance. Multi-group confirmatory factor analysis indicated that the PSSM is an invariant instrument with regard to girls and boys.   Finally, the third article was conducted with 4166 (12th grade) high school students to determine the ways school belonging can be connected to academic achievement (Anderman & Freeman, 2004; Connell & et al., 1994; Roeser et al., 1996). To more thoroughly investigate these psychological processes, we applied the Anderman-Freeman model to validate the following hypotheses through path analysis; H1 Positive emotions positively and partially mediate the relationship between school belonging and behavioral engagement; H2 Positive emotions positively and partially mediate the relationship between school belonging and emotional engagement; H3 Positive emotions positively and partially mediate the positive relationship between school belonging and cognitive engagement; H4 Emotional, cognitive and behavioral engagement positively and partially mediate the positive relationship between school belonging and academic achievement. Our results partially support the first hypothesis. Our findings do support hypotheses two, three and four. Specifically, the relationship between school belonging and emotional engagement shows a more direct than an indirect effect (hypothesis two). The study produced similar results for cognitive engagement, i.e., a direct effect (hypothesis three). Finally, the relationship between school belonging and academic achievement indicates a more indirect than direct effect (hypothesis four). To conclude, we suggest some recommendations aimed at Education professionals.	School belonging , Academic achievement , High school students	en	14049.0
742	La québécité dans le théâtre contemporain Mythanalyse de Scotstown, Yukonstyle et Félicité	This memoir addresses three works of contemporary Quebec theatre, Fabien Cloutier’s Scotstown, Sarah Berthiaume’s Yukonstyle and Olivier Choinière’s Félicité, for the purpose of comparing them. This comparison must fuel a reflection on the concept of Quebec-ness, herein defined as the establishment of a treatment of identity promoting the development of an ambivalent identity. By providing that identity discourses are marked by what Gérard Bouchard calls “social myths”, this memoir analyses the proposed corpus with the intent of extracting the rational part of such myths along with their emotional parts, with both parts considered equally significant in the foundation identity. This memoir seeks to move away from common conceptions of Quebec-ness that are rooted in a political and historical tradition influenced by nationalism and proposes a more global definition of this concept, a definition that takes into account various meanings, allowing us to revisit the history of Quebec dramaturgy, as said dramaturgy ironically maintains an ambivalent position in regards to identity discourses since the Quiet Revolution.

743	L’idéalisme et le phénoménalisme leibnizien	Many commentators try to read Leibniz either as an idealist or a realist, adding a phenomenalist reading to theses first two analyses. However, those terms are however often used with ambiguities, making Leibniz sometimes an even more complex philosopher. The first purpose of this master’s thesis is to gather and compare all these interpretations in order to clarify Leibniz’s thought. In this study, his writings will be used to defend the following interpretation : Leibniz can be considered as a realist since he develops a theory where monads act as « mind-independent » entities. Nonetheless, these monads are non-extended and without parts. Therefore, we can present an idealistic understanding of Leibniz, for they are the “basic building-blocks” of his metaphysic. Still, clarifications need to be made concerning the body. It can either be “real”, if it is seen as an aggregate of monads. Or, it can be considered a “mind-dependent” phenomenon if seen as the result of monadic perceptions. We will develop, between these two possibilities, an intermediate position stating that bodies are indeed aggregates of monads (matter realism). However they must be considered as phenomena for this same reason (phenomenalism). Corporeal aggregates require the action of the mind which alone can give them unity. On the contrary monads are said to be unum per se. Bodies are therefore phenomena but precisely well founded in the monads that compose them.

744	Co-encapsulation of enzymes and antibodies for chemical deactivation of pathogens on paper	Bioactive paper is obtained through the modification of paper substrate with biomolecules and reagents. It is used in the development of novel biosensors that are portable, disposable and inexpensive, aimed at capturing, detecting and in some cases deactivating pathogens. Generally bioactive papers are made by incorporating biomolecules such as enzymes and/or antibodies on to paper. The immobilization of such biomolecules on solid surfaces is widely used for different diagnostic applications such as in immunosensors and immunoassays but due to the sensitive nature of enzymes, their large scale incorporation into paper has faced several difficulties especially under industrial papermaking conditions. The functionalization of paper at large scale is possible because paper can be easily coated with a layer of microcapsules, which have proven to be an efficient immobilization platform for enzymes and to allow. In this study, we developed a generic alginate-based platform incorporating microcapsules that can be applied to current paper production processes to prepare antibacterial bioactive paper with the ability to capture pathogens on its surface and to deactivate them by producing an anti-pathogenic agent. The design of the antibacterial platform is based on constant production of hydrogen peroxide as the antibacterial agent inside the alginate microcapsules. Hydrogen peroxide production is achieved through oxidation of glucose, catalyzed by the enzyme glucose oxidase encapsulated inside the alginate beads. The different steps of development included the entrapment of glucose oxidase inside alginate microcapsules, the reinforcement and surface activation of microcapsules by adding an additional layer of chitosan, investigating the possibility of immobilization of antibodies (human immunoglobulin G as a model antibody) on the surface of microcapsules and, finally, verifying the antibacterial properties of the system against Escherichia coli K-12 (E. coli K-12) as a representative pathogen. During development, certain measurements and observations were made using various analytical methods and techniques such as Bradford protein assay, oxygen electroanalysis, optical and confocal laser canning microscopy (CLSM), matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization- time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS), etc. Appropriate tests were performed to validate the successful modification of microcapsules and to ensure that glucose oxidase is still active after each modification. It was found that the encapsulated glucose oxidase maintained the specific enzymatic activity of 120±30 U/g. Subsequent efforts were made to immobilize glucose oxidase on gold NPs of two different diameters (10.9 nm and 50 nm) to enhance the enzymatic activity and increase the encapsulation efficiency.   The results obtained during this study demonstrate successful modifications on alginate microcapsules and also a successful response of such antibacterial platform regarding deactivation of the pathogen representative, E. coli K-12. The threshold for the enzymatic activity was found to be 1.3×10-2 U/ml for E. coli K-12 growth inhibition of 6.7×108 cells/ml. Further studies are needed to assess the efficiency of immobilized antibody in the capture of pathogens and also to incorporate the platform onto paper and to validate the efficiency of the system once it is coated on paper.

745	Émergence des comportements de leadership transformationnel : examen de l’apport d’une approche basée sur les composites de personnalité et d’une perspective interactionniste	Understanding what can influence a leader to demonstrate transformational leadership behaviours has intrigued researchers and practitioners for several years (Bommer, Rubin, & Baldwin, 2004; Bono & Judge, 2004; Shamir & Howell, 1999; Stogdill, 1948; Yukl, 1999). Yet, until now, these factors were little researched and poorly understood in comparison to the consequences of this type of leadership. Along these lines, this thesis answers to numerous issues raised by authors on this topic (Dinh & Lord, 2012; Zaccaro, 2007) by seeking to clarify the role of different individual and situational antecedents of transformational leadership. This objective is pursued through the adoption of an interactionist perspective which integrates individual and contextual antecedents to the assessment of personality supported by a criterion-centric personality model (compound variable).  This thesis is composed of three articles that pursue the following objectives: 1) Review empirical literature on individual and contextual antecedents of transformational leadership; 2) Validate the empirical links between a new personality model (i.e. compound variable) and transformational leadership; 3) Test empirically the correlations between personality and contextual variables to predict transformational leadership.  The first article aims to review and organize the current empirical knowledge from more than forty articles regarding transformational leadership indicators. The article is built on three major themes: the individual personality factors, the contextual elements and the study of the interaction between both. Multiple findings and research leads are discussed and set the stage for the following articles.    In turn, the second article investigates the explanatory potential of a criterion-centric personality model to predict leadership. Specifically, the Great Eight model, put forward by Bartram (2005) is leveraged to understand the relationships between behaviours tied to transformational and transactional leadership. Results from a survey of 113 managers and their 799 subordinates provide little support for the explanatory value of this model, but indicate that some personality traits are associated with leadership. Further analysis allows us to put the results in perspective with the academic literature and provide some insights regarding the potential for some personality trait groupings to predict leadership behaviours.   The third article builds on the traits activation theory (Tett & Burnett, 2003) to validate the combined effects of a manager’s personality and the context in which he or she operates to predict transformational leadership. The results ((nmanagers = 89; nsubordinates = 643) offer limited support to the rationale underlying the traits activation theory. Yet, it appears a manager’s relational traits (operationalized by the personality compound variable “supporting and cooperating”) are correlated to demonstrations of transformational leadership, when contextual factors (organizational consideration, decision latitude) are perceived positively by the manager. As a result, this research sheds some light on an element of variability put forth in previous studies regarding a manager’s relational inclinations by highlighting its sensitivity to positive contextual factors.

746	Proximité à distance : les fonctions critiques de la mimêsis dans la pensée de Theodor W. Adorno	The main goal of this thesis is to give meaning to a concept which, despite being central to the thought of Theodor W. Adorno, is notoriously difficult to grasp, and for that reason, has not received the critical attention it deserves: mimesis (Mimesis). More precisely, this thesis will present mimesis as a central principle which grounds the particular type of philosophical critique developed and defended by Adorno. Despite its different meanings – and they are numerous, as we shall see –, adornian mimesis is always invoked as a means of countering the heteronomous (that is to say, dehumanizing) tendencies at the heart of advanced capitalist societies. Above all, we will try to show that mimesis is presented by Adorno as a materialist corrective to the type of abstract rationality that underlies these societies. This task is a difficult one, since for all its normative importance, the concept of mimesis is never conceptualized as such by Adorno, but simply alluded to. We will try to compensate for this indeterminacy, firstly, by identifying the most fundamental normative underpinnings of Adorno’s thought (0.0. Introduction : les fondements normatifs de la critique adornienne), and secondly, by giving a full account of the different critical contributions that mimesis brings to it (1.0. Les fonctions critiques de la mimêsis adornienne). This exegetical and interpretative effort will enable us to see that Adorno’s concept of mimesis contains three distinct critical potentials. First, insofar as it is presented – especially in the works of the late 1930s and 1940s – as a psychosomatic impulse which gives lie, momentarily, to the violence inflicted on man’s interior and exterior nature by the reifying forces of instrumental rationality (Instrumentelle Vernunft), Adorno’s mimesis can be understood as a bioanthropological mimicry (Mimikry) (2.O. Mimikry : le potentiel bioanthropologique de la mimêsis). Secondly, insofar as it presented – more often in the works of the late 1950s and onward – as an epistemological competence by which the thinking subject is able to re-encounter and re-determine the objects of his experience, adornian mimesis can be seen to counteract the appropriative logic of identity thinking (identifizierendes Denken) (3.O. Affinität et Entäusserung : le potentiel épistémique de la mimêsis). Finally, insofar as it informs the radical artwork’s modus operandi – as it is defended by Adorno in his unfinished Aesthetic Theory –, that is, its capacity to subvert the constraints of the totally administered world (total verwaltete Welt) by incorporating them, adornian mimesis can be understood as a strategic Methexis, as a seditious tactic by which heteronomous forces can be at once anticipated and countered (4.0. Methexis subversive : le potentiel stratégique de la mimêsis). Thus, while looking to do justice to the rich polysemy of the concept of mimesis in Adorno, we would also like to show what, in all its forms, it points towards one form or another of resistance: as expression, exteriorization or subversion.

747	Guérir avec l'EMDR : preuves et controverses	EMDR is an integrative psychotherapy approach proposed to treat a wide range of psychological disorders. This is the first French review of EMDR effectiveness. The EMDR effectiveness is initially show with uncontrolled cases studies that suffers from important methodological weaknesses. Experimental case studies provide equivocal results. Controlled studies are then reviewed as a function of the type of experimental control used and the type of disorder treated. EMDR appears as effective as cognitive-behavioral therapy for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder but cognitive-behavioral therapy remains the treatment of choice for specific phobia and panic disorder. In addition, dismantling studies repeatedly show that eye movements are not necessary for the efficacy of EMDR. An analysis of the differences and similarities between EMDR and the cognitive behavioral approach is presented. Pseudoscience elements embedded in EMDR development and diffusion are also presented.

748	Tachykinins Processing is Significantly Impaired in PC1 and PC2 Mutant Mouse Spinal Cord S9 Fractions	Substance P (SP) play a central role in nociceptive transmission and it is an agonist of the Neurokinin-1 receptor located in the lamina I of the spinal cord. SP is a major proteolytic product of the protachykinin-1 primarily synthesized in neurons. Proprotein convertases (PCs) are extensively expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) and specifically cleave at C-terminal of either a pair of basic amino acids, or a single basic residue. The proteolysis control of endogenous protachykinins has a profound impact on pain perception and the role of PCs remain unclear. The objective of this study was to decipher the role of PC1 and PC2 in the proteolysis surrogate protachykinins (i.e. Tachykinin 20-68 and Tachykinin 58-78) using cellular fractions of spinal cords from wild type (WT), PC1-/+ and PC2-/+ animals and mass spectrometry. Full-length Tachykinin 20-68 and Tachykinin 58-78 was incubated for 30 minutes in WT, PC1-/+ and PC2-/+ mouse spinal cord S9 fractions and specific C-terminal peptide fragments were identified and quantified by mass spectrometry. The results clearly demonstrate that both PC1 and PC2 mediate the formation of SP and Tachykinin 58-71, an important SP precursor, with over 50% reduction of the rate of formation in mutant PC 1 and PC2 mouse S9 spinal cord fractions. The results obtained revealed that PC1 and PC2 are involved in the C-terminal processing of protachykinin peptides and suggest a major role in the maturation of the protachykinin-1 protein.

749	Bases moléculaires et cellulaires d’un trouble neurodéveloppemental causé par l’haploinsuffisance de SYNGAP1	Intellectual deficiency is the most frequent cause of severe handicap in children. A growing body of work indicates that disruption of synaptic genes explains a significant fraction of neurodevelopmental disorders, such as intellectual deficiency and autism. Until recently, the majority of known mutations associated with non-syndromic intellectual deficiency were either X-linked or autosomal recessive. On the other hand, more recent studies suggest that de novo mutations in autosomal genes required for synaptic plasticity may explain an important fraction of cases of non-syndromic intellectual deficiency. Using exome capture and genomic DNA sequencing technics, our laboratory reported for the first time pathogenic mutations in the autosomal dominant gene of SYNGAP1. Pathogenic mutations in SYNGAP1 have been associated with behavioral abnormalities such as intellectual deficiency, inattention, mood problem, impulsivity, and physical aggression. In addition, a subset of these patients show acquired microcephaly, autism and/or specific forms of generalized epilepsy. Syngap1 germline knockout (Syngap1+/-) mice show several behavioral abnormalities, such as locomotor hyperactivity, decreased anxiety-like behavior, enhanced startle reactivity, lack of social memory, a propensity toward isolation, deficits in cued fear conditioning, and impaired reference and working memories. Thus, Syngap1+/- mice might represent a reliable experimental model to study the pathological effects of Syngap1 haploinsufficiency on neuronal circuit development. On the other hand, it is important to first establish whether mutations in Syngap1 found in human lead in fact to protein haploinsufficiency.   SYNGAP1 codes for a Ras GTPase-activating protein. Its haploinsufficiency results in an increased level of Ras activity and ERK phosphorylation, abnormal dendritic spine morphogenesis, and an excess of postsynaptic AMPA receptors in excitatory neurons. Specifically, it has been suggested that prematurely increased insertion of AMPA receptors into excitatory synapses could explain some of the phenotypes observed in Syngap1+/- mice. Conversely, the role of Syngap1 haploinsufficiency in GABAergic circuits is unknown. The aims of my thesis project are: 1), to identify the impact of human mutations on SYNGAP1 function; 2) to determine whether SYNGAP1 plays a role in GABAergic circuit development and function, and 3) to reveal how Syngap1 haploinsufficiency specifically in GABAergic circuits affects cognitive behavior. We reported the first missense mutations (c.1084T>C [p.W362R]; c.1685C>T [p.P562L]), as well as two novel truncating mutations (c.2212_2213del [p.S738X]; c.283dupC [p.H95PfsX5]) in SYNGAP1 in humans. These mutations are de novo, except c.283dupC, which was inherited from a mosaic parent. In this study, we confirmed that patients with these mutations in SYNGAP1 showed, among other phenotypes, behavioral disorders associated with intellectual deficiency. Biolistic transfection of wild-type Syngap1 cDNA in pyramidal cells from cortical organotypic cultures significantly reduced neural activity-dependent pERK levels. In contrast, plasmid constructs expressing W362R, P562L or the previously described R579X mutations had no significant effect on pERK levels. These experiments suggest that these mutations in SYNGAP1 result in a loss of function, most probably disrupting brain development via a mechanism of haploinsufficiency.  Several studies suggest that the cognitive deficits associated with Syngap1 haploinsufficiency may arise from alterations in the developmental trajectory of glutamatergic excitatory neurons. Whether and to what extent Syngap1 haploinsufficiency affects the synaptic network development of GABAergic cells, thus contributing to excitation/inhibition imbalance and cognitive abnormalities, remains elusive. Therefore, we examined the involvement of Syngap1 in the development of GABAergic circuits. To this goal, we generated conditional knockout mice where one Syngap1 allele was removed specifically in GABAergic interneurons derived from the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE)  (Tg(Nkx2.1-Cre);Syngap1flox/+ mice). In organotypic cultures, we found that reduction of Syngap1 specifically in GABAergic interneurons resulted in alterations of their axonal arborisation and synapse density. Moreover, miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSC) and optogenetically-evoked IPSC (oIPSC) recordings in acute brain slices showed a significant reduction in cortical inhibitory neurotransmission in Tg(Nkx2.1-Cre);Syngap1flox/+ mice. Furthermore, we compared the performance of young adult Syngap1+/-, Tg(Nkx2.1-Cre);Syngap1flox/+ mice and their respective control littermates in several behavioral tests. Contrary to Syngap1+/- mice, Tg(Nkx2.1-Cre);Syngapflox/+ mice were not  hyperactive, and did not demonstrate any anxiety-like behavior. They, however, showed the same impairment in working and social recognition memory, indicating that Syngap1 disruption in MGE-derived GABAergic neurons recapitulate at least some of the cognitive deficits observed in Syngap1+/- mice.  All together, my PhD work first, demonstrated that human mutations in the SYNGAP1 gene associated with intellectual deficiency likely cause Syngap1 haploinsufficiency, and second, revealed for the first time a significant role of SYNGAP1 in the regulation of the development and function of GABAergic interneurons.

750	Modélisation de l’activité électrique des oreillettes avant et après ablation par cathéter	Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common form of arrhythmia in humans. The mechanisms governing the initiation and manifestations of that disease are complex, dynamic in nature, including interactions across multiple spatial and temporal scales in the atria. This often leads to unpredictable manifestations and phenomena that arise at the level of the organ, and are reflected across the entire torso. To remedy that problem, catheter ablation can be carried out, which consists in creating linear lesions which block and force the electrical propagation in the atrial tissue. Sometimes these lines reconnect after the procedure, which leads to atrial fibrillation recurrence, thus requiring a new intervention. The purpose of this work is to model the monitoring of the postoperative P wave to detect non-invasively the reconnection of ablation lines and to predict atrial fibrillation recurrences. Using a mathematical model of the atria and thorax, the P waves are simulated before and after ablation, as well as after reconnection of some ablation lines. The results show that the morphology and the characteristics of the P wave as well as the activation map are significantly affected by the ablation lines and the subsequent reconnections. These differences are more easily detected when reconnections arise on the left inferior pulmonary vein. The changes are most important in electrodes placed in certain areas of the torso, notably in the back. These new data are helping to plan a clinical study to validate the approach.

751	"Étude de la migration des populations de lymphocytes B du sang de patients infectés
par le virus d’immunodéficience humaine (VIH)"	Deregulation of the B-cell compartment is an important consequence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection. We observe a decrease in blood B lymphocyte numbers accompanied by variations in the relative frequency of B cell populations in infected individuals when compared to healthy controls. Our lab has previously exposed the implication of dendritic cells in B-cell deregulation via excessive production of B lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS/BAFF). Additionally, the study of BLYS/BAFF-transgenic mice as well as mice exhibiting an AIDS-like disease revealed an expansion of the marginal zone (MZ) of the spleen. Interestingly, we found reduced relative frequencies of mature MZ-like B cells in the blood of elite controllers while rapid and classic HIV progressors had increased ‘precursor’ MZ-like cells. This variation in elite controllers is the only one observed for all population analyzed and could be the reflection of active recruitment of these cells to the periphery to help control infection. To try and understand these variations in B-cell frequencies we have analyzed the Btropic chemotaxis axes CXCL13-CXCR5, CXCL12-CXCR4/CXCR7, CCL20-CCR6 and CCL24-CCR9. The longitudinal study of patients with varying degrees of disease progression and control shows a modulation of the levels of most chemokines in the blood of rapid and classic progessors. Meanwhile, elite controllers maintain normal levels of these chemokines, demonstrating their ability to preserve homeostasis. Our results suggest that the type of disease progression impacts B-cell migration, resulting in modified B-cell population frequencies. The decrease in mature MZ-like B-cells and the increased frequency of cells expressing CXCR7, a receptor associated to the MZ in mice, in elite controllers suggest an important role for the MZ in controlling HIV-1 infection. Overall, our results provide more information about the B-cell compartment in the context of HIV-1 infection and can contribute to the elaboration of preventive and therapeutic strategies for HIV-1.	migration , progression clinique , B lymphocytes , Human Immunodeficiency Virus , HIV , chemotaxis , chemokine , migration , clinical progression , marginal zone , longitudinal analysis	en	13885.0
752	Optimisation du promoteur CR5 inductible au cumate	Biologics are a very promising therapeutic avenue for the treatment of incurable diseases such as cancer. The market’s demand for these products is very high, so reliable and efficient industrial bioprocesses must be set up in order to answer it. The cumate gene switch (CR5) developed by Bernard Massie’s group allows high and fine-tuned expression of proteins of interest in CHO cells. Optimisation of this system is however a necessary work to maximise the expression and improve the leakiness of the system. For this purpose, promoters with different spacing configurations, transactivators with different activation domains, and a synthetic operator sequence have been assayed to evaluate their ability to drive high protein expression while improving the leakiness of the CR5 system. Thus, a promoter containing three operator sequences with a six base pairs spacing between them has been found to be the most efficient configuration in terms of yield and leakiness in comparison to the current CR5 configuration. Also, a new configuration of the CR5 where the transactivator is regulated by the coumermycin gene regulation system has been studied, showing very tight regulation ability. This optimisation work can only be applied to our specific experimental conditions and its application to other cell lines and promoters needs to be demonstrated.	cumate , CR5 , optimisation , coumermycin , inducible systems , CHO cells	en	13881.0
753	Applying scanning electron microscopy for the ultrastructural and clinical analysis of periprosthetic capsules in implant-based breast reconstruction	Two-stage implant-based (expander to implant) breast reconstruction is the most frequently applied technique following total mastectomy. While the periprosthetic capsule is a normal physiologic response to any foreign body, pathological capsule formation often leads complications and suboptimal aesthetic results. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) is a powerful tool that offers unparalleled assessment of capsule ultrastructural topography.  The first research aim was to compare conventional high-vacuum (Hi-Vac) SEM with newer environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) technology to determine whether the latter offers superior assessment of breast capsular tissue. The second aim was to apply the most optimal SEM mode to study periprosthetic capsule ultrastructural modifications in women undergoing differing expansion protocols during the first stage of implant-based reconstruction. Ten patients were prospectively included in the first study and 48 prospectively included into the second. Conventional Hi-Vac mode was deemed superior for the comprehensive analysis of breast capsular tissue. Using Hi-Vac mode within the established study protocol, a more pronounced capsular 3-D relief was observed around BIOCELL® expanders when the first postoperative saline inflation took place at 6 weeks following expander insertion (delayed approach). No significant changes were observed with SILTEX® expander capsules in both early (2 weeks) and delayed approach groups.

754	Des classes sociales aux classes cognitives	The author pursues two objectives in this article. First, he attempts to show that, from now on, cognitive competencies will be more important than social class when it comes to landing a prestigious job. Five aspects are examined: social status and cognitive competencies, the Flynn effect, the interaction between heritability and environment-mentality, educational homogamy and globalization. Secondly, the author presents some social consequences of this state of affairs on society and educa- tion, including meritocratic ideology.

755	La trajectoire de changement d’hommes ayant vécu des événements potentiellement traumatogènes	This report of internship explores the psychological trauma experienced effect on the change of trajectory of men who served prison sentences and who are currently on parole in an attempt to understand the involved processes of change. To achieve the objective, a qualitative methodology was privileged to establish the life story of men who spent time in prison. Data collection from interviews and from the criminal profile, the correctional plan and the evaluation report of the risk and needs of the subjects was conducted to establish their life trajectory. The analysis shows that the majority of offenders have lived at least one event that can possibly be seen as traumatic and that had a significant impact on their life trajectory. Indeed, it is possible to assume the existence of a link between the traumatic events experienced by the subjects and the problematic behaviors that led them to serve prison sentences.

756	Nanostructure des particules polymériques :  aspects physiques, chimiques  et biologiques	The goal set to nanotechnologies applied to pharmaceutical sciences is to improve drug delivery and benefits with the help of nanometer-sized vehicles. At this time different types of drug carriers had been proposed. Amongst them, block copolymer nanoparticles (NP) have been designed to allow, at the same time, efficient drug encapsulation and provide surface properties (hydrophilic layer) to the NP which are necessary for its interactions with biological systems by preventing the opsonisation and the subsequent recognition by the mononuclear macrophage system (MPS) and the rapid elimination of the drug carrier. The most prominent polymer architecture in drug delivery application is the linear di-block copolymer architecture, such as poly(ethylene glycol) blocks (PEG) linked to a polyester hydrophobic chain. PEG is the gold standard to add a hydrophilic corona to drug carrier’s surface, but its efficacy is directly linked to its surface organization and surface densities. In spite of limited success of diblock at the clinical stage, few studies have been devoted to other type of architecture such as comb-like copolymers, either for the exploration of new synthesis routes or for the characterization of particles prepared from alternative architecture polymers. We attempted in preamble of this work to define more closely the conceptual and technical framework allowing quantitative determination of PEG surface densities. This review work has been used in the experimental work to define the characterization methods. Several synthesis strategies have been developed for the preparation of comb copolymers in this work. All strategies are based on random copolymerization of dilactide with small epoxy molecules with a pendant group suitable for subsequent PEG grafting, yielding a polyester-co-ether backbone. In a second step, PEG chains have been grafted on available pendant groups (alcohol groups or alkyne) to produce the final comb copolymers. In the first part of the experimental work, esterification reaction by acylation and coupling (the Steglish reaction) allowed the preparation of a first comb-like copolymer library with PEG content varying from 5 to 50 % (w/w). The number of PEG chains (PEG grafting density) was varying while the lengths of the PEG chains and the hydrophobic PLA backbone were kept constant. The library of comb-like polymers was used to prepare nanocarriers with dense PEG brushes at their surface, stability in suspension, and resistance to protein adsorption. The structural properties of nanoparticles (NPs) produced from these polymers by a surfactant-free method were assessed by DLS, zeta potential, and TEM and were found to be controlled by the amount of PEG present in the polymers. A critical transition from a solid NP structure to a soft particle with either a “micelle-like” or “polymer nano-aggregate” structure was observed when the PEG content was between 15 to 25% w/w. This structural transition was found to have a profound impact on the size of the NPs, their surface charge, their stability in suspension in presence of salts as well as on the binding of proteins to the surface of the NPs. The arrangement of the PEG-g-PLA chains at the surface of the NPs was investigated by 1H NMR and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). NMR results confirmed that the PEG chains were mostly segregated at the NP surface. Moreover, XPS and NMR allowed the quantification of the PEG chain coverage density at the surface of the solid NPs. Concordance of the results between the two methods was found to be remarkable. Physical-chemical properties of the NPs such as resistance to aggregation in saline environment as well as anti-fouling efficacy, assessed by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), were related to the PEG surface density and ultimately to polymer architecture.  In the second part of this work, grafting of PEG chains on a polyester-co-ether backbone was directly performed using cyclo-addition of PEG azide on pendant alkyne groups. The new strategy was designed to understand the contribution of PEG chains grafted on PLA backbone ends. The new polymer library was composed of PEG-g-PLA with different PEG grafting densities and PEG molecular weights (750, 2000 and 5000 D). PEG chain grafting could only take place on pendant groups with this approach. NPs were produced by different methods of nanoprecipitation, including “flash nanoprecipitation” and microfluidic technology. Some formulation variables such as polymer concentration and speed of mixing were studied in order to observe their effects on NP surface characteristics. Unlike for the first copolymer library, here the NPs size and zeta potential were found to not be much affected by the PEG content (% w/w in polymer). Sizes were also not affected by the PEG chains length. TEM images show round shaped object and as expected sizes were found to decrease with polymer concentration in the organic phase and with a decrease in mixing time of the two phases (for flash nanoprecipitation and microfluidic technology). PEG chain surface densities were assessed by quantitative 1H NMR and XPS. In the third experimental part, we explored the role of polymer architecture on drug encapsulation and release of curcumin from NPs. Curcumin has been chosen as a model with a view to develop a delivery platform to treat diseases involving oxidative stress affecting the CNS. As previously observed with blank NPs, a sharp decrease in curcumin-loaded NP size and morphology change occurred between 15 to 20 % w/w of PEG. Drug loading, Drug loading efficiency and the diffusion coefficients of curcumin in NPs are showing a dependence over the polymer architecture. NPs did not present any significant toxicity when tested in vitro on a neuronal cell line. Moreover, the ability of NPs carrying curcumin to prevent oxidative stress was evidenced and linked to polymer architecture and NPs organization.  In a nutshell, our study showed the intimate relationship between the polymer architecture and the biophysical properties of the resulting NPs and sheds light on new approaches to design efficient NP-based drug carriers. The results obtained lead us to propose PEG-g-PLA comb architecture copolymers for nanomedecine development as an alternative to the predominant polyester-PEG diblock polymers.

757	"Dévotion à la Divine Miséricorde selon Sainte Maria Faustyna Kowalska : 
rituels, pratiques et croyances dans une paroisse montréalaise"	The life and mission of Saint Sister Maria Faustyna Kowalska (1905-1938) gave birth to a great devotion to the Divine Mercy in Cracow, Poland. The novelty of the message of the Divine Mercy compared with the other devotions of the Catholic church, comes from is the Messages that Sister Faustyna received from Jesus between 1931 and 1938 that marks the beginning of the Divine Mercy Devotion with the command to paint an image according to the pattern that she had seen through an apparition and have this image venerated throughout the world. Came also the revelations of the Chaplet and of the Feast of Mercy to be celebrated on the first Sunday after Easter. During World War II, from 1940 on, the Devotion to The Divine Mercy began to spread throughout the world and was first introduced to Canada in the year 1957 by two immigrant Ladies of the Polish nobility.  My research begins in the parish of Notre-Dame-des-Septs-Douleurs, where is situated «L’Oeuvre de Jésus Miséricordieux» in Verdun  and concerns the various rituals and religious expressions lived by peoples who devote themselves to the Divine Mercy in their everyday life. I am interested in the development of their spiritual life, their beliefs and practice that involve different postures of the body, movements and methods to concentrate in prayer, which can lead the devotees into spiritual experiences.

758	L’exploration du modèle des vies saines auprès de détenus dans un milieu de réinsertion sociale encadré par un modèle de gestion du risque	The social reintegration of offenders is a focus point in modern criminology and different ideologies concerning its effectiveness exist. Considering this aspect, the present study based on the Good lives model, which is a relatively new social reinsertion model that has been minimally utilized by the Correctional service of Canada (CSC). We are exploring the possible application of the Good lives model principles in the actual correctional context. More specifically, we wish to study the compatibility of the Good lives model with offenders in halfway house inside a context of risk management that is using the Risk-Need-Responsivity model. To do so, we use a qualitative methodology based on case studies, using observations, interviews and file information to illustrate the aspects of the two models. This type of methodology allowed us to conclude that it is possible to apply certain aspects of the Good lives model proposed by Ward within a social reinsertion context. On the other hand, the principles and the frame of the actual context of risk management challenges the principles of the Good lives model, which do not allow an entire application of it. Based on our results, a few hypotheses are proposed tin order to make the actual framework used in different correctional settings of Correctional service of Canada more flexible.

759	Analyse de la traduction d’un texte multimodal : la bande dessinée : le cas de Mujeres alteradas	The present research deals with the translation of comics. This topic, long time neglected by translation scholars, has started to attract researchers from the 80s. The research on the subject, however, has focused mainly in the linguistic aspect of comics. This paper, on the other hand, deals with comics as multimodal texts. It is thus at the cross-roads of both Translation Studies and Multimodality as defined by Gunther Kress and Theo Van Leeuwen (2001). The aim of this research is to apply a tool which allows to describe the different modes contained in the text. This tool, created for this research, is based on Hatim and Mason’s (1990, 1997) Three Dimensions of Context : Communicative Transaction, Pragmatic Action and Semiotic Interaction. This paper studies the French translation of Mujeres alteradas, an Argentinian comics created by Maitena Burundarena and published in France as Les déjantées.

760	TRANSHUMANCES, suivi de I ended up being my own trout (jeux de fragments avec Éric Plamondon)	This M.A thesis combines research and creative writing to focus on the tension between searching for and creating one’s identity, both acts which can only be achieved through the (re)interpretation of the past.   The novel TRANSHUMANCES tells the story of Alice’s pilgrimage on the via Podiensis, which connects Puy-en-Velay, France, to Santiago de Compostela, Spain. There, she walks. She walks to forget, to bury her dead, to move forward, to be elsewhere. Through conversation and contemplation she tries to fight her gnawing anxiety. She walks to harness the power of the mythical and mystical road: the road that leads the believer to a meeting with God, the godless to a meeting with himself. Alice meets John. They exchange jokes and secrets, share meals and tears, become blister brothers and return home, changed.  The essay I ended up being my own trout (jeux de fragments avec Éric Plamondon) explores fragmentary writing, with particular attention to the effects of the fragment on the act of reading. Éric Plamondon, with his trilogy 1984, playfully uses the fragmentary form to encourage the reader to doubt his certainties and to guide him towards a manipulated version of history. The reader is thus confronted with a plurality of interpretations and must acknowledge his position as the author of his own reading.

761	Marqueurs électroencéphalographiques du développement d’une maladie neurodégénérative dans le trouble comportemental en sommeil paradoxal	Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a parasomnia characterized by the loss of normal muscle atonia during REM sleep leading to undesirable and often violent behaviors associated with dream mentation. Idiopathic RBD (iRBD) patients are particularly at risk of developing a synucleinopathy such as dementia with Lewy bodies, Parkinson’s disease or multiple system atrophy. Indeed, subtle signs of neurodegeneration are seen in these patients including a slowing of brain electrical activity (EEG) during wakefulness and the presence of cognitive impairment. The purpose of this thesis is 1) to investigate waking EEG abnormalities specific to RBD patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 2) to assess the usefulness of baseline EEG spectral analysis performed during wakefulness for predicting the development of a neurodegenerative disease.   The first study compared a group of iRBD patients with MCI to cognitively intact patients and a group of healthy control. Only those with concomitant MCI showed waking EEG slowing in the posterior cortical regions, namely higher relative theta power in the parietal, temporal, and occipital regions, lower relative alpha power in the occipital region, and higher slow-to-fast frequency ratio compared to patients without MCI and controls. Moreover, the spectral ratio negatively correlated with attentional/executive function, visuospatial abilities and verbal episodic memory. The second study compared baseline waking EEG of iRBD patients who developed disease on a mean longitudinal follow-up of 3,5 years with patients who remained disease-free and controls. iRBD patients who developed disease showed higher absolute delta and theta power and higher slow-to-fast power ratio in all five cortical regions compared to disease-free patients and controls. This thesis identified specific EEG abnormalities during wakefulness in iRBD patients with MCI. Moreover, these anomalies are associated with greater short-term risk of developing parkinson’s disease, dementia with Lewy bodies or multiple system atrophy. Therefore, EEG slowing seems to be a promising marker of neurodegeneration in iRBD patients.

762	Un pilote avec groupe témoin : effets de la méditation de pleine conscience sur la qualité de vie, le sommeil et l’humeur chez des adolescents atteints de cancer	News of a cancer diagnosis often elicits a strong emotional reaction in teenagers and their parents. To address these emotional challenges, various psychosocial approaches have been developed, including mind-body therapies. Mindfulness-based meditation, inspired from the Buddhist tradition, and adapted to improve quality of life in patients suffering from chronic illnesses, constitutes a promising option. Altogether, authors have suggested that mindfulness meditation could have beneficial effects on physical and psychological symptoms among adults with different chronic illnesses, namely cancer, and could hence be an interesting therapeutic avenue in the treatment of these conditions. The emerging research in pediatrics is suggesting similar effects in children and adolescents. The goal of this thesis was to develop a randomized clinical trial with the aim to evaluate the effects of a mindfulness- based intervention on quality of life, sleep and mood in adolescents with cancer, while documenting lessons learned from this experience and obtained results. This thesis is comprised of two scientific articles. The first article presents the initial study protocol that was planned for this study, although this could not be implemented because of multiple feasibility challenges that were met along the way. Preliminary steps in developing this research project, giving prominence to its intervention manual. The structure of the project, namely the choice of design and participant flow, the targeted sample size, along with recruitment and randomization strategies, are described in this article. For the purposes of this project, an intervention manual was written. The mindfulness-based intervention, given by two trained instructors, comprised of eight weekly sessions, lasting 90 minutes each. A detailed description of each weekly session was included in this article, in order to foster the dissemination of our research protocol. The second article is firstly based on our experience of carrying out a mindfulness- based clinical trial with a group of teenagers treated for cancer. While the initial goal of the trial was to expand the field of mindfulness research of youth with cancer, it became clear that much was to be learned from the challenges we met along the way. The goal of this article was therefore to document lessons learned from completing this trial to improve feasibility of future similar trials. Our findings are described in terms of the challenges encountered according to the following three categories: 1) recruitment and retention challenges; 2) treatment acceptability; 3) timing and commitment. Over 9 months of recruitment, 481 youth were screened for participation in the present project. Of these, 418 (86,9 %) were excluded. Of the 63 that were approached, only 7 (1,4%) agreed to participate in the project, gave consent and provided a complete dataset. A narrow pool of eligible participants, along with high refusal rates, scheduling conflicts with school and absenteeism had a significant impact on sample size in this project. Although there is manifest interest from the medical care community and scientific merit to conducting clinical trials, the resources needed for implementing these types of projects are often underestimated. Effective recruitment and retention merits particular attention. Secondly, this article presents results of our mindfulness-based intervention in adolescents with cancer, specifically in terms of quality of life, sleep and mood. Participants from the experimental group completed follow-up measures. Testing revealed no significant differences on any variable between participants from the experimental group and participants from the control group pre-to-post assessment. This could be explained by a lack of exposure to mindfulness techniques following the eight weeks program, limiting the generalization potential beyond therapy sessions. Moreover, encountered difficulties with homework, previously mentioned, could explain the absence of a mindfulness skills acquisition. Globally, our results could be explained by the inherent developmental changes of adolescence, impacting participants’ openness and adherence to mindfulness. Sub-clinical psychological symptoms could also strongly impact the usefulness of mindfulness meditation in youth with cancer. Data from this pilot study suggests that caution is required in generalizing the results used to determine the effectiveness of mindfulness interventions in adults with cancer, as they are not a guarantee of success and effectiveness for adolescent oncology populations. In conclusion, the present thesis helps advance the state of knowledge in mindfulness and youth research, namely by presenting data that questions the relevance of mindfulness interventions for teenagers with cancer. It is necessary to be cautious in analysing results from this thesis, especially when taking into consideration the methodological limitations that were faced in its completion and their impact on feasibility and reproducibility of such a project on a larger scale. Thus, lessons learned from the implementation of a mindfulness intervention project in pediatric oncology were of crucial importance in the completion of this project and will be an essential part of any attempt to replicate a project of this nature. Further research in this field will be necessary to conclude whether mindfulness interventions are beneficial for teenagers with cancer and whether they are feasible with pediatric populations.

763	Caractérisation de la plainte cognitive dans le vieillissement normal et le trouble cognitif léger	Faced with the serious demographic challenge of an aging population, it is increasingly important to better understand the changes that occur with advancing age. It is known that aging is associated with many cognitive modifications. Indeed, approximately 25 to 50% of elderly individuals aged 65 and over report cognitive and memory declines. The work presented in this thesis focuses on the characterization of the cognitive complaint in healthy older adults and in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and the changes in the complaint as they progress into the Alzheimer’s disease continuum. The first study (Chapter II) aimed to identify main domains of memory complaint in middle-aged and older adults. It also sought to determine whether the domains of complaint were related to cognitive performance on neuropsychological tests. The impact of personal characteristics (age, gender, education and level of depression) on complaint was also assessed. A total of 115 healthy adults between the ages of 45 and 87 completed the Self-Evaluation Questionnaire (QAM; Van der Linden, Wijns, Von Frenkell, Coyette, & Seron, 1989) and were tested with a comprehensive neuropsychological battery. A principal component analysis performed on the items of the QAM identified seven dimensions of complaint. Difficulty inhibiting internal and external sources of interference when learning or remembering something was the main area of complaint. Other analyses revealed that complaints related to a set of memory failures that appear to be more detrimental to autonomy and safety indicated more severe cognitive and functional difficulties. The results also indicated that the main domains of complaint generally reflected objective cognitive problems. There was no association between cognitive complaint and almost all demographic characteristics. The second study (Chapter III) aimed to characterizing the cognitive complaint in MCI and its changes as individuals progress into the Alzheimer’s disease continuum. Another goal of this study was to verify whether changes in domains of cognitive complaint were associated with the increasing cognitive deficits experienced by those with progressive MCI. Individuals with MCI and healthy older adults were tested yearly over a three-year period. Complaint was measured using the QAM and the Multifactorial Memory Questionnaire (MMQ; Fort, Holl, iv Kaddour, & Gana, 2004). Our findings revealed that individuals with progressive MCI reported more cognitive complaints in relation to memory for complex information (e.g., text or conversation), for events from the recent past and for information about familiar people than healthy older adults, and this was found up to three years prior to the dementia diagnosis. When examining group effects, there were no changes in the level of complaint over time. Awareness of difficulties may become compromised in a proportion of individuals with progressive MCI. However, correlational analyses indicated that an increase in three domains of complaints was associated with the increasing cognitive deficits over the 3-year period. Thus, complaint in MCI may help to better understand the cognitive difficulties the individual person with MCI is experiencing. The theoretical and clinical implications of these findings are discussed in Chapter IV.

764	Sur une classe de structures kählériennes généralisées toriques	"This thesis is about the problem of finding a natural notion of ""scalar curvature"" in generalized Kähler geometry. The approach taken here is to compute the moment map for the action of the group of hamiltonian diffeomorphisms on the space of generalized Kähler structures of symplectic type. Indeed, it is well known that the moment map for the restriction of this action to the space of ordinary Kähler structures can be naturally identified with the riemannian scalar curvature. We concern ourselves only with a certain class of generalized Kähler structures on toric manifolds which we denote by $DGK_{\omega}^{\mathbb{T}}(M)$ and which we recognize as being classified by the data of an antisymetric matrix $C$ and a real-valued strictly convex functions $\tau$ (exhibiting appropriate behavior on a neighborhood of the boundary of the moment polytope). This viewpoint makes obvious the fact that any toric Kähler structure can be deformed to a non-Kähler element of $DGK_{\omega}^{\mathbb{T}}(M)$, and we note that this deformation happens along one of the classes which were shown by R. Goto to be unobstructed. We identify sufficient conditions on a pair $(\tau,C)$ for it to define an element of $DGK_{\omega}^{\mathbb{T}}(M)$ and we show that in dimension 4, these conditions are also necessary. Following the adage ""the moment map is the curvature"" mentioned above, formulas for notions of ""generalized Hermitian scalar curvature"" and ""generalized Riemannian scalar curvature"" (in dimension 4) are obtained in terms of the function $\tau$. Finally, an expression for the generalized Riemannian scalar curvature in terms of the underlying bi-Hermitian structure is found in dimension 4. When compared with the results of the physicists Coimbra et al., our formula suggests a canonical choice for the dilaton of their theory."

765	Photorealistic Surface Rendering with Microfacet Theory	Photorealistic rendering involves the numeric resolution of physically accurate light/matter interactions which, despite the tremendous and continuously increasing computational power that we now have at our disposal, is nowhere from becoming a quick and simple task for our computers. This is mainly due to the way that we represent objects: in order to reproduce the subtle interactions that create detail, tremendous amounts of geometry need to be queried. Hence, at render time, this complexity leads to heavy input/output operations which, combined with numerically complex filtering operators, require unreasonable amounts of computation times to guarantee artifact-free images. In order to alleviate such issues with today's constraints, a multiscale representation for matter must be derived.  In this thesis, we derive such a representation for matter whose interface can be modelled as a displaced surface, a configuration that is typically simulated with displacement texture mapping in computer graphics. Our representation is derived within the realm of microfacet theory (a framework originally designed to model reflection of rough surfaces), which we review and augment in two respects. First, we render the theory applicable across multiple scales by extending it to support noncentral microfacet statistics. Second, we derive an inversion procedure that retrieves microfacet statistics from backscattering reflection evaluations. We show how this augmented framework may be applied to derive a general and efficient (although approximate) down-sampling operator for displacement texture maps that (a) preserves the anisotropy exhibited by light transport for any resolution, (b) can be applied prior to rendering and stored into MIP texture maps to drastically reduce the number of input/output operations, and (c) considerably simplifies per-pixel filtering operations, resulting overall in shorter rendering times. In order to validate and demonstrate the effectiveness of our operator, we render antialiased photorealistic images against ground truth. In addition, we provide C++ implementations all along the dissertation to facilitate the reproduction of the presented results. We conclude with a discussion on limitations of our approach, and avenues for a more general multiscale representation for matter.

766	Développements et applications de méthodes computationnelles pour l'étude de l'agrégation des protéines amyloïdes	Proteins are at the center of life. They are formidable molecular nanomachines specialized and optimized during million years of evolution for well-defined functions in the cell. The structure of proteins, meaning the tridimensional setting of their atoms, is closely related to their function. Absence of structure for a subset of proteins is also recognized to be as crucial. Amyloid proteins is a striking example : they fold into an ensemble of various structures hardly observable experimentally that are associated with neurodegenerative diseases.   This thesis, firstly, is on the study of the structural ensemble of the amyloid proteins amyloid-beta (Alzheimer) and huntingtin (Huntington) during their folding and aggregation. Our results describe in details, with an atomic resolution, the characteristic interactions present in the structural ensemble of these two proteins.   Concerning the amyloid-beta protein (AB), our results show the structural differences between three of its physiological forms during its first aggregation steps in an aqueous environment. We have then compared these results with those obtained during the past few years by several other research groups using various experimental and simulation protocols. Clear trends come out of this comparison regarding the influence of AB physiological form on its structural ensemble during its first aggregation steps. Their distinct aggregation pathways are rationalized by the identified differences. For their part, the identified similarities offer targets for therapeutical compounds disrupting the aggregation of the neurotoxic oligomers.  Concerning the huntingtin protein, we identify the structural ensemble of its functional region at its N-terminal in an aqueous environment and in a phospholipid membrane. In agreement with the available experimental results on the global structure of this region in aqueous solution, our results reveal the dominant interactions, at an atomic precision, in its structural ensemble as well as the influence of its neighboring regions. We have also characterized the stability and the growth of nanotube-like structures that could occur during the aggregation of the amyloid region of huntingtin. Moreover, we have developed, in collaboration with a group of experimentalists, a precise model describing the main membrane interactions of huntingtin N-terminal, which serves as a membrane anchor that controls the localization of huntingtin in the cell.  Secondly, this thesis is on the refinement of a coarse-grained model (sOPEP) and on the development of a new all-atom model (aaOPEP) that are both based on the coarse-grained OPEP force field, commonly used to study protein folding and amyloid protein aggregation. The goal behind the optimization of these models is to improve the de novo structure prediction of the PEP-FOLD method. These three models -- OPEP, sOPEP and aaOPEP -- are now also implemented in a new molecular dynamics software that we have developed specifically to greatly ease their future developments.	aaOPEP , opep_sim , protein , amyloid , amyloid-beta , huntingtin , protein-membrane interactions	en	13707.0
767	"Utilisation d’agrafes chirurgicales dans le suivi de tumeurs hépatiques appliquée à des
traitements de radiochirurgie stéréotaxique par CyberKnife"	Recent progress in stereotactic body radiation therapy allows an ever larger number of people to receive non-invasive treatment for liver cancer. One of the methods that were developed involves tracking the tumor’s movements, using radio-opaque markers which are inserted into the liver of the patient, with the help of the tracking system of the CyberKnife. However, the insertion of these markers is sometimes too invasive for patients with poor liver condition. These patients often have a history of surgery which allows the tracking of surgical clips that are already present in the liver as a surrogate for the tumor. This new approach to treating liver cancer is investigated in the present study in order to identify the optimal parameters for a better practice of this therapy. An anthropomorphic phantom experiment lead to the conclusion that the clip contrast in the tissue increases with an increase of the two imaging parameters (kV and mA of the x-ray tube). In addition, the error that was made on the identification of the position of clips by the CyberKnife system was measured as being slightly superior to the error on platinum marker positions (approximately 1 mm vs less than 1 mm). This error is considered acceptable in the context of this particular type of treatment. Finally, a gamma analysis of the dosimetric impact of clip tracking shows that it is approximately equivalent to that of platinum marker tracking. From these observations, we conclude that the treatment of liver tumors using surgical clips is valid and can be improved following this study’s clinical recommendations.

768	Étude du lien entre la collaboration enseignant-technicien en éducation spécialisée et l'adaptation sociale en classe des élèves ayant un trouble du comportement	In specialized classrooms for students showing behavioural disorders, the teacher and the paraeducator are encouraged to work together in collaboration so they can support the social and scholar adaptation of the students with whom they strive everyday. However, despite the numerous advantages of working together for the success of the student, the interprofessional collaboration comprise a lot of challenges which, if they are not took up professionally, can affect the students. The goal of the research is to verify if there’s a link between the quality of the collaboration of those professionals and the social adaptation in specialized classroom of the students with behavioural disorders. A methodology based on a correlational approach has been used. Teachers responsible of this type of classes completed a questionnaire to evaluate the social adaptation of their students while paraeducators filled one to qualify the collaboration established in their educational duo. In total, 71 of these duos coming from 9 schools of the greater Montreal have participated to this study. Although the quality of the collaboration varies in a significant way depending on the professional duos, the results do not show any relation with the quality of the social adaptation of the students with whom they intervened. Therefore, according to this research, there is not significant link between the social adaptation of the student in class and the collaboration of the teacher and the paraeducator. Those results, opposite to our starting hypothesis, are discussed in the light of the scientific literature on this subject. The strength, the limits and the considerations for further research are also discussed.

769	Vers une meilleure compréhension de la pathogenèse de la maladie osseuse reliée à la fibrose kystique	With cystic fibrosis (CF) patients now being able to live past fifty years of age come a multitude of secondary complications; one of the most important being cystic fibrosis-related bone disease (CFBD). In Cftr-null mice, this disease is caracterized by a low bone mineral density caused by an uncoupled bone remodeling. However, the observation that various models of CF mice display a bone phenotype despite the absence of the usual human confounders (i.e. inflammation, steroid hormone use, pancreatic insufficiency, etc.) led us to propose that CFTR, itself, plays a non-negligible role in the regulation of bone metabolism. This project will study the impact of the absence of CFTR on the osteoblasts (Ob) and osteoclasts (Oc) in a CF mouse model, namely the BALB/c Cftr-/- mice. In addition, Ob are recognized as having a modulating effect on the leukocyte microenvironment of the bone marrow (BM). This project will also investigate the impact of the absence of CFTR on the leukocyte niche in the BM. Our bone densitometry and X-ray microtomography results showed that Cftr -/- mice have lower bone density and bone mineral content vs. Cftr +/+ mice as well as a decrease in trabecular bone volume and trabecular number, and a greater trabecular separation. To further understand this bone phenotype, we confirmed that BM- derived Ob expressed CFTR at the gene and protein level, but not BM-derived osteoclasts. Such observations support our findings showing that only Ob differenciation and function were affected by the absence of CFTR. The osteoblastic defect appears to adversely affect the BM leukopoiesis as decreased numbers of T cells, macrophages and dendritic cells were observed in Cftr -/- mice vs. Cftr +/+.

770	Traitement de la douleur chronique non cancéreuse à l’aide d’opioïdes : efficacité à long terme	Chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP) is a complex phenomenon and multimodal interventions that address both its biological and psychosocial dimensions are considered as the optimal approach for treating this type of disorder. Prescription of opioids for CNCP has dramatically increased over the past two decades but little is known about the long-term effectiveness of this type of medication for reducing pain severity and improving quality of life of CNCP patients. The objective of the present study was to investigate in a real life context the long-term effectiveness of opioids for reducing pain intensity and interference, and improving health-related quality of life in patients with CNCP over a one-year period. Methods: Participants were 1,490 patients (mean age = 52.37 (SD = 13.9); female = 60.9%) enrolled in the Quebec Pain Registry between October 2008 and April 2011  who completed a series of questionnaires before initiating treatment at a tertiary multidisciplinary pain management facility as well as 6 and 12 months thereafter. Based on their opioid use profile (OUP), patients were categorized into 1) non users, 2) non-persistent users, and 3) persistent users. Data were analyzed using generalized estimating equation models. Results: Among the users of opioids, 52% stopped taking them during the follow-up period. After adjusting for age and sex, patients’ OUP significantly predicted pain intensity felt during 7-day periods (p < 0.001) and physical quality of life (pQOL) over time p < 0.001). Compared to non-users, persistent users had significantly higher levels of pain intensity and poorer pQOL. A significant interaction was found between patients’ OUP and time in the prediction of worst pain intensity (p = 0.001) but the persistent users reported the highest pain scores across time. A significant interaction was also observed between patients’ OUP and type of pain in the prediction of pain interference (p = 0.048) and mental quality of life (mQOL) (p = 0.042). Irrespective of the type of pain they suffered, persistent users reported higher pain interference scores and lower mQOL compared to non users. However, all effect sizes were small (Cohen’s d < 0.5), thus questioning the power and clinical significance of these group differences. Conclusion: These results contribute to the debate by adding evidences on the effectiveness of long term opioid therapy and question the role this type of medication should play in the therapeutic arsenal for managing CNCP.	opioids , chronic pain , Quebec Pain Registry , multidisciplinary pain management , treatment effectiveness , opioid use profile	en	13651.0
771	Impacts de l'urbanisation sur la diversité spécifique et fonctionnelle dans les forêts riveraines	Urbanization is a major threat to biodiversity worldwide. This thesis aims at understanding its effects on plant functional composition and biotic homogenization in riparian forests. Floristic inventories were carried out in 57 riparian forests of the Montreal area. To investigate changes in functional composition with urbanization, community weighted means were computed for trees, shrubs and herbs using eight functional traits. Each forest was characterized by variables related to the surrounding urban landscape, local forest conditions and spatial processes. The relative importance of these three subsets on the functional composition was quantified by variation partitioning using redundancy analyses. Local conditions, especially flood intensity, exerted an overriding selection pressure on riparian functional communities. The effect of the landscape was suspected to be indirect, acting on trait patterns likely through alteration of hydrological disturbances in riparian forests. In addition to environmental filtering, dispersal along rivers was also an important process structuring riparian forests.  Changes in taxonomic and functional β-diversity for herb species were studied between three urbanization and flood levels. While urbanization led to taxonomic differentiation, flood intensity fostered taxonomic homogenization, both without influence on functional β-diversity. Urbanization was the main trigger for all β-diversity changes, as it directly caused a gain in exotic species and a net species loss in highly urban forests, and indirectly fostered an important species turnover through alteration of the hydrological regime. Overall, these results suggest that the alteration and interruption of natural landscape-scale processes by human activities are major mechanisms underlying changes in urban riparian communities.

772	Systematic construction of models for the exchange hole of density functional theory	In this work, we extend the number of currently known physical conditions of the exact exchange hole with the derivation of the fourth-order expansion of the exact spher- ically averaged exchange hole. We compare the second- and fourth-order expansions with the exact exchange hole for atomic and molecular systems. We found that, in gen- eral, the fourth-order expansion reproduces more accurately the exact exchange hole for small values of the interelectronic distance. We demonstrate that Gaussian-type basis sets have a significant influence on the terms of this new condition, by studying how oscillations originated in these basis sets affects its leading term. Also, we propose four analytical exchange hole models to which we impose all currently known condi- tions of the exact exchange hole and the new one presented in this work. We assess the performance of the models by computing exchange energies and its contributions to atomization energies. It is found that oscillations originated in Gaussian-type basis sets can compromise the accuracy and solution of the models.	Exchange energy functional	en	13627.0
773	Contribution de modèle demande-contrôle-soutien à la variation des concentrations de cortisol salivaire	The main objective of this master thesis is to increase the knowledge about the impact of organisational factors on salivary cortisol concentrations. Especially, the models demand-control (Karasek, 1979) and demand-control-support (Karasek and Theorell, 1990) will be studied in relationship to the salivary cortisol. The objectives of this study are to investigate the associations between the main components of each model (psychological demands, decision latitude and social support), but also patterns of interaction effects, i.e. the effect moderator of decision latitude and social support. It has been shown that the HPA axis would be linked to symptoms of mental health (Abelson et al., 2007; Havermans et al. 2011; Vreeburg et al. 2009b, 2010, 2013; Staufenbiel, 2013) as well as stressors in the workplace (Chida and Steptoe, 2009). Currently, salivary cortisol, an indicator of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) or the axis of stress management, would be the most promising for measuring the physiological response to a stressful event or chronic stress (Maïna et al. 2009). The data results come from the SALVEO surveys led by the research team on work and mental health of University of Montreal (ERTSM). Results of multilevel analyses do not support the involvement of the demand - control - support model to changes in cortisol concentration. Indeed, they do not suggest that the main effects as much as the interaction effects of the demand-control-support model, explain the variation in cortisol levels. Tobacco consumption is significantly related to salivary cortisol concentration and must be taken into account in previous studies. Therefore, these results suggest that further research is needed to understand how the occupational stressors are incorporated into the individual at the physiological level. Depth knowledge of these associations would help to understand the associations between long-term stress and health effects or how job strain affects long-term mental health (Karhula et al. 2015).

774	Imperfect flâneurs : anti-heroes of modern life	This dissertation begins with a simple question in response to “the perfect flâneur” model that Baudelaire elaborated in his 1853 essay “The Painter of Modern Life”: can a flâneur be imperfect? I suggest three possible inferences behind the word “imperfect.” First, it should liberate the flâneur from the strict context of nineteenth-century Paris, and allows for imperfect translations of the figure into other urban contexts. Second, the flâneur also strolls in the “imperfect” dimension of fictional imagination, a dimension comparable to the anamorphic skull in Holbein’s painting The Ambassadors. Third, in the grammatical meaning of imperfect verb tenses, “imperfect flâneur” can also refer to the anti-heroic figure of the living, whose existence remains incomplete and mundane as in the phrase “it was.” All three implications contribute to the reinterpretation of the flâneur in late twentieth-century contexts. My premise is that to experience the city as a flâneur, or to make flânerie possible in the city, one should concede being imperfect, anticipate imperfections, and come to terms with them. Four in-depth studies of contemporary novels and their respective cities constitute the main chapters. Chapter One reads Robert Majzels’s City of Forgetting and Montreal. I examine the ways in which homeless characters could be said to occupy – or, fail to occupy – contemporary Montreal from their dislodged position. Chapter Two focuses on Rohinton Mistry’s A Fine Balance and Bombay. My reading evolves around the question of hospitality in relation to the accommodation and un-accommodation of strangers in the city. Chapter Three brings us to XiXi’s Feituzhen series and Hong Kong: I address the special method of hopscotching as a unique form of imperfect flânerie in XiXi’s works. In Chapter Four, I study Orhan Pamuk’s The Black Book and Istanbul. Inspired by Edward Said’s notions of beginning, I frame my argument with the enquiry: how and when does a narrative begin? In lieu of Conclusion, I imagined a conversation between the writing subject of this dissertation and the imperfect flâneurs featured in each chapter.	flâneur , anticipation , imperfection , vie quotidienne , flâneur , anti-hero , city , late twentieth-century novel , anticipation , disappointment , translation , imperfection , everyday life , urban culture	en	13608.0
775	La presse satirique illustrée française et la colonisation (1829-1990)	"This doctoral investigation studied satirical colonial iconography in the French satirical illustrated press between 1829 and 1990. From counting and analysis of twenty-two satirical periodicals, representing di erent editorial lines, this thesis aims to inform an unknown part of this colonial iconography. Two serious illustrated papers complement the general corpus to reintegrate results in the general fields of media images. For a diachronic, the aim should be to identify the major axes of the colonial satirical illustration. To understand the construction, operation and role of colonial imagery from satirical titles, this research also intends to define the genre ""satirical press"". By analyzing the historical evolution, popular features and the hallmark of this media class, we will highlight the crucial relationship between gender and colonial images."

776	Prise de parole au féminin : la paix et les relations internationales dans les revendications du mouvement de femmes pour la paix en France (1919-1934)	Few people came out of the Great War (1914-1918) without dreaming of a better world. After four years of suffering and anguish, peace appears as a driving force for the populations that have been affected by the war, notably for those who have experienced its consequences first hand. A record number of peace movements emerged from the ashes of the war, many of which were specifically feminine. Deprived of the right to vote and therefore excluded from political life in a traditional sense, these movements created new grounds for women’s political action. Through their pacifism, they invested the political and social fields, and debated all the major issues of the interwar period.  It is in this perspective that women speak out: even if they have not seen the battlefields like men, they have also suffered during the conflict and claim their right to “create a new world”. These few women have long been left in the shadows: ignored because of their pacifism and their gender. The historiography of the interwar period in France has indeed neglected their work in the establishment of peace and in international relations. This thesis seeks to fill a void left by a historiography focused solely on political men and which links too strictly political actions and the right to vote. Looking at five women’s peace associations – the Section française de la Ligue internationale des femmes pour la paix et la liberté (SFLIFPL), the Ligue des femmes contre la guerre (LFCG), the Union féminine pour la Société des Nations (UFSDN), the Union fraternelle des femmes contre la guerre (UFFCG), and the Ligue internationale des mères et des éducatrices pour la paix (LIMEP) – this research offers a new analysis of international relations giving a gendered analysis of peace, reconciliation and disarmament. It also focuses on the discourse on women’s role and place in the after-war society and seeks to understand how these pacifists worked around their exclusion from political life to enter a field traditionally reserved to men.

777	Developmental, morphological, and behavioural plasticity in the reproductive strategies of stink bugs and their egg parasitoids	The environment shapes the physiology, morphology, and behaviour of organisms through complex, multidimensional ecological and evolutionary processes. The reproductive success of individual animals is determined by how well their phenotype is suited to an environment that is constantly changing over single and multi-generational time scales. At the same time, phenotypes are shaped by the environment, which triggers adaptive modifications of animal reproductive strategies while also imposing important constraints. In this thesis, using stink bugs and their parasitoids as model organisms, I considered how several types of plasticity can interact to influence biological fitness, and how plasticity in reproductive strategies responds to several important components of environmental change (host quality, ultraviolet radiation, temperature, biological invasions). Firstly, I compared the response of behavioural and life history traits to body size variation in the parasitoid Telenomus podisi Ashmead (Hymenoptera: Platygastridae), finding that reaction norms of behavioural traits more often had positive slopes than life history traits. Next, I found that the predatory stink bug Podisus maculiventris Say (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) can selectively control the colouration of its eggs. Egg pigmentation in this species protects embryos against ultraviolet radiation as part of a complex oviposition strategy that evolved in response to a suite of environmental factors. Then, I tested how thermal stress affects the memory dynamics of the parasitoid Trissolcus basalis (Wollaston) (Hymenoptera: Platygastridae) learning the reliability of chemical traces left by its host. These experiments revealed that both high and low stressful temperatures prevented forgetting, affecting the time allocation of parasitoids on patches of host chemical traces. I also developed a general framework to classify temperature’s effects on all aspects of ectotherm behaviour, distinguishing constraints from adaptive behavioural adjustments. Finally, I tested the ability of an indigenous parasitoid (T. podisi) to attack the eggs of a new invasive pest of agriculture, Halyomorpha halys Stål (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae). The results showed that T. podisi attacks the eggs of H. halys but cannot develop, demonstrating that the invasive pest is an “evolutionary trap” for indigenous parasitoids, which could indirectly benefit native stink bug species by acting as an egg and time sink for the parasitoid. These findings have important implications for how insects, including those involved in biological control programs, respond to environmental change.	entomologie , phenotypic plasticity , animal behaviour , reproductive biology , entomology , Pentatomidae , Platygastridae	en	13586.0
778	Trois essais en macroéconomie	Economic fluctuations represent the movements of economic growth. It may experience acceleration phases (expansion) or deceleration (recession), and even depression if the decline in production is persistent. Economic fluctuations are related to differences between actual growth and potential growth. They can be explained by supply and demand shocks, as well as by the credit cycle. In the first case, the conditions of production are modified. This is the case when the price of production factors (wages, raw materials prices) or external factors influencing the price of products (exchange rate) evolve. Thus, an increase in the price of production factors causes a negative shock and slows growth. This slowdown may also be due to a negative demand shock caused by an increase in product prices caused by a currency appreciation, causing a decrease in exports. The second case concerns the financial variables and financial assets. Thus, in a period of expansion, economic agents borrow more and have speculative behaviors in response to anticipated supply and demand shocks. The value of securities and financial assets increases, causing a bubble that eventually burst, causing a collapse in the value of assets. Therefore, economic activity cannot be funded. This is what generates a recession, sometimes profound, as in the recent financial crisis.  This thesis includes three essays on macroeconomic fluctuations and economic cycles, specifically on the topics described above. The first chapter deals with expectations about monetary policy and on the reaction of econonomic agents on these expectations. A particular emphasis is placed on the consumption of durable goods and indebtedness related to this type of consumption. The second chapter discusses the influence of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on labour demand in the Canadian manufacturing sector. Finally, the third chapter focuses on spillover, sometimes negative, of the real estate market on household consumption and the impact on property prices and household debt of demand expectations in the property market.  The first chapter, entitled ``Monetary Policy News Shocks and Durable Consumption'', provides insight on the link between durable goods spending and monetary policy news shocks. We propose and implement a new approach to identifying news shocks about future monetary policy. News shocks are identified recursively from the residuals of a monetary policy rule estimated using U.S. multi-horizon survey data. We then use those inferred news shocks in a structural VAR (SVAR). An expected monetary policy tightening leads to an increase in output, non-durable and durable goods consumption, and real price of durable goods. Although news shocks account for a significant fraction of output and consumption fluctuations, they contribute less than surprise shocks to economic fluctuations. We then carry out theoretical analysis using a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model with durable goods and nominal rigidities. Results indicate that a model with sticky durable goods price can reproduce the positive correlation between the response functions of durable and non-durable goods consumption to policy news shocks that was found from the SVAR.  The second chapter is entitled ``Exchange Rate Fluctuations and Labour Market Adjustments in Canadian Manufacturing Industries''. In this chapter, we estimate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on hours worked and jobs in Canadian manufacturing industries. The analysis is based on a dynamic model of labour demand and the econometric strategy employs a panel two-step approach for cointegrating regressions. Our data is drawn from a panel of 20 manufacturing industries, from Statistics Canada's KLEMS database, and covers a long sample period that includes two full exchange rate appreciation and depreciation cycles. We find that exchange rate fluctuations have economically and statistically significant effects on the labour decisions of Canadian manufacturing employers, and that these effects are stronger for trade-oriented industries.  Finally, the last chapter, entitled ``Housing Market Dynamics and Macroprudential Policy'', studies the statistical evidence suggesting a collateral link between the housing market and the rest of the economy and if the link is more demand- or supply-driven. We also followed the \textit{news shocks} literature and look if a housing-market boom-bust can arise endogenously following unrealized expectations of a rise in housing demand. To this end, we construct a New Keynesian model in which a fraction of households borrow against the value of their houses. We estimate the model with Canadian data using Bayesian methods. We assessed the model's ability to capture key features of consumption and house price data. Finally, we performed an analysis to determine how well the introduction of a countercyclical loan-to-value (LTV) ratio can reduced household indebtedness and housing price fluctuations compare to a monetary policy rule augmented with house price inflation. We find statistical evidence suggesting an important collateral link between the housing market and the rest of the economy, and this link is mainly driven by demand factors. We also find that the introduction of news shocks can generate a housing market boom-bust cycle, the bust following unrealized expectations on housing demand. Finally, our study also suggests that a countercyclical loan-to-value ratio is a useful policy to reduce the spillover from housing market to consumption via the collateral value.

779	Activism and participation among people of migrant background : discourses and practices of inclusiveness in four italian cities	As interest in the processes of integration of immigrants and ethnic minorities grows among European scholars, the role of multiple actors in shaping civic and political participation by people of migrant background needs to be further examined. Building on the literature on migration, this study addresses the following research question: What accounts for differences in forms of civic and political participation by activists of migrant background at the local level? In order to answer this question, I have mapped the forms of participation by activists of migrant background in four Italian cities, and examined the discourses and practices of multiple actors involved in the sphere of immigration under an increasingly hostile national environment.  To understand differences in participation, I argue that it is important to go beyond an exclusive consideration of the state and institutional actors, to look at both institutional and non-institutional actors, and to examine how, through their interaction, they shape opportunities and constraints for participation. This work investigate both conventional and non-conventional channels in four Italian cities and considers immigrant activists as relevant political actors, who are able to mobilize and shape participation through their interaction and alliances with the organizations of the receiving society.  This research presents three main findings. The first is that approaches to integration adopted by local actors matter. This study identified three main approaches to integration: 1) assistance, based on the idea that immigrants are in need and thus focuses on the promotion of delivery of services and advocacy; 2) intercultural, founded on the idea that immigrants are would-be citizens and that integration is reciprocal; and 3) political rights promotion, which focuses on the idea that immigrants are entitled to basic political rights, and thus encourages the opening of channels of participation to immigrants who are denied local voting rights. The empirical analysis shows that while the assistance approach does not encourage participation because it conceives immigrants as passive subjects, the other two approaches encourage civic and political participation respectively. Second, this study demonstrates that left-wing actors matter. It shows that the actors who contribute to opening channels for participation are not only moderate and institutional left-wing actors, such as local authorities, main political parties, and trade unions, but also radical and non-institutional left-wing organizations. Left-wing actors interpret and act differently with respect to immigration and participation and this affects how immigrant activists mobilize. Third, this study underlines the role of perception of the opportunities for participation and shows how activists of migrant background appropriate the discourses and practices of left-wing actors. It documents how immigrant activists respond to the opportunities offered by other actors and how they contribute to the opening of channels for participation by creating alliances with the left-wing organizations and by challenging the discourses and practices of local actors.

780	Les pèlerines, la religion vécue et la Roumanie postcommuniste	At the end of 1989, Romania embarked on a path towards democracy. From that moment on, the country has witnessed numerous changes, including a “religious revitalization.” The attraction of religion in post-communist Romania has sparked researchers’ interest; they have tried to explain what they judge contrary to theories of secularization and modernization. My thesis starts with a critique of these studies, which have too often neglected everyday actions of individuals. In the present study, I use a lived religion approach to understand the ways in which individuals understand, express, practice and experiment religion in their daily lives. In a reflexive manner, my thesis examines lived religion in post-communist Romania; it draws on fieldwork undertaken during pilgrimages in the spring and autumn of 2012 in monasteries known for their miracles, their charismatic confessors, or their relics. Because of their predominance during pilgrimages, women stand out as the main actors of lived religion in Romania. They are at the center of my thesis. Observing their beliefs and practices—without omitting the lived religion of the “carriers of official religion”—I set out to explore themes that represent as many facets of lived religion: fate, charisma, materiality, and relics. My thesis offers two research contributions to the sociology of religion. 1) The study of the pilgrim’s religious practice instructs us on the manner in which religion is understood and practiced in an Orthodox context. It also gives insight into the consequences of this practice in post-communist Romania: as it turns out, lived religion is a vehicle for values diverging from the official democratic discourse. 2) The study provides a theoretical and methodological contribution to the lived religion approach. Its empirical material indicates that lived religion stems from the Orthodox Church before circulating between women and church representatives. In this to-and-fro movement lived religion pertains to the pilgrims as well as to the “carriers of official religion.”	Orthodoxie , Lived religion , Pilgrimages , Romania , Post-Communism , Orthodoxy , Religious practice , Materiality , Orthodox Church	en	13577.0
781	The effects of additives and chemical modification on the solution properties of thermo-sensitive polymers	This thesis focused on the phase separation of two well-known thermoresponsive polymers, namely PNIPAM (poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)) and PIPOZ (poly(2-isopropyl-2-oxazoline).  Despite various studies of the two polymers, two aspects of their thermal properties remained unclear and needed to be investigated.  One is the cononsolvency effect of PNIPAM in water and a second water miscible solvent. The other is the effect of the end group properties on the phase separation of PIPOZ.   With this in mind, we first studied the effect of the chain architecture on the cononsolvency of PNIPAM in water/methanol mixture, employing a 4-arm star shape PNIPAM and a cyclic PNIPAM as model.  Tethering PNIPAM arms to a hydrophobic core resulted in a reduced Tc (cloud point temperature) and a lower phase transition enthalpy change.  The Tc of the star shape PNIPAM was inversely dependent on the polymer molecular weight.  The dehydration cooperativity was depressed for the star PNIPAM and cyclic PNIPAM due to topological constraints.  A study of the effect of polymer concentration on the cononsolvency of PNIPAM in water/methanol mixture revealed a macroscopic liquid-liquid phase separation (MLLPS) for PNIPAM in water/methanol mixtures of methanol molar fraction ranging from 0.127 to 0.421 at a polymer concentration of 10 g·L-1.  The turbid suspension of PNIPAM/water/methanol separated into a polymer rich phase coexisting with a polymer poor solution phase after equilibration for two days at room temperature.  The phase diagram showing the MLLPS for the PNIPAM/water/methanol mixtures was constructed based on experimental data.  The droplets in the condensed polymer rich phase showed a dependence on the methanol molar fraction.  Methanol affects the surface tension of the liquid droplets.  The slow equilibrium kinetics of PNIPAM phase separation was sped up and a macroscopic liquid-liquid phase separation realized. In order to study the effect of end groups on the solution properties of PIPOZ, two telechelic PIPOZ end capped with perfluorodecanyl groups (FPIPOZ) and octadecyl groups  (C18PIPOZ), respectively, were synthesized.  The Tc values of the telechelic polymers were greatly reduced after end-functionalization.  Stable micelles formed in aqueous solutions of the telechelic polymers. The micellization and phase separation of the telechelic polymers in water were studied.  The phase separation of the telechelic PIPOZs in water followed a liquid-liquid phase separation mechanism. Differences in the sizes of droplets formed inside of the two polymer solutions were observed.  To further investigate the differences in the association behaviour between the two telechelic polymer, NMR signal intensities and T1 and T2 relaxation times were examined. Higher 1H T2 values were obtained for the IPOZ unit in FPIPOZ than that in C18PIPOZ, indicating a higher mobility of the main chain in the FPIPOZ micelles than that in the C18PIPOZ micelles.  Together with the 13C NMR and 19F NMR relaxation studies, we obtained better knowledge of the association properties of the telechelic PIPOZ in water.  NMR relaxation studies proved to be efficient way of probing the solution behaviour of the polymers.

782	Architectures radiales hétéro-poly-métalliques pour la photosynthèse artificielle et le stockage de l'information	By a supramolecular strategy, radial hetero-poly-metallic architectures were obtained for applications in artificial photosynthesis and molecular magnetism.  The first part is devoted to the synthesis, as well as the photophysical characterization (UV-vis absorption, emission, electrochemistry, X-ray diffraction) of ruthenium(II) complexes bearing a wide range of polypyridine ligands. Theoretical calculations were performed to support the interpretation of the photophysical properties. Through their pendant pyridine moieties, these complexes were used as core of architectures, bearing rhenium tris-carbonyl (for antenna effects), and cobaloximes (for catalytic properties) complexes. The nuclearities obtained vary from two to seven according to the core involved. These systems were engaged in photo-production of hydrogen, demonstrating more efficient systems than the reference in the field, the archetypal [Ru(bpy)3]2+. The second part concerns the study of transition metal couples, built on polycyanometallate cores, or oxamide-bridged lanthanide-based assemblies. These “complex as ligand” and “assemblies as ligand” approaches allow us to obtain high nuclearity systems on which we seek single molecule magnet (SMM) properties or good magnetocaloric effect (based on CrNi, GdCu, DyCu). Photo-magnetic properties have been studied on the RuCu and MoCu couples, which can serve as molecular switches in complex systems. Finally, a tri-functional hetero-tetra-metallic architecture was obtained containing a MoCu switch, a CuTb SMM entity, and a ruthenium complex.

783	Développement d’outils analytiques pour la détection de biomolécules directement dans des fluides sanguins	This thesis discusses the development of surface plasmon resonnance (SPR) biosensors to perform detection directly on unpurified and undiluted blood based fluids such as serum or blood. Every biosensor discussed in the following chapters rely on a home-built portable SPR device developed in Professor Masson’s research laboratories. Non-specific adsorption, which greatly hinders biosensing in crude fluids, will be the first topic of the thesis. Serum adsorption was performed on the SPR sensor surface and then characterized by SPR and mass spectrometry. This study provided useful information for biosensing directly in blood-based fluids. It also provided a better fundamental understanding of the nonspecific adsorption process on surfaces.  The first biosensor was developed to detect prostate specific antigen (PSA), a protein normally contained in serum, which is a known biomarker for prostate cancer. In order to detect low concentrations of this protein directly in serum, a microstructured gold film was used to amplify the signal generated by the binding event on the biosensor. A peptide monolayer covered the metallic surface of the sensor to reduce non-specific protein adsorption. The SPR portable instrument was modified to simultaneous detect fluorescence in order to perform a SPR and ELISA test in a single instrumental platform. Each technique provided a control for the other for detection of the prostate cancer biomarker at concentration levels required for the screening of the disease. The SPR and ELISA combination also extended the dynamic range of the biosensing assay.  Finally, the portable SPR device was used to detect small biomolecules with potential therapeutic activity directly in a sample of blood. Peptides with an anti-atherosclerotic activity were thus detected in an unpurified and undiluted blood sample at micromolar concentration. The addition of a porous membrane to the microfluidic used for the biosensing assay facilitated the successful detection of these molecules in whole blood.  The present thesis describes novel strategies and instrumental modifications to unlock the possibility of performing biosensing directly on unpurified and undiluted blood-based fluids. Modifications of the fluidic system, the SPR instrument and biosensor used will allow detection in fluids with high complexity such as serum or blood. The work described herein reports a prostate cancer screening assay performed in 12 minutes directly in serum using a portable SPR/fluorescence instrument. Finally, this thesis reports one of the first scientific papers where a SPR biosensor is used to perform analysis directly in blood.

784	Role of histone methylation in the regulation of COX-2, iNOS, and mPGES-1 gene expression in human chondrocytes: Implication for Osteoarthritis	Osteoarthritis (OA) is a disabling disease classified as the most common form of arthritis worldwide. It is characterized by cartilage degeneration, synovium inflammation, and subchondral bone remodeling resulting in a loss of joint function. These structural and functional changes are due to numerous factors.  Cytokines, prostaglandins (PG), and reactive oxygen species are the major mediators implicated in the pathophysiology of OA. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a major pro-inflammatory cytokine that plays a crucial role in OA. IL-1 induces the expression of Cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2), microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), as well as their products prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and nitric oxide (NO). These are critical mediators of the inflammatory response during OA causing pain, swelling, and joint tissue destruction.  The activation of these pro-inflammatory genes results from different changes at the level of chromatin known as epigenetic modifications. Epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation and histone modifications play a crucial role in gene expression. Among these modifications, histone methylation/demethylation is the most critical one. Histone methylation/demethylation is mediated by two types of enzymes: histone methyltransferases (HMT) and histone demethylases (HDM) which can either activate or repress transcription. It is therefore necessary to understand the molecular mechanisms which underlie the regulation of COX-2, mPGES-1, and iNOS expression.   The objective of this study is to investigate whether histone methylation/demethylation can modulate COX-2, mPGES-1, and iNOS expression in IL-1 induced OA human chondrocytes.   We demonstrated that histone H3 lysine K4 (H3K4) methylation by SET-1A contributes to IL-1-induced COX-2 and iNOS expression in human OA Chondrocytes. We showed also that LSD1-mediated demethylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) contributes to IL-1β-induced mPGES-1 expression in human OA chondrocytes.  We found that levels of SET-1A and LSD1 expression are elevated in OA cartilage as compared with normal cartilage. Our data demonstrates, for the first time, the implication of histone methylation/demethylation in COX-2, mPGES-1, and iNOS regulation suggesting that these mechanisms could be a potential target for pharmacological intervention in the treatment of the pathophysiology of OA.

785	Caractérisation et objectivation de l’acouphène subjectif chronique idiopathique	"Objective: The main objective of this thesis was the implementation and validation of applying the gap prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle reflex (GPIAS) paradigm in humans, in order to objectively measure tinnitus. To do this, three experiments were carried out. Experiment 1 was designed to validate the inhibition of the acoustic startle reflex by using a short gap within high and low frequency narrowband noise in normal hearing humans (without tinnitus) to determine the optimal paradigm parameters. Experiment 2 was designed to validate the accuracy and the test-retest fidelity of a tinnitus psychoacoustic characterization method (intensity and frequency matching). Finally, Experiment 3 applied the GPIAS paradigm to participants with chronic tinnitus using the techniques developed in experiments 1 and 2. Methods: Experiment 1 included 157 participants tested with only one gap duration (5, 25, 50, 100, 200 ms) and with one of the two paradigms (gap imbedded in the background noise or following it) including high and low frequencies background noise. Experiment 2 included two groups of participants with tinnitus, one group consisting of musicians (n=16) and one group without musical experience (n=16). A third group consisted of adults who were instructed to simulate having tinnitus (n = 18). Tinnitus pitch and intensity matching abilities were assessed for all participants. A subgroup of participants was retested several weeks later. Experiment 3 included 15 participants with tinnitus and 17 controls assessed with the GPIAS. The psychoacoustic parameters of tinnitus were also measured. A subgroup of participants was retested several weeks later. Results: Experiment 1: the GPIAS is applicable in humans with normal hearing. Experiment 2: psychoacoustic measurements of tinnitus frequency and intensity using a computerized matching procedure produced precise and accurate measurements of the tinnitus percept. Experiment 3: an inhibition deficit was found using the GPIAS paradigm in the tinnitus group for background noise of high and low frequency compared to the control group, at test and retest. The frequency matching measurements revealed a 16,000 Hz tinnitus predominant frequency for most tinnitus participants. Discussion: It is possible to apply the gap prepulse inhibition of the startle reflex paradigm on human participants with tinnitus, as used in animal research to ""objectify"" the presence of tinnitus. However, the inhibition deficit found in the tinnitus group was not specific to their tinnitus frequency. This was validated by psychoacoustic tinnitus pitch matching. Our results question the original interpretation of the GPIAS paradigm for objectifying the presence of tinnitus."

786	Monoacylglycerol, alpha/beta-hydrolase domain-6, and the regulation of insulin secretion and energy metabolism	The glycerolipid/ free fatty acid (GL/FFA) cycle is a key metabolic pathway that links glucose and fatty acid metabolism and it consists of lipogenesis and lipolysis. GL/FFA cycling, especially in its lipolysis arm, generates various lipid signaling molecules to regulate insulin secretion in pancreatic ß-cells and non-shivering thermogenesis in adipocytes. Currently, the lipolysis-derived lipid signals involved in this process are uncertain.  Triglyceride hydrolysis in mammalian cells is accomplished by the sequential actions of adipose triglyceride lipase to produce diacylglycerol, by hormone sensitive lipase to produce monoacylglycerol (MAG) and by MAG lipase (MAGL) that releases free fatty acid and glycerol. Our work shows that in pancreatic ß-cell, the classical MAGL is poorly expressed and that MAG hydrolysis is mainly conducted by the newly identified α/β-Hydrolase Domain-6 (ABHD6). Inhibition of ABHD6 by its specific inhibitor WWL70, leads to long-chain saturated 1-MAG accumulation inside the cells, accompanied by enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). Decreasing the MAG levels by overexpression of ABHD6 in the ß-cell line INS832/13 reduces GSIS, while increasing MAG levels by ABHD6 knockdown enhances GSIS. Acute exposure of INS832/13 cells to various MAG species dose-dependently stimulates insulin secretion and restores GSIS suppressed by the pan-lipase inhibitor orlistat. Also, various biochemical and pharmacological experiments show that saturated 1-MAG levels species rather than unsaturated or 2-MAG species best correlate with insulin secretion. Furthermore, whole-body and β-cell-specific ABHD6-KO mice exhibit enhanced GSIS in vivo, and their isolated islets show elevated MAG production and GSIS. Inhibition of ABHD6 in low dose streptozotocin diabetic mice restores GSIS and improves glucose tolerance. Results further show that ABHD6-accessible MAGs not only enhance GSIS, but also potentiate fatty acid and non-fuel-induced insulin secretion without alteration in glucose oxidation and utilization as well as fatty acid oxidation. We have identified that MAG binds and activates the vesicle priming protein Munc13-1, thereby inducing insulin exocytosis. Based on all these observations, we propose that lipolysis-derived saturated 1-MAG acts as a metabolic coupling factor to regulate insulin secretion and ABHD6 is a negative modulator of insulin secretion. Besides its role in ß-cells, ABHD6 is also highly expressed in adipocytes and its level is increased with obesity. Mice globally lacking ABHD6 on high fat diet (HFD) show modestly reduced food intake, decreased body weight gain, insulinemia and fasting glycemia and improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity and enhanced locomotor activity. In addition, ABHD6-KO mice display increased energy expenditure and cold-induced thermogenesis. In accordance with this, these mice show elevated UCP1 level in white and brown adipocytes, indicating browning of white adipocytes. The browning phenotype is reproduced in the mice either chronically treated with the ABHD6 inhibitor WWL70 or an antisense oligonucleotides targeting ABHD6. White and brown adipose tissues isolated from whole body ABHD6 KO mice show greatly elevated levels of 1-MAG, but not 2-MAG. Increasing MAG levels by either exogenous administration of 1-MAG or ABHD6 inhibition or genetic deletion induces browning of white adipocytes in a cell-autonomous manner. Further evidence indicates that 1-MAGs can transactivate PPARα and PPARγ and the browning effect induced by WWL70 or exogenous MAG is abolished by PPARα and PPARγ antagonists. In vivo administration of the PPARα antagonist GW6471 to ABHD6 KO mice partially reversed the ABHD6-KO effects on body weight gain, and abolishes the enhanced thermogenesis, white adipose browning and fatty acid oxidation in brown adipose tissue. All these observations indicate that ABHD6 regulates not only insulin and glucose homeostasis but also energy homeostasis and adipose tissue function.  Thus, ABHD6-accessible 1-MAG not only acts as a metabolic coupling factor to regulate fuel and non-fuel induced insulin secretion by activating Munc13-1 in beta cells, but also regulates glucose, insulin and energy homeostasis. The latter effects are mediated at least in part via browning of white adipocytes and enhanced brown fat function through the activation of PPARα and PPARγ. Collectively these findings suggest that ABHD6 is a promising target for developing therapeutics against obesity, type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome.

787	Jürgen Habermas et la théorie de l'agir communicationnel : la question de l'éducation	The Theory of Communicative Action (1981), by the German theorist Jürgen Habermas, is among the most important works of sociology and social philosophy of the 20th century: its universal character, which aims to develop a comprehensive theory of the Western modern society, benefits from a well-established reputation in a variety of academic fields from social sciences (philosophy, sociology, anthropology, political science, law, history, ethics, etc.). However, to date, Habermas's theory has only inspired a limited number of studies in education in terms of the nature and aims of the educational activity or the theoretical characterization of institutionalized education in Modernity : thus, how does the theory of communicative action allow us to better understand the foundations of education’s historical, social and political development in Europe and North America? As a theory of society based on a communicative reinterpretation of the concept of rationality, how does Habermas's theory, as a prolongation of the educational and philosophical traditions at the sources of the Western modern school, can inform us about the mechanisms of the pedagogical relationship between teachers and students? In proposing a series of considerations to answer these questions, this thesis is both a study of the relationship between the philosophical and sociological thought of Habermas and a strong critic of his perspective : the central issue that remains unanswered from the philosopher is the child's status in such a rationalistic system that, despite its emancipatory and liberating ideals for the social actor, perpetuates a form of denial of childhood present in the rationalist tradition from Plato to Kant. How can we then reflect on contemporary education regarding Habermas's theory? How, finally, can we conceptualize education with and against Habermas?

788	La réclamation en dommages punitifs et son effet sur l’assurance responsabilité : analyse de la faute intentionnelle et de l’atteinte illicite et intentionnelle	Claims for punitive damages have proliferated over the years before the courts. For such claim to be granted, it is required to demonstrate an unlawful and intentional interference with any right or freedom protected by the Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms. Liability claims can be covered by insurance. However, the Civil Code of Québec specifically provides that the insurer is never bound to indemnify the insured’s intentional fault. Does this mean that the insurer has no obligation towards its insured when punitive damages are sought? The question is thus whether the concept of intentional fault and of unlawful and intentional interference are concepts that are equivalent or that need to be distinguished. For this analysis, the two concepts will be adressed in depth. The origin of these two concepts, their founding principles and their interpretation will be discussed to ultimately define these terms as precisely as possible. These definitions will then help to compare these two concepts and determine in the end that there are several elements that differentiate these concepts, particularly in regard to the required intent, with the result that they can not be assimilated. This conclusion will have a definite impact on the insurer’s obligations to defend the insured and to indemnify the victim for compensatory damages if punitive damages are also sought. Therefore, the insurer cannot justify its refusal to defend or indemnify solely on the basis of the evidence of an unlawful and intentional interference.

789	Increased spinal pain sensitization : a new explanation for highly prevalent painful somatic symptoms in major depressive disorder?	Objectives: Although patients suffering from major depressive disorder (MDD) often complain from painful symptoms, the relationship between pain and depression has yet to be clearly characterized. Only recently have studies employing temporal summation paradigms offered some preliminary insight into the co-occurrence of pain and depression. This study sets out to evaluate the contribution of spinal and supraspinal processes in pain sensitization in MDD using a temporal summation paradigm. Subjects: Thirteen healthy controls and fourteen MDD patients were included in the final analysis. Methods: To induce temporal summation, we used low- and high-frequency intermittent stimulations of the sural nerve. Spinal pain sensitization was quantified by measuring the change in the amplitude of the nociceptive-specific flexion reflex (NFR) response, and supraspinal pain sensitization was obtained by measuring change in subjective pain rating, from the low- to high-frequency stimulation condition. Results: We found an increased sensitization in the NFR response in MDD patients in the high-frequency condition, which did not translate into an increased amplification of their subjective responses during testing. However, we found a positive association between spinal sensitization and painful somatic symptoms in MDD patients. Conclusion: Together, these results suggest increased spinal pain sensitization in MDD, which might explain the high prevalence of painful somatic symptoms in these patients.

790	La construction de la conjugalité chez des conjoints de couples formés sur des sites de rencontre en ligne : une perspective interactionniste symbolique	The couple is at the beginning of the family, which is the fundamental cell of the society and one of the main places of people solidarity. Though, from a few years, the inrush of internet has favoured the establishment of new social rules in relationship that we can identify in the new way of encountering somebody or fall into love. The appearance of dating websites has namely favoured to individuals to encounter a partner on a website at the convenience. This study aims to a better understanding of the social phenomenon of the marrital construction from the meeting from a dating website and going from the own perceptions of the participants interviewed. Our purpose was to demonstrate as Marie-Chantal Doucet (2009) that the action of the individual on the dating websites was not due to some determinations but benefited rather of a scope allowing him to perform codes and to make clear senses to his action as to the others actions because the individual is performing a character on the dating website. In order to carry out this study, we have adopted a theoretical framework which is a part of the symbolic interactionism perspective by supporting an grounded theory approach. It emerses from the qualitative method that we have carried out that the marrital construction is, above all, the result of the face to face dating after dating the partner on the dating website because dating on a website is still labelled by a stigma and it is the place of the human body commoditification that the dating website are not conducive to the feeling of closeness which favor the development of a matrimonial bond.

791	Dérivation de diagrammes de séquence UML compactes à partir de traces d’exécution en se basant des heuristiques	We propose an approach for extracting sequence diagrams from object-oriented programs by combining static and dynamic analysis. Our objective is to derive compact yet informative diagrams to ease the understanding of a program’s behavior. To this end, we define a set of heuristics to filter unimportant execution events and abstract control structures such as loops and recursions. We also group objects based on their respective types. To cover variations of the same behavior, our approach considers and aligns multiple execution traces. Our approach was evaluated on an ATM Banking simulation system. The case study shows that our approach produces concise, yet informative sequence diagrams.

792	Study of Langmuir-Blodgett Films of Self-Assembled Diblock Copolymers	Self-assembly of block copolymers (BCPs) attracts much interest due to their ability to spontaneously generate ordered materials with unique properties. For many applications, such as masks in nanolithography, separation membranes in medical diagnostics, and nanotemplates for nanowire fabrication, manufacturing into thin films is required. The Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) and Langmuir-Schaefer (LS) techniques are commonly used to produce ultrathin or monolayer films at the air/water interface that are transferred to solid substrates. LB/LS films of amphiphilic BCPs self-assemble into various morphologies, depending on the BCP composition and other factors. In our work, we investigated LB/LS films of polystyrene-b-poly(4-vinyl pyridine) (PS-P4VP) and their supramolecular complexes with, naphthol (NOH), naphthoic acid (NCOOH) and 3-n-pentadecylphenol (PDP). The first part of the thesis was devoted to the investigation of PS-P4VP complexes with NOH and NCOOH, in comparison to PS-P4VP alone. It was shown that a plateau in the Langmuir isotherm, indicative of a first-order transition, is absent at high spreading solution concentrations for the complexes. This was correlated with an absence of the expected dot morphology with 2D hexagonal-like order at low surface pressure. Above the transition, when present, the morphology has 2D square order. The second part of the thesis re-examines the PS-P4VP/PDP system, which was previously shown to undergo a transition from 2D hexagonal to square order at the isotherm plateau pressure. This was confirmed here, and a detailed ATR-IR study of LB films was then undertaken to better understand molecular-level changes occurring at this transition. It was found that, contrary to another study in the literature on a different system, there is no change in alkyl chain orientation. Instead, it was found that the pyridine group loses its low-pressure orientation and there is increased phenol-pyridine hydrogen-bonding above the transition pressure, which is rationalized by a partial collapse of the low-pressure molecularly ordered P4VP monolayer at the transition pressure. This study leads to an improved understanding of the processes occurring at the air/water interface, which is a basis for the further possible applications of LB/LS films in nanotechnologies.

793	Reconnaissance des actions humaines : méthode basée sur la réduction de dimensionnalité par MDS spatio-temporelle	Human action in a video sequence can be seen as a space-time volume induced by the concatenation of silhouettes in time. We present a space-time approach for human action recognition, which exploits global characteristics generated by the technique of dimensionality reduction MDS and a cube division into sub-blocks to model the dynamics of the actions. The objective is to provide a method that is simple, inexpensive and robust allowing simple action recognition. The process is fast, does not require video alignment, and is applicable in many scenarios. Moreover, we demonstrate the robustness of our method to partial occlusion, deformation of shapes, significant changes in scale and viewpoint, irregularities in the performance of an action, and low-quality video.

794	Caractère intrinsèque des matrices de Stokes	It is well known that a linear differential equation, x^(k+1)Y' = A(x)Y, near a non-resonant irregular singular point is uniquely determined (up to analytic isomorphism) by : (1) its formal normal form, (2) the collection of its Stokes matrices. By definition, the Stokes matrices depend on an order defined on the real parts of the eigenvalues of the system which can be perturbed by a rotation in the x coordinate. In this paper, we have established the intrinsic character of the dependency : we have described how the new Stokes collection is obtained from the first collection after a rotation in x which changes the order on the real parts of the eigenvalues. The first chapter contains preliminaries concerning the normal form of an ordinary differential equation and a chapter on the Stokes phenomenon for linear differential equations. The third chapter contains our results.	solutions propres , Classification analytique , Classification formelle , Stokes Phenomenon , Linear differential equations , Irregular singularity , Eigensolutions , Analytic classification , Formal classification	en	13444.0
795	Surveillance non invasive de la réponse neuroimmunitaire fœtale à l’infection	Introduction. In utero, the infection of maternal and fetal membranes, chorioamnionitis, goes frequently unnoticed and, especially when combined with acidemia due to occlusions of the umbilical cord as they occur during labour, can result in brain damage and long term neurological sequelae peri- and postnatally. Currently, there is no way to early detect these pathological conditions to prevent or limit lasting neurological deficits.  Hypotheses. (1) the fetal electroencephalogram (EEG), obtained from the scalp could serve as a useful ancillary tool to the existing fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring for early detection of fetal acidemia and neurological injury; (2) the sampling rate of fetal ECG has a significant impact on the continuous FHR monitoring in the prediction of fetal acidemia; 3) patterns of FHR variability will reflect fetal baseline and inflammatory states; (4) FHR variability analysis should permit prediction of pH and base excess (BE) at birth. Methods. In a series of studies using the chronically instrumented unanesthetized fetal sheep and clinical cohort, we modeled 1) worsening fetal acidemia with intermittent hypoxia resulting from umbilical cord occlusions (UCO) of increasing severity as experimental model of human labour to test the 1st and 2nd hypotheses; 2) moderate fetal inflammation by administering lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to test the 3rd hypothesis and 3) prediction of pH and BE status at birth using clinically validated FHR variability measures in a clinical cohort of laboring women to test the 4th hypothesis.  Results. Repetitive UCO resulted in marked acidosis (pH arterial 7.35±0.01 to 7.00±0.01), decreased EEG amplitudes synchronized with UCO-induced FHR decelerations and pathological arterial blood pressure decreases; in addition, we detected a significant increase in FHR variability with worsening acidemia when sampled at 1000 but not at 4 Hz, the sampling rate used clinically. LPS administration resulted in systemic fetal inflammation with IL-6 peaking at 3 h and FHR variability changes tracking this temporal cytokine profile precisely. In the clinical cohort, a statistical model based on a matrix of 103 FHR variability measures predicted pH (R2 = 0.90, P < 0.001), but not BE, from one hour of FHR recording prior to pushing stage. Conclusions. The decrease in the EEG amplitude suggests an adaptive and neuroprotective brain shut-down; fetal EEG may complement the FHR monitoring during labour to improve early detection of incipient acidemia. FHR variability changes can detect early developing hypoxic-acidemia when sampled at 1000 Hz, but not when sampled at 4 Hz suggesting that a more sensitive mode of fetal ECG acquisition will improve early acidemia detection. Distinctive subsets of FHR variability measures permit online monitoring of fetal inflammation from ECG opening a new approach to characterizing the fetal inflammatory profile. Clinical bedside prediction of pH and BE monitoring at birth using FHR variability monitoring will allow more accurate decision making in obstetrics during labour	Foetus , EEG , monitoring , asphyxie , inflammation , LPS , Fetus , FHR , HRV , acidosis , asphyxia , hypoxia , sampling rate , clinical study , labour	en	13441.0
796	Une démarche participative pour soutenir la communication graphique de la responsabilité sociale d’une organisation : le cas de l’Institut EDDEC	Organizations are increasingly choosing to implement corporate social responsibility in their activities. To do so, they are invited to consider the environmental, social and economic impacts of their activities and decisions and, consequently, share it with their stakeholders. These commitments are conveyed to the audience through different medias created by a graphic designer. Since corporate social responsibility knowledge is complex and unique to each organization, the designer has to carefully understand the organization’s message in order to create medias that are consistent in their form and content. To help the graphic designer respond to this challenge, a participative approach was tested through this research. The objective was to observe and document, while collaborating with a group of stakeholders, on a graphic design project and understand how a participative approach can support the graphic communication of an organization’s corporate social responsibility. The graphic design of the corporate identity and the medias of EDDEC Institute of environment, sustainable development and circular economy was selected to conduct this research. A methodology, inspired by action-research, was chosen to identify, with the project’s stakeholders, the brakes and levers of the approach. The results are confirming the general benefits of the participative approach to the creative process. Stakeholders were able to share and visualize their understanding of the organization’s corporate social responsibility. The iterative process, which is part of the approach, also helped the appropriation of the corporate identity by the organization’s stakeholders. Despite these positive aspects, limitations due to short delays and insufficient human and financial resources were major constraints in supporting the participative approach during the entire process. Recommendations towards the improvement of this participative approach were then formulated for its eventual usage by the graphic design community and its clients, in order to communicate their corporate social responsibility.

797	Saint-Maron : une paroisse diasporique : église et fidèles maronites à Montréal (1969-2015)	Maronite immigration to Montreal started at the end of the 19th century. During the 1970s and 1990s, massive waves of Lebanese immigrants arrived to Montreal due to the wars in Lebanon. The Maronite Church is fully Roman Catholic but has a syriac-antiochean rite. Maronite immigrants did not have their own parish in Montreal and had to go for célébrations in the Oriental Catholic Church which was created by Montreal clerical authorities and served by Greek-Catholics (Melkites) of the Saint-Sauveur order. In 1969, Father Élias Najjar from the Maronite mariamite order, together with Maronites from Egypt, founded the first Maronite parish in Montreal. This thesis aims to study the process behind the constitution of the first parish, its evolution and the life of its parishioners by using a narrative and descriptive approach in the frame of the social and religious history. Results show a national Church and a new model of Maronite diasporic parish, different from the classical one, having subnational, international and inter-confessional diversities.

798	Role of the Protein Tyrosine Kinase 7 gene in human neural tube defects	Neural tube defects (NTDs) are among the most common congenital defects with a high incidence of 1-2 per 1000 births, causing a heavy burden to both the families and society. Various types of NTDs result from defects happening in the neurulation process during vertebrate embryonic development. In order to prevent the occurrence of NTDs, understanding the underlying mechanism is a prerequisite. The etiology of NTDs is complex involving environmental and genetic factors. Folic acid supplementation was proven to efficiently decrease the frequency of NTDs by 50-70% depending on the time point of this supplementation and demographic background. Gene identification studies in NTDs have adopted mainly a candidate gene approach investigating folate-related genes and genes derived from animal models. In particular, studies in mouse models have demonstrated a strong association between the non canonical Wnt/Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) pathway and NTDs.  Protein Tyrosine Kinase 7 (PTK7) is a member of the PCP pathway and was shown to cause a very severe form of NTDs called craniorachischisis in a mouse model. Ptk7 genetically interacts with a core PCP member Vangl2 where double heterozygotes suffer from spina bifida.  These data make PTK7 a strong candidate for NTDs in humans. We sequenced the coding region and the exon-intron junctions of PTK7 in a cohort of 473 patients affected with various forms of open and closed NTDs. Novel and rare variants (<1%) were genotyped in a cohort of 473 individuals. Their pathogenic effect was predicted in silico and functionally in an overexpression assay in a well established zebrafish model.  We identified in our cohort 6 novel rare mutations, 3 of which are absent in all public databases, in 1.1% of our NTD cohort.  One variant, p.Gly348Ser, acted as a hypermorph when overexpressed in the zebrafish model. Our findings implicate mutation of PTK7 as a risk factor for NTDs and provide additional evidence for a pathogenic role of PCP signaling in these malformations.

799	Impact de l’hyperglycémie et de l’infection sur le transport ionique, la réparation épithéliale et l’action des correcteurs dans les voies aériennes en Fibrose kystique	Cystic fibrosis (CF), caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, is characterized by dysfunctional Cl- secretion and an imbalance in ion/fluid transport resulting in a decrease in mucociliary clearance. Accumulation of mucus then occurs and this favors bacterial infection in the airways. Chronic infection and inflammation is then responsible for progressive injuries to the lung epithelium. These mechanisms are associated with a decline in lung function, the main cause of morbidity and mortality in CF. The recent improvement in clinical care of patients with CF has led to an increase in median life expectancy, which allows the emergence of comorbidities, such as CF-related diabetes (CFRD). Because Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection and CFRD have been associated with decreased lung function, we investigated their impact on ion transports and epithelial repair, two main functions of airway epithelia. First, our results showed a reduction in Cl- secretion by CFTR and total K+ currents through CF and non-CF airway epithelial cells in hyperglycemic conditions. Moreover, our data indicated a decrease in wound closure rates of airway cell monolayers after exposure to high glucose. We also demonstrated an impairment of the beneficial effect of CFTR correctors on repair rates. The second part of our studies reveals a deleterious impact of Pseudomonas aeruginosa diffusible material (PsaDM) on CFTR expression and function in non-CF airways cells. Importantly, we showed, for the first time, that the presence of PsaDM altered the functional rescue of mutated CFTR by correctors and dampened their beneficial effect on CF wound repair. Finally, we tested several different combinations of corrector and potentiators in order to identify the most efficient compounds to improve the repair rates of CF monolayers despite the presence of PsaDM. Overall, our research demonstrated a deleterious impact of CFRD and PsaDM on ion transports and wound closure. Moreover, the new therapies with correctors may also be impacted by these two components.

800	Multisite Research Ethics Review: Problems and Potential Solutions	Large scale, multisite clinical research trials have been increasing in frequency. As it stands currently, a research project performed at multiple institutions requires ethics review at each institution. While local (institutional) review may be necessary in some instances, repetitive reviews may require unnecessary changes and not serve to further protect participants. Multiple ethics reviews of a single study have been shown to delay research and require, in some cases, significant resources in order to fulfill the requests of individual ethics boards. This literature review discusses the conceptual issues and outlines empirical research surrounding multisite ethics review from different jurisdictions, as well as alternative methods to streamline the ethics review process including reciprocal review, centralized review, and a proposed modification to the centralized review process.	multisite research , human subject research , research ethics board , institutional review board , reciprocal review , centralized review , multisite ethics review	en	13387.0
801	Activité antimicrobienne de peptides provenant d’hydrolysats de protéines de babeurre, de lactoferrine et de pois	Antibiotics are frequently used in poultry feed in order to prevent certain diseases, including necrotic enteritis, which causes the emergence of bacterial strains resistant to antibiotics. A promising alternative is the use of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) as dietary supplements, such as AMPs from dairy products. The objective of this project was to develop a production method for the extraction peptides, from co-produced food processing (buttermilk, lactoferrin, pea protein isolates). These peptides were tested for the detection of antimicrobial activity on the following specific poultry pathogens; Salmonella Enteritidis, Salmonella Typhimurium, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Proteins were suspended in water (5% w/w) and pepsin hydrolyzed by pepsin for 6 hours at pH 2.5. Peptides were recovered by ultrafiltration (< 10 kDa) and fractionated based on the basis of their ionic charges: total, cationic, anionic and unbound peptides, to specifically target the fractions with antimicrobial activities. Bacterial survival was measured in contact with different peptides concentrations. Cationic buttermilk extracts were effective at a concentration less or equal to 5 mg / mL; loss of 3 log for Escherichia coli O78: H80, compared with lactoferrin which was effective at a concentration less than or equal to 0.6 mg / mL; loss of 6 log for E. coli O78: H80. The peptide extracts from pea showed low efficiency. The use of antimicrobial peptides, from buttermilk, lactoferrin and peas, is promising for the development of an alternative or a complement to reduce antimicrobial use.

802	Herpesviruses including novel gammaherpesviruses are widespread among phocid seal species in Canada	Little is known about herpesviruses in Canadian pinnipeds. We measured prevalence of antibodies to herpesviruses in the sera from Canadian phocid seals by an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Wild harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) and captive harbor seals were positive for antibodies to Phocid herpesvirus 1 (PhoHV-1) at prevalences of 91% and 100%, respectively. Sera from wild hooded seals (Cystophora cristata), harp seals (Pagophilus groenlandica), and grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) were positive for antibodies to PhoHV-1 antigenically related herpesvirus antigens at 73%, 79%, and 96%, respectively. We isolated new herpesviruses in cell culture from two hunter-harvested ringed seals (Pusa hispida) in poor body condition from Ulukhaktok, Northwest Territories, Canada; one lethargic hooded seal from the St. Lawrence Estuary, Québec, Canada; and one captive, asymptomatic harp seal from the Magdalen Islands, Québec. Partial sequencing of the herpesvirus DNA polymerase gene revealed that all four virus isolates were closely related to PhoHV-2, a member of the Gammaherpesvirinae subfamily, with nucleotide similarity ranging between 92.8% and 95.3%. The new seal herpesviruses were genetically related to other known pinniped herpesviruses, such as PhoHV-1, Otariid herpesvirus 3, Hawaiian monk (Monachus schauinslandi) seal herpesvirus, and Phocid herpesvirus 5 with 47–48%, 55%, 77%, and 70–77% nucleotide similarities, respectively. The harp seal herpesvirus and both ringed seal herpesviruses were almost identical to each other, whereas the hooded seal herpesvirus was genetically different from the three others (92.8% nucleotide similarity), indicating detection of at least two novel seal herpesviruses. These findings are the first isolation, partial genome sequencing, and identification of seal gammaherpesviruses in three species of Canadian phocid seals; two species of which were suspected of exposure to one or more antigenically related herpesviruses based on serologic analyses.

804	Fragilisation de la santé mentale et suicidalité chez les infirmières novices : mesures de prévention organisationnelles	The first months of novice nurses’ job is very stressful and can be experienced by them with difficulty. Following the deaths of some Quebec nurses, including a novice nurse, in the last five years, it is appropriate to ask whether the work related stress does not contribute to the risk of suicidality (suicidal thoughts, suicidal ideation, suicide attemps, completed suicides) of novice nurses. Therefore, the aim of the work is to propose, on the basis of established knowledge about the organizational factors that can contribute to the suicide of novice nurses, suicide prevention measures to the attention of managers. With its central concepts : work organization, the sources of suffering and defensive strategies, the framework of the psychodynamics of work of Dejours (1993) was selected to guide and structure the integrative literature review; the latter being composed of 26 empirical studies, seventeen theoretical writings and one book. From this review, it appears that the organization of work can be a source of suffering for novice nurses. The latter also face several organizational sources of suffering (high workload, stress at work, lack of support, etc.) and, although novices can deploy some adaptation strategies, these suffering undermine their mental health and help to increase their risk of suicide. In this spirit, an organizational prevention program of suicidality among novice nurses is proposed to the attention of managers, which includes several organizational measures that can be implemented in Quebec’s health care organizations.	suicidality , novice nurse , mental health	en	13138.0
805	Intervention éducative pour soutenir le développement d’un sentiment de maîtrise du rôle paternel chez des futurs pères	Background. Paternal implication benefits all members of the family (Allen and Daly, 2002). Therefore, it is recommended to encourage fathers’ engagement during the prenatal period (Deave and Johnson, 2008). However, the actual content and format of prenatal classes, which represent an ideal occasion to address fathers' role (Agence de santé publique du Canada, 2007), are not adapted to respond to their unique needs (Kowlessar, Fox and Wittkowski, 2014; Premberg and Lundgren, 2006). Consequently, fathers-to-be may feel unprepared for their paternal role (Deave and Johnson, 2008). Method. An innovative and interactive educational intervention, inspired by several prenatal programs, was elaborated, implemented, and evaluated with six fathers-to-be in a local community health centre providing antenatal classes, in order to develop a feeling a mastery of their paternal role. The conceptual framework of Preventive Role Supplementation (Swendsen, Meleis et Jones, 1978) guided this clinical project, which consisted of four educational sessions and brochures, in complement to the prenatal classes. Results. The participants developed a sentiment of paternal role mastery, which was confirmed through knowledge of the behaviors, sentiments, goals, costs and rewards regarding the anticipated role. However, they acquired more knowledge on the behaviors associated to the role and less on the anticipated costs and rewards. Finally, they were very satisfied with the content and interactive format of the intervention. Recommendations. As this educational intervention was appreciated and helped fathers-to-be with their transition to paternity, it would be recommended to implement it in other settings offering prenatal classes. Nevertheless, further studies are necessary to validate the results obtained in this clinical project.	Paternal role , Prenatal , Educational intervention , Nursing	en	13136.0
806	"L’optimisation de la performance des services infirmiers : miser sur des pratiques de gestion
utilisées par les organisations hautement performantes"	Background: The implementation of high performing work practices is widely established in high performing organizations from different sectors, but few in healthcare organizations. Strategic human resource management is a lever underutilized that would allow healthcare organizations to optimize their performance. The aim of this supervised study is to identify, from the writings on high performing organizations, high performing work practices that can be implemented by head nurses to improve the performance of nursing services and propose implementation strategies. Methodology: The High Performance Work Practices model proposed by Sung & Ashton (2005) was chosen as a reference. PubMed, CINAHL and Emerald databases were reviewed for the literature search as well as Google for grey literature. A total of thirty articles were selected. Finally, the Nursing Care Performance Framework (NCPF) (Dubois & al, 2013) was chosen as an analytical framework. Results: Literature analysis identifies three main dimensions: staff development, information and staff involvement and reward. The analysis shows that these practices as a bundle lead to better results than if used individually. The bundle of these practices influences the performance of nursing services by helping to acquire, maintain and deploy resources, to transform resources into services and to produce change in patients conditions. Six main factors facilitating the implementation and sustainability of the use of high performing work practices are identified: skills of middle management, organizational culture, alliance with key partners, resources availability, support measures and measurement of results Conclusion: The use of high performing work practices related to staff development, information and staff involvement and reward could help to improve nursing services performance by acquiring, deploying and maintaining resources, by transforming resources into services and by producing changes in patients conditions.

807	"Étude de l’effet de la metformine sur la survie cellulaire et 
sur la réparation de l’ADN chez la levure"	Recently, metformin has been widely used to treat hyperglycemia of humans that have type II diabetes mellitus. Recently, some epidemiological studies have showed that populations of individuals being treated with metformin showed lower incidence of cancer. For example, there is a 78 % and 46 % reduction in the incidences of liver and pancreatic cancers, respectively. It has also been demonstrated that metformin protects against skin cancers caused by ultraviolet radiation-B (UVB) DNA damage. In this study, I have demonstrated that metformin significantly protects the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae from ultraviolet radiation-C (UVC) and from ultraviolet radiation-A (UVA)-induced death. I also showed that metformin increases the recruitment of the histone Htz1 linked to chromatin. In an htz1Δ strain, the metformin protection from UVAinduced death is significantly reduced. Htz1 is important for the recruitment of Rad14 to sites of DNA damage, important for the detection of these sites. Furthermore, nuclear recruitment of Rad14 was significantly increased in cells previously treated with metformin. In the absence of Htz1, the survival rate to UVA exposure in presence of metformin drops significantly. So, Htz1 and Rad14 are two key proteins involved in the protection by metformin against UV DNA damage. With all the results of this study, it was shown that metformin can confer some protection against UVC and UVA for yeast.

808	La «koinônia» des Actes des apôtres : analyse structurelle du verset 2,42 et de son contexte d’insertion	Jesus of Nazareth used to place much importance on commensality, so much that he wished the common meal to be the particular environment for both actions on bread and wine Jesus did during the Last Supper. For several generations, the memorial of Jesus Last Supper kept on being celebrated in its original context by Christians. But it was later separated from the communal meal.  Does the word koinwnia in Acts 2:42 denote those communal meals during which Christian gatherings were held?  The importance of common meals in the early community will be highlighted here through a funnel-type structural analysis of Acts 2-5. But it will be shown also that the meaning of koinwnia is more extended than the common meal alone, and just as concrete and active as the three other elements listed in verse 2:42.

809	Les issues périnatales des femmes avec prééclampsie récidivante : une étude rétrospective	OBJECTIVE: To assess whether a recurrent preeclampsia compared to the preeclampsia that occurred at the first pregnancy was more at risk of preterm delivery at < 37 weeks of gestation. Secondary outcomes were intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and maternal morbidity.  STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective cohort study including 383 women with preeclampsia who delivered at Sainte-Justine Hospital in Montreal (Canada) from 2001 to 2011. Among these, 128 women developed a recurrent preeclampsia in their subsequent pregnancy.   RESULTS: Among women with a recurrent preeclampsia (n = 128), no significant differences were found in the rates of preterm delivery and IUGR between the first and the subsequent pregnancy. Women with a recurrent preeclampsia were more at risk of chronic hypertension (p = 0.001) and gestational diabetes (p = 0.02) in their second pregnancy. Furthermore, women with recurrent preeclampsia had, at their first pregnancy, a higher rate of severe preeclampsia (p < 0.001), eclampsia and adverse criteria (p = 0.007), than women who experienced a single preeclampsia (n = 255). The Relative Risk to experience a recurrent preeclampsia at the second pregnancy, if a woman had the above criteria at the first pregnancy, was 1.60 (95%CI 1.17 - 2.18).  CONCLUSION: Recurrent preeclampsia was not associated with a higher rate of preterm delivery. Women who experienced a severe preeclampsia, an eclampsia or adverse criteria in a first pregnancy were more at risk to have a recurrent preeclampsia in the subsequent pregnancy.

810	Développement des connaissances et compétences alimentaires, culinaires et nutritionnelles chez les jeunes : le cas des Brigades Culinaires	Context. For the last few decades, we have noticed a decrease in the number of opportunities to observe and hand down food preparation skills to youth, encouraging a cooking and food preparation skills evolution. This evolution has an impact on teenagers’ food choices and probably, on the overall population’s health. In order to educate Quebec high school adolescents in the field of cooking and to help them develop food self-efficacy, a culinary program of 24 cooking classes, the Brigades Culinaires, was initiated by la Tablée des Chefs. Objectives. The primary aim is to evaluate if the program’s specific objectives of nutrition, culinary and food education were reached, and to measure the potential classes have to arouse adolescents’ career interests in cooking, nutrition or agriculture. Methodology. During the 2013-2014 project, data were collected using two questionnaires. The ‘’pre‘’ questionnaire was distributed at the beginning of the academic year to measure future participants’ knowledge and interest in food, nutrition and cooking. The ‘’post‘’questionnaire was handed out at the end of the cooking classes to measure achievement of the nutrition, culinary and food education specific objectives. Teenagers’ interests in career choices related to cooking, nutrition and agriculture were also measured twice. Data were analyzed with SPSS to generate descriptive statistics. The 2013-2014 project grouped 33 schools in Quebec. It received ethical approval by the Comité d’éthique de la recherche en santé de la faculté de médecine de l’Université de Montréal (CERES) and financial support from Québec en Forme. Results. Results obtained from the Brigades Culinaires participants’ evaluation measures (325 ‘’pre‘’ questionnaires and 197 ‘’post‘’ questionnaires) are promising. Notably, the majority of the participants showed learning in 68 % of the cooking knowledge development objectives and in 82 % of the food learning development objectives. Participants demonstrated an interest in careers related to cooking (67 %), nutrition (39 %) and agriculture (25 %) and their participation to the Brigades Culinaires classes seems to have contributed to their career orientations. Results suggest that the Brigades Culinaires classes have an impact on the participants’ surroundings. Conclusion. Participation to the Brigades Culinaires classes’ contributes to elevating participants’ involvement level in nutrition, cooking and food. Results obtained from this study provide information on the program forces and allow the elaboration of recommendations to raise Quebec adolescents’ involvement in healthy eating.	adolescents , food behaviors , healthy eating , cooking classes , cooking skills , food skills , culinary nutrition , nutrition education , culinary program	en	13101.0
811	Modified Large Margin Nearest Neighbor Metric Learning for Regression	The main objective of this letter is to formulate a new approach of learning a Mahalanobis distance metric for nearest neighbor regression from a training sample set. We propose a modified version of the large margin nearest neighbor metric learning method to deal with regression problems. As an application, the prediction of post-operative trunk 3-D shapes in scoliosis surgery using nearest neighbor regression is described. Accuracy of the proposed method is quantitatively evaluated through experiments on real medical data.	3-D shape prediction Mahalanobis distance metric learning nearest neighbor regression semidefinite programming	en	13078.0
812	Non-invasive quantitative assessment of scoliosis spinal surgery outcome	Improving the appearance of the trunk is an important goal of scoliosis surgical treatment, mainly in patients' eyes. Unfortunately, existing methods for assessing postoperative trunk appearance are rather subjective as they rely on a qualitative evaluation of the trunk shape. In this paper, an objective method is proposed to quantify the changes in trunk shape after surgery. Using a non-invasive optical system, the whole trunk surface is acquired and reconstructed in 3D. Trunk shape is described by two functional measurements spanning the trunk length: the lateral deviation and the axial rotation. To measure the pre and postoperative differences, a correction rate is computed for both measurements. On a cohort of 36 scoliosis patients with the same spinal curve type who underwent the same surgical approach, surgery achieved a very good correction of the lateral trunk deviation (median correction of 76%) and a poor to moderate correction of the back axial rotation (median correction of 19%). These results demonstrate that after surgery, patients are still confronted with residual trunk deformity, mainly a persisting hump on the back. That can be explained by the fact that current scoliosis assessment and treatment planning are based solely on radiographic measures of the spinal deformity and do not take trunk deformity into consideration. It is believed that with our novel quantitative trunk shape descriptor, clinicians and surgeons can now objectively assess trunk deformity and postoperative shape and propose new treatment strategies that could better address patients' concern about their appearance. © (2013) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

813	Semiautomatic Detection of Scoliotic Rib Borders From Posteroanterior Chest Radiographs	3-D assessment of scoliotic deformities relies on an accurate 3-D reconstruction of bone structures from biplanar X-rays, which requires a precise detection and matching of anatomical structures in both views. In this paper, we propose a novel semiautomated technique for detecting complete scoliotic rib borders from PA-0° and PA-20° chest radiographs, by using an edge-following approach with multiple-path branching and oriented filtering. Edge-following processes are initiated from user starting points along upper and lower rib edges and the final rib border is obtained by finding the most parallel pair among detected edges. The method is based on a perceptual analysis leading to the assumption that no matter how bent a scoliotic rib is, it will always present relatively parallel upper and lower edges. The proposed method was tested on 44 chest radiographs of scoliotic patients and was validated by comparing pixels from all detected rib borders against their reference locations taken from the associated manually delineated rib borders. The overall 2-D detection accuracy was 2.64 ± 1.21 pixels. Comparing this accuracy level to reported results in the literature shows that the proposed method is very well suited for precisely detecting borders of scoliotic ribs from PA-0° and PA-20° chest radiographs.

814	Reliability of a quantitative clinical posture assessment tool among persons with idiopathic scoliosis	Objective To determine overall, test–retest and inter-rater reliability of posture indices among persons with idiopathic scoliosis.  Design A reliability study using two raters and two test sessions.  Setting Tertiary care paediatric centre.  Participants Seventy participants aged between 10 and 20 years with different types of idiopathic scoliosis (Cobb angle 15 to 60°) were recruited from the scoliosis clinic.  Main outcome measures Based on the XY co-ordinates of natural reference points (e.g. eyes) as well as markers placed on several anatomical landmarks, 32 angular and linear posture indices taken from digital photographs in the standing position were calculated from a specially developed software program. Generalisability theory served to estimate the reliability and standard error of measurement (SEM) for the overall, test–retest and inter-rater designs. Bland and Altman's method was also used to document agreement between sessions and raters.  Results In the random design, dependability coefficients demonstrated a moderate level of reliability for six posture indices (ϕ = 0.51 to 0.72) and a good level of reliability for 26 posture indices out of 32 (ϕ ≥ 0.79). Error attributable to marker placement was negligible for most indices. Limits of agreement and SEM values were larger for shoulder protraction, trunk list, Q angle, cervical lordosis and scoliosis angles. The most reproducible indices were waist angles and knee valgus and varus.  Conclusions Posture can be assessed in a global fashion from photographs in persons with idiopathic scoliosis. Despite the good reliability of marker placement, other studies are needed to minimise measurement errors in order to provide a suitable tool for monitoring change in posture over time.

815	Évolution de la gestion pharmacologique de la polyarthrite rhumatoïde et impact sur le risque de fracture ostéoporotique non vertébrale	Over the past two decades, progresses in the understanding of disease etiology, the arrival of new drugs, and the development of clinical practice guidelines may have led to a better pharmacological management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoporosis, a common comorbidity. In this thesis, three research questions were investigated using well characterized administrative databases (RAMQ and MED-ECHO).  A first study documented RA drug use in the province of Quebec. To this date, this is the only Canadian study to report on patterns of biologic DMARD use since their introduction in clinical practice. Over our study time horizon (2002-2008), the use of any DMARDs (synthetic and biologic) slightly increased in the overall RA population (1.9%, 95% CI: 1.1-2.8). However, despite clinical practice guidelines stressing the importance of early treatment, and the reimbursement of treatments by the Quebec drug plan, the results demonstrated suboptimal DMARD initiation in newly diagnosed RA (probability at 12 months: 38.5%), though DMARD initiation increased when rheumatologists were overseeing care (OR: 4.31, 95%CI: 3.73-4.97). For biologic DMARDs, the strongest predictor of initiation was the calendar year of study entry. Of subjects newly diagnosed in 2002, 1.2 in 1000 had a biologic initiated within one year, while for those newly diagnosed in 2007, it was 13.0 in 1000. The results showed that the pharmacological management of RA is improving over time, but remains below expectations. Ensuring better access to rheumatologists should be an area of focus in order to enhance the quality of RA care.  A second study reported on biologic DMARD use and the risk of non-vertebral osteoporotic fractures in RA patients aged ≥50 years. Because chronic inflammation in RA interferes with bone remodeling and biologic DMARDs, in addition to their anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects, are modulators of the cellular activity of osteoblasts and osteoclasts possibly leading to the preservation of bone mineral density (BMD), it was believed that their use may reduce the risk of fractures. A nested-case control study was conducted. Although a reduction in the risk of fractures subsequent to biologic DMARD use could not be demonstrated (OR: 1.03, 95% CI: 0.42-2.53), the study established the incidence rate of non-vertebral osteoporotic fractures in a Canadian RA population (11/1000 person-years) and highlighted some important risk factors. The high prevalence of osteoporosis in the RA population justifies that more attention be paid to preventing fractures.  Finally, a third study investigated the impact of the 2002 Canadian osteoporosis guidelines on the pharmacological management of osteoporosis and on the rates of non-vertebral osteoporotic fractures in a RA population aged ≥50 years between 1998 and 2008. With the availability of effective osteoporosis treatments since the mid 90s, and the evolving clinical practice guidelines, a reduction in the rate of fractures was expected. Some Canadian studies have shown reductions in the rate of fractures following broader use of osteoporosis drugs and BMD testing in a general adult population, but none have specifically investigated the impact in RA. In this observational study using a time series approach, no reduction in the rate of fractures after 2002 (post guidelines dissemination) could be demonstrated. However, the use of osteoporosis drugs, BMD testing, and provision of post fracture osteoporosis care improved. This study demonstrated that years of availability of effective preventive measures and investments in the development and promotion of clinical practice guidelines have not yet translated into further reduction in the rate of fractures in our RA population over our study time horizon.   This body of work is the first to examine, using healthcare administrative data, subjects with RA over a period of 11 years, allowing not only to study the changes in clinical practice following the introduction of new treatments and guidelines, but also to capture the impact on health. In addition, by studying predictors of treatment, the results provide good insights in terms of solutions to fill the gap between the observed clinical practice and guideline recommendations. Finally, the results of these studies substantiate the literature regarding the quality of RA care and the prevention of fractures.

816	Évaluation de la performance du score de propension à hautes dimensions dans le cadre d’études observationnelles québécoises	Propensity scores (PS) are frequently used to adjust for confounders leading to indication bias. However, PS are limited by the fact that they can only adjust for measured and known confounders. High-dimensional propensity scores (hdPS), a specific type of PS, select which variables they adjust for by means of a standardized selection algorithm. Thanks to the use of this selection algorithm, hdPS could potentially adjust for all type of confounders. This thesis aims to evaluate the hdPS’s performance in the adjustment for indication bias in the context of an observational study focussing on the potential diabetogenic effect of statins. The first article’s aim was to identify if the exposure to statins was associated with the risk of diabetes. Results of this article suggest that exposure to statins is associated with an increase in the risk of diabetes and that this association is dose-dependent and reversible in nature. After having identified this association, we examined if the hdPS outperforms the PS in the adjustment for indication bias. Both methods’ performance were compared by means of the obtained adjusted measures of associations and by means of the standardized differences regarding 19 characteristics following the creation of two matched sub-cohorts (each matched on either patients’ PS or patients’ hdPS). Results of this second article identify that the performance of either method could not be differentiated by means of the first approach but that, based on the second approach, the hdPS outperforms the PS in its adjustment for indication bias. The last article aimed to evaluate if the hdPS could adjust for known confounders which were hidden to the selection algorithm. Results of this third article suggest that the hdPS method can adjust for at least some hidden confounders and that it could potentially adjust for some unmeasured confounders. As a whole, this thesis suggests that the hdPS method could be superior to the PS method in its ability to adjust for indication bias and supports its use in future observational studies using medico-administrative databases.

817	Uncovering the role of misfolded SOD1 in the pathogenesis of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis	Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of motor neurons resulting in paralysis and death. Approximately 20% of familial ALS cases are caused by mutations in superoxide dismutase (SOD1), which leads to misfolding of the SOD1 protein, resulting in a toxic gain of function. Several antibodies have been generated that are specific for the misfolded form of the protein, and have been used as therapeutics in pre-clinical models. How misfolded SOD1 provokes a selective loss of motor neurons remains unresolved. Mitochondrial morphology, bioenergetics and transport are all documented is SOD1-mediated ALS models, thus mitochondrial impairment plays a key role in motor neuron degeneration. Moreover, misfolded SOD1 selectively associates with the surface of spinal cord mitochondria in ALS rodent models. We hypothesize that the accumulation of misfolded SOD1 on mitochondria could impair mitochondrial function. To this end, we developed a novel flow cytometric assay to immunolabel isolated mitochondria with misfolded SOD1 antibodies while also evaluating aspects of mitochondrial function. This method will allow for a comparison of mitochondria bearing misfolded SOD1 to those without. We utilized the B8H10 conformation specific SOD1 antibody to demonstrate that misfolded SOD1 associates with SOD1G93A rat spinal cord mitochondria in a in a time dependent manner. Mitochondria with B8H10-reactive misfolded SOD1 associated with their surface (B8H10+) have a significantly larger volume and produce excessive amounts of superoxide, but have a similar transmembrane potential compared to B8H10- mitochondria. In addition, the presence of B8H10-reactive misfolded SOD1 coincides with higher levels of the pro-apoptotic form of Bcl-2. Staining of lumbar spinal cord sections with both B8H10 and another conformation specific SOD1 antibody, AMF7-63, yielded distinct localization patterns. B8H10 was found predominantly in motor neurons and numerous puncta throughout the neuropil. Conversely, AMF7-63 marked motor neurons as well as a distinctive fibrillar network that was concentrated in the anterior horn. At the subcellular level, AMF7-63-reactive misfolded SOD1 also localized to the mitochondrial surface of spinal cord mitochondria in a time-dependent manner. AMF7-63+ mitochondria have an increased volume compared to B8H10+ mitochondria and the unlabelled subpopulation. However, they produce similar amounts of superoxide. Together, these data suggest that there are multiple species of misfolded SOD1 that converge at the mitochondria to cause damage. Moreover, different SOD1 conformations may ellicit varying toxicities towards mitochondria. Both B8H10 and AMF7-63-reactive misfolded SOD1 are present in aggregates in mitochondrial fractions and can therefore not account for any different effects produced in terms of mitochondrial volume. Conformational antibodies are invaluable tools to identify and characterize the continuum of misfolded SOD1 species with regards to biochemical characteristics and toxicity. The information presented in this thesis will be used in determining the future therapeutic potential of these antibodies.	SOD1 , ALS , misfolded SOD1 , mitochondria , flow cytometry	en	13032.0
818	Étude de la régulation de l'activité du ligand Delta dans le cadre de la signalisation Notch	The Notch signalling pathway is evolutionarily conserved. It plays a key role in development and it is involved in multiple cell fate decisions, in the maintenance of stem cells, and in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation. Misregulation of Notch signalling is implicated in various diseases and cancers including solid tumours, such as breast and cervical cancers, and leukemias, such as T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (T-ALL). Notch is a transmembrane receptor activated by transmembrane ligands of the DSL family (Delta/Serrate/Lag-2). Whereas oncogenic mutations have been identified in the Notch receptor, many Notch-mediated cancers remain ligand-dependent. Strikingly, the molecular mechanisms that regulate ligand activation are still poorly characterized as compared to those regulating the Notch receptor itself. Using a co-culture assay with a luciferase Notch reporter, we performed the first genome-wide RNAi screen aiming specifically at identifying regulators of Notch ligands in the signal-sending cell. We thereby unraveled new classes of common regulators for both Delta-like1 and 4 ligands. These regulators include protease inhibitors, transcription factors and various genes of unknown function such as Tmem128 (Transmembrane protein 128), or of previously characterized function such as the molecular co-chaperone Cdc37 (Cell division cycle 37 homolog). We next developed functional secondary screens where we demonstrated that our hits are important for Notch-mediated events, such as normal T-cell differentiation, and survival of pre-leukemic stem cells (pre-LSCs) isolated from a mouse model of T-ALL. Moreover, we showed that top hits from the pre-LSC survival screen are also required for the self-renewal activity of pre-LSCs. Finally, we performed a preliminary molecular characterization of two newly identified regulators; Tmem128 and Cdc37 in order to investigate their mechanism of action on Delta-like ligands. Altogether, this study led to the identification of novel Notch pathway regulators that could serve as potential therapeutic targets in Notch cancers, as exemplified by the T-ALL model. Elucidating the finer details that underlie the molecular functions of these regulators will be critical to develop pharmacological inhibitors to counteract their action and impede Notch signalling in cancer.

819	Neuropsychological predictors of treatment outcome in obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)	Background: Despite substantial evidence supporting the general efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OSD), there is controversy about improvement in some neuropsychological deficits in this disorder. Objective: The present study aim to evaluate: 1) correlation of severity of OCD and neuropsychological test scores and 2) clinical and neuropsychological improvement of patients with OCD who have successfully completed their treatment. Method: This study evaluates neurocognitive function and clinical condition of 27 participants of OCD group and 25 participants of control group. The neurocognitive function of every participant has been assessed using Rey-Osterreich Complex Figure Test (RCFT), D-KEFS fluency test and Cardebat- D test. We also, used Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive scale(Y-BOCS) to verify comorbidity of anxiety and depression with OCD and severity of symptoms in patients with OCD. Results: Our study concludes that a significant difference of function in copy score is present between OCD and control group. Also, we found considerable difference in score of immediate and delayed recall of RCFT before and after treatment in OCD group. Conclusion: In summary, the present study demonstrated that OCD patients have specific cognitive impairments and cognitive behavioral therapy could improve, at least, some neurocognitive dysfunction.

Recent evidences revealed the existence of two EPC subtypes implicated in vascular repair: early outgrowth cells (EOCs) and endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs). EOCs express adapter proteins, members of the TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs), necessary for CD40 signaling, the latter possibly involved in the anti-platelet function of sCD40L-treated EOCs, through prostacyclin (PGI2) and nitric oxide (NO) secretion. However, the TRAFs present in ECFCs which may act upstream of CD40 signaling to regulate the expression of cyclooxygenases (COX) and NO synthases (NOS) are still unexplored. This study aims to investigate the role of TRAFs, COX and NOS in ECFCs. We succeeded in differentiating EPCs by culturing peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in an endothelial growth medium (EGM-2), and showed by optical and confocal microscopy that EOCs display a monocyte-like phenotype whereas ECFCs have an endothelial cell (EC)-like phenotype, both EPC subtypes sharing endothelial features assessed by flow cytometry. Indeed, ECFCs, like ECs, constitutively express eNOS, iNOS, COX-1 and weakly COX-2; whereas EOCs do not constitutively express these NO and PGI2 producing enzymes, as shown by Western Blot. Comparing the expression profile of TRAFs in EOCs, ECFCs, PBMCs and ECs, we found that they all express CD40, TRAF1, 2, 3, 5 and 6. However, their levels of expression vary between the different cell types. Results generated from this project informed on the presence of TRAFs, COX and NOS in EOCs and ECFCs, where further studies on CD40 association with its identified TRAFs in each EPC subtype should shed lights on the downstream intracellular mechanisms involved in the regulation of COX and NOS expression in EOCs and ECFCs, and consequently their anti-platelet function.

821	Préconditionnement ischémique et exercice : de la réadaptation à la performance	Physical activity is an integral part of medical recommendations for preventing and treating coronary heart disease. By following a structured training program, is it possible to improve response to exercise and provide heart protection at the same time? This is suggested by certain studies on ischemic preconditioning (IPC) induced by a maximal exercise test. The same physiological mechanisms induced by IPC are also observed when a pressure cuff is used to create cycles of ischemia/reperfusion on skeletal muscle. This is known as remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC). At the other end of the physical activity spectrum, athletes have used RIPC during warm-ups to improve performance. The following research projects were developed to study these premises. The first trial addressed the effects of RIPC on short supra-maximal exercise. The subjects (N = 16) performed an alactic test (six seconds of supra-maximal exercise) followed by a lactic test (30 seconds of supra-maximal exercise) on a cycle ergometer. The subjects were randomly assigned to an RIPC or CON intervention before the exercise. The RIPC procedure involved four cycles of ischemia using a pressure cuff inflated to 50 mmHg above systolic blood pressure at the arm. The results of the project show that RIPC intervention does not significantly improve performance typical of the anaerobic system, despite a slight increase in maximal power output in favour of RIPC in the 30 second Wingate test (795 W vs. 777 W)  and in the 6 seconds test (856 W vs. 847 W).  The aim of the second clinical trial was to study the effects of RIPC during eight minutes of moderate exercise (75% of ventilatory threshold) and intense exercise (115% of ventilatory threshold) on the kinetics of O2 uptake. Our results showed a significant acceleration in the kinetics of O2 uptake during the RIPC intervention compared to the CON intervention for the two exercise intensities (value of 1 during moderate exercise: 27.2 ± 4.6 seconds compared with 33.7 ± 6.2, p < .01 and intense exercise: 299 ± 4.9 seconds compared with 33.5 ± 4.1, p < .001) in amateur athletes (N= 15). This means a reduction in the oxygen deficit at the onset of exercise and more rapid achievement of the steady state.  The third project involved performing a systematic review and meta-analysis on ischemic preconditioning (IPC) induced by an exercise test in coronary patients. Our literature search identified 309 articles, 34 of which were included in the meta-analysis, which represents a batch of 1,053 patients. Our statistical analyses show that in subsequent exercise, patients' time to 1 mm ST segment depression is augmented by 91 seconds (p < .001); the maximum depression decreases by 0.38 mm (p < .01); the double product at 1 mm ST segment depression increases by 1.80 x 103 mmHg (p < .001) and the total time of exercise increases by 50 seconds (p < .001).   Our research projects have promoted the advancement of knowledge in exercise science by the use of a cuff as a stimulus to the RIPC before sports performance. We evaluated the effect of the RIPC on different metabolic pathways and we concluded that the method could accelerate the kinetics of oxygen consumption and reduce the range of oxygen deficit. In addition, we have established clinical parameters for assessing the IPC induced by a stress test for coronary patients.

822	The autotelic experience : a design approach to user experience	If usability guides the formal organisation of interactive systems as it pertains to being usable, useful and efficient, what principle(s) guide(s) the formal organisation of interactive systems when it comes to give form to the subjective dimension of the user experience? This question came from two perceived gaps in our understanding of UX: (1) the UX theoretical framework appears incomplete to this day. Going beyond experiencing, what is at play during Dewey’s an experience? (2) The process and abilities of designers are underused in the current theoretical and practical UX framework; what would provide a more designerly approach? We propose that the autotelic experience could bridge these gaps and be the UX counterpart to usability. The autotelic experience is an internal dimension at the heart of the optimal experience—Flow—(Csikszentmihalyi, 1975) and covering the whole of the aesthetic experience (Schaeffer, 2000). The autotelic experience is a shift in awareness occurring during the interaction. This awareness is accompanied by an imperceptible tension of wanting to make this moment last in order to continue enjoying the pleasure it generates (a circular motivation to stay in the interaction for the sake of the interaction itself) (Schaeffer, 2000). Our results suggest the key to the autotelic experience sits with visuospatial reasoning or more specifically to right hemisphere (RH) activation. Three exploratory studies were conducted, using a three-part theoretical framework where Flow, signs of nonverbal / spatial activity (physical gestures) and of verbal activity (discourse) were assessed for their various associations.  The main contribution of this research is a model of autotelic experience made of three interlocking elements (high positive pressure, low mental demand and an openness to unexpected events) contextualised by either an active or a receptive engagement on the part of the user. One of the findings is that the pragmatic experience and the autotelic experience (which we have associated to Dewey’s an experience, 1934), are based on one and the same content, the only difference is the shift in attention on the participant’s part.  All the elements of the model are known, but one, to design the experience in a way to keep the user open to the unexpected. This one element supports the occurrence of the shift from ordinary to autotelic attention. The new model opens the door to a better appreciation of designers’ skills and processes within multidisciplinary team in UX design.

825	Les directives anticipées des personnes atteintes d’une démence de type Alzheimer : Comment faire pour bien faire?	The Law on End of Life Care is now effective in Quebec. This law provides for a system of advanced medical directives. Respecting advanced directives (AD) issued in anticipation of incapacity can be a beneficial ethical way to ensure self-determination of the patient in a context where a person’s incapacity is total and of short duration (e.g., terminal cancer). But what about when the loss of decision- making abilities is gradual and spread over a long period of time, as is the case of people with Alzheimer’s type dementia (ATD)? Although the cognitive decline associated with ATD legitimizes the use of AD to promote self- determination of these people, relying solely on a person’s wishes expressed verbally or in writing to their relatives or physician to guide care is an approach that can be ethically risky. A review of the literature on AD, a study of the clinical features associated with ATD, and a critical analysis of a fictitious clinical case will help demonstrate the need for developing a gradual approach to revalidate agreements that take into consideration the AD of the person with a ATD while weighing their wishes and views in real time, their current quality of life and that of their caregiver. The beneficial deployment of AD relies on the ability of the actors involved to consider this as a process of revalidation of agreements. This necessary paradigm shift will ensure that actualising the self-determination of people with ATD does not come at the expense of their dignity, safety and integrity. Such an approach remains to be developed and promoted for people with ATD in Quebec. Health policies that move in this direction, as well as specific normative benchmarks for this clientele, are needed rapidly in the current Quebec context, which is joining the development of a system of “advanced medical directives” with a Law on End of Life Care.

826	Liquidity traps, capital flows	Motivated by debates surrounding international capital flows during the Great Recession, we conduct a positive and normative analysis of capital flows when a region of the global economy experiences a liquidity trap. Capital flows reduce inefficient output fluctuations in this region by inducing exchange rate movements that reallocate expenditure towards the goods it produces. Restricting capital mobility hampers such an adjustment. From a global perspective, constrained efficiency entails subsidizing capital flows to address an aggregate demand externality associated with exchange rate movements. Absent cooperation, however, dynamic terms-of-trade manipulation motives drive countries to inefficiently restrict capital flows, impeding aggregate demand stabilization.

827	Survival in water of Campylobacter jejuni strains isolated from the slaughterhouse	Campylobacter jejuni cause gastroenteritis in humans. The main transmission vector is the consumption or handling of contaminated chicken meat, since chicken can be colonized asymptomatically by C. jejuni. However, water has been implicated as the transmission vector in a few outbreaks. One possibility is the contamination of water effluent by C. jejuni originating from chicken farm. The ability of C. jejuni to be transmitted by water would be closely associated to its ability to survive in water. Therefore, in this study, we have evaluated the ability of reference strains and chickenisolated strains to survive in water. Defined water media were used, since the composition of tap water is variable. We showed that some isolates survive better than others in defined freshwater (Fraquil) and that the survival was affected by temperature and the concentration of NaCl. By comparing the ability of C. jejuni to survive in water with other phenotypic properties previously tested, we showed that the ability to survive in water was negatively correlated with autoagglutination. Our data showed that not all chicken isolates have the same ability to survive in water, which is probably due to difference in genetic content.		en	12858.0
828	L’impact des principes éthiques sur le marché d’assurance en présence de tests génétiques	According to certain authors, the genetic tests entail the exclusion of agents from the insurance market. For that reason, several individuals advocate in the name of ethical principles to ban the use of genetic tests on the market. However if for the ethical reasons, the information remains private, the contract of solidarity which insures a complete mutualization of the risk and an access equal to all to the insurance market can be threatened. The agents themselves can use this information either to lower their premium if they are low risk agents either to increase their insurance demand if they are high risk agents. This situation can induce an adverse selection phenomenon. In this article, we look for the consequences of ethical principles on the insurance market. We show that sometimes it is rational to let genetic information as public information.	philosophy , ethics , economics , Genetic testing , insurance , ethics , justice , philosophy , ethics , economics , justice	en	12849.0

We show in this paper that this strategy carries more threats than solutions for fair trade, unless a broader definition of the quality of goods is envisaged. We observe finally that quality and equity can be antithetical: the exhortation of the consumers to be more concerned with quality of goods may surpass the exhortation to exchange in a jut way.	philosophy , ethics , economics , Quality , equity , justice , trade , price , philosophy , ethics , economics , justice	en	12847.0
830	"Amino acids substitutions in σ1 and μ1 outer capsid proteins of a Vero cell-adapted
mammalian orthoreovirus are required for optimal virus binding and disassembly"	In a recent study, the serotype 3 Dearing strain of mammalian orthoreovirus was adapted to Vero cells; cells that exhibit a limited ability to support the early steps of reovirus uncoating and are unable to produce interferon as an antiviral response upon infection. The Vero cell-adapted virus (VeroAV) exhibits amino acids substitutions in both the σ1 and μ1 outer capsid proteins but no changes in the σ3 protein. Accordingly, the virus was shown not to behave as a classical uncoating mutant. In the present study, an increased ability of the virus to bind at the Vero cell surface was observed and is likely associated with an increased ability to bind onto cell-surface sialic acid residues. In addition, the kinetics of μ1 disassembly from the virions appears to be altered. The plasmid-based reverse genetics approach confirmed the importance of σ1 amino acids substitutions in VeroAV's ability to efficiently infect Vero cells, although μ1 co-adaptation appears necessary to optimize viral infection. This approach of combining in vitro selection of reoviruses with reverse genetics to identify pertinent amino acids substitutions appears promising in the context of eventual reovirus modification to increase its potential as an oncolytic virus.

831	"Amino acid substitutions in σ1 and μ1 outer capsid proteins are selected
during mammalian reovirus adaptation to Vero cells"	Establishment of viral persistence in cell culture has previously led to the selection of mammalian reovirus mutants, although very few of those have been characterized in details. In the present study, reovirus was adapted to Vero cells that, in contrast to classically-used L929 cells, are inefficient in supporting the early steps of reovirus uncoating and are also unable to produce interferon as an antiviral response once infection occurs. The Vero cell-adapted reovirus exhibits amino acids substitutions in both the σ1 and μ1 proteins. This contrasts with uncoating mutants from persistently-infected L929 cells, and various other cell types, that generally harbor amino acids substitutions in the σ3 outer capsid protein. The Vero cell-adapted virus remained sensitive to an inhibitor of lysosomal proteases; furthermore, in the absence of selective pressure for its maintenance, t he virus has partially lost its ability to resist interferon. The positions of the amino acids substitutions on the known protein structures suggest an effect on binding of the viral σ1 protein to the cell surface and on μ1 disassembly from the outer capsid.

832	Environnement virtuel générateur d’émotions	Emotions play an important role in daily decision-making. Indeed, they greatly influence how individuals interact with their environment. In this study, we first designed a virtual driving environment and various emotion-inducing scenarios using the Belief-Desire-Intention method. We evaluated the effectiveness of these scenarios with a group of 30 people and an EEG headset to measure the emotions. Over 70% of scenarios designed with this method induced the emotion that had been anticipated in 52% to 76% of the participants. The second phase of this experiment is the reduction of emotions with a corrective agent. We noted an efficiency in reducing emotions ranging from 36.4% to 70.0% of the participants through the different scenarios.

833	Video-based analysis of Gait pathologies	Gait analysis has emerged as one of the most important medical field recently due to its wide range of applications. Marker-based systems are the most favoured methods of human motion assessment and gait analysis, however, these systems require specific equipment and expertise, and are cumbersome, costly and difficult to use. Many re- cent computer-vision-based approaches have been developed to reduce the cost of the expensive motion capture systems while ensuring high accuracy result. In this thesis, we introduce our new low-cost gait analysis system that is composed of two low-cost monocular cameras (camcorders) placed on the left and right sides of a treadmill. Each 2D left or right human skeleton model is reconstructed from each view based on dy- namic color segmentation, the gait analysis is then performed on these two models. The validation with one state-of-the-art vision-based motion capture system (using the Mi- crosoft Kinect v.1) and one ground-truth (with markers) was done to demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of our system. The average error in human skeleton model estimation compared to ground-truth between our method vs. Kinect are very promis- ing: the joints angles of upper legs (6.29◦ vs. 9.68◦), lower legs (7.68◦ vs. 11.47◦), feet (6.14◦ vs. 13.63◦), stride lengths (6.14cm vs. 13.63cm) were better and more stable than those from the Kinect, while the system could maintain a reasonably close accu- racy to the Kinect for upper arms (7.29◦ vs. 6.12◦), lower arms (8.33◦ vs. 8.04◦), and torso (8.69◦ vs. 6.47◦). Based on the skeleton model obtained by each method, we per- formed a symmetry study on various joints (elbow, knee and ankle) using each method on two different subjects to see which method can distinguish more efficiently the sym- metry/asymmetry characteristic of gaits. In our test, our system reported a maximum knee angle of 8.97◦ and 13.86◦ for normal and asymmetric walks respectively, while the Kinect gave 10.58◦ and 11.94◦. Compared to the ground-truth, 7.64◦ and 14.34◦, our system showed more accuracy and discriminative power between the two cases.	Pose estimation , Video-based gait analysis	en	12831.0
834	Evaluating perceptual maps of asymmetries for gait symmetry quantification and pathology detection	The gait movement is an essential process of the human activity and also the result of coordinated effort between the neurological, articular and musculoskeletal systems.  This motivates why gait analysis is important and also increasingly used  nowadays for the (possible early) diagnosis of many different types  (neurological, muscular, orthopedic, etc.) of diseases.  This paper introduces a novel method to quickly visualize the different parts of the body related to an asymmetric  movement in the human gait of a patient for daily clinical. The goal is to provide a cheap and easy-to-use method to measure the gait asymmetry and display results in a perceptually relevant manner.  This method relies on an affordable consumer depth sensor, the Kinect. The Kinect was chosen because this device is amenable for use in small, confined area, like a living room.  Also, since it is marker-less, it provides a fast non-invasive diagnostic. The algorithm we are going to introduce relies on the fact that a healthy walk has (temporally shift-invariant) symmetry  properties in the coronal plane.

836	Le récepteur CD36 : implication dans le développement de l'athérosclérose et dans le recrutement des leucocytes aux sites inflammatoires	CD36 is a class B scavenger receptor expressed by multiple cell types such as macrophages and microvascular endothelial cells. CD36 shows a high affinity binding towards lipid-based ligands such as oxidized low-density lipoproteins (oxLDL). Macrophage CD36 has been shown to play a critical role in the development of atherosclerotic lesions by its ability to internalize oxLDL and to lead to foam cell formation. We tested the hypothesis that EP 80317, a selective CD36 ligand, exerts anti-atherosclerotic effects in apolipoprotein E-deficient (apoE–/–) mice fed on atherogenic diet. Long term treatment (12 weeks) with EP 80317 results in a striking reduction (51%) of lesion areas in EP 80317-treated apoE–/– mice. This effect was associated with a decrease in plasma cholesterol, a reduced oxLDL internalization within macrophages and an up-regulation of proteins involved in cholesterol efflux. Additionally, treatment with EP 80317 was associated with a reduced expression of vascular and plasma pro-inflammatory proteins. Our studies also showed a role of CD36 in modulating the recruitment of mononuclear phagocytes to the arterial wall, as shown by a reduced migration of radiolabeled CD36-/- macrophages into atherosclerotic lesions compared to CD36+/+ cells. At the molecular level, our studies showed that oxidized phospholipids induced the phosphorylation of the adhesion kinase Pyk2 in monocytes/macrophages, in a CD36- and Src-dependent manner. The Pyk2 phosphorylation is attenuated by treatment with EP80317. Our results strongly support the role of CD36 in atherosclerosis development and suggest that synthetic ligands featuring modulatory effect on CD36 function may represent a novel class of anti-atherosclerotic agents. CD36 expressed by microvascular endothelial cells is a receptor for the heterodimer S100A8/A9. These proteins bind intracellular arachidonic acid (AA) within polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) and the complex S100A8/A9-AA may be secreted at sites of inflammation where it exerts chemotactic activities. We aimed to delineate the role of microvascular CD36, as a receptor for the S100A8/A9, in the AA transcellular metabolism and the regulation of the associated PMN trafficking to inflammatory sites. In two mouse models of acute inflammation (hind limb ischemia/reperfusion and dorsal air pouch), CD36 regulated trafficking of PMN to inflammatory sites, as shown by a mean of 63% reduction of PMN accumulation in CD36-/- mice. Treatment with EP 80317 or with S100A8/A9 antibodies reduced, each by ~ 60%, the recruitment of PMN to inflammatory sites. The combined administration of anti-S100A8/A9 and EP 80317 did not exert any additional inhibitory effect and neither treatment featured a modulatory effect in CD36-/- mice. Our results strongly support a role for microvascular CD36 in regulating PMN trafficking to inflammatory sites. Targeting CD36 might represent a novel therapeutic avenue for the treatment of acute inflammatory responses.

837	L'accélération de la rigidité vasculaire associée au diabète de type 1 : implication de la protéine Gla de la matrice	Arterial stiffness contributes to the development of isolated systolic hypertension (ISH), the most prevalent form of hypertension in the elderly. Arterial stiffness, due in part to the calcification of large arteries, is accelerated by 15 years in diabetic patients. It is suggested that vascular calcification could be responsible for the resistance to anti-hypertensive agents in patients suffering from ISH, emphasizing the need of developing new therapies directly targeting vascular calcification.  The matrix Gla protein (MGP) is a vitamin K-dependent secretory protein post-transtionnaly modified by the enzyme γ-glutamyl-carboxylase. This post-translational modification renders MGP active, i.e. able to inhibit vascular calcification (cMGP). Another enzyme, the vitamin K oxidoreductase (VKOR) is necessary to ensure the recycling of vitamin K from the epoxide to hydroquinone, the form used by the γ-carboxylase. Recent studies have shown that vascular calcification is associated with increased levels of under-carboxylated MGP (ucMGP), and vitamin K deficiency. However, the modulation of the expression or the activity of the enzymes involved in γ-carboxylation, as well as the impact of this modulation is currently unknown. The goal of this research project was to study the mechanisms involved in the accelerated development of arterial stiffness in diabetes due to increased vascular calcification of large arteries. In a rat model of type 1 diabetes with increased arterial stiffness, we demonstrated that aortic MGP γ-carboxylation was altered. In fact, the amount of active MGP was reduced in the arterial wall, coupled with a marked reduction of γ-carboxylase expression. However, neither VKOR expression nor activity was modified.  This alteration of the γ-carboxylase was reproduced in an ex vivo model of hyperglycemia. In this model, vitamin K supplementation prevented the reduction of γ-carboxylase expression, whereas surprisingly, plasma levels of vitamin K were increased in diabetic rats compared to controls. The PKC signaling pathway has been identified as the pathway involved in the γ-carboxylase alteration. Our results provide multiple new research ideas. For instance, it would be important to study the effect of vitamin K supplementation in an animal model of diabetes-associated arterial stiffness, to gain insight into its impact on γ-carboxylase and MGP γ-carboxylation, and ultimately on vascular calcification. Moreover, it would be very interesting to determine the effect of molecules affecting the PKC pathway on vascular calcification in this model, which would allow for a better understanding of their therapeutic potential. Depending on the results of these experiments, we could have at our disposition new therapeutic options to prevent and treat vascular calcification, which would have the potential to slow down the acceleration of arterial stiffness in diabetic patients and reduce the cardiovascular risk associated with ISH.

838	Asymétries locomotrices réelles et perçues lors de différentes conditions de marche sur tapis roulant chez les personnes saines et hémiparétiques	Locomotor asymmetry is frequently observed in individuals following a stroke despite their capacity to perform more symmetrically on demand or after some interventions. Therefore, the underlying causes of such asymmetry and its persistence despite interventions are sources of many questions. This project aims to improve knowledge about the factors that could explain locomotor asymmetry following a stroke. The main objectives were 1) to quantify net joint moments and muscular levels of effort in the lower limbs during different walking conditions on a split-belt treadmill with the aim of determining if these factors could be among those explaining locomotor asymmetry; and 2) to quantify the capacity to perceive locomotor asymmetry in healthy individuals and those post-stroke. The general hypothesis was that locomotor asymmetry is a strategy used by individuals post-stroke to perform with symmetrical levels of muscular effort or to avoid overly high levels of muscular effort, as assessed by the muscular utilization ratio (MUR). The results were presented in four articles (#2 to #5). The first study quantified the effect of split-belt treadmill walking in net joint moments of the lower limbs in healthy individuals and those post-stroke. Overall, the results showed that placing the paretic limb on the slow belt increased the plantarflexion moment in post-adaptation and that such increase was correlated with the increase in contralateral step length. The second study showed that individuals with high levels of effort in the paretic plantarflexors (PF) were asymmetrical in their efforts between sides for PF and hip extensors, whereas the group with low levels of effort in the paretic PF had symmetrical levels of effort in all muscle groups. In addition, both groups showed asymmetrical plantarflexion moments, but only in the group with high levels of effort was this asymmetry related to the asymmetry of residual forces. This suggests that muscle weakness plays an important role in reducing the paretic PF moment for individuals with high levels of effort in PF while other factors must be considered to explain the joint moment asymmetry in individuals with low levels of effort in PF. The third study showed that a more symmetrical gait pattern (temporal or spatial) following walking on the split-belt treadmill required high levels of effort (over 85%) in paretic PF. The fourth study evaluated the ability to perceive locomotor asymmetry in healthy individuals with a protocol on a split-belt treadmill. The gait pattern was perceived as asymmetrical when the temporal asymmetry ratio reached the threshold of 1.05. The low intra-individual variability suggested healthy individuals had a good ability to detect asymmetry. Supplementary results of this thesis showed that individuals post stroke perceived temporal asymmetry better than spatial asymmetry. Overall, these results suggest that muscle strength and muscular level of effort in paretic PF need to be considered as potential factors explaining locomotor asymmetry in individuals post stroke. Further studies are needed to determine the perceptual abilities of locomotor asymmetry in individuals post-stroke.

839	Role of receptor and non-receptor protein tyrosine kinases in vasoactive peptide-induced signaling	Endothelin-1 (ET-1) and angiotensin II (Ang II) play important roles in maintaining blood pressure and vascular homeostasis, and a heightened activity of these vasoactive peptides is thought to contribute to the development of vascular pathologies, such as hypertension, atherosclerosis, hypertrophy and restenosis. This is caused by an excessive activation of several growth and proliferative signaling pathways, which include members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family, as well as the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K)/protein kinase B (PKB) pathway. While the activation of these signaling pathways is well elucidated, the upstream elements responsible for ET-1 and Ang II-induced MAPK and PI3-K/PKB activation remain poorly understood. During the last several years, the concept of transactivation of receptor and/or non-receptor protein tyrosine kinases (PTK) in triggering vasoactive peptide-induced signaling events has gained much recognition. We have recently demonstrated that insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) plays a role in tranducing the effect of H2O2, leading to PKB phosphorylation. Since vasoactive peptides elicit their responses through generation of reactive oxygen species, including H2O2, we investigated whether IGF-1R transactivation plays a similar role in ET-1 and Ang II-induced PKB phosphorylation and hypertrophic responses in VSMC. AG-1024, a specific inhibitor of IGF-1R, attenuated both ET-1 and Ang II-induced PKB phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner. ET-1 and Ang II treatment also induced the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the autophosphorylation sites of IGF-1R, which was blocked by AG-1024. In addition, both ET-1 and Ang II evoked tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Src, a non-receptor PTK, and pharmacological inhibition of c-Src PTK activity by PP-2, a specific inhibitor of Src-family tyrosine kinase, significantly reduced PKB phosphorylation as well as tyrosine phosphorylation of IGF-1R induced by the two vasoactive peptides. Furthermore, protein and DNA synthesis, markers of cell growth and proliferation, enhanced by ET-1 and Ang II were also attenuated by AG-1024 and PP-2.  While this work demonstrates the role of c-Src in ET-1 and Ang II-induced PKB phosphorylation, its role in ET-1-induced MAPK signaling and regulation of transcription factors, such as early growth response factor-1 (Egr-1), which was recently shown to be expressed in atherosclerotic plaque, remains controversial in VSMC. Therefore, we have also investigated the involvement of c-Src in ET-1 and Ang II-induced ERK 1/2, JNK and p38mapk activation, as well as Egr-1 regulation. ET-1 and Ang II-induced the phosphorylation of ERK 1/2, JNK and p38mapk, and enhanced the expression of Egr-1 in aortic VSMC. This increased phosphorylation was decreased by PP-2. Further proof for the role of c-Src in this process was obtained by using mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) deficient in c-Src (Src -/- MEF). ET-1-induced Egr-1 expression, as well as MAPK activation, were found to be downregulated in Src -/- MEF, as compared to MEF expressing normal Src levels. In summary, these data demonstrate that IGF-1R and c-Src PTK play a critical role in mediating both PKB and MAPK phosphorylation and Egr-1 expression, as well as hypertrophic and proliferative responses induced by ET-1 and Ang II in VSMC.

840	Le diagnostic des tuméfactions latérales solides cervicales chez l'enfant	Introduction: Histological studies are often required to establish the etiology of solid lateral cervical masses (SLCM) in children since diagnostic tools are lacking accuracy. We evaluated the diagnostic tools available in order to develop a systematic and standardized diagnostic approach.   Methods: After etiologies and diagnostic tools were described, a review of the scientific literature on the topic was performed. A retrospective study between 2002 and 2012 of SLCM was conducted. A case report showing the feasibility of Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) is presented. Finally, a decision algorithm integrating our results and the scientific opinion of an expert group is proposed.  Results: Differential diagnosis for SLCM is wide. The scientific literature regarding their diagnosis is weak, outdated and comparison is difficult. The 42 children studied had a median age of seven year old. They had inflammatory masses in 59% (26/44 biopsies) with mostly Atypical Mycobacteria (13/26), which has been shown to be difficult to confirm and often requires multiple diagnostic tests. The benefit of biopsy is questionable in 39% (17/44) of biopsies. Ultrasound-guided FNA appears to be a feasible technique and less invasive than biopsy. The algorithm proposes a standardized approach based on scientific facts that we want to evaluate through a prospective study.  Conclusion: SLCM in children represent a diagnostic challenge and the algorithm intends to guide the clinician’s diagnostic approach. A prospective study on the algorithm created is at its final step for acceptance through the CHU Sainte-Justine authorities.

841	"L’injonction thérapeutique à l’égard des toxicomanes : comparaison des systèmes français et
québécois"	In Canada, the total amount of accusations, in compliance with the laws on drugs, show a slight but constant progression. More than half of the sentences for drug-linked offenses have lead to incarceration, a third of the people sentenced for a simple drug possession have been jailed. The relevance of these sentences, making the Canadian detention centres populated with more drug addicts than the rehabilitation centres, is questionable.  In France, legislation is mostly based on the December 31st, 1970 law: drug use and trafficking are severely punished. However, for a first arrest, the prosecutor can enjoin the arrestee to treatment: this is what is called therapeutic injunction. Even though therapeutic injunction spares substance users from a jail term, some limitations are encountered this measure is selective, based on social and judicial criteria, making it more forgiving than the average characteristics of drug addicts, it is only accepted and applied by half of the subjects. A specific inquiry has been done in a department in the Paris region, where drug addiction activity is abundant, and suggested a preventive role for the injunction in cases of recidivism. Global appreciation of the therapeutic injunction remains nuanced in a context of new measures in drug addiction, but it translates into the increasing necessity to introduce professional networks between the judicial and sanitary systems, intended for a young population dealing with the modern difficulties of social adaptation and high risk behaviour.		en	12764.0
842	Étude structurale et fonctionnelle du canal potassium dépendant du voltage KvAP	Voltage-gated ion channels are responsible for the initiation and propagation of action potentials in excitable cells. Several hereditary diseases (channelopathies) are associated with a defective voltage control by these channels, leading to arrhythmias, epilepsy, etc. Hence, establishing the exact structure/function relation for ion channels is crucial for the development of new specific therapeutic agents. Here, the bacterial voltage-gated potassium channel KvAP served as a model to study i) electromechanical coupling, ii) influence of lipids on the voltage dependent activity and iii) closed-state inactivation. To overcome the lack of structural information on the cytosolic side and of crystal structure in the closed state, we determined the S4-S5 linker movement during gating using fluorescence spectroscopy (LRET). We were able to control the conformational state of the channels by using lipids (phospholipids and non phospholipids) instead of voltage clamp. Based on these experimental constraints, a model in the closed state was produced, showing that a small 4Å radial displacement of the S4-S5 linker is sufficient to close the conduction pore. Interactions between lipids and membrane proteins play an important role in the regulation of ion channels activity but are not well characterized. We studied the influence of different lipids on KvAP voltage-dependent activation and showed two distinct effects related to different interactions sites: one bound to the voltage sensor, leading to a shift of the conductance-voltage curve, and another at the intracellular side near the pore region, affecting the steepness of this curve. We also showed that the exchange of lipids is very limited around KvAP and seems to be state dependent, occuring only when the channels are kept in the open state. KvAP has a slow inactivation atypical, accessible from the open state. We studied the effects of lipid composition and temperature on entry into inactivation and recovery. We also used voltage-clamp fluorometry in bilayers to investigate closed-state inactivation molecular basis. We identified a position at the bottom of the S4 helix that seems involved in the mechanism for slow inactivation and the extremely slow recovery from inactivation typically displayed by KvAP.

843	Impact de l’expression de l’isoforme p35 de la chaîne invariante humaine chez des souris déficientes en CD74 endogène	The invariant chain (Ii; CD74) is a type II membrane protein which plays a key role in antigen presentation as well as acting as a receptor for the cytokine MIF (macrophage migration inhibitory factor). In the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Ii assists the folding of MHC II and prevents the loading of nascent polypeptides in the peptide-binding groove. Di-leucine-like motifs contained in the Ii cytoplasmic tail target the MHC II-Ii complexes in the endocytic pathway. Once in low pH-endosomes, Ii is degraded allowing the binding of a high affinity peptide which is then presented on cell surface to CD4+ T cells. In Ii deficient mice, MHC II displays a “floppy” conformation typical of empty molecules or is loosely bound with peptides. The transport is aberrant leading to decreased surface expression of MHC II and defective antigenic presentation. Also, the lack of Ii restricts the peptide repertoire and impairs thymic selection of CD4+ T cells. Moreover, Ii regulates B cells maturation and Ii deficient mice display reduced numbers of mature follicular B cells (FO). The human minor p35 isoform (Iip35) does not exist in mice and displays a 16 amino acids N-terminal cytoplasmic extension containing a di-arginine (R-x-R) motif causing ER retention and acting as dominant in heterotrimeric complexes with Iip33. Upon binding to MHC II, the retention motif is masked, which allows the complexes to egress from the ER.  The physiological role of the R-x-R motif is poorly understood. To shed light on Iip35 function, we generated transgenic mice expressing Iip35 and analyzed the conformation and traffic of MHC II, the thymic selection and the development of B cells as well as the antigenic presentation.  Our results showed that Iip35 generates an MHC II in the right conformation and increases MHC II surface expression. Also, Iip35 targets MHC II into endosomes where high affinity peptides bind to the groove. We also showed that Iip35 diversifies the peptide repertoire and fully restores thymic selection of CD4+ T cells as well as the TCR levels on these cells. Then, Iip35 ensures presentation of the Ii-dependent antigen ovalbumin but does not totally rescue the presentation of superantigens. Interestingly, thymic selection of the iNKT cells is fully restored showing that Iip35 assists with lipids presentation by CD1d. Finally, Iip35 allows B cells to develope into FO B cells but does not support marginal zone (MZ) B cells maturation. This result suggests that MIF stimulation is not a prerequisite for FO B cells development. Altogether, these results showed that Iip35 is functional and has most of the CD74 functions. However, it cannot replace the endogenous Ii regarding the MZ B cells maturation suggesting that Iip35 could have regulatory functions by modulating the development of some cells.

844	Étude du goulot d’étranglement dans la transmission mère-enfant du virus de l’hépatite C	Mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of hepatitis C virus (HCV) represents the first cause of infection in children of developed countries. MTCT of HCV may take place in <10% when the mother is solely infected with HCV. However, maternal coinfection with type 1 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) leads to a drastic increase of this rate. Besides, there is no mean of prevention of MTCT of HCV. HCV replication leads to a prominent variability due to the absence of correction mechanism of its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Consequently, it is retrieved in its host as a swarm of genetically closely related but different variants named quasispecies. When HCV transmission occurs between adults, only a very limited number of variants are responsible for the infection. This phenomenon is called a genetic bottleneck and whether it exists during MTCT of HCV is to confirm. Based on the detection by RT-PCR of HCV’s RNA at birth, MTCT is believed to take place both in utero and peripartum. Nevertheless, such dynamics of MTCT of HCV have never been demonstrated directly. Here we report, using next generation sequencing, a longitudinal analysis of MTCT of HCV in 5 mother-child pairs, in 3 cases the mother was also infected with HIV-1. Identity analysis based on nucleotide sequence of the glycoprotein E2 hypervariable regions 1-2 (positions 1491-1787 of the isolate H77) reveals that a tight genetic bottleneck exists during MTCT of HCV (n= 1-4 variants transmitted) when the mother is only infected with HCV. However, in the case of maternal coinfection with HIV-1, this number is radically increased (n = 111-118). Also, the detection of variants shared between mother and child that are only present at the 2nd trimester of pregnancy in the mother but not found after suggest that MTCT of HCV can take place as early as the 2nd trimester of gestation. Lastly, we show that the dynamics of the establishment of the infection in the young child involve a transitional increase of the viremia concomitant with reduced diversity of HCV quasispecies. Together, these results show the first direct evidence of a genetic bottleneck occurring during MTCT of HCV. This bottleneck appears to be much less constricted when the mother is coinfected with HIV-1 and HCV. It appears possible that the MTCT can take place as early as the second trimester of pregnancy and that a limited number of variants may be responsible for the essential of the viral production during early childhood.

845	Rest-activity cycle disturbances in the acute phase of moderate to severe traumatic brain injury	Background. Sleep-wake disturbances are among the most persistent sequelae after traumatic brain injury (TBI) and probably arise during the hospital stay following TBI. These disturbances are characterized by difficulties sleeping at night and staying awake during the day. Objective. The aim of the present study was to document rest-activity cycle consolidation in acute moderate/severe TBI using actigraphy and to assess its association with injury severity and outcome. Methods. In all, 16 hospitalized patients (27.1 ± 11.3 years) with moderate/severe TBI wore actigraphs for 10 days, starting in the intensive care unit (ICU) when continuous sedation was discontinued and patients had reached medical stability. Activity counts were summed for daytime (7:00-21:59 hours) and nighttime periods (22:00-6:59 hours). The ratio of daytime period activity to total 24-hour activity was used to quantify rest-activity cycle consolidation. An analysis of variance was carried out to characterize the evolution of the daytime activity ratio over the recording period. Results. Rest-activity cycle was consolidated only 46.6% of all days; however, a significant linear trend of improvement was observed over time. Greater TBI severity and longer ICU and hospital lengths of stay were associated with poorer rest-activity cycle consolidation and evolution. Patients with more rapid return to consolidated rest-activity cycle were more likely to have cleared posttraumatic amnesia and have lower disability at hospital discharge. Conclusions. Patients with acute moderate/ severe TBI had an altered rest-activity cycle, probably reflecting severe fragmentation of sleep and wake episodes, which globally improved over time. A faster return to rest-activity cycle consolidation may predict enhanced brain recovery.	traumatic brain injury , sleep , circadian rhythms , actigraphy , intensive care	en	12687.0
846	Corruption, croissance et démocratie en Afrique : la difficile consolidation	Rather than assuming the existence of democracy in Africa, which has been established and accepted by many scholars, the present study examines the challenges of democratic consolidation in Africa. Using a wide range of countries, this study identifies neopatrimonialism, presidentialism and lack of development as the main problems for democratic consolidation. Consolidating democracy in Africa requires leaders to change their attitudes and adopt the rule of law rather than the rule of money, in addition to citizens accepting that democracy and growth are not synonymous.	consolidation	en	12660.0
847	Asia-Pacific: a new agenda for the times ahead	"The rapid growth of the populous Asian economies provokes profound economic changes and a shift in the balance of power. On the economic front, Asian leaders are confronted with the need to preserve the stability that has underpinned their prosperity, maintain an environment conducive to trade and investments and encourage domestic consumption while avoiding ecological disasters. Internationally, business competition will intensify with the strong presence of Asian manufacturers in global supply chains, growing price competition from Asian firms in domestic markets and global competition for energy, food, minerals and other commodities. Geopolitical concerns stem, in part, from Asia’s global quest for critical resources, conflicting territorial and maritime disputes and increasing military expenditures which affect security dynamics. China’s assertiveness over its periphery prompts an arm’s race in the region and concerns about Sino-American relations even though U.S.-Chinese relations may be less risky than China’s relations with its neighbours. The United States remains a key player in the Asia-Pacific region, with the capacity to alter balances and affect outcomes. Globally, the United States capacity to lead is now diminished and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future. Since no rising power is capable of exercising global leadership, a return to the ""old normal"" where no one power in geopolitical or economic terms dominates the world is to be expected."

848	Bioassay-guided fractionation of Larix laricina du Roi, and antidiabetic potentials of ethanol and hot water extracts of seventeen medicinal plants from the traditional pharmacopeia of the James Bay Cree	We have used a collaborative ethnobotanical approach to identify plant species used by the Cree of Eeyou Istchee (CEI) to treat symptoms of type 2 diabetes. Several screening studies were performed on 17 species identified in a survey of the Cree Nation. Firstly, Larix laricina du Roi (L. laricina) was recently identified as one of the top plants, which stimulated glucose uptake in C2C12 muscle cells and strongly potentiated the differentiation of 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes suggesting enhanced insulin sensitivity. Secondly, these screening studies were performed on ethanol extracts (EE) using an in vitro bioassay platform, however, traditional preparations are often based on hot water. So the purpose of this PhD thesis was to isolate the active principles from L. laricina through adipogenesis-guided fractionation, and to evaluate and compare the antidiabetic activity and mechanisms of EE and hot water extracts (HWE) of these 17 Cree plants. For the fractionation of L. laricina, we isolated several known compounds and identified a new active cycloartane triterpene, which strongly enhanced adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells and was responsible partly for the adipogenic (potentially glitazone-like insulin sensitizing) activity of the ethanol extract of the bark of L. laricina. In the adipocyte lipid metabolism course, the results confirmed that 10 of the 17 EE stimulated adipocyte differentiation and adipogenesis, whereas 2 had inhibitory effects. Corresponding HWE exhibited partial or complete loss of such adipogenic or anti-adipogenic activity. R. groenlandicum and K. angustifolia EEs activated Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPAR γ), sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 (SREBP-1) and CCAAT-enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) α, whereas P. balsamifera and A. incana decreased these transcription factors. P. balsamifera’s inhibitory effect was also found to involve AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation. R. groenlandicum HWE and EE stimulated similar transcription factors, but HWE of other selected plants lost such effects compared to their respective EE. Phytochemical analysis also uncovered clustering of active versus inactive species, notably when species were segregated by plant family. The results showed that several EE stimulated muscle glucose uptake and inhibited hepatic glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) activity. Some of the HWE partially or completely lost these antidiabetic activities in comparison to EE; while one plant (R.groenlandicum) retained similar potential between EE and HWE in both assays. In C2C12 muscle cells, EE of R.groenlandicum, A. incana and S. purpurea stimulated glucose uptake by activating AMPK pathway and increasing GLUT4 expression level. In comparison to EE, HWE of R.groenlandicum exhibited similar activities; HWE of A. incana completely lost its effect on all parameters; interestingly, HWE of S. purpurea activated insulin pathway instead of AMPK pathway to increase glucose uptake. In the H4IIE cells, all selected 5 plants HWE and EE activated AMPK pathway, and in addition, 2 plants EE and HWE also activated insulin pathways. Quercetin-3-O-galactoside and quercetin 3-O-α-L-arabinopyranoside were identified as potential candidates to be responsible for the biological activity of the active HWE plants in the glucose transport assay. In conclusion, we isolated several known compounds and identified a new active triterpene from fractionation of L. laricina. We also provide direct evidence evaluating and comparing of an insulin-like or insulin-sensitizing action of EE and HWE of Cree medicinal plants at the level of muscle, liver and adipose tissue. Part of their actions may be related to stimulation of insulin-dependent and insulin-independent intracellular signaling pathways, as well as to PPARγ activation. The results indicate that plant species, target tissues or cells, as well as extraction methods, are all significant determinants of the biological activity of Cree medicinal plants on glucose and lipid metabolism.	l’Akt , la G6Pase , type 2 diabetes , AMPK , Akt , PPAR γ , SREBP-1 , C/EBP α , G6Pase , traditional medicine , lipid  and glucose homeostasis	en	12626.0
849	Chicken Caecal Microbiome Modifications Induced by Campylobacter jejuni Colonization and by a Non-Antibiotic Feed Additive	Campylobacter jejuni is an important zoonotic foodborne pathogen causing acute gastroenteritis in humans. Chickens are often colonized at very high numbers by C. jejuni, up to 109 CFU per gram of caecal content, with no detrimental effects on their health. Farm control strategies are being developed to lower the C. jejuni contamination of chicken food products in an effort to reduce human campylobacteriosis incidence. It is believed that intestinal microbiome composition may affect gut colonization by such undesirable bacteria but, although the chicken microbiome is being increasingly characterized, information is lacking on the factors affecting its modulation, especially by foodborne pathogens. This study monitored the effects of C. jejuni chicken caecal colonization on the chicken microbiome in healthy chickens. It also evaluated the capacity of a feed additive to affect caecal bacterial populations and to lower C. jejuni colonization. From day-0, chickens received or not a microencapsulated feed additive and were inoculated or not with C. jejuni at 14 days of age. Fresh caecal content was harvested at 35 days of age. The caecal microbiome was characterized by real time quantitative PCR and Ion Torrent sequencing. We observed that the feed additive lowered C. jejuni caecal count by 0.7 log (p<0.05). Alpha-diversity of the caecal microbiome was not affected by C. jejuni colonization or by the feed additive. C. jejuni colonization modified the caecal beta-diversity while the feed additive did not. We observed that C. jejuni colonization was associated with an increase of Bifidobacterium and affected Clostridia and Mollicutes relative abundances. The feed additive was associated with a lower Streptococcus relative abundance. The caecal microbiome remained relatively unchanged despite high C. jejuni colonization. The feed additive was efficient in lowering C. jejuni colonization while not disturbing the caecal microbiome.		en	12620.0
850	Étude sur le biofilm et les mécanismes de résistance à la bacitracine chez Clostridium perfringens	Clostridium perfringens is ubiquitous in the environment. This microorganism can be found in the intestinal tract of mammals as normal flora and can also cause many gastrointestinal infections. Phenotypic bacitracin resistance has been reported in the literature for C. perfringens but the genes responsible for this resistance have not yet been characterized. In this study, twenty-four of the 99 poultry isolates tested showed bacitracin resistance. Analysis revealed putative genes encoding for both an ABC transporter and an overproduced undecaprenol kinase. These two mechanisms were shown to be both encoded by the putative bcrABDR operon.  An IS1216-like element was found upstream and downstream from the bcr cluster, which may play a role in the dissemination of this resistance determinant. DNA hybridization analyses revealed that the bacitracin resistance genes bcrABDR were located on the chromosome. Moreover, this gene cluster has been showed to be expressed under bacitracin stress.   Many studies have associated tolerance to antibiotics and disinfectants to biofilm. In the literature, very little is known on the biofilm formation by C. perfringens. Most of the C. perfringens isolates tested in this study were able to form biofilms. Matrix composition analysis revealed the presence of proteins, extracellular DNA and beta-1,4 linked polysaccharides. Biofilm could also protect C. perfringens bacterial cells from an exposition to high concentrations of antibiotics. Exposition to low doses of antibiotics tended to lead to a diminution of the biofilm formed but for few isolates, the biofilm formation was increased. In the present study, susceptibilities of C. perfringens biofilms to disinfectants were also analysed. Results showed that biofilms can protect the bacterial cells from the action of potassium monopersulfate, quaternary ammonium chlorides, hydrogen peroxide and gluteraldehyde solutions. However, sodium hypochlorite solution was shown to be effective on C. perfringens biofilms. Our investigation of dual-species biofilms of C. perfringens with the addition of Staphylococcus aureus or Escherichia coli demonstrated that these dual-species biofilms were more tolerant to disinfection with sodium hypochlorite than the mono-species biofilms of S. aureus or E. coli.  However, further disinfection studies using sodium hypochlorite suggest that the mono-species biofilms formed by C. perfringens is more tolerant to this disinfectant than the dual-species biofilms of C. perfringens with S. aureus or E. coli.   Finally, the differential gene expression patterns between planktonic populations and biofilms of C. perfringens were investigated by RNA sequencing. The transcriptomic analysis identified 238 genes that were significantly differentially expressed between both conditions. Genes that were down-regulated in biofilm cells, relative to planktonic cells, included those involved in virulence, energy production, carbohydrate metabolism, fatty acids and amino acids biosynthesis. On the other hand, genes up-regulated in biofilm cells were involved in oxidative and stress responses, fatty acids and phospholipids biosynthesis and few genes were involved in virulence.   This study reports on the discovery of genes associated to bacitracin resistance of C. perfringens. Our work brings also new data on matrix cohesion of the biofilm, tolerance to antibiotics and disinfectants, and on the transcriptome of the biofilm of C. perfringens.

851	L’architecture de paysage moderne du campus de l’Université de Montréal	The campus of the University of Montreal is based on a highly significant association of buildings and landscape design that contributes to our understanding of the evolution of the use of space in the campus environment. For a number of historical reasons, the open spaces of the 1960s deserve particular attention. In the context of unprecedented expansion experienced by the university at the time and the simultaneous coming to age in Québec of the disciplines of landscaping and planning, open spaces on the campus became, for the first time in the history of the university, the focus of serious reflection. This article describes the context influencing the planning principles applied by La Haye and Associates, one of Québec’s leading urban planning firms, in designing these open spaces for the campus. We trace the strengths and shortcomings of modern thinking about open spaces – on the one hand, the innovative approaches used in planning and design, and, on the other, the overemphasis placed on car related needs, at the expense of safety and opportunities for social interaction.

852	Rancheros y el Estado mexicano : la construcción del honor a través del poder	This research aims to examine a cattle ranchers’ society in a community located in north Jalisco: Colotlán. I will study its relationship with the environment, its economy involved in national and international markets, its political configuration (considering its links with the state) and its symbolism, that includes their work ethics. My analysis has allowed me to identify different forms of relationship among peers and the values, the affective dimensions, and the representations that derive from them. I propose the existence of a certain type of social formation that can be called “honorable society” due to the importance of the traditions that concern their main economic activity, as well as its identity founded on moral values and rules linked to honor. I analyze the connection of power with politics and the way political power is built, the existing links between honor and power, and how people build honor through power. This society has suffered the increasing impact of modernizing practices and ideologies, with attempts at institutionalization through national and state interests.   Relying on a methodology that combines research in historical archives and extensive fieldwork, this thesis aims to contribute to the studies of cultural identities, in which honor occupies a central place in the context of the relationship between rancher communities and the state.

In the frame of an exploratory qualitative research, twelve semi-directed interview are carried out with members of the staff working directly with the clientele of such Accommodation centre. The originality of this thesis is to give a voice to the staff in direct interaction with the residents and to collect the concerns they have in mind while they perform their activities. The qualitative analysis of the content of these interviews allow expose many concerns of the staff in regard of différent elements of the environnement such as the Center as an organisation, the resident and the end of his life, the peers of the last, the associates of the staff such as families and co-workers, as much as much toward themselves in regard of their knowhow and how to be. Nonetheless, certain component limit its range such as : the choice of volunteers as participants, their small number particularly regarding the males staff and, the effect of social desirability that could have drawn the presentation of an improved vision of the reality. This thesis contribute to the advance of the knowledge in bioethics, demonstrating that the recourse at Ricœur's ethical thinking constitute a pertinent to use for the comprehension and analysis of the institutional functioning, the quality of life of the residents in end of life, as much as for the intervention of staff in their interventions in their accompaniment toward the residents and their families. In leaning on Ricœur's components of small ethics to set the bases of a program of end of life in Accommodation centre, this thesis shows also that the reference to Ricœur can constitute a valid resource to elaborate a response to the ministerial directive taking in account the staff's recommandations.

This report describes an intervention involving the implementation of a group to provide professional co-development for preceptors as one strategy to help optimize their competencies and in turn, those of new nurses, while promoting satisfaction and retention. The objective of the professional co-development group's meetings was to develop the abilities of each member to act and reflect, using structured interactions between members while emphasizing individual and collective reflection in order to improve professional practice (Payette & Champagne, 1997). The report begins with a description of the problem, the objectives, a literature review and the theoretical model used to guide the intervention. Then, the environment in which the intervention was conducted and how it unfolded is described. Finally, the report analyses the relevance of the intervention, how objectives were met, the results, fallout and recommendations.

Indeed, the analysis of the results of this study, which raises the question of the social conditions of the emergence of social work in Haiti as well as its evolution, by mobilizing a set of documentary data and interviews data (n = 9), suggests that development, as a worldview incarnated both as an institution and in the form of mental structures, is the opus operantum at the foundation of the genesis of the social work in Haiti as well as its evolution.

856	Désintégration du faux vide médiée par des kinks en 1+1 dimensions	In this thesis, we study the tunneling decay of the false vacuum, that is, a vacuum that is a relative minimum of a scalar potential. Topological defects in 1+1 dimension, called kinks, appear when the potential possesses a minimum that spontaneously breaks a discrete symmetry. In 3+1 dimensions, these kinks become domain walls. For instance, they appear in magnetic materials in condensed matter. A model with two coupled scalar fields will be studied, as well as the solutions to the equations of motion that arise from it. We will then analyze how the energy of the static solutions depend on the parameters of the model. A numerical survey of parameter space reveals that the stable solutions are located between dissociation zones, areas in parameter space where stable solutions no longer exist. The behavior of the unstable solutions in the dissociation zones can be very different depending on which dissociation zone a solution is found near the dissociation zone. The potential first consists in a sixth-order polynomial, to which is added a quartic polynomial multiplied by a coupling term, and is chosen such that the extremities of the kink are at distinct false vacua. The decay rate has been estimated by a semiclassical approximation to show the impact of topological defects on the stability of the false vacuum. The project consists in determining the conditions that allow the kinks to catalyze false vacuum decay. It appears that we found an expression for the critical kink density and that we understand what happens with most terms.

857	Investigating the Impact of Personal, Temporal and Participation Factors on Code Review Quality	Code review is an essential element of any mature software development project; it aims at evaluating code contributions submitted by developers. In principle, code review should improve the quality of code changes (patches) before they are committed to the project's master repository. In practice, the execution of this process can allow bugs to get in unnoticed. In this thesis, we present an empirical study investigating code review of a large open source project. We explore the relationship between reviewers'code inspections and personal, temporal and participation factors that might affect the quality of such inspections. We first report a quantitative study in which we applied the SZZ algorithm to detect bug-inducing changes that were then linked to the code review information extracted from the issue tracking system. We found that the reasons why reviewers miss bugs are related to both their personal characteristics, as well as the technical properties of the patches under review. We then report a qualitative study that aims at soliciting opinions from Mozilla developers on their perception of the attributes associated with a well-done code review. The results of our survey suggest that developers find both technical (patch size, number of chunks, and module) and personal factors (reviewer's experience and review queue) to be strong contributors to the review quality.

858	L'œuvre d'art dans l'école au Québec : similitudes entre l'enfant et l'œuvre dans l'aperception de l'adulte	Of the 850 pieces of art integrated to the elementary and secondary schools in Quebec since the 1980’s following the Politique d’intégration des arts à l’architecture, rare are the ones that seem to address their public, young and adult. The child’s comprehension is not always taking into account when the adult comity chooses the pieces of art. Equally, when the youths meet the art, their spontaneous affect can be turned by the interpretation of the authority – educator, supervisor or parent – in favor to a meaning induce by the culture of the Law Society. It is then noticed that the view of the child which drives him towards the piece of art to develop his knowledge of it through the experiment of his senses – vision, touch, hearing, spatiality – is discredited by the view of the adult who has a mission to impart knowledge to students and foster their social development by bringing them to civil manners. Comparing the institutional willingness written down into legislative material and the reports of the art integration comity upstream and the behaviors and discourses of the youths and adults around the pieces of art downstream, the child’s apperception in the scholar system can be uncovered in its relevance to the apperception of the art integrated to the schools. Are the child and the piece of art in the institution considered for themselves or are they solely seen by the adult through a mindful projection of what they ought to be? Thus will be studied theoretically and empirically the place left both to the child and the piece of art in the school space in order to see everyone’s autonomy in their relation with the adult. Material experience theories, Dewey’s pragmatism and Vygotsky’s socioconstructivism will allow to call into question the constructivism, behaviorism and so-called socioconstructivism implemented in the institution. Through this study, it is understand that the piece of art is a synonym of the child’s place in the school space. The adult considers both for what they legitimate his own place. The child integrates both human and art to the space of his own representation without any discrimination in gender, specie nor form, comprising them as his own self.

859	Inscriptions d’un legs littéraire : analyse comparatiste des inscriptions funéraire et amoureuse dans Premier amour de Samuel Beckett	This dissertation deals with the representations of the act of inscribing in Samuel Beckett’s short story Premier Amour with a particular focus on two specific inscriptions – namely firstly, the funeral (the epitaph the narrator composes for himself after his father’s death) and secondly, the beloved (the name he inscribes once he “falls in love”). By looking at these, the dissertation investigates the notions of both reading and writing. The dissertation is divided into two chapters: the first, which looks at the inscription as something visible and legible; and the second, which focuses on inscribing as an act which has a legacy. By using and comparing these two approaches, this dissertation demonstrates how Premier Amour can be seen as a first step towards a general comprehension of a written “literary legacy”. Specifically, the dissertation shows the linguistic construction of the conceptual interlacing of the inscriptions and the legacy it conveys and presupposes, as this interlacing is inherent to our understanding of the literary and the human world. By means of a conclusion, this dissertation considers the conflicting relationship between, on the one hand, the contemporaneousness which dreams of a world without inscription, and on the other hand, the inevitability of inscription.

860	L’origine géographique en tant que facteur explicatif de la cyberdélinquance	This memory suggests that the origin of a cybercriminal is an explanatory factor of the phenomenon of cybercrime. It has two specific objectives: first, to describe the profile of cybercriminals identified in the international media. It also aims to check whether these profiles vary according to the origin of the cybercriminal. A database was created, with 90 cases of cybercriminals, worldwide. Fifteen (15) cybercriminals were selected per geographical territories, areas ranging as follows: North America, Latin America, Australasia, Western Europe, Eurasia, and Africa/Arabian Peninsula. First of all, descriptive analyzes were performed in order to paint a picture of this phenomenon. Secondly, analyzes of contingency tables were performed between the variables being studied to see if relationships existed. Finally, other analyzes of contingency tables were performed to establish the differences of the parameters depending on the origin. The results of these tests reveal that it is in general young men with an average age of 25 who will commit computer crimes. Some typical profiles emerged from the analysis and can be explained by access to computers, Internet speed, and inequalities in economic distribution, depending on the origin of the cybercriminal.

861	Intégrer les études d'impact des droits de la personne au processus législatif canadien : une étude de cas  sur des changements apportés à la loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés concernant les étrangers désignés et les pays d'origine désignés	On the 28th of June 2012, the Parliament of Canada adopted modifications to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), introducing important changes in the way claims for refugee protection from inside Canada are treated. These modifications bring about new concepts in Canadian law. The first is the notion of “designated countries of origin”. By ministerial Decree, the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration designates countries that do not usually produce refugees. Asylum seekers from these countries will face some important changes in the treatment of their application. The second one is the status of “designated foreign national”; it gives the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness the authority to designate as irregular the arrival of migrants who are not in possession of regulatory documentation. This designation leads to mandatory detention. The designated foreign nationals will also face specific treatment. These dispositions raise questions about their validity with respect to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. As a first step, the object of this master’s thesis is to show that there is an information gap in the Canadian legislative process. A majority government is able to pass into law any of its own bills as it controls both the Executive and the Legislature. The government is not bound to inform adequately the opposition parties nor the electors about the risks of any bill. In our opinion, this is an obvious gap since some bills are adopted without the government having to provide justifications, even if they run the risk of being in violation of the Constitution and more particularly of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedom. This thesis explores the idea of using Human Rights Impact assessments (HRIA): an analysis model evaluating the impact of laws, regulations and public policies on human rights. The cases of France, Great Britain and the European Commission are used in this analysis. Finally, this thesis analyzed “designated country of origin” and “designated foreign national” dispositions of the IRPA in regard to the Canadian Charter and international law. We conclude that if these dispositions had been analyzed using a HRIA prior to their adoption, the Parliament and Canadians would have been informed about the risk of violation of the concerned asylum seekers’ fundamental rights.

862	Virtual (dis) connectivities : mobile intimacy and presence for women in long distance relationships	Globally speaking, an increasing amount of people are on the move for many reasons; whether for work, studies, travel, emigration or exile (Elliott and Urry, 2010). These movements, or lack thereof, along with the development of communication technologies raise important questions around the ways people are able to connect, as well as disconnect, when they are apart. This thesis aims to understand women’s perspectives and practices of intimacy and presence with their partners when they are separated by distance for extended periods of time. This thesis examines various practices of connection, through old and new technologies (mobile technologies), as well as the bodily senses that participate in intimacy and a sense of presence. Informed by the new mobilities paradigm (Sheller & Urry, 2006) as well as the emerging literature on mobile intimacy (Hjorth & Lim, 2012; Elliott & Urry, 2010) and imagined presence (Chayko, 2002; Elliott and Urry, 2010), I propose the notions of virtual (dis)connectivity, virtual place, and technological absence and presence to frame and analyze the practices engaged in by my study’s participants. Through a combination of methods, including semi-structured interviews, multimedia diaries, autoethnography, and research creation, questions of the sensory practices of mobile intimacy, control and monitoring, emerging forms of affective labor, immediacy, and reciprocity are examined in an age of global interconnectedness.	mobile intimacy , mobilities , place , connectivity , imagined presence	en	12521.0
863	Marginalization and Transnationalizing Movements: How Does One Relate to the Other?	The main objective of this chapter is to address the following theoretical issue: How are the transnationalization and the marginalization processes related? We suggest that in order to understand more accurately how marginalized people’s movements and transnationalization processes are embedded, we need to open our understanding of transnationalization processes to see what the actors do when they build transnationalizing movements. In order to analyze experiences of poor people’s movement transnationalizing, we propose first to consider transnationalization as a social practice of solidarities building and second, as practices of “translation,” a search of recognition beyond borders.

864	Collaborer : un jeu d’enfant? : regards des parents de familles vulnérables sur les relations famille-école	Parents in vulnerable families encounter both personal and social problems that further complicate their ability for effective parenting; this, leading to incidences that may affect their child’s development (Léveillé, Chamberland et Tremblay-Renaud, 2007). Therefore, there may be an increase of school-based and social interventions seen within these families. It is strongly recommended that parents be encouraged to actively participate in available programs as well as academic and social intervention strategies (MSSS, 2003). Participating in these programs can be quite challenging for these parents. The objective of this research is to develop a better understanding of the parents’ point of view with regards to the professionals who participate in the decision making process for their child’s academic development as well as their own place in the decisions making process. In order to meet this objective, a sub sample of 19 parents was used to evaluate the AIDES initiative. Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with the participants. An analysis of the results identified three dimensions that are influencing the parents’ level of satisfaction: the parents’ position within the decisions making process, the quality of the relationship with the professionals and whether the needs of their child are met. An exploration of ways to encourage parental participation in school-based decision making and improve the ability to meet the need of these children living in vulnerable families is presented.

865	Les causes des violences ethniques de 2010 au Kirghizistan	Following the ethnic violence which happened in southern Kyrgyzstan in 2010, several authors and media sources have stated that the confrontation between the Uzbeks and the Kyrgyz was due to manipulations of ethnicity by the region’s elites. This master’s dissertation analyzes the influence of elites within Kyrgyz society, it thus analyzes they’re capacity to mobilize people for something as radical as ethnic violence. The political and economic leverage which these elites have in society is thus confronted to more emotional factors of mobilisation. Scott Radnitz’s theory on clientelism and on elite’s ability to gather large crowds for public gatherings will be examined and opposed to other theories which attribute more emotional causes to confrontation. The results of this analysis indicate that Radnitz offers and excellent guide to studying any type of mobilisation in Kyrgyzstan. However, in the case of ethnic violence, the emotional aspect to mobilisation must be taken into account to fully understand the situation.

866	Logarithme d'harmoniques sphériques pour le rendu d'ombres douces de champs de hauteurs et de maillages	"Shadows provide important visual cues to a viewer about the relative positions of objects in a scene, as well as certain properties of the lighting in an environment, such as orientation, size, and intensity. The importance of shadows in visual simulations is even more striking when any element of an environment, such as characters in a scene or the light sources themselves, are animated over time.  The simulation of so-called ""hard"" shadows from small point or directional light sources is a very mature field in computer graphics, with many concrete and well-established solutions. On the other hand, efficiently approximating the shadowing effects from larger ""area"" light sources, such as ceiling lights or environment maps captured from the real world, remains an open problem. Indeed, in many applications, the availability of a high-performance solution to this problem trumps the need for an accurate solution.  Our work aims to solve the problem of approximating soft shadows interactively, in scenes where the geometric elements and lighting are both allowed to be animated over time. We decompose dynamic scene elements into deformable objects, approximated with a collection of non-deformable animated spheres, and height field geometry. By leveraging a novel spherical harmonic basis-space exponentiation formulation, we are able to very quickly accumulate the shadowing effects from these many dynamic blockers, while also encoding their local reflectance behaviour in a similar reduced basis representation.  Our proof-of-concept implementation uses a hybrid, multi-resolution image- and object-space visibility marching algorithm that decouples geometric complexity from radiometric complexity. We demonstrate our method on several scenes with dynamic blockers and complex illumination."

867	La science historique et le rapport aux savoirs des manuels québécois du cours collégial «Histoire de la civilisation occidentale» : analyse épistémologique et critique	While the teaching of history in Quebec once aimed to promote students acquire specific content, nationalist and religious, decades of scientific and political will seek to reorient the discipline. The history taught must now shift its approach to the history of science. In focusing on the transmission of content, learning is now targeting a specific mode of apprehending reality: historical thinking. This study raises the question of correspondence between school history and the current scholarly historiography in the context of epistemological paradigm shift and reports to know that this implies. The assumption is that the history taught – as it appears in Western history textbooks for use by college students – did not follow the historiographical developments in recent years, specifically with regard to their epistemological posture.

recherche de la matière sombre"	The latest cosmological measurement showed the presence of a type of exotic matter constituing of 85% mass-energy of the universe. This type of non-baryonic matter would consist of neutral, non-relativistic, massives particules which are weakly interacting with normal matter. All the candidates are grouped under the generic name of WIMPs (Weakly Interactive Massive Particles). The PICASSO project (Project In CAnada to Search for Supersymmtric Objects) is an experiment using superheated liquid C4F10 as target material. The detection principle is a variant of the bubble chamber technique and the experiment ins installed in the SNOLAB underground laboratory in Sudbury (Ontario). The goal of this project is to make a direct measurement of a dark matter particle. The detection principle is that a dark matter particule interacting with the active liquid produces a nuclear recoil of 19F. The energy deposition of the recoiling fluorine nucleus triggers a phase transition accompagnied by an acoustic signal recorded by piezoelectrics sensors. In this work, the simulation of the count rate of PICASSO detectors subjected to monoenergetic neutron beam was performed using the theory of Seitz which describes particle induced phase transitions in supherheated liquids. which describes the criteria for a phase transition to occur in a superheated liquid. In addition, a model calculating the acoustic signal emitted during a phase transition caused by different types of radiation has been developped which allowed the characterisation of the discrimination between different kind of background events as a function of threshold energy. Finally, an acoustic signal analysis tools, the localisation of events, was used to apply fiducial cuts to the detectors in order to improve the alpha-neutron discrimination.

869	"L’implication du réseau fronto-pariétal dans le raisonnement 
est-elle atypique chez les autistes?"	Having a distinct cognitive profile, autistic individuals, as opposed to non-autistics, tend to obtain higher scores at the Raven’s Progressive Matrices test (RSPM), than at the Wechsler IQ tests and to resolve the items of the RSPM more quickly. Though, the cerebral processes underlying these differences are not well known. Re-analyzing data previously published (Soulières et al., 2009), this study aims to characterize the modulation of the reasoning network by task complexity in the fronto-parietal reasoning network in autistic individuals (AUT) in comparison to a control group (Non-AUT) during a fluid reasoning task. 15 AUT and 18 Non-AUT resolved the 60 RSPM problems while lying in an MRI. As reasoning complexity was increasing, an increase in the activity in the occipital areas in the AUT group, and in frontal and parietal areas for the Non-AUT group were observed. Moreover, as task complexity was increasing, the modulation of the connectivity between areas involved in reasoning was lower in AUT, and they showed a more narrowly focused implication of occipital areas in this modulation as opposed to Non-AUT. These results suggest that autistic individuals are less affected by task complexity, given a lower modulation of the reasoning network that they exhibit for a similar accuracy, and rely more on visuospatial processes to solve complex matrices. These results give us a better understanding of the cognitive processes engaged in autistic intelligence and on the positive influence that the autistic enhanced perceptual functioning has on it.

870	Le «recours en oppression» : quelles attentes raisonnables pour les créanciers ?	Creditors feature prominently in the corporate governance of Canadian business corporations and significantly contribute to their funding. Creditors perform in exchange for a promise to be paid later, so that they are in an agency conflict with other stakeholders of the corporation, especially managers. The main procedural route for litigation in corporate law, the oppression remedy helps curb some aspects of the agency conflict by granting courts broad powers to remedy oppressive conduct. This judicial intervention is expressed through the theory of reasonable expectations, which states that the court must not only protect the legal rights of the parties but also their reasonable expectations. The case law shows that creditors have reasonable expectations toward the information provided by the corporation, its assets and the decision-making process of managers and directors. It also suggests a reasonable expectation with respect to changes in the sharing of risks arising from an unforeseeable event.

871	Méthode efficace d'assignation de tissus humains par tomodensitométrie à double énergie	A stoichiometric method is usually used to analyze computed tomography images. A curve links the Hounsﬁeld units on the images to the electron density in a given me- dium. Dual-energy computed tomography gives additional information on a scan. A stoi- chiometric method was developed to acquire both electron density and effective atomic number from a pair of images. The aim of this research is to develop a new method to identify tissues using the parame- ters extracted from dual-energy computed tomography. This new method is compared to the standard single-energy computed tomography segmentation method. Furthermore, the effect of correctly assigning tissues on dose distribution is studied. Monte Carlo simulations allow the use of perfectly known numerical phantoms. Dif- ferent phantoms allowed the calibration of the stoichiometric methods, the comparison of the versatility and the robustness of the dual-energy and the single-energy methods, and the comparison of dose distribution in phantoms of same densities, but of different compositions. The dual-energy identiﬁcation method gives more accurate values of electron density in any studied condition. This method is also more robust to tissues of variable density. The dosimetric impact of an accurate identiﬁcation becomes more important for treatments using lower energy photons, such as imaging energies and brachytherapy.	dose distribution , tissue identification , effective atomic number , electron density	en	12440.0
872	Les impacts urbains des évènements sportifs internationaux : les cas du parc municipal Américo Renné Giannetti à Belo Horizonte (Brésil) et la Coupe du monde de 2014	"Mega sporting events have become an important global phenomenon. Host countries and cities use these events to promote an image of global development. Such events often lead to major urban renewal projects. The nature of the impact of such development project on local populations remains unclear. In light of these processes, this study had the objective of  identifying and analyzing differing local perspectives on the revitalization of the Américo  Renné Giannetti Municipal Park in Belo Horizonte (Brazil), within the context of spatial  transformations of the city for the 2014 World Cup. We begin by situating this research within  the literature that examines urban redevelopment in relationship to mega events. This literature suggests that, through the practices of urban entrepreneurialism, certain urban areas, such as parks and historical districts are transformed into ""products"" to be consumed by a very specific audience. In order to understand whether a similar type of process is under way in Belo Horizonte, we conducted a study of the history and contemporary transformation of the Municipal Park. Based on field observations, interviews with people who frequent the park, as well as interviews with individuals involved in the park management, we examine the social role that the park plays in Belo Horizonte. The analysis of different visions of the project leads us to conclude that the revitalization of the park for the World Cup responds to the interests of the private sector, particularly tourism. In this context, the social impact for the local population is inevitable. While the redevelopment of the park responds to the need of certain citizens, the alteration of the space leads to exclusions and reaffirms segregation in urban areas."

873	Les municipalités dans le secteur énergétique québécois : le cas du chauffage urbain	In a global context of climate change and energy transition, Quebec seems to be privileged, producing a large amount of cheap hydroelectricity.  But aside from the established  popular belief  that  Quebec’s energy is abundant, clean and inexpensive, Quebec’s energy future is still precarious. Within a few decades,  Quebec will have to import a significant amount of electricity at a higher price than it actually produces it; the cheap exploitable hydro resources will not only get scarcer if not nonexistent; and the national hydroelectric ``cultural`` heritage even seems to quell the development of alternative energies, letting few space for local innovation coming from municipalities.   While in many countries, municipalities are recognised as key figures in the energy sector, here, in Quebec, their role in the national energy system seems marginal. As main actors responsible for territorial planning, it seams that municipalities could play a more important role on Quebec’s energy scene.  So they can densify their territory, develop active and collective solutions to transportation issues, they can adopt exemplary energetic habits, they can produce their  own energy with wind, solar or even district heating systems.  District heating and heat networks being less well know and documented in Quebec, the present study aims at explaining their low penetration level in the Quebec energy landscape. The study also attempts to understand what are the  main hurdles to the implementation of district heating in Quebec’s particular energetic context. Finally, the  research tries to open a discussion  on the motives that could incite municipalities to adopt district heating as an energy alternative.  Based on  some twenty interviews with key actors of the energy and municipal sectors, the findings give some indications that the low penetration level of district heating in the Quebec municipalities could explain itself in part by : the low priced hydroelectricity, the presence of a comfortable, sufficient and pervasive Hydro-Quebec(er) culture, and also by organizational dynamic and a certain political inertia which limit the appropriation of an energy competence by local governments.   In turn,  the study shows that district heating solutions are more likely to develop in contexts in which : there are minimum urban or energy density levels; the development of district heating coincides with the local or regional economic structure; and where exist a mobilising local leader or local visions from a community in favor of the implementation of alternative energy systems.

874	Adolescence, immigration et santé mentale : schisme et articulation des discours soignants autour des orientations et des stratégies d'intervention en contexte ethnopsychiatrique	The psychological suffering of teenagers has drawn increasing attention of the public authorities, associations, and of course clinicians and psychosocial workers. For migrant teens, this suffering, exacerbated by the fragility, discomforts and tensions of adolescence, is complicated by the complex bureaucratic public health apparatus designed to translate into the language of health care the malaise of attitudes, behaviours, and tendencies that emerge from their migrant status and history.  This thesis explores one of these, the transcultural psychiatry clinic, where listening to what is said is as important as translating and managing these complaints. Using an anthropological approach, I analyze the speech and attitudes of ten therapists and social workers who work with families and teenagers. This research shows that the framework of social and cultural management that includes caregivers and families, and the ambivalencies of young teens, cannot be analyzed without referencing the broader context of class differences, power, and the past condition that influence both teen suffering and how their anguish is communicated and translated. In this particular perspective, the paradoxes and resistances of some medical and social professionals, whose position in the power structure could otherwise tempt them to engage in facile diagnoses linked to allegedly improper socialisation of these migrant teens. Instead, they create unique strategies that respect the official idioms that frame their medical and social authority.

875	Le concept de justice et la quête du bonheur chez Thrasymaque de Chalcédoine	"Thrasymachus of Chalcedon, a renowned sophist in the Athens of the fifth century BC, is presented as the main interlocutor of Socrates in Book I of the Republic. As it is mainly a debate on the question of justice and its implications, Socrates and Thrasymachus are obviously not agreeing on the nature of justice. Thrasymachus, driven by the constant questioning of Socrates, comes to formulate different theories about justice, including: ""I support that justice is nothing else than the interest of the stronger"" (Rép. 338c) and ""justice and just are actually another's good."" (Rép. 343c) Meanwhile, he opposes the philosopher a vision of justice difficult to accept, but also hard to refute: one who commits injustice is happier than he who acts according to justice Thus, for Thrasymachus, injustice is better than justice and is happier because injustice is more profitable for yourself. According to this view, what is justice, and why is it not profitable for ourselves? The objective of this thesis is to highlight the positive conception of Thrasymachus about justice, because it is in conflict with the pursuit of happiness. Indeed, if justice represent the interests of the ruler, as argued by the sophist, then being just is nothing else that acting according to the interests of others and not yourself. However, in a city where people are under the guidance of the law, it is not always so easy to act according to its own interests when they are contrary to justice. That is why it is also relevant to dwell on the characteristics and qualities an individual must possess, according to Thrasymachus, to be happy. We will try to identify in Thrasymachus' ideas about justice a life model to follow: the κρείττων. Ultimately, we will highlight the position of Thrasymachus with Plato's critique. For Socrates, the position that injustice is profitable is difficult because he will have to show that this is actually justice that brings happiness, as it is a virtue of the soul."

876	Proposition de combinaisons optimales de contractions volontaires maximales isométriques pour la normalisation de 12 muscles de l'épaule	As a means to provide information on the intensity of the muscle activity, the electromyographic (EMG) signal must be expressed as a percentage of a maximum activation value. Because of the anatomical complexity of the shoulder, no single maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) has been found to maximally activate the same muscle for a group of subjects. The objective of this study is to develop a statistical approach to determine the optimal MVICs that can maximise the activation levels for several shoulder muscles. The amplitude of the EMG signal of 12 shoulder muscles was recorded as 16 subjects performed 15 MVICs in standardised positions. A first systematic approach was used to determine the optimal 4 MVICs amongst 15 that could maximise the activation levels of 12 shoulder muscles simultaneously. The activation levels produced by these 4 MVICs were significantly higher than those produced by previous recommendations. A second approach was adopted to identify the minimum number of MVICs that were required to produce muscle activation levels that did not significantly differ from the maximum activation values. For 12 shoulder muscles, 9 MVICs were necessary to produce muscle activation levels that were representative of the maximum effort of all 16 subjects. This study proposed two novel approaches, the first of which maximised the EMG activation levels that can be produced by a fixed number of MVICs while the second approach identified the minimum number of MVICs required to produce EMG activation levels that were not significantly different from the maximum values of activation. These two approaches provided guidelines with regards to the MVICs that are necessary to normalize the EMG signals of 12 shoulder muscles while reducing the risks of underestimating the maximum capacity of each individual.

877	Impacts fonctionnels diurnes et corrélats psychopathologiques dans le somnambulisme adulte	Sleepwalking is a common sleep disorder affecting up to 4% of adults and is associated with a risk of serious injuries to self or others. The mechanisms responsible for the disorder are still misunderstood but psychopathology has long been considered as a key factor in development of sleepwalking. While most research efforts have focused on nighttime correlates of the disorder, very few studies have examined the daytime consequences of sleepwalking. The first goal of this thesis was to clarify the relation between sleepwalking and psychopathology. The first study investigated the prevalence of depressive and anxious symptomatology in a large sample of patients. Results showed that only a minority of sleepwalkers presented with significant psychopathological symptoms. Overall, the clinical profile of patients with and without significant symptoms was more similar than dissimilar. In addition, a smaller proportion of patients with more severe symptoms reported a family history of sleepwalking when compared to those with no or few symptoms, suggesting that there could be a lesser contribution of genetic factors to their disorder. A greater proportion of patients with more severe symptoms also reported suffering from nightmares.   The second objective of this thesis was to investigate the daytime consequences of sleepwalking. The second study found that almost half of the sleepwalkers presented with clinically significant levels of sleepiness. Surprisingly, sleepiness wasn’t related to polysomnographic measures of sleep fragmentation or sleep depth. The third study found that 25 hours sleep deprivation impaired sleepwalkers’ inhibitory control during wakefulness compared to controls but between-groups differences in performance weren’t related to greater sleep fragmentation in sleepwalkers. In addition, sleep deprivation did not have a differential effect on patients’ sustained attention performance and no differences were found between groups when testing was performed during normal wakefulness.  In sum, the results from this thesis indicate that a majority of sleepwalkers don’t present with clinically elevated scores on measures of psychopathology. However, findings from studies two and three reveal the existence of significant daytime consequences in sleepwalkers that could be related to pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the disorder. The investigation of daytime phenomenon in patients suffering from somnambulism appears to be a promising research venue that could improve our understanding of sleepwalking.

878	Mécanismes cérébraux de la régulation de la douleur : perception de la douleur et hypoalgésie induite psychologiquement	Objective: This thesis aims to clarify the neuropsychological mechanisms of pain, of the endogenous regulation of pain and of psychologically induced hypoalgesia (PIH), through the synthesis of almost thirty years of functional brain imaging research. Methodology: Given the abundance of studies in this domain and the lack of integration of their results, we used the quantitative meta-analysis technique based on brain activation using the ALE (Activation likelihood Estimate) statistic. The strength of this thesis lies in the globalized perspective of the litterature, and in the rigor of the article selection process from which results were extracted. Indeed, the studies included in the meta-analyses needed to meet strict inclusion criteria in order to strengthen the accuracy and the validity of subsequent conclusions. Study 1: The first article is aimed at identifying brain areas involved in pain reduction through psychological methods of intervention. Chosen articles that covered a variety of approaches, such as placebo, hypnosis, meditation, perception of control over the stimulation, and induction of emotions. Analysis across these various studies indicated that PIH involves a broad network of activation that includes the anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insulae, orbital and lateral prefrontal and frontal areas, as well as parietal, temporal and subcortical regions. This activation network may reflect the involvement of diverse neuropsychological mechanisms in the various affective, self-awareness, cognitive and motivational processes underlying the psychological interventions targeted by these studies. In addition, we explored some specific patterns of brain activity related to placebo and distraction, in comparison to other approaches. We propose several hypotheses regarding the distinctive neuropsychological processes underlying these approaches. Study 2: The second article aimed at investigating patterns of brain activity preferentially associated with pain perception or with PIH. First we assessed patterns of increased and decreased activity during experimental pain in healthy volunteers. Second we determined the brain regions preferentially activated during pain perception or during PIH with subtraction analyses. Using a conjunction analysis, we also determined a set of brain regions possibly involved in regulatory processes activated spontaneously during acute of pain. Our results indicate that 1) somatosensory and motor areas are preferentially related to pain perception, which may reflect the preparation of a motor response, 2) dorsolateral prefrontal areas, anterior insula and the anterior midcingulate cortex were associated with both pain and PIH and may reflect the spontaneous activation of top-down regulation mechanisms during pain, and 3) antero-medial and orbital prefrontal regions were preferentially associated with PIH, which may indicate motivational and emotional processes associated with the engagement of an externally driven hypoalgesic procedure.

879	Structures algébriques, systèmes superintégrables et polynômes orthogonaux	"This thesis is divided into five parts concerned with the following topics: the physical and algebraic interpretation of families of multivariate orthogonal functions and their applications, the study of superintegrable quantum systems in two and three dimensions involving reflection operators, the characterization of families of orthogonal polynomials of the Bannai-Ito scheme and the study of the algebraic structures associated to them, the investigation of the relationship between the recoupling of irreducible representations of algebras and superalgebras and superintegrable systems, as well as the algebraic interpretation of families of matrix multi-orthogonal polynomials. In the first part, we develop the physical and algebraic interpretation of the Krawtchouk, Meixner and Charlier families of multivariate orthogonal polynomials as matrix elements of unitary representations of the SO(d + 1), SO(d, 1) and E(d) groups on oscillator states. We determine the transition amplitudes between the states of the singular oscillator associated to the Cartesian and polyspherical bases in terms of the multivariate Hahn polynomials. We examine the 9j coefficients of su(1,1) through the generic superintegrable system on the 3-sphere. We characterize the q-Krawtchouk polynomials as matrix elements of ""q-rotations"" of U_q(sl_2). We show how to design a two-dimensional spin network that allows perfect state transfer using the two-variable Krawtchouk polynomials and we construct a discrete model of the two-dimensional quantum oscillator using the two-variable Meixner polynomials. In the second part, we study superintegrable systems of Dunkl type, which involve reflections. We examine the Dunkl oscillator in two and three dimensions, the singular Dunkl oscillator in the plane and the generic system on the 2-sphere with reflections. We show that each of these systems is superintegrable. We obtain their constants of motion, we find their symmetry algebras as well as their representations, we give their exact solutions and we exhibit their relationship with the orthogonal polynomials of the Bannai-Ito scheme. In the third part, we characterize two families of polynomials belonging to the Bannai-Ito scheme: the complementary Bannai-Ito polynomials and the Chihara polynomials. We also show that the Bannai–Ito polynomials arise as Racah coefficients for the osp(1,2) superalgebra. We determine the symmetry algebra associated with the dual − 1 Hahn polynomials in the context of the Clebsch-Gordan problem for osp(1,2). We introduce a q -generalization of the Bannai-Ito polynomials by examining the Racah problem for the quantum superalgebra osp_q(1,2). Finally, we show that the q-deformed Bannai-Ito algebra serves as a covariance algebra for osp_q(1,2). In the fourth part, we determine the relationship between the recoupling of representations of the su(1,1) and osp(1,2) algebras and second-order superintegrable systems with or without reflections. We also study representations of Racah–Wilson and Bannai-Ito algebras. Moreover, we show that the Racah Wilson algebra serves as a quadratic covariance algebra for sl(2). In the fifth part, we explicitly construct two families of d-orthogonal polynomials based on su(2). We investigate the squeezed/coherent states of the finite oscillator and we characterize a family of matrix multi-orthogonal polynomials."

880	"La traduction au Maroc sous le protectorat français 
1912-1956 : 
étude de trois auto-traducteurs de l’IHEM"	The Textes arabes de l’Ouargha (Lévi-Provençal, 1922), the Textes arabes de Rabat (Brunot, 1931) and the Textes arabes des Zaër (Loubignac, 1952), dealing with three regions in Morocco, draw attention to their methodological organization, as well as to their themes.  The three works, consisting of an Arab version, a transcription using Latin characters and an annotated translation, provide a portrait of colonial Morocco between 1912 and 1956. Following in the footsteps of Orientalist William Marçais, the three self-translators concerned themselves with Moroccan ethnography in all its facets. To examine the works of these self-translators, we studied their translation not only from a comparative perspective, but also from a paratextual standpoint. In addition, we conducted a socio-historical study of these translators that proved useful to better understand their ideology and above all shed light on their membership in the community of scholars. For this purpose, our theoretical framework was based on both an archaeological component and a critical component in order to identify the norms underlying the translators’ intentional interventions. The preface and numerous notes clearly illustrate the different translation projects, namely, to “strengthen the edifice” of the French administration. Admittedly, our analysis of the self-translations did not reveal significant interventions and, thus, the study of the Moroccan dialect transcription became an important part of my research. A reading of each transcription – an intralinguistic translation from the oral to the written – and a grasp of all its aspects demonstrate that the role of each of the three self-translations, done by translators in the service of the IHEM, was to shape the image of Moroccans and consolidate the French colonial project in Morocco.

881	Transformations quasi-conformes de maillages volumiques et applications en infographie	Geometric modeling is important for both computer graphics and engineering. Our ability to represent geometric information sets the limits and the ease with which we manipulate 3D objects. One such representation is the volume mesh, that is composed of polyhedra assembled to approximate a desired shape. Some applications, such as texturing and remeshing, benefit from deforming the mesh to a more regular domain in order to perform some operations. We say that a deformation is \emph{quasi-conformal} if its distortion is bounded.  In this thesis, we propose algorithms for quasi-conformal deformations of volume meshes. We study these deformations because of their good local shape preservation properties and because they are still relatively unknown to the graphics community, as opposed to their 2D counterparts. This research attempts to generalize \gilles{some well-known surface deformation concepts to volumes}.  First, we present a linear approach to quasi-conformality. We develop a method that deforms a solid to a parameterization domain using a linear least squares method. This method is fast and simple to implement, but the result is an approximation to quasi-conformality because distortion is not bounded. Second, we solve this latter limitation with a nonlinear approach based on vertex positions. We develop a technique to deform the parameterization domain to a solid shape using a nonlinear least squares method. Nonlinearity lets us include constraints that guarantee the injectivity of the deformation. Moreover, deforming the parameterization domain instead of the shape itself lets us use more general domains. Third, we present a nonlinear approach based on dihedral angles. Our method defines the deformation of the volume mesh using its dihedral angles instead of its vertex positions. This change of variables permits a natural expression of the bounds of the deformation distortion. We present some applications of this new approach that include volume parameterization, shape interpolation, mesh optimization, and mesh compression of tetrahedral meshes.

882	L’illusion des signaux pénaux : l’effet tendancieux de l’impunité différentielle	Using an economic approach to crime, this thesis focuses on offenders’ ability to minimize their risks of arrest or conviction and on the effect of this differential adaptation on the way we should interpret offenders’ profile based on police and correctional statistics. Studies using the approach mostly insisted on penal costs, but overlooked the benefits that offenders gain from crime and their differential vulnerability to risks, essential to its interpretation. Considering penal experiences as an information signal between offenders and criminal justice system officials, both parties would need to interpret this signal with a serious amount of noise: penal avoidance. This signal distortion induced to police officers, judge or correctional officers a misleading depiction of inefficient offenders. Our first analysis, based on a population estimates method, assess the intensity of this distortion through the different steps of the penal system (arrest, conviction, incarceration). This noise is not randomly distributed, but influenced by offenders’ characteristics. Offenders who are less prone to detection are be more experienced in the achievement of their offences: older, more geographically mobile, more specialized. Our second analysis looked at the effect of penal avoidance on our interpretation of recidivism. Self-reported offending data from an inmate sample, in conjunction with penal data, allowed us to assess individual penal avoidance ability. When taking into consideration penal avoidance, past penal experiences appear to be an indicator of failure faced by offenders during their criminal career rather than its true continuation, creating the illusion of the efficient prediction of recidivism using past penal experiences. The intensity of past penal costs reduces the probability of the continuation of the criminal career. The benefits of crime increase this probability while legitimate opportunities reduce it.  Our third analysis, also using a population estimates methods combined to a variation adapted for offenders’ urban mobility, gives a macro perspective to our past observations and allowed us to examine the evolution of offenders populations from different ethnic groups in function of the intensity of police surveillance they each are subject to. Our results suggest that, for offenses with more proactive reporting, an increased surveillance of one group results in the decreased surveillance of other groups. The preventive effect on the first group is then cancelled by an incentive effect on the second. This effect alone suffices to increase the total criminal population. This Harcourt effect corrects the illusion of criminal profiling or targeted strategies efficiency. In conclusion, we observe that relying solely on penal data to assess offenders behaviours maintain an illusion of penal efficiency. The noise caused by offenders’ penal avoidance or differential impunity influences our understanding of offenders’ adaptive behaviors.	estimation population , analyse de capture-recapture , adaptation criminelle , Penal avoidance , dark figure of crime , population estimation , capture-recapture analysis , penal recidivism , criminal adaptation	en	12325.0
883	Design de nouvelles fonctionnelles en théorie de la fonctionnelle de la densité et conception de polymères pour application à la photovoltaïque organique	This thesis is about calculations using density functional theory (DFT) in order to simulate systems in which long range peoperties are important. Particular emphasis is put on excitation energies, especially in the context of applications in photovoltaics. These effects are adressed in two different ways. In the first place, well-established DFT tools are used to simulate systems of experimental interest. Secondly, DFT’s underlying theory will be explored, its limits will be identified and new theoretical developments will be suggested in reponse to them. For the first part of this thesis, numerical calculations using DFT and time- dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) as implemented in the Gaussian software system [1] are done with known functionals on molecules and polymers of experimental interest. In particular, the project presented in chapter 2 explores the use of lateral chains in order to optimize electronic properties of polymers which are already widely used in organic photovoltaics. The results obtained show that a judicious choice of lateral chains can allow good control of the electronic properties of these polymers and can make photovoltaic cells using these polymers more efficient. The project presented in chapter 3 uses TDDFT in order to explore the optical properties of two polymers, poly-3-hexyl-thiophene (P3HT) and poly- 3-hexyl-selenophene (P3HS) as well as a blend of these two polymers, in order to support experimental observations indicating an exciplex formation in the blend. The numerical calculations in the first part of this thesis allow us to make a few very interesting conclusions, however they also emphasize certain limitations of DFT and TDDFT when treating excited states, due to the approximate treatment of long-range Coulombic interactions. So, the second part of this thesis comes back to the theoretical foundations of DFT. To be more precise, in chapter 4, a series of functionals better modelizing long-range Coulombic interactions based on a non-local approach is elaborated. The functionals expand upon the weighted density approximation (WDA) and impose several exact conditions which should be satisfied by the exchange hole. These functionals are implemented in the Gaussian [1] software system and their performances are evaluated with tests on a series of atoms and molecules. The results obtained show that many of these functionals improve upon the WDA and they also provide some insight on the relative importance of satisfying each of the exact conditions.

884	When glaciers vanish : nature, power and moral order in the indian Himalayas	The dissertation presents an ethnographic study that examines knowledge as a situated practice in Ladakh, in the Indian Himalayas. It analyzes the sociocultural implications of two drivers of change at play in Ladakh: one is of socioeconomic origin and linked to the production of Ladakh as a border area, while the other is environmental and driven by climate change. Ladakh, which remained outside the scope of the bureaucratic state during the British colonial administration, found itself refashioned into a strategic border area following India’s independence and successive wars with Pakistan and China. Independence led to the partition of Indian into India and Pakistan in 1947; the dissertation examines the long-term, traumatic events of the partition in Ladakh, tracing connections to current perceptions of climate change. The independent Indian state has produced itself in the region through the taming of its mountains, primarily through infrastructure development and the co-optation of Ladakhi knowledge of the environment by the military apparatus. Far-reaching militarization has restructured Ladakh’s economy, consequently redefining household structure, contributing to village depopulation, displacing the centrality of agro-pastoralist activities and, as the dissertation argues, significantly altering the local population’s engagement with the environment. The increasing rationalization of the outlook on the environment today contributes to the fragmentation of links between the natural and human realms within the local cosmology and the abandonment of related ritual practices. Concurrently, the region is impacted by distinct effects of climate change, in particular glacier recession. The dissertation juxtaposes both the subjective experience of wide-ranging environmental changes and changes in everyday village life with historical facts, showing that local historical events influence perceptions of glacier recession and the depletion of natural resources. The analysis demonstrates that objective phenomena such as glacier recession are interpreted through local realities. Specifically, in the local worldview, a vanishing glacier is a trope for changes in the human condition. Yet, as the dissertation further argues, such cultural framing does not preclude the objectivity of natural history in local cosmology. Moreover, cultural framing and empirical experience, therefore, are shown to be essential to the vitality of local knowledge about the environment and to the performance of associated landscape practices.

885	Les contrôles à l'aide sociale: l'expérience québécoise des visites à domicile	Each year since 1986, between 100,000 and 135,000 households of Quebec welfare recipients have been visited by welfare inspectors, without any prior evidence of fraud. Yet, we know very little about the relevance and meaning of such controls. Following a review of the Quebec debate on this question, we try to evaluate the relevance of home visitations given the government's objectives, which focus on the reduction of errors and fraud. Since from this strictly administrative point of view, the results appear dubious, we also analyse the broader political meaning of the operation.		en	12262.0
886	Quand les mouvements sociaux changent la politique. Le cas du mouvement étudiant de 2012 au Québec	Using the case of the 2012 student conflict in Québec, we show how social movements can temporarily transform politics. We define politics as the set of rules and individual and collective practices that regulate relations between actors regarding a community's government. We show three ways in which the 2012 student conflict transformed politics. Firstly, the six-month conflict created a new division around which politics reorganized itself. Secondly, political parties and student unions modified their daily practices, redefining their relationships and policies of alliance. Finally, the prolonged experience of mobilization transformed activists' relationship to politics by rearticulating the distinction between institutional and protest politics.	Québec	en	12254.0
887	"Comparing the Protests of Undocumented Migrants Beyond Contexts: Collective Actions
as Acts of Emancipation"	In this article, we demonstrate that the collective actions of undocumented migrants possess similar symbolic dimensions, even if the contexts of their actions differ. We explain this finding by focusing on the power relations that undocumented migrants face. Given that they occupy a very specific position in society (i.e., they are neither included in nor completely excluded from citizenship), they experience similar forms of power relations vis-à-vis public authorities in different countries. We argue that this leads them to participate in collective actions as acts of emancipation. Our analysis illustrates this argument by comparing marches by undocumented migrants in three countries: France, Germany and Canada-Quebec. Through an in-depth analysis, we demonstrate that these marches redefine the legal order and politicize the presence of undocumented migrants in the public sphere. By highlighting the cognitive, emotional and relational dimensions of collective actions, we show that the symbolic dimension of these three marches relates to the empowerment, pride and solidarity of undocumented migrants.

888	Public Opinion and Global Justice	The concept of global justice has been developed to stress the worldwide implications of moral problems. Not much, however, has been written about the actual politics of global justice. This article focuses on public opinion and argues that attitudes about international redistribution are not a simple projection of attitudes about the domestic situation. In countries where domestic income redistribution is seen as an important priority, foreign aid is less popular; where this is less so, there is more concern for the fate of the poor in the South. Far from reflecting a lack of coherence in public opinion, these counterintuitive results need to be understood in connection with policy achievements in donor countries. The authors' empirical findings suggest that although the commitment to redistribute is stronger at the national level, relationships of solidarity do not stop at national boundaries. The achievement of justice at home in fact sustains justice abroad.	Opinion publique , Justice	en	12249.0
889	La pratique de la contrepartie pour les personnes exclues du marché du travail : ici et ailleurs	The methods and practices of reciprocity in social assistance are compared in six OECD countries. The literature from English-speaking countries tends to talk about workfare while Continental European literature uses the concept of conditionality. The authors employ the term “reciprocity” as a generic concept encompassing all of the programs that include forms of conditionality for assistance, as opposed to the unconditional provision of assistance or benefits. The authors put forth an interpretation of these variations by comparing their results with the existing body of work in comparative politics on the development of the various types of welfare states. The development of reciprocity mechanisms, therefore, follows neither a single logic, nor a series of pre-mapped paths determined by existing institutions. To understand and evaluate current experiences and innovations, each case must be carefully examined, taking into account all the constraints, but also the opportunities, created by a new era in the development of the Welfare State.

890	Une loi contre la pauvreté :  La nouvelle approche québécoise de lutte contre la pauvreté et l’exclusion sociale	In June 2002 the government of Quebec unveiled a draft bill targeting poverty and social exclusion. Bill 112 would make anti-poverty actions a governmental priority and commits the government to developing concrete action plans and institutional structures for implementation. The draft bill is accompanied by the government’s anti-poverty strategy. This article describes the roots of the law and strategy in a citizen and popular initiative and considers its implications for democracy. While the project is relatively general, it does have the advantage that it puts anti-poverty in the spotlight as well as understanding the problem from a longitudinal, integrated and participatory perspective. Only time will tell whether there will be more specific results.		en	12243.0

892	In vivo effect of deoxynivalenol (DON) naturally contaminated feed on porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection	Deoxynivalenol (DON), also known as vomitoxin, is the most prevalent type B trichothecene mycotoxin worldwide. Pigs show a great sensitivity to DON, and because of the high proportion of grains in their diets, they are frequently exposed to this mycotoxin. The objective of this study was to determine the impact of DON naturally contaminated feed on porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection, the most important porcine viral pathogen in swine. Experimental infections were performed with 30 animals. Piglets were randomly divided into three groups of 10 animals based on DON content of diets (0, 2.5 and 3.5 mg/kg DON). All experimental groups were further divided into subgroups of 6 pigs and were inoculated with PRRSV. The remaining pigs (control) were sham-inoculated with PBS. Pigs were daily monitored for temperature, weight and clinical signs for 21 days. Blood samples were collected and tested for PRRSV RNA and for virus specific antibodies. Results of PRRSV infection showed that ingestion of diet highly contaminated with DON greatly increases the effect of PRRSV infection on weight gain, lung lesions and mortality, without increasing significantly viral replication, for which the tendency is rather directed toward a decrease of replication. These results suggest that PRRSV infection could exacerbate anorectic effect of DON, when ingested in large doses. Results also demonstrate a DON negative effect on PRRSV-specific humoral responses. This study demonstrate that high concentrations of DON naturally contaminated feed decreased the immune response against PRRSV and influenced the course of PRRSV infection in pigs.

893	The role of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) virus structural and non-structural proteins in virus pathogenesis	Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is an economically devastating viral disease affecting the swine industry worldwide. The etiological agent, PRRS virus (PRRSV), possesses a RNA viral genome with nine open reading frames (ORFs). The ORF1a and ORF1b replicase-associated genes encode the polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab, respectively. The pp1a is processed in nine non-structural proteins (nsps): nsp1a, nsp1b, and nsp2 to nsp8. Proteolytic cleavage of pp1ab generates products nsp9 to nsp12. The proteolytic pp1a cleavage products process and cleave pp1a and pp1ab into nsp products. The nsp9 to nsp12 are involved in virus genome transcription and replication. The 30 end of the viral genome encodes four minor and three major structural proteins. The GP2a, GP3 and GP4 (encoded by ORF2a, 3 and 4), are glycosylated membrane associated minor structural proteins. The fourth minor structural protein, the E protein (encoded by ORF2b), is an unglycosylated membrane associated protein. The viral envelope contains two major structural proteins: a glycosylated major envelope protein GP5 (encoded by ORF5) and an unglycosylated membrane M protein (encoded by ORF6). The third major structural protein is the nucleocapsid N protein (encoded by ORF7). All PRRSV non-structural and structural proteins are essential for virus replication, and PRRSV infectivity is relatively intolerant to subtle changes within the structural proteins. PRRSV virulence is multigenic and resides in both the non-structural and structural viral proteins. This review discusses the molecular characteristics, biological and immunological functions of the PRRSV structural and nsps and their involvement in the virus pathogenesis.

894	Identification of a novel herpesvirus associated with cutaneous ulcers in a fisher (Martes pennanti)	On December 8, 2008, a male fisher (Martes pennanti) housed in a quarantine enclosure at the St-Félicien Zoo was found dead with multiple skin ulcers on the muzzle and plantar pads. At necropsy, no major findings were found, and a specific cause of death was not determined microscopically. However, at the borders of ulcerated sites, there were increased numbers of koilocytes, with perinuclear vacuolation and nuclear enlargement. A pan-herpesvirus nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was conducted, and an expected PCR product of 230 nucleotides was obtained within tissues collected from around the skin ulcers. Other tissues, including intestines and pool of lung, liver, and kidney, tested negative. The obtained PCR amplicon was sequenced and was highly related to the partial viral DNA polymerase (DPOL) gene of Mustelid herpesvirus 1. Virus isolation was negative, and no virion was detected by electron microscopy. The pathogenic potential of this novel herpesvirus and its role in the death of the fisher are unknown.

895	Analyse de la transnationalisation de l’action collective : proposition pour une géographie des solidarités transnationales	This article considers the phenomenon of the transnationalization of collective action from a theoretical perspective. Our understanding of transnationalization and its practices is limited by the prevailing political process approach and its concept of politics, power and social change (Part I). The conceptual constraints, while not new, nonetheless take on a special colour when the actions transcend national boundaries and spark collective actions through a “geography” of transnational solidarities (Part II). Finally, we describe the exemplary case of solidarities represented by the World March of Women which contrasts the respective contributions of the political process approach with the approach proposed here (Part III).		en	12191.0

Simultaneously, a similar virus was also detected in Canadian mink based on partial viral genome sequencing. The origin of the new swH3N2/pH1N1 viral genes was related to the North American swH3N2 triple-reassortant cluster IV (for hemagglutinin [HA] and neuraminidase [NA] genes) and to pH1N1 for all the other genes (M, NP, NS, PB1, PB2, and PA).

897	Bridging The Unknown : An Interdisciplinary Case Study of Paratext in Electronic Literature	This chapter presents a dual perspective on the paratextual apparatus of a work of electronic literature, The Unknown: The Original Great American Hypertext Novel by William Gillespie, Scott Rettberg, Dirk Stratton, and Frank Marquardt. Approaches from literature studies and information science are combined to offer qualitative content analyses and close readings of the table of contents, titular apparatus, comments hidden in the source code, and other paratextual elements, in relation to the narrative. Findings indicate that the work's paratextual content presents inconsistencies and contradictions, both in terms of the use of the paratextual structure and of the information conveyed. The paratextual elements are analyzed through the lens of Gérard Genette's theory, as outlined in Paratexts: Thresholds of Interpretation, in order to gauge their role and efficiency as identifiers, organizational components, and information providers, as well as their literary effect. The value of the theory as an interdisciplinary tool is also discussed.	Content analysis (Communication) , Digital media , Paratext , Authorship , Genette, Gérard, 1930- -- Influence	en	12174.0
898	"Les facteurs de protection et leurs implications pour le 
traitement des délinquants sexuels"	"Abstract Objective: Protective factors are a topical issue in literature. However, no consensus exists as to their definition, as well as their possible effects on the delinquent behavior. In addition, very little information is known about which factors may influence the desistance among sex offenders, as well as their possible implications in the treatment of adult sex offenders. The objective of this research was to determine the empirical support to these different points and to establish, concretely, how protective factors are being used in correctional programs that aim to reduce the risk of sexual recidivism. Method: In order to answer these questions, a systematic review of the literature was conducted. The keywords used were ""protective factor"" and ""offender"". A total of 15 articles were selected according to the different inclusion and exclusion criteria. Of these, four were empirical studies regarding protective factors, while the other 11 articles were theoretical in nature.  Results: This systematic review of the literature helped us conclude that there is very few empirical support regarding protective factors, since the majority of these articles were theoretical. The listed empirical studies had mostly been conducted on small sample or specific populations, making it difficult to establish clear conclusions and thus, to concretely determine the real nature of protective factors. Also, this study allowed us to establish that the identification of a protective factor brings nothing more than the absence of a risk factor. It is therefore appropriate to question the usefulness of the so-called ""protective"" factors.  Keywords: Protective factors, sex offenders."	Protective factors , Sex offenders	en	12169.0

We highlight the conditions of its emergence, and stability after independence. This system certainly has the advantage of relying on a monetary rule limiting drifts economic policy. It establishes a dynamic development based not on the discretion, but the rules of convertibility and coverage of foreign exchange reserves. The anchoring of expectations does not have to be confronted with the ethics of policy maker and respect for good governance criteria. However, the risk of a stall with the reference currency -i.e. the US dollar- exist given excessive external debt and structural budget deficit and the current account. Add to that the weak governance in the management of public affairs. Simulations of the sustainability of external debt indicate that risks are important.	philosophy , ethics , economics , governance , liquidity , credibility , money supply , philosophy , ethics , economics , Currency Board , liquidité , crédibilité	en	12156.0

It produces effects that can lead, however, social actors to potential subversion of social relations.

But reflections on business ethics are echoing links with conflictuality known by many studies as remaining while turning? Do the handbooks treat the question of the relationship of ethics to economic and social change, and how? Do they make links, or not, with the issues of justice and those of social conflicts within organizations? What conceptions of the subject, its liability and / or freedom, do these books show, or not, as such?

901	The interest rates and performance of MFIs in the MENA region: is there a moral issue?	The high interest rates of microfinance institutions (MFIs) seem to oppose their social mission, and raise a moral issue. We analyse the determinants of the level of interest rates with regard to the financial performance of an unbalanced panel of 66 MFIs in nine countries of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region over the period 2004-2012. We differentiate internal factors (cost of capital, operating expenses and loss provisions) from the external ones (regulation, competition and inflation).The outcomes of a typology from a multivariate analysis upon the relationship between the interest rate and social performance of 53 MFIs in 2008 do not match the classification of MFIs according to Yunus and Weber, which proves irrelevant.	philosophy , ethics , economics , costs , interest rates , MENA , microfinance institutions , multivariate analysis , performance. , philosophy , ethics , economics , coûts , MENA , performance	en	12140.0
902	Comparaison des potentiels évoqués cognitifs de patients présentant des tics chroniques simples ou complexes	Tic disorders affect up to 1% of individuals worldwide and are associated with social stigma. A major obstacle to these disorders’ evaluation and treatment is the large heterogeneity of phenotypes, which could explain the important number of conflicting neurobiological data. Certain variables, like tic complexity and tasks’ cognitive demand, could explain these heterogeneous results. We propose that a better understanding of cognitive impairments often seen in tic disorders could be obtained by studying the chronometry of electrocortical activity underlying inhibition, attention, memory and motor processes. Our aim was to evaluate the impact of tic complexity as well as task response demand on tic patients’ electrocortical profiles. Thus, we compared 12 patients exhibiting simple tics to 12 patients showing complex tics, and matched them to 15 healthy control participants. All participants performed two Oddball tasks in which one required a motor response (button press) and the other a non-motor response (counting). During both tasks, electrophysiological components were recorded, serving as indices of processes underlying attention (P200), inhibition (N200) and memory (P300). Our results revealed that for the non-motor task, both groups of tics patients had an enhanced N200, while only those with simple tics showed a reduced P300. For the motor task, both groups of tics patients exhibited a decreased P300. According to our results, both tic complexity and motor demand can affect neural mechanisms of the processing stream. Conflicting results found in previous studies might have been confounded by tic complexity as well as task motor requirements.	tic , P200 , N200 , P300 , oddball , complexity , event-related potentials , impulsivity	en	12116.0
903	"Dynamic magnetic resonance spectroscopy of phosphate energetics during muscle
exercise and recovery"	Entailing of phosphorus exchanges in most bio-chemicals as a key factor in disease, increases researcher’s interest to develop the technologies capable of detecting this metabolite. Phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy is able to detect key metabolites in a non-invasive manner. Particularly, it offers the ability to measure the dynamic rate of phosphocreatine(PCr) degeneration through the exercise and recovery. This metric as a valid indication of mitochondrial oxidative metabolism in muscle, differentiate between normal and pathological state. To do magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy, clinical research tools provide a wide variety of anatomical and functional contrasts, however they are typically restricted to the tissues containing water or hydrogen atoms and they are still blind to the biochemicals of other atoms of interests. Through this project we intended to obtain the phosphorus spectrum in human body – specificadenerativelly in muscle – using 31P spectroscopy. To do so a double loop RF surface coil, tuned to phosphorus frequency, is designed and fabricated using bench work facilities and then validated through in vitro spectroscopy using 3 Tesla Siemens scanner. We acquired in vitro as well as in vivo phosphorus spectrum in a 100 mM potassium phosphate phantom and human calf muscle in rest-exercise-recovery phase in a 3T MR scanner. The spectrum demonstrates the main constituent in high-energy phosphate metabolism. We also observed the dynamic variation of PCr for five young healthy subjects who performed planter flexions using resistance band during exercise and recovery. The took steps in this project pave the way for future application of spectroscopic quantification of phosphate metabolism in patients affected by carotid artery disease as well as in age-matched control subjects.

904	Validité et fiabilité d’un questionnaire de fréquence alimentaire visant à évaluer l’adhésion à la diète méditerranéenne	Validated dietary assessment methods are needed to conduct clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of the Mediterranean diet in primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Aim: To assess the reproducibility and the validity of a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) to be used in clinical trials on the Mediterranean diet within the population of Quebec. Methods: Fifty-three participants were recruited. The FFQ was administered twice to assess reproducibility and was compared to a 12-day dietary record (DR) to assess validity. Results: For reproducibility, intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for energy and nutrients ranged from 0.38 to 0.91. For validity, Pearson’s correlation coefficients (r) between the DR and the FFQ pre-DR ranged from 0.26 to 0.84 and ICCs ranged from 0.25 to 0.84. As for the DR and the FFQ post-DR, r ranged from 0.36 to 0.83 and ICCs ranged from 0.36 to 0.83. Conclusion: The FFQ demonstrates good reproducibility and validity for energy and most key nutrients of the Mediterranean diet.

905	A longitudinal study of overweight during childhood :  etiology, mental health outcomes and mediating factors	Child overweight and obesity has challenged the field of public health for several decades. While its direct underpinnings may be physiological, its development and outcome are intertwined with an array of psychosocial factors. This dissertation has sought to answer questions relating to the perinatal and early life risk factors associated with overweight development, as well as its potential psychological correlates during middle childhood and early adolescence.   Specifically, this project had three research goals:  1) To model the developmental pattern of BMI or weight status throughout childhood and estimate population heterogeneity.  2) To identify the perinatal and early childhood risk factors that may increase the likelihood that a child follows a path leading to overweight by adolescence. 3) To examine whether being overweight in middle childhood is associated with internalizing mental health symptoms in early adolescence, and whether such an association is mediated by the experience of peer victimization and body dissatisfaction.  This work takes a developmental life-course perspective in that it considers both the accumulation of risk factors over time as well as risk factors occurring during critical periods of development.1,2 We examined data drawn from the Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child Development (QLSCD), a population-based birth-cohort study in the province of Quebec, Canada. The initial sample consisted of 2120 families with a 5-month old baby born in Quebec in 1997. These families were monitored yearly or biennially until children were 13 years of age.  For our first research goal, we modeled group-based developmental trajectories of child BMI and child weight status (overweight vs. not overweight). For our second goal, multinomial logistic regression analyses were conducted in order to identify the perinatal and early risk factors associated with the different developmental groups of weight status. Putative risk factors were chosen from the literature and represent the perinatal environment, child behavioral characteristics, as well as the family home environment. These were analyzed longitudinally when possible, and factors that could be targeted for intervention, such as maternal smoking during pregnancy, child sleep times or television viewing were selected for analysis.    In order to complete our third research goal, we examined the longitudinal associations (from age 6 to 12) between BMI z-score (CDC 2000 reference) and internalizing and externalizing problems by way of cross-lag panel models in the Mplus program.  Our results indicating sparse cross-lagged links, we then examined whether peer victimization and body dissatisfaction during childhood mediate the association between early overweight development and self-reported internalizing symptoms in early adolescence.   Important scientific contributions stemming from this project include the identification of distinct weight status trajectories during childhood (i.e. early onset, late onset, never overweight) and the identification of perinatal and early life risk factors and mental health outcomes that may differ depending on a child’s developmental trajectory. Additionally, we identified two important mechanisms of the association between overweight and internalizing problems: peer victimization and low body satisfaction.

906	Implication des utilisateurs dans le développement des innovations médicales : une analyse sociotechnique de la collaboration et de ses enjeux pour l’organisation des soins	Technological changes have major effects on health care organization. Health professionals and patients – the main users of medical innovations – are key actors in the ongoing development and refinement of new medical technologies. To develop more efficient, safe and user-friendly medical technologies, many propose enhancing collaboration between technology users and developers. This research investigates the premise of involving users in the medical innovation process. The main objective of this research is to better understand the collaboration between users and developers involved in the transformation of medical innovations. Adopting a sociotechnical approach, this thesis by article has three objectives: 1) Describe how the literature defines the objectives, methods and issues of engaging users in the development of medical innovations; 2) Analyze the perspectives of users and developers of medical technologies with regards to their collaboration in the innovation process; and 3) Analyze how users are mobilized in practice in the development of medical innovation. The first objective is addressed by a narrative synthesis of the scientific literature (n=101) on user involvement in the medical innovation process. This synthesis has identified the methods used or proposed, normative arguments conveyed, and the main issues raised by involving users. Analysis of data from three deliberative focus groups and a plenary involving users and developers (n=19) of medical technology were employed to address the second objective. The analysis details their perspectives on various modes of collaboration in the innovation process. The third objective involves a case study of an innovation in electrophysiology at the clinical research phase. This case study is based on a qualitative analysis of clinical studies (n=57), editorials and reviews in medical journals (n=15) covering a ten year period (1999-2008) and semi-structured interviews with key actors involved in the innovation process (n=3). This study provides insight into how users make sense of, appropriate and legitimize medical innovation in the context of clinical research. The overall contribution of this thesis is a better understanding of user involvement in the medical innovation process and how to more effectively align technological development with the objectives of the health system.	medical technology , user involvement , innovation process , sociotechnical analysis , healthcare organization	en	12102.0
907	Rôle des gènes HOX du paralogue 4 dans l'autorenouvellement des cellules souches et progéniteurs hématopoïétiques	Transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) is a treatment commonly used to treat several types of hematological diseases such as leukemia. However, a major limitation of this type of treatment is the limited number of HSC available for transplantation. It is therefore important to develop ways to expand these cells ex vivo. The HOXB4 gene is a promising candidate for achieving this goal. It has indeed been shown that HOXB4 is able to expand HSC in vivo and in vitro without inducing leukemia. HOXC4, which belongs to the same paralog group, is also able to expand primitive hematopoietic cell suggesting a common role for paralog 4 HOX genes in the self-renewal of HSC. HOXA4 is ten times more expressed in fetal liver HSC during their primary expansion. Furthermore, Hoxa4 mutant HSC, unlike Hoxb4 mutant HSC, are unable to reconstitute an irradiated recipient when transplanted in competition. Therefore, HOXA4 could play a more important role than other paralog 4 genes for HSC expansion at the physiological level and we hypothesized that HOXA4 can expand HSC more efficiently than HOXB4.  The results obtained during this research project showed that the overexpression of HOXA4 expand HSC and primitive hematopoietic progenitors in the same order as HOXB4. Direct competitive culture and transplantation assays confirmed the equal capacity of HSC overexpressing HOXA4 and HOXB4 to proliferate and engraft at long-term. However, we observed a better short-term peripheral reconstitution by HOXA4+ HSC compared to HOXB4+ HSC, which was associated with a better lymphoid reconstitution. We also compared the expression levels of potential target genes in HSC overexpressing HOXA4 or HOXB4 and observed that many genes important for HSC function were upregulated following their overexpression, including several genes involved in the Notch and Wnt signaling pathway. These included both receptors as well as ligands, indicating that HOX4 genes might regulate the communication of primitive HSCs with their environment through these major signaling pathways and promote self-renewal. In addition, modulation of genes coding for transcription factors and molecules known for their function in pluripotency suggest that HOXA4 and HOXB4 have both intrinsic and extrinsic potential to control self renewal potential.   This knowledge can then be further explored and used to optimize ex vivo HSC expansion protocols for clinical purposes.	HOXA4 , HOXB4 , Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) , HSC transplantation	en	12080.0
908	Study of nuclear receptor dynamics by BRET	Nuclear receptors (NRs) are ligand-dependent transcription factors that control a wide variety of biological processes in human physiology, which has made them preferred pharmacological targets for many diseases. One such receptor, the estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), can activate cell proliferation in some sections of the mammary epithelium while another, the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARα), can cause growth arrest and cellular differentiation. Signalling by these receptors can be altered in breast cancer, contributing to tumorigenesis. ERα can be blocked by antiestrogens (AEs) in the clinical setting to inhibit tumor cell proliferation. However, attempts to activate the RARα pathway with retinoids have not proven beneficial in clinical trials. This may result from the lack of specificity of the tested ligands for RARa and/or from their activity only in a subset of breast tumors.  Since nuclear receptors form homo- and heterodimers, we sought to develop novel pharmacological assays to study the activity of specific receptor-dimer complexes, their dynamics and quaternary structure. We report here a new FRET technique dubbed BRET with fluorescence enhanced by combined transfers (BRETFect) that can detect the formation of ternary nuclear receptor complexes. BRETFect can monitor the activation of ERα-ERβ heterodimers and highlights an allosteric mechanism of activation that each receptor exerts on its dimer partner. Use of BRETFect in combination with PCA-BRET has allowed us to observe the formation of functional ERα multimers in live cells for the first time. The formation of multimers is favored by AEs which induce receptor degradation, and may underlie their specific properties. These assays are a net improvement over the classical luciferase-reporter experiment as they deliver real-time receptor specific information with no interference by other process such as transcription and translation. Using these BRET assays we developed a new class of NR hybrid ligands that can modulate ER or RAR activity and inhibit HDACs. This has allowed for the development of promising new bifunctional molecules such as the RAR-agonist/HDACi hybrid molecule TTNN-HA. In conclusion, the work presented here brings new insight in NR dynamics and quaternary structure and offers novel tools to study their mechanism of action or design new modulators of NR activity such as hybrid AE-HDACis and Retinoid-HDACis.

909	Activité physique et insatisfaction de l'image corporelle chez un groupe d'adolescentes	Body image dissatisfaction (BID) is common among adolescent girls and is associated with the development of various psychological disorders. Physical activity (PA) is correlated with several psychological benefits and appears to be a promising variable that could change the BID. However, research findings show contradictory links between PA practice and BID during adolescence. The main objective of this study is to measure the relationship between PA and BID in teenage girls, aged between 12 and 19 (n=173), from Montreal. The secondary objective is to test the potential moderating effect of the reasons which underlie the practice of the PA on this relationship. Variables such as age, ethnicity and body mass index were controlled. The results suggest an absence of association between the duration of physical activity and the level of BID obtained by two instruments (Body Shape Questionnaire and body dissatisfaction scale of Eating Disorder Inventory-2; EDI-2). The relationship between duration of physical activity and the BID score on the EDI-2 is, however, moderated by one of the reasons underlying the practice of physical activity. For teenagers who engage in PA to lose weight, a higher level of PA is linked to a higher level of BID. We found no relationship between teenagers who do not engage in PA for this reason. This study highlights the importance of considering the reasons underlying the practice of PA when the link between the duration of physical activity and the BID is examined.	adolescence , clinical psychology , body image dissatisfaction , physical activity	en	12078.0
910	TDP-43 régule la dynamique et la fonction des Granules de Stress via G3BP1	Stress Granule (SGs) are cytoplasmic inclusions sequestering proteins and mRNAs following a stress exposure. Their assembly is part of the cell stress response and is considered an important step for stress resistance and cell survival. SG are currently linked to different pathogenesis from viral infection to neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).ALS is an aggressive disease, characterized by neuronal death leading to paralysis and death within five years. Pathogenesis mechanisms are still not fully understood. TDP-43 (TAR DNA binding protein 43) and FUS (Fused in liposarcoma) are two proteins linked to the disease that share many structural features and functions suggesting a common toxicity mechanism. TDP-43 and FUS are both recruited to SGs in stress conditions. We demonstrate for the first time that SGs function to protect mRNA from degradation induced after stress exposure, a function that was only suspected until now. We also prove that G3BP1 (Ras GTPase-activating protein-binding protein 1) is the effector of this function via it’s implication in the dynamics of SG formation. As TDP-43 is a regulator of G3BP1, we prove that loss of TDP-43/G3BP1 function leads to a stress response defect yielding increased cellular vulnerability. Furthermore, we have discovered that the mechanism of toxicity for FUS is different from TDP-43, and does not implicate a loss of function mechanism during the cell stress response.

911	Vieillissement actif : le maintien à domicile des baby-boomers	This study is about the stakes of how the baby boomer generation, in particular those born between 1945 and 1954 who are currently retiring, will deal with their living spaces. I shall take into account the multiple visions of Benoit Goetz (2011), Heidegger (1958), Bachelard (1957), Benjamin (1955), Büber (1962) and Deleuze (1980) who analyze what it means to live in a given living space. Indeed not only must porosity factors and increasing relations between beings be analyzed but also the characteristics of these baby boomers themselves with regards to who they are as Jean Francois Sirinelli (2003) and Josée Garceau (2012) have done. This new generation of baby boomers hopes to remain active and in order to do so seeks to adapt and influence their living spaces as well as their conceptualizations of what it means to “live”.  This current study has asked baby boomers what their visions are for their future residential choices in order to grasp on what values and for what goals their project is based on,. This was done by having five baby boomer between the age of 60-65 to watch the movie Et si on vivait tous ensemble. Afterwards, semi-directed interviews, based on their memory of the movie, what adaptions they foresee in addition to how they see their future, were conducted in two different phases with approved verbatim. The findings were then compared and confirmed with different theoretical frameworks such as porosity and opening of a physical and virtual window. At the same time, retirement homes and the financial considerations behind an aging population were taken into account.  This generation, immersed in technology wants to have access to such modern technology without losing the feeling of controlling their lives and story. Born in an innovation and changing time, they have already proven capable of changing and reinventing each stage of their life. This, therefore, leaves us to believe that they will do the same with their vision of retirement and living spaces.  Hence, tomorrow’s design models will have to renew itself for its new users.	autonomy , baby boomer , living space , economy , porosity	en	12062.0
912	Asymmetric cell division intersects with cell geometry : a method to extrapolate and quantify geometrical parameters of sensory organ precursors	Asymmetric cell division (ACD) consists in a cellular division during which specific cell fate determinants are distributed preferentially in one daughter cell, which then differentiate from its sibling. Hence, ACD is important to generate cell diversity and is used to regulate stem cells homeostasis. For proper asymmetric distribution of cell fate determinants, the positioning of the mitotic spindle has to be tightly controlled. Frequently, this induces a cell size asymmetry, since the spindle is then not centered during mitosis, leading to an asymmetric positioning of the cleavage furrow.   Although small small GTPases have been shown to act directly on the spindle, the exact mechanism controlling spindle positioning during ACD is not understood. Recent studies suggest that an independent, yet uncharacterized pathway is involved in spindle positioning, which is likely to involve an asymmetric regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Indeed, actin enables spindle anchoring to the cortex. Hence we hypothesize that asymmetric actin contractions during cytokinesis might displace the mitotic spindle and the cleavage furrow, leading to cell size asymmetry. Interestingly, from our preliminary results we observed that cortical blebbing, which is a read-out of cortical tension/contraction, preferentially occurs on the anterior side of the dividing sensory organ precursor (SOP) cells at telophase.  Our preliminary data support the idea that Rho small GTPases might be implicated in regulation of the mitotic spindle hence controlling asymmetric cell division of SOP cells. The experimental settings developed for this thesis, for studying regulation of the mitotic spindle orientation and positioning will serve as proof of concept of how geneticist and biochemist experts could design ways to control such process by different means in cancerous cells.  The preliminary results from this project open novel insights on how the Rho small GTPases might be implicated in controlling asymmetric cell division hence their dynamics in vivo of such process during SOP development. Furthermore, the assays and the theoretical model developed in this study can be used as background that could serve to design improved quantitative experimental methods for cell biology synchronizing sub-networks of ACD mechanism.

913	Studies on lipid production of microalgae under mixotrophic growth, utilizing glycerol as a carbon source, combined with nitrogen starvation	Rampant increases in oil prices and detrimental effects of fossil fuels on the environment have been the main impetus for the development of environmentally friendly and sustainable energy sources. Amongst the many possibilities, microalgae have been proposed as a new alternative energy source to fossil fuels, as their growth is both sustainable and ecologically safe. By definition, microalgae are unicellular photosynthetic microorganisms containing chlorophyll a. These organisms are capable of producing large quantities of oils, surpassing that of traditional oil-seed crops, which can be transformed, through chemical processes, into biofuels such as biodiesel or bio-gasoline. Thus, recent research has gone into discovering high lipid producing algal strains, optimising growth media for increased lipid production and developing metabolic engineering to make microalgae a source of biofuel that is competitive to more traditional sources of biofuel and even to fossil fuel.  In this context, the research reported here focused on using a mixotrophic growth mode as a way to increase lipid production for certain strains of microalgae. In addition, nitrogen starvation combined with mixotrophy was studied to analyse its effects on lipid production. Mixotrophy is the parallel usage of two trophic modes, in our case photoautotrophy and heterotrophy. Consequently, 12 algal strains were screened for mixotrophic growth, using glycerol as a carbon source. Glycerol is a waste product of the current biodiesel industry; it is a cheap and abundant carbon source present in many metabolic pathways. From this initial screening, several strains were chosen for subsequent experiments involving nitrogen starvation. Nitrogen starvation has been shown to induce lipid accumulation. The results obtained show that a mixotrophic growth mode, using glycerol as a carbon source, enhances lipid production for certain strains. Moreover, lipid enhancement was shown for nitrogen starvation combined with mixotrophic growth mode. This was dependant on time spent under nitrogen starvation and on initial concentrations of the nitrogen source.	Biodiesel , Glycerol , Microalgae , Mixotrophy , Nitrogen Starvation	en	12055.0
914	Contribution du mécanisme d'inhibition présynaptique à l'induction de réactions posturales efficaces suite à une perturbation d'équilibre	Falls are a significant problem among the elderly or persons with a neurological impairment, and reflect a deficit in the nervous mechanisms underlying postural control. Previous research shows that the integration of sensory feedback is a crucial component of postural control and that presynaptic inhibition (PSI) plays an important role in controlling the sensory processing of information. The aim of this study was to identify the contribution of PSI to the induction of effective postural responses following an unexpected balance perturbation. We hypothesized that a decrease in PSI would contribute to the induction of these responses by increasing the influence of sensory feedback onto spinal networks during the perturbation. First we assessed the level of spinal excitability during perturbations, using the soleus H-reflex. Results show that spinal excitability is modulated according to the direction of the perturbation (forward and backward tilts) and that this modulation occurs 75 and 100 ms after tilt-onset in all subjects (p<0.05). To further estimate changes in PSI, spatial facilitation techniques were used. PSI was shown to decrease in both perturbation directions shortly after tilt onset at 75 and 100 ms (p<0.05), suggesting an increase in sensory transmission in the spinal cord. These observations suggest that sensory feedback is critical for the induction of effective postural responses and that impaired sensory transmission or integration, due to CNS lesions or ageing, may lead to certain balance deficits. Identifying patients with such impairments may improve fall risk-assessment and prevention.	Presynaptic inhibition , H-reflex , postural responses , risk of falls , balance	en	12053.0
915	La preuve ontologique de l'existence de Dieu chez Descartes	"This master thesis project will focus on Descartes and the ""ontological"" proof of the existence of God. The presentation will be made of this proof, its ins and outs. It will take into account: first, the role and status of the latter in the order of metaphysical reasons; second, the relationship between the ""ontological"" proof and the ""through the effects"" proof; and third, the various writings of Descartes in which it is question of the ontological argument. Thus, this analysis will note the differences there might be in Descartes thought regarding the substance or form of this argument. We will discuss on the different position this proof occupied in two writings: the Meditations (1641) and the Principles of Philosophy (1644). This type of analysis will allow us to focus on the debate initiated by Martial Guéroult and Henri Gouhier concerning the place of the ""ontological"" proof of the existence of God in the order of metaphysical reasons as well as its relations with the ""through the effects"" proof. The posterity of this debate will also be considered. Also, we will be able to ask the question whether there is an evolution of the ""ontological"" proof of the existence of God in the thought of Descartes over his writings. In summary, in this thesis, we address two issues: the question of autonomy or non-autonomy of the ""ontological"" proof in relation with the ""through the effects"" proof; and the question about the possibility of an evolution of the place and nature of the ""ontological"" proof of the existence of God in the writings of Descartes."

916	L'astronomie nouvelle de Kepler et la logique de la découverte	This thesis offers a study of the theoretical and empirical reasons involved in the elaboration of a new astronomy by Johannes Kepler (1571-1630) as displayed in his work Astronomia nova (1619).  The thesis consists of two parts: the first part deals with Kepler’s actual writings, whereas the second part uses the notion of abduction in order to interpret with logic that process of discovery and justification. The first part begins with an analysis of Kepler’s project and its philosophical, metaphysical and theological foundations as displayed in his first work piece, Mysterium cosmographicum. Then follows a review of Kepler’s own words regarding the nature and status of astronomical hypotheses as proposed through a study of his treatise entitled Apologia pro Tychone contra Ursum. A careful study of philosophical, mathematical and scientific sources that have influenced Kepler for his new astronomy is then proposed prior to a detailed analysis of the scientific arguments and different demonstrative steps that are presented in Astronomia nova.  The second part aims at enlightening the debate on abduction first by looking at three traditional approaches (Plato, Aristote and Epicurus) relative to the scientific knowledge of celestial phenomena that bring about a plausible discourse or a series of explanations that fit with the phenomena. Finally, four modern abductive interpretations of the discovery process followed by Kepler in Astronomia nova are presented, reformulated and reviewed in order to propose a new abductive interpretation that leave a greater place to the actual project of building a new astronomy based on causes. This provides tools to better understand the meaning and significance of what can be understood as the “Keplerian revolution”, namely the transition from a geocentric system to a system not simply heliocentric but heliodynamic, which freed astronomers from the paradigm of circular orbits.

917	Projets et utopies au Québec : Les années 1960 et 1970 : entre sculpture et architecture	Since the first release of Thomas More’s Utopia in the XVth century, the notion of utopia has been appropriated by different means of artistic expression. Quickly, architecture and urban planning used it as an historical purview, when merging in drawings and maps, representations of idealized societies. Modernity and new technologies changed intrinsically utopia’s modalities; therefore artistic projections progressed towards built models. The XXth century has also shown plenty of innovative forms and ideas, whose transmission was accelerated by new media. Although the 1960s and the 1970s gave rise to experimental forms and utopian projects — especially powered by the Révolution tranquille and Mai 68 — it is still challenging to find traces of these art and architecture projects in Québec, due to lack of documentation on the subject. In studying artistic works and practices of Yvette Bisson, Robert Roussil and Melvin Charney, this master thesis intends to observe means and tactics used within their sculptures to seize space and its political dimension. Through Michel de Certeau, Henri Lefebvre and Louis Marin, we will attempt to clarify in which ways the three sculptors’ imagination is fully deployed, hence creating new utopian spaces in sculpture.	sculpture , architecture , Yvette Bisson , Robert Roussil , Melvin Charney , Révolution tranquille , utopia , space appropriation tactics	en	12021.0
918	Influence of plant species and richness on pollutant removal in treatment wetlands	Treatment wetlands (TWs) are complex engineered ecosystems designed to remove pollutants from wastewater. In selecting plant species for TWs, the use of polycultures as well as the choice of local non-invasive species is increasingly recommended. However, to date, the majority of TWs have been planted in monoculture using invasive species, probably because the performance of native species and the possible advantages associated with plant diversity have not been clearly demonstrated. The research questions of my thesis are:  Are polycultures as good as or better than monocultures for pollutant removal, and could a native species be as efficient as an exotic invasive species in TWs?  Three experiments were performed to answer this question. The influence of plant richness on pollutant removal was tested in two mesocosm experiments: 1) comparing two emergent plant species in monoculture and planted in sequence, and 2) evaluating four free-floating species, each in monoculture versus pairs of species (all possible combinations) and the four species planted together. A third experiment was carried out to compare the removal efficiency of the invasive European haplotype of common reed (Phragmites australis) and the native non-invasive subspecies (P. australis subsp. americanus).   Plant species composition influenced the performance of TWs. The comparison of the performance of monocultures versus polycultures showed that, overall, TWs planted with a combination of species were as efficient as monocultures of the best performing species. Comparing the performance of native and invasive P. australis strongly suggests that the native could replace the invasive species in TWs, thereby avoiding possible environmental risks without compromising treatment efficiency.  The promising results of the native P. australis subspecies need to be further tested in full-scale experiments in order to encourage the use of this species in TWs. The results obtained comparing plant species combinations suggest that under circumstances in which the performance of available macrophytes is unknown or cannot be determined, using a mixture of species offers the best chances of achieving the highest possible level of pollutant removal. Furthermore, it has been suggested that plant diversity contributes to TWs in terms of their resilience to stress and disease.

919	Conception et développement d'un environnement informatisé d'expérimentations contrôlées et assistées à distance par ordinateur (Ex@O)	In the school environment, the scientific (or experimental) approach requires experimental «savoir-faire» which is usually acquired in presential, that is to say in an institutional laboratory where the teacher or technician are present and may, at any time, fully assist the learner in his inquiry-based scientific and technological approach. The teacher or technician can direct, guide and stimulate the learner’s thinking, to do live demonstrations and control experiment by showing the learner how to configures the computer assisted experimentation (expérimentation assistée par ordinateur or ExAO) tools.  To meet the needs of distance learning, the R&D in science and technology education, provides learners and teachers with a computer laboratory environment, controlled and attended to from a distance. In order to distinguish between the remote computer lab environment and the ExAO microlaboratory, we named our environment Ex@O. It was first tested in order to werify its functionality and it was then evaluated in classroom situations by student teachers and students of adult education who practiced and experienced the scientific approach. This was done with a computer laboratory environment, but from a distance.  To achieve this, we combine the MicrolabExAO software with a grip remote, and audio and video tools (Teamviewer). In addition, we have create and included in the MicrolabExAO software, online help in order to facilitate the download and the grip remote laboratory. Because of Ex@O, the learner benefits from increased contacts with concrete experiments. In doing so, the Ex@O prototype meets the objectives of the « Programme de formation de l’école québécoise » (PFEQ), which is to increase the learner’s active participation in his learnings. With the first version of Ex@O prototype, where the learner can perform activities in remote laboratory, we were able to verify that it also focuses not only on knowledge, but also the experimental science and technology « savoir-faire », traditionally developed in institutional laboratories. Note here that the experimental approach is acquired almost exclusively in the laboratory practicing, often and on a regular basis, both inductive and deductive processes which are specific to this approach. The practice of the experimental approach from a distance with the Ex@O technology, has enabled us to verify that it was possible, even comparable to a real, step-by-step, experimental protocol traditionally conducted in an institutional laboratory.	assistance , Ex@O , actography , distance education , model of action , remote control , Scientific investigation , Ex@O , assistance	en	11917.0
920	Étude des conceptions alternatives et des processus de raisonnement des étudiants de chimie du niveau collégial sur la molécule, la polarité et les phénomènes macroscopiques	The difficulties found in learning Chemistry are mostly ascribed to the fact that it comprises many complex and counter-intuitive concepts. But beyond these epistemological challenges, learning chemistry can be in jeopardy when it relies on learners’ unstable foundations mixed with alternative conceptions. Alternative conceptions are tacit internal representations that students hold in disagreement with scientifically accepted theories. The presence of alternative conceptions in students’ minds might harm their conceptual understanding leading them to wrongly explain the behaviour of matter and to make incorrect predictions in chemistry. Alternative conceptions are recognised as widespread and difficult to identify in a traditional educational setting. Many alternative conceptions in chemistry have been identified by different groups of researchers in international settings, but such an operation has never been carried out with Quebec college students. As Quebec’s post-secondary education system represents a unique context, a study of the particular difficulties of students in this system was necessary to draw an accurate picture of the situation. Furthermore, researchers presently suggest not only to list such alternative conceptions, but also to explore by what processes they lead to wrong predictions or explanations. Researchers indeed argue that mere lists of alternative conceptions cannot be easily used by teachers, who should be the target audience for these results if they are to take into account alternative conceptions in their teaching. However, no satisfactory typology of reasoning processes and alternative conceptions in chemistry exists today in the research literature. Several researchers in chemistry education suggest that such a typology is needed and should render explicit the reasoning processes involving these alternative conceptions. Explicitation of the reasoning used by the students while performing a task in chemistry would be the way to identify the alternative conception on which this reasoning is based.  Reasoning is viewed as the process that proceeds from implicit ideas to explicit answers. Not all wrong answers in chemistry come from alternative conceptions: some come from a lack of knowledge, other from logical errors. Since all types of wrong answers from students are problematic during teaching, it is relevant to consider them all. Thus, these concerns have inspired the following research question:  What alternative conceptions and modes of reasoning lead students to make poor predictions in chemistry or to give wrong explanations of the behavior of matter?  This doctoral research was conducted to provide an answer to this question. In total, 2,413 students enrolled in Science programmes in Québec’s college (postsecondary pre-university) system were involved in this research, which was divided into three phases: preliminary phase, pilot phase and main phase. Clinical interviews were conducted in the preliminary phase to explore chemistry students’ alternative conceptions. During the pilot phase, multiple-choice questions with open-ended justification were used to delimit the chemistry topics to be studied and to highlight ways of reasoning that students use. The main phase, for its part, used the two-tier “Molecules, Polarity and Phenomena” questionnaire (MPP) developed specifically for this research. The questionnaire was distributed to students via an adaptation of the Consol Web platform, developed by the research group of the principal investigator of this doctoral study. The results show that Science students hold several alternative designs, some of which are quite widespread among the population. In particular, a high proportion of students believe that evaporation causes the breaking of covalent bonds of the molecules (61.1 %), that all atom groups are molecules (78.9 %) and that atoms have similar macroscopic properties as the element (66.0 %). On the other hand, not all bad answers in the MPP show alternative conceptions. Some of them are rather explained by a deficiency in prior knowledge (for example, when students show a lack of knowledge of common chemical elements, 21.8 %) or an incomplete logical reasoning (when they believe the mere possession of polar bonds necessarily makes a molecule polar, which is observed in 24.1% of them). Alternative conceptions and reasoning that lead to incorrect answers are found among first-year and second-year students in the Science program, in some cases with decreasing frequency between the two years, and in others, at the same frequency in both subpopulations. These results mitigate the statement generally found in the research literature, that alternative conceptions are resistant to traditional teaching: according to the results of this research, some of them seem to actually be resolved through such a teaching context. The fact remains, however, that several alternative conceptions, deficiencies in basic prior knowledge and reasoning errors have been highlighted by this research. These learning problems lead college students to make incorrect predictions about the behaviour of matter, or to explain this behaviour incorrectly. In view of these results, a reflection on the teaching of chemistry at the college level, placing a greater emphasis on conceptual thinking and the use of reasoning for the prediction and explanation of the studied phenomena, should be considered.

921	Preuves empiriques des liens entre des indicateurs de performance processuels et les résultats sensibles aux soins infirmiers	Problematic : For several years, nursing performance has been the subject of particular attention around the research fields and for nursing administrators. Performance indicators sensitive to nursing, that compose the analysis systems of nursing performance, have not been the subject of a deep analysis, especially concerning the empirical bases. The objective of this work is to find and analyze the empirical evidence that illustrate cause and effect links be-tween structural elements, process and the results of four process of care indicators: evaluation and care planning, symptoms management, discharge planning and health promotion.    Method : The literature review was conducted with different databases such as CI-NAHL©, EMBASE©, PUBMED©, WEB OF SCIENCES©, COCHRANE database of Sys-tematic Review© and GOOGLE SCHOLAR©. The articles selection has been done accord-ing to the empirical evidence ranking method from the University of Duke (2014).    Results: Following the literature review, 42 synthesis studies relating empirical links between nursing interventions and care process indicators were identified    Conclusion : Empirical links were established between indicators of symptoms control, discharge planning, illness prevention, health promotion and clinical pathways. Some nursing interventions were also linked with these indicators. Recommendations for the use of these indicators were then suggested.

922	Rôle de la plasticité synaptique des interneurones somatostatinergiques dans l’apprentissage et la mémoire dépendants de l’hippocampe	Hippocampus-dependent learning and memory are mediated by activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. The role that different subtypes of interneurons play in hippocampal learning and memory remains largely unknown, but likely relies on cell type-specific plasticity mechanisms at interneuron synapses. Excitatory synapses onto CA1 oriens-alveus interneurons show persistent long-term potentiation induced by chemical stimulation of metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR1) [mGluR1-mediated chemical late long-term potentiation (cL-LTPmGluR1)]. The objectives of this project were to identify the oriens-alveus interneuron subtypes expressing cL-LTPmGluR1 and examine its induction and expression mechanisms. We determined that repeated mGluR1 stimulation induces cL-LTPmGluR1 at excitatory synapses onto the somatostatin-expressing interneuron subtype (SOM-INs). Electrophysiological recordings coupled to pharmacological inhibitors and a functional knock-out of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) showed that SOM-INs cL-LTPmGluR1 induction (which consisted of three applications of the mGluR1/5 agonist (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG) in the presence of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) antagonist 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)-pyridine (MPEP)) requires mGluR1, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) and mTORC1 signaling pathways. Collectively, our results show that persistent synaptic plasticity mediated by mTORC1 is induced by repeated mGluR1 stimulation in somatostatin-expressing hippocampal interneurons. Knowledge of cL-LTPmGluR1’s underlying mechanisms, coupled to in vivo models, will now make it possible to interfere with SOM-INs cL-LTPmGluR1 and examine its role in hippocampal-dependent learning and memory.

923	Facteurs génétiques de prédisposition à la maladie coeliaque et l'oesophagite éosinophilique	Chronic immune diseases including autoimmune and inflammatory diseases affect 20 to 25% of Western country population. The  higher concordance of disease in twins or in first-degree relative of patients with celiac disease (bowel autoimmune disease) or eosinophilic esophagitis (inflammatory disease of the esophagus) indicate that genetic and environmental factors are involved in susceptibility to these diseases. However, these studies do not distinguish clearly genetic predisposition according to clinical heterogeneity (children versus adults) or ethnicity (population stratification). Methods: HLA haplotypes predisposing to celiac disease and polymorphisms of candidate genes IL-13 (R130Q), IL-5 (-746 T / G) and IL-5R (-80A / G) involved in physiopathology of eosinophilic esophagitis, have been evaluated by PCR-SSP on genomic DNA. Results: Our familial and case-control studies performed in populations having a very similar genetic background with a strong founder effect, allowed us: i) to avoid the problem of population stratification, ii) to confirm that HLA genes are also associated with celiac disease  in Quebec (children and adults) as in other Caucasian populations, iii) to identify the role of IL-13 gene in susceptibility to eosinophilic esophagitis (boys and girls) and to exclude IL-5 and IL-5R genes as susceptibility factor in our population. Conclusion: This study confirms for the first time the impact of HLA genes in predisposition to celiac disease and the role of genetic factors in eosinophilic esophagitis in a French Canadian population with a strong founder effect.

924	Recension intégrative des écrits sur la collaboration entre l'infirmière praticienne spécialisée et l'infirmière clinicienne en soins de première ligne	Interprofessional collaboration is an important aspect in improving access to health care to the population. This collaboration, when existed in the first-line health care settings, seemed sometimes difficult to articulate every day. Our integrative literature review is to analyze the written knowledge on NP-RN collaboration and propose an original conceptualization that integrates. The method of integrative literature used is that proposed by Whittemore and Knafl (2005). This is a structured method to analyze and synthesize written rigorously and to offer an original and integrative conceptualization of the subject under study. This method has five recursive steps: 1) identifying the problem; 2) research written; 3) evaluation of the data; 4) analyzing the data; 5) presentation of results. The analytical method of constant comparative data Strauss and Corbin (1998) that was used, has identified the phenomenon of collaboration between NP-RN and conceptualize the form of key categories. Based on the analysis of the literature reviewed, we propose that, for the NP and RN work is to collectively invest in the cooperative nursing practice frontline. For moving this collective investment, it is to prepare properly before court and following the arrival of the NP by learning, by taming and giving himself time. It also requires that all actors in this collaboration, feel sufficiently supported at the organizational, professional and personal. It is also essential to evaluate in order to improve, and by specifying the expected benefits of collaboration (both for the care team for customers), by regularly re-evaluating and correcting course as needed . To collectively is an inclusive action that assumes that all stakeholders recognize a desire to work together to better meet the health needs of a population. Finally, we discuss the strengths and limitations of our directed work, methodologically and in light of comparable work, and offer recommendations for practice, management, research and education in nursing.

925	The impact of early intra-articular corticosteroid injections on the outcome of oligoarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis	Background One of the goals in oligoarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis would be to alter the disease course with early therapy. We examined the association between early intra-articular corticosteroid injections and the achievement of an active joint count of zero and inactive disease during the first two years after study enrollment.   Methods We included oligoarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis patients enrolled into a prospective longitudinal cohort across Canada. Demographic, clinical and treatment-related information were collected. Early intra-articular corticosteroid injections was defined as having received the first injection within 3 months of diagnosis. Generalized estimating equations were used for data analysis.   Results A total of 310 patients were included, of whom 111 (35.8%) received an early injection. Participants who received an early injection had more severe disease at baseline. Patients exposed to early injections had a similar chance to achieve an active joint count of zero, OR 1.52 (95%CI 0.68-3.37), p=0.306 but were significantly less likely to achieve inactive disease, OR 0.35 (95%CI 0.14-0.88), p=0.026.   Interpretation In this cohort of 310 oligoarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis patients, early intra-articular corticosteroid injections did not result in an increased risk of achieving an active joint count of zero or inactive disease. Methodological issues encountered when estimating treatment effect using observational data might have biased the estimates obtained. Firm conclusion on the inefficacy of early injections in improving outcomes in this population cannot be drawn from this study. Prospective studies addressing the limitations raised will be needed to clarify if early injections can alter the disease course.

We hypothesized that restoration/maintenance of sinus rhythm (SR) pre-ablation would facilitate AF-termination and improve outcomes in patients with persistent AF.  Methods: We conducted a two-group cohort study of consecutive patients with persistent AF and SR restored for at least one month prior to ablation (SR Group; N=40) and controls matched by age, sex, and AF duration (Control Group; N=40). Radiofrequency (RF) step-wise catheter ablation was performed in AF for both groups (induced and spontaneous, respectively). Success was defined as freedom from atrial tachyarrhythmia without antiarrhythmic drugs beyond one year of follow-up.  Results: During the index ablation-procedure, AF cycle length was longer in the SR versus Control Group (183±32 vs 166±20 ms, P=0.06) suggestive of reverse remodeling. In the SR Group, AF more frequently terminated during ablation (95.0% vs 77.5%, P<0.05) and required less extensive ablation of complex fractionated electrograms (40.0% vs 87.5%, p<0.001) and linear lesions (42.5% vs 82.5%, p<0.001). Mean procedural (199.8±69.8 vs 283.5±72.3 minutes, P<0.001), fluoroscopy (51.0±24.9 vs 96.3±32.1 minutes, P<0.001), and RF-energy delivery (47.5±18.9 vs 97.0±30.6 minutes, P<0.001) times were shorter in the SR Group. Clinical success rates were similar between groups for first (55.0% vs 45.0%, P=0.28) and last (80.0% vs 70.0%, P=0.28) procedures, during similar follow-up periods (21.1±9.7 months).  Conclusions: Restoration of SR prior to catheter ablation for persistent AF whenever possible decreases the extent of ablation with the same high clinical efficacy.

927	Criblage génétique et caractérisation fonctionnelle des mutations dans les différentes sous-unités du récepteur GABAA associées à l'épilepsie génétique généralisée	Genetic generalized epilepsy (GGE) syndrome is a group of epilepsy disorders that occur early in childhood and adolescence. Genetics generalized epilepsies (GGE) account for approximately 30 % of all epilepsy syndromes. There is currently no cure for GGE. Although patients with GGE typically have no anatomical brain abnormalities, the root cause of these conditions is considered to be genetic in origin. An increasing number of genes predisposing to epilepsy have been identified over the past ten years. It has emerged in many cases that the causative genes for inherited epilepsies code for ion-channels such as the GABAA receptor (GABAAR). Among these genes, mutations in four subunits of the GABAA receptor appear to be an important cause of familial epilepsy. The main aim of the present thesis is to better characterize the genetic component of our GGE cohort explain by GABRA genes and evaluated the critical role of these variants in the pathogenesis of this phenotype.  The first part of our project was to investigate the impact of rare variants of GABAAR in GGE, we screened the coding regions of 19 genes encoding for all the known subunits of the GABAAR in unrelated GGE patients, including familial cases. Overall, approximately 8% of our GGE individuals have novel GABRA mutations, including 19 missenses and 3 nonsenses including 1 frameshift mutation. By sequencing those genes in a large cohort of cases and controls, we were able to establish the profile of rare variants for these genes. Our data suggest that a significant proportion of GGE patients share rare variants in GABRA genes. The second part of the work builds on the genes bearing mutations identified in the sequencing analysis. Among this group, five novel mutations have been so far associated to this syndrome (GABRA1 and GABRG2). We characterized the gating properties of GABA-evoked currents and the subcellular localization of the mutated subunits by expressing recombinant GABAA receptors in vitro. The third part of the work aimed to characterize the impact of mutated GABAA receptors on synapse formation and development of neuronal networks. By knocking down these genes in cortical organotypic slices, we provided a better understanding of the specific and distinct neural circuit alterations caused by different GABRA1 mutations and help define the pathophysiology of genetic generalized epilepsy syndromes.  We believe that these findings will allow a better understanding of the genetic mechanisms underlying the disease and involve mutations in GABAA receptors in critical mechanisms leading to epilepsy. Eventually, our results could lead to a better diagnosis and counteract the devastating effects of some GGEs early on before this complex condition has had the opportunity to be established.

928	Caractérisation du rôle et des mécanismes d’action des gènes Hoxa dans l’hématopoïèse adulte	In humans, a large percentage of myeloid and lymphoid leukemias exhibit aberrant Homeobox (Hox) genes expression, predominantly Hoxa genes. This aberrant expression is known to be caused by either translocations involving Hox genes or indirect activation of Hox genes. In addition, evidence now indicates a critical role for Hox genes in the initiation of leukemias. Clearly, understanding how Hox genes function in normal hematopoiesis is prerequisite to elucidate their involvement in leukemogenesis and this may eventually lead to new treatments for this disease. Attempts to determine the precise role(s) of Hox genes in normal hematopoiesis using single gene loss of function mutants have shown little success due to functional complementation by the remaining Hox genes. We previously showed that the Hoxa genes are much higher expressed in enriched hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) populations than the other members of the Hox gene family. Moreover, Hoxb cluster genes were found to be dispensable for HSCs long-term repopulation of irradiated mice. Thus, we hypothesize that Hoxa genes are critical for normal adult hematopoiesis. We have used a multi-gene knockout (KO for the entire Hoxa cluster) approach to thoroughly evaluate this issue.  In this thesis, we showed that HSC, primitive progenitors and B cell progenitors are particularly sensitive to the levels of Hoxa gene expression. Furthermore, a lower survival and a premature differentiation account for the loss HSC Hoxa-/- in bone marrow. Differential expression profiling by RNASeq revealed that Hoxa genes are capable of regulating a broad array of genes involved in various biological processes. Indeed, Hoxa genes regulate the expression of several genes coding for cytokine receptors. Furthermore, Hoxa genes modulate the expression of genes implicated in the regulation and formation of the niche architecture. The expression of several adhesion molecules is also modulated by the Hoxa genes, which can affect the relationship of HSC with the hematopoietic niche. Through their action on several biological processes such as apoptosis, cell cycle and niche interactions, Hoxa genes are necessary for maintenance of HSC and progenitors. Taken together, these results demonstrate that Hoxa genes are important regulators of adult hematopoiesis.	Hox genes , hematopoiesis , hematopoietic stem cells , transcription factors	en	11831.0
929	Évolution échocardiographique et prédicteurs de progression de la sténose valvulaire aortique	Introduction: The clinical use of biomarkers to predict the progression of aortic valve stenosis (AVS) is not yet validated. We want to evaluate potential predictors of the progression of degenerative AVS on tricuspid valve.  Methods: We identified 126 cases with AVS and ≥ 2 echocardiograms post-recruitment and 126 paired controls recruited by the Montreal Heart Institute’s Biobank. We collected clinical, echocardiographic and genetic base data and measured plasma biomarkers. The AVS evolution was established by the analysis of the serial echocardiograms and defined as the mean variation per year of the following parameters: maximal aortic transvalvular velocity, mean aortic transvalvular gradient (MATG), aortic valve area and indexed aortic valve area. We evaluated the association of clinical, echocardiographic and genetic (LPA rs10455872 polymorphism) data with the AVS progression and plasma biomarkers with the AVS presence and progression. Results: The mean follow-up was 2.4 years. According to multivariate analysis concerning the clinical/echocardiographic/ LPA rs10455872 data, a higher heart rate (for older patients and males), diabetes mellitus (for males) and a greater MATG in the first echocardiogram are associated to a faster AVS evolution. The presence of aortic regurgitation in the first echocardiogram is associated to a slower AVS evolution. The analysis of plasma biomarkers versus the AVS presence and progression is ongoing.  Conclusion: Our results indicate that a higher heart rate, diabetes mellitus, and a greater MATG are associated with faster AVS progression. The results of this study should contribute to a more personalized approach of the AVS follow-up and treatment.

et comment intervenir en phase initiale? Les principes extraits des résultats de la
recherche sur les facteurs prédisposants à l’invalidité"	Disability due to pain is a significant problem owing to its personal, financial and societal costs. Scientific efforts are aimed towards the identification of the risk factors for the development of pain leading to a state which undermines the afflicted person’s ability to attend to his/her basic functions. These efforts highlight the key role that psycho-social factors play in each stage of the progression towards disability due to pain. Among the influencing factors are psychological difficulties (depression, anxiety, somatization, personality disorder, catastrophization and activity avoidance), dissatisfaction at work and the compensation context. In light of this awareness, industrialized countries have instituted policies for the management of acute pain with the aim of reducing costs, both for the patient and for society. Twenty years after the appearance of the first clinical practice guidelines and the subsequent publication of numerous other guides propounding essentially the same information, physicians are still struggling to apply the recommendations. Relying on the evidence from the scientific literature, this study proposes a critical synthesis of the results to provoke thought and to advance the process towards a reduction in the personal, financial and societal costs of pain.	kinésiophobie , pain , somatization , catastrophization , kinesiophobia , fear-avoidance , pain treatment guidelines , invalidity , risk factors	en	11781.0
931	Densification & affordability : comparative real estate projects across Montreal	Montreal, Quebec is building towards a more compact urban form and there is a fundamental questioning of its effect on home-ownership affordability. Using the process of densification, a survey on a range of real estate condominium projects across the city is conducted to divulge the prices of new or in-construction projects. Beginning with a literature review of the most up to date planning stratagems, notably Smart Growth initiatives, the context for densification and consumerist tendencies to prefer sprawled urban forms is highlighted. Fundamentally, there is a teleocratic versus nomocratic planning approach that must be decided upon. Contemporary densification in Montreal is expressed in a myriad of condominium designs conforming to new demographic trends and lifestyles. Using existing criteria by Accès Condos, the projects are compared and validated as to whether or not condominium unit prices are affordable. As a result, new or in-construction condominium units are found to be affordable with respect to the Accès Condos programme and to median income households.  The analysis contributes empirically to the literature by relating the impetus of densification strategies with levels of affordability. The research takes a fresh look into Montreal's own condominium phenomenon alongside trending demographic studies. Using Burgess' spatial segregation of the city, a cross comparison survey tests for affordability across Montreal. The findings suggest that current projects are relatively affordable for median income earning households as per AccèsCondos.

It questions the practices, which contribute to the development of environmental qualities in the living environment. The collective creative efforts deployed in charrettes and workshops are considered to be relevant to the mobilization and reconciliation of values; principles necessary for sustainable development. The specific problematic concerns the adaptation of different operating structures of charrettes from one local context to another in order to insure desired outcomes. A comparative analysis of three case studies reveals that the creative processes of charrettes are adapted to the modes of communication required to advance the project planning process and confirms that their performance relies on their capacity to gather consensus in the actors concerned. Finally we supply a preliminary toolkit to help the future implementation of the charrette’s creative processes locally.	design urbain , collaboration , concertation , dialogue , communication , analyse structurale , urban design , local project , design process , collaboration , conciliation , structural analysis , case study	en	11774.0

As it is increasingly used, it is important to achieve proper bonding of the wire to ensure stability. Objective: The aim of this prospective randomized clinical study is to assess the short and medium term survival rate of the mandibular lingual retention wire using 2 different bonding techniques (direct and indirect).  Materials and Methods: The sample of 117 consecutive patients was randomly distributed into 2 groups: direct bonding (n=58) and indirect bonding (n=59). The multi-strand twist wires (0,0175”) used were all preformed by a technician and prepared for either direct or indirect bonding technique with a transfer matrix. Assure® and Filtek™ Flow were used for direct bonding. Filtek™ Flow, Assure®, and Sondhi™ were used for indirect bonding. The lingual wires were evaluated for bonding failure, infiltration, breakage, and distortion at 2 months (T1) and 6 months (T2).  Results: At T1, survival rate for the lingual wire was 90,2% for direct bonding and 79,5% for indirect bonding (p=0,232).  At T2, the lingual wire was intact for 74,1% of the participants in the direct bonding group and 70,0% for the indirect bonding group (p=0,481).  The differences between the 2 groups were not statistically significant. Debonding was more frequent than all other problems at T1 (p<0,022), accounting for 85,7% of the failures. At T2, debonding was more frequent than distortion and breakage (p<0,04), but not statistically more frequent than infiltration (p=0,109). It then accounted for 86,4% of the failures.   Conclusion:  Debonding is the main cause of failure for a lingual retention wire.  There is no statistically significant difference in the survival rate of a lingual retention wire using direct and indirect bonding techniques in the short and medium term.

935	Droites sur les hypergraphes	The Sylvester-Gallai theorem states that in a finite set S of points in the plane, not all on the same line, there is a line passing through exactly two points of S. Chvátal [14] extended the concept of lines to arbitrary metric spaces and made a conjecture generalizing the Sylvester-Gallai theorem. Chen [10] proved this conjecture which is now called The Sylvester-Chvátal Theorem. In 1943, Erdos [18] noticed a corollary to the Sylvester-Gallai theorem stating that, in a finite set V of points in the plane, not all on a line, the number of lines that pass through at least two points of V is at least |V |. De Bruijn et Erdos [7] generalized this corollary, using a generalized definition of a line (see Chapter 2) and proved that any set of n points, not all on the same line, determines at least n distinct lines. In this master’s thesis, we will study the theorems mentioned above. We will also look at the Theorem of De Bruijn-Erdos within the framework of hypergraphs and various metric spaces.

936	De Thiaroye on aperçoit l'île de Gorée. Histoire, anthropologie et mémoire d'un massacre colonial au Sénégal	By connecting history and anthropology, this thesis analyses the representations of the Thiaroye massacre, a repression of the tirailleurs sénégalais, Western African conscripts of the French army, in the Thiaroye camp on the outskirts of Dakar that took place on December 1st, 1944. First, it aims at documenting the event that, sixty years after, remains a controversial issue among the historians. Secondly, this thesis aims at analysing both the past and current use of this tragedy in different periods of time-scales. As a consequence, it helps to read the path of the post-colonial senegalese nation through the use of historical referents. This work dealing with the history of Thiaroye massacre is based on more than sixty interviews, the analysis of the works of art representing the event, different kind of archives (colonial sources and press journals published since 1945 until today), and the ethnographic investigation (for instance among the college students). The representation of the December 1st 1944 is currently one of the paradigms of the colonial memory in Senegal. By trying to describe the use of the past during more than sixty years, it is possible to consider the links between the dominant memory – official as well as unofficial – or the specific forms of remembrance and the role of this past in the some identity dynamics.

937	Sociétés de fictions	The concept of Societies of fictions developed inside the framework of this Masters thesis aims to explore the mediation at the digital age. The main idea is to think the terms of narrative fiction with the idea that each one may be part of societies. To do so, this analytical work intends to examine various fictions, specifically some examples of the American Gothic in contemporary literature, to extract a significant thought mode. In attempt to analyze how these fictions connect to each other, this piece of research focuses also on the relationship that fiction maintains with technology, including various modes of dissemination. To understand how narrative mechanisms contribute to positioning those fictions relative to each other, they will be approached as if they formed a society of their own. This strategy will lead us to revisit past tradition in a critical vein, and it will also provide an entry into the ways in which and how relations among human, literature and technology are reconfigured through new forms of mediation. By emphasizing the idea that fictions are organized into societies, we are in a better position to describe the paradigm shift from printed to digital media, and to examine how it transforms our relationship to narrative fiction in general. On balance, this discussion on mobility forms and fictions related platforms and their society should ultimately permit a better analyze of individuals who invent and consume these fictions, their social world and their intimate relationship with technology and mediations. As a result, Societies of fictions can become a key element to understand our relationship with the virtualization of our social universe. Between societies of fictions and human societies, a substantial connection can be drawn in the form of a co-evolutionary process. The main works studied and cited will be those of the American novelist and screenwriter Bret Easton Ellis, more specifically Less Than Zero and Imperial Bedrooms. The television serial drama Twin Peaks, which aired on the ABC channel in 1990 and was directed by David Lynch, will also be discussed, as well as a John Cheever’s short story, The Enormous Radio, originally published in 1947 in The New Yorker.	fiction , flux , Society , fiction , mediation , slip , platform , network , flow , gothic , intimate	en	11714.0
938	Diaspora arménienne de Montréal : comparaison intergénérationnelle du contenu des imaginaires nationaux et des sources de (re)production culturelle	The Armenian genocide of 1915 has had substantial identity impacts on different generations of Armenians in the diaspora, creating, for diasporic Armenian communities, a responsibility to perpetuate the traumatic collective memory. However, differences can be observed between these generations in the definition of Armenianness and in the identity supplies. Thus, our research question seeks to understand how the content of the national imaginary and the sources of cultural (re)production change between the second, third and fourth generations of Armenians settled in Montreal. The aim of the present study is to combine the emerging scientific literature on diasporic nationalism, as well as the role of cyberspace. Through interviews with Armenians – exiled since the Armenian genocide of 1915 and settled in Montreal – we will show, firstly, how the content of the national imaginary changes from a traditional identity to a symbolic one. Secondly, we will demonstrate how the sources of cultural (re)production are transformed by the transition from traditional sources to digital ones with the advent of cyberspace.

939	Étude du champ magnétique interne de deux matériaux magnétiques et d'un supraconducteur sans symétrie d'inversion	This thesis is divided in three sections. The first section presents the results from a small angle neutron scattering (SANS) investigation of the formation of bound magnetic polarons in the ferromagnet EuB6. While the magnetic nature of the system was observed below 15K, we could not resolve the q dependent signature of the polarons, thus putting a lower limit of 100\AA to the coherence length of the phenomenon (xi_{Lower}).    Secondly, we investigated the non-centrosymmetric superconductor LaRhSi3 by muSR. The absence of an internal field below T_c = 2.2 K in ZF-muSR, indicates that the superconducting wave function does not carry an intrinsic magnetic moment. The asymmetry spectrum taken under external magnetic field shows the magnetic signature associated with vortices between H_{c1}(0) and H_{c2}(0), respectively 80 +/- 5 and 169.0 +/- 0.5 G, suggesting the system is weakly type-II.    Finally, the third section presents the zero field muSR study of internal magnetic fields in the organic antiferromagnet NIT-2Py. The temperature dependent oscillating signal in the ZF-muSR spectrum confirms the presence of a long-range magnetic interaction between the molecules. By comparing the measured internal magnetic fields to calculated values based on density fonctional theory calculations, we confirm that half the molecules dimerizes while the other half forms the antiferromagnetic order under the critical temperature (T_c = 1.33 +/- 0.01K). In this antiferromagnetic order, the moments on the magnetic molecules are uniformly aligned along the (1 0 -2) axis. They interact antiferromagnetically along the (0 1 0) axis and ferromagnetically between the [-1 0 2] planes.	muSR , ZF-muSR , NIT-2Py , Unconventional superconductivity , Non-centrosymmetric , Quantum magnet , Organic magnetism , Neutron diffraction , Ferromagnetism , Antiferromagnetism , LaRhSi3 , EuB6 , muSR	en	11709.0
940	La violence domestique envers les femmes au Mexique : une analyse multidimensionnelle et intersectionnelle	"By adopting the intersectional feminist approach and mobilizing mixed methods, this research seeks to better understand partner violence in Mexico, both through a discourse analysis of the Mexican feminist movement and a quantitative multidimensional level of analysis by identifying the institutional, economic and socio-cultural factors associated with the risk of experiencing domestic violence. This research differs from the traditional feminist reflections made in Mexico because it takes into consideration gender inequality in interaction with other systems of oppression and subordination, mainly based on social class and ethnicity. Thus, it captures partner violence in relation to patriarchy, without reducing it to sociodemographic and behavioral indicators measured at the individual level, but by taking into account the structural context of gender inequality at the regional level. By integrating individual and contextual factors, this research attempts to reconcile the two major theoretical perspectives that explain partner violence, which are the family violence approach (that linger to factors at the micro level) and feminist approaches (which focus on the patriarchal structure, in other terms the broader context of gender inequality).   The results of the discursive analysis from the interviews with the feminists representing all three branches of the Mexican feminism (hegemonic, popular and indigenous feminism) revealed existing fractures within the feminist movement in Mexico (antagonism between institutionalization and autonomy of the feminist movement). In general, this analysis showed that the feminists’ gender struggle and their demands are consistent with the ""ideal types"" of the three branches of the Mexican feminism. Hegemonic feminism focuses mainly on the patriarchal structure of Mexican society and gender inequality when it comes to finding the causes of violence against women. For the popular feminism, violence against women is explained by both gender inequalities and the vulnerable economic situation. The discourse of indigenous women emphasizes the articulation of gender, ethnic and socio-economic inequalities. However, we found evidence that hegemonic and popular feminism seem increasingly sensitive to the intersection of systems of domination and oppression. In addition, multilevel analysis using data from the National Survey of Dynamics of Relationships within Households (2006) revealed several important findings that deserve to be highlighted. Firstly, we show that differences in the prevalence of partner violence among Mexican municipalities are largely explained by their social composition, that is to say, by the characteristics of women and their relationship (micro level), rather than differences between the level of gender inequality in the Mexican municipalities measured by the GDI (gender-Human Development Index). In addition, the results show that indigenous women generally have lower rates of violence that the rest of mestizas Mexican women (majority group). Finally, in regard to the relationship between the context of gender inequality and domestic violence, and contrary with what would be expected, violence is higher in municipalities with higher GDI. This result seems to contradict feminist assumptions. It would seem that despite recent progress in women’s situation in areas such as health, education and income in Mexico, it has not been able to transform the gender order."

941	Les centres de travailleurs : un moyen d’élargir le champ d’action syndical? : études de cas	The labor market is undergoing major changes. The north-american model of union organization seems to not allow the labor movement to respond effectively to these changes, which have contributed to the development of several union renewal initiatives. To evaluate the impacts of union renewal initiatives, we have developped a model based on the concept of union zone (Haiven 2003, 2006). We had to determine the factors defining the union zone, as the litterature was silent about that subject. Using at first the theory of the determinants of the union density (Schnabel, 2003), we have integrated elements of the theory of union power resources (Lévesque and Murray, 2010) to the model to consider the internal factors for the unions that can influence the union zone. The integration of these three theories in one unified model constitute a significant theoritical innovation. The model was applied to two workers centers : the Vermont Workers Center and the St-Rémi Workers Center. In both cases, these union renewal initiatives have enlarged the union zone. On the other side, the Vermont center applies the principles of community unionism, seeking to develop leadership among its members (Cranford and Ladd, 2003), while the St-Rémi center applies the principles of mobilization unionism, in which leadership is exercised rather by union organizers (Camfield, 2007). This difference and their different mandates made the impacts in the two studied cases different. Further studies are needed to improve the proposed model. It remains a tool that can be useful for researchers or unions who want to evaluate the impacts of union initiatives or practices and, eventually, increase the influence of the labor movement on the labor market and society.	workers center , union renewal , union power , union density , union zone , atypical workers , unions , trade union , labor movement , migrant workers	en	11702.0
942	Misrepresenting Russia : Western perceptions of the Putin years, 1999-2008	The ascension of Vladimir Putin to the Russian presidency was a turning point in the history of Russia. Using articles from four influential western newspapers—the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Guardian and the Independent—this text will show the West perceived Russia during Putin’s between 1999 and 2008. Putin was heavily criticized as he was moving the country away from the “democracy” installed by the West after the Cold War, to a path more in line with traditional Russian principles. Russia refused to be subservient to Western interests. The western mainstream media reflected their government’s interests and critiqued Russia’s new path. The western media’s perceived obligation to promote “freedom” and “democracy” around the world has led it to condemn Russia and Putin and to create a sense of “russophobia” in the West.

943	La gestion des forêts royales en Normandie à la fin du Moyen Âge : étude du Coutumier d’Hector de Chartres	At the beginning of the XVth century, domanial forests became a major issue in the affairs of the kingdom of France. Managed by the Waters and Forests administration, they were put under close surveillance by the king’s decree. The study of Hector de Chartres’ customary, a XVth century register containing the customs of hundreds of users of Charles VI’s norman domain’s forests, reveals the place that they held in France at the end of the Middle Ages. It shows first that they were not only important in the province’s economic life but that they also played a major role in its urban and rural life. It also shows, with the analysis of a XIVth and XVth century corpus of royal ordonnances, how they were important for the king, who took there the ressources he needed to build a navy and maintain his fortresses in Normandy and who benefited from the users’ royalties. Thus, a complex relation which greatly benefited the two parties was created through a complex system of customs and royalties. By trying to protect these benefits, the kings of France tried to manage adequately their forests, establishing the bases of sustainable forestry oriented towards the conservation of forest ressources and acting as gardians of the kingdom’s common good.

944	Suzanne Lilar : configurations d'une image auctoriale	This thesis investigates the difficult positioning of identity in Belgian writer Suzanne Lilar's literary trajectory. The conflict between the writer's art and her need to project an image consistent with her environment is reflected not only in the set-pieces of her literary works, but also in her essays and paratext, and in the way her works were received by the press of the day. The first part of the analysis describes Lilar's position in Belgian literary circles, whose proximity to the mainstream was always threatened by assimilation, and within feminist writings. The second part analyzes the storylines in her fictional and more biographical works. The parallel viewpoints in these works demonstrate that Lilar's aesthetic approach, which is based on the need to legitimize her enterprise, is based mainly on multiple perspectives and forms of expression. The duplication of the plot line in her stories, the mise en abyme of the author's voice, and the constant rewriting illustrate her need to make a place for herself in the literary landscape, but also her mistrust of literary writing. The third part of this research analyzes the ethos and position Lilar constructs through her essays and paratext, upon which she bases her literary and social legitimacy. The final part of the thesis reports on how Lilar's work was received in its day. The image of Lilar propounded by the media positioned her within the literary establishment and also within her own chosen social stratum. The press of the time viewed her as she variously presented herself. This corroborates the hypothesis that Lilar had trouble in fully assuming her role as a writer. Her presentation of herself as being out of step with society − in the trompe-l'oeil manner of her poetics − appears to have been the only way for Lilar to shoulder the displacement essential to her creative work.

945	Sur un modèle d'érythropoïèse comportant un taux de mortalité dynamique	This thesis addresses erythropoiesis mathematical modeling, which is the process of erythrocytes production and its regulation by erythropeitin. We propose an erythropoiesis model extension which includes aging of mature cells. First, we consider an age-structured model with moving boundary condition, whose dynamics are represented by advection equations. Biologically, the moving boundary condition means that the maximal lifespan varies to account for a constant degraded cells flux. Then, hypotheses are introduced to simplify and transform the model into a system of three delay differential equations for the total population, the hormone concentration and the maximal lifespan. An alternative model composed of two equations with two constant delays is obtained by supposing that the maximal lifespan is constant. Finally, a new model is introduced, which includes an exponential death rate depending on erythrocytes maturity level. A linear stability analysis allows to detect simple and double Hopf bifurcations emerging from variations of the gain in the feedback loop and from parameters associated to the survival function. Numerical simulations also suggest a loss of stability caused by interactions between two linear modes and the existence of a two dimensional torus in the phase space close to the stationary solution.

946	« En vacances...en voiture...en Pontiac!» : les représentations de genre à travers les loisirs dans la Revue moderne et Châtelaine, 1945-1969	This thesis analyses the articles and publicities about leisure found in Revue moderne and Châtelaine after World War II. Being a growing phenomenon during the era of mass consumption, leisure is gaining in popularity and it is reflected in its representations, particularly towards the lower middle class families whose access to leisure is facilitated by an increased amount of ressources.  These representations, which are used to promote daily use products, tourism products or advices on vacation, bring to light certain aspects from the population of Quebec's daily life. Moreover they help disseminating postwar values. Indeed, stereotypes such as the mother as the housewife and the father as a provider can be observed. Not only are values associated to domesticity, feminity, masculinity and the nuclear family transmitted in the media and by social actors of the time, but they are also found in leisure which is accessible to even more families.

947	The importance of language : the impact of linguistic vitality on intergroup tensions	This dissertation seeks to add to the understanding of ethnic tensions. It does so by exploring in a four-part study one of its most important but severely overlooked features: language. Combining research traditions from sociolinguistics, social psychology and political science, this dissertation provides an in depth analysis of language’s influence on intergroup relations. It does so, specifically, by concentrating on the influence that linguistic vitality, the social health of a language, has on social tensions. This dissertation puts forward a theoretical framework in which linguistic vitality is presented as fueling cultural grievances, which subsequently impact intergroup relations. The first article explores the general macro-social relationship between linguistic vitality and intergroup conflict intensity. Using data from UNESCO’s Atlas of the World’s Languages in Danger and from the Minorities at Risk (MAR) project, the results show a curvilinear relationship in which low and high levels of linguistic vitality generate lower conflict intensity than moderate vitality levels. The findings support linguistic vitality as being an important determinant of language-based ethnic tensions in a general manner, but even more so for countries with multiple linguistic minorities. The second article explores the influence of linguistic vitality on political trust. The results of the analyses, using survey data from the European Social Survey (ESS)    and linguistic vitality data from UNESCO’s Atlas of the World’s Languages in Danger, show that linguistic vitality positively influences trust in national institutions and that perceptions of linguistic discrimination decrease political trust. The findings further indicate that the status of a language, how ‘official’ it is, also positively affects trust in national institutions. Therefore, language is clearly underscored as being an important dimension of political trust. The third article seeks to isolate the socio-psychological sequence which connects linguistic vitality and intergroup tensions. Original survey data was gathered from Francophones in Quebec, Ontario, New Brunswick and Manitoba. The findings, using stepwise regression analyses, support a socio-psychological sequence in which in-group threat influences attitudes towards the out-group through the mediation of perceived threat caused by the out-group. Thus, these findings emphasize the importance of linguistic vitality perceptions on intergroup attitudes The fourth, and final, article, in collaboration with Patrick Fournier and Verònica Benet-Martínez, uses an experimental design to ascertain the causal role of linguistic vitality on intergroup attitudes. The results demonstrate that the type of information, positive or negative, on linguistic vitality influences perceptions of threat towards a language. However, results about linguistic vitality information’s impact on out-group attitudes, support for sovereignty and subjective identity were less one-sided. This dissertation permits to shine new light on group tensions by highlighting the important role that linguistic vitality plays on macro-social phenomena and micro-individual attitudes.

948	On the design of customized risk measures in insurance, the problem of capital allocation and the theory of fluctuations for Lévy processes	The aim of this thesis is to study fundamental problems in financial and insurance mathematics particularly the problem of measuring risk and its application within financial and insurance frameworks. The main contributions of this thesis can be classified in three main axes: the theory of risk measures, the problem of capital allocation and the theory of fluctuation. In Chapter 2, we design new coherent risk measures and study the associated capital allocation in the context of collective risk theory. We introduce the family of Cumulative Entropic Risk Measures. In Chapter 3, we study the optimal portfolio problem for the Entropic Value at Risk coherent risk measure for particular return models which are based on relevant cases of Jump-Diffusion models. In Chapter 4, we extending the notion of natural risk statistics to the multivariate setting. This non-trivial extension will endow us with multivariate data-based risk measures that are bound to have applications in finance and insurance. In Chapter 5, we introduce the concepts of drawdown and speed of depletion to the ruin theory literature and study them for the class of spectrally negative Lévy risk processes.

949	Robert Choquette à la lettre. Poésie et réseaux épistolaires au Québec	This thesis takes as its object the study of the correspondence between Robert Choquette and Louis Dantin, Alfred DesRochers and, to a lesser extent, Claude-Henri Grignon, Émile Coderre and Albert Pelletier. The letters in question were never published and are kept in the Robert-Choquette archival group, itself only made available to academics in 2006. The purpose of this study is to measure Robert Choquette's scope and influence as well as the role he played in literary circles during the 20s and 30s. The first part of the first chapter is essentially theoretical, and concerns itself with defining the importance of epistolary writing within the purview of a writer’s work, the constitution of a literary network by way of correspondence, and the relationship between sender and addressee. Then, the various letter exchanges between Choquette and his correspondents are examined so as to shed light on the interplay of influences within the network. The study, based on a corpus of letters written between 1927 and 1943, also displays the evolution of the author’s poetic ambitions. Aiming to highlight the impact Choquette’s correspondents had on his literary project, the second and third chapters of this thesis are dedicated to analyzing his collections of poems Metropolitan Museum and Suite marine. The study of specific exchanges bearing on these two books exhibits a transformation in the imagery Choquette employs to depict himself, as well as an evolution of the author’s expectations from his correspondents.

950	"Quand _Refus global_ devient ""Refus global"" : l'histoire d'une réception partielle"	"Total Refusal, the pamphlet, is not ""Total Refusal"", the text written by Paul-Émile Borduas and co-signed by 15 members of the group of artists called the Automatists. Based on this distinction between the pamphlet and its eponymous text, and from the observation that the part eclipses the whole in the critical discourse about this work, this thesis aims to explain the occultation of the pamphlet in Quebec’s social and artistic history. From the study of the reception from 1948 to 2008, I question the construction of the common narrative surrounding the work, from which the pamphlet is excluded. In this regard, I uncover which obstacles impeded the pamphlet’s path of reception, preventing the constitution of a unified and coherent discourse, and limiting its place in history. These obstacles, identified from a corpus that includes 639 secondary semiotic objects (« objets sémiotiques secondaires » (OSS), as proposed by Brigitte Louichon), derive from (1) pragmatic factors such as the heterogeneous composition of the work or its availability; (2) institutional or historiographical factors, such as the disciplinarisation of the cultural field and the influence of the Quiet Revolution’s narrative on the literary history; and (3) human factors, based on the role of writers and critics in the reception of the work. The different stages of the reception are thus considered: from the horizon of expectation (Jauss) to the productive reception (Link), through the publication, the first reviews, the reeditions, the academic lectures, the historicization and the entry of the work in the collective memory as a symbol or an hypotext. However, rather than this classic path of reception, I am concerned with its opposite side, that is, the difficulties and deviations of the reception of Total Refusal pamphlet.  This thesis is divided in three parts. The first part, theoretical and methodological, positions my argumentation in the fields of cultural history and reception studies, and presents various considerations about the formation of the corpus and the processing of the data.  The second part is concerned with the horizon of expectations and the first reception. Such is a critical time for the survival of the work, as showed by Hans Robert Jauss and Daniel Chartier. Notably presented are the lock effect (Cambron) of the dismissal of Borduas on the constitution of the reception narrative, as well as the ethical and aesthetic criteria throught which took place the hierarchization of the value of the components of the pamphlet. The third part covers the subsequent reception (1950-2008) in which I continue the study of the obstacles that still prevents the integration of the pamphlet in history. Furthermore, this section examines the parallel, fragmented and autonomous receptions which enable the survival of Total Refusal, occasionally and partially, outside the common narrative formed around ""Total Refusal"".  These three types of reception, together with the different categories of OSS (direct, indirect, hypertextual, metacritical and fragmented), are part of heuristic tools developed to explain the partial reception of the pamphlet Total Refusal. In accordance with the quantitative and environmentalistic approach of the cultural history, Total Refusal is perceived as a microcosm of the culture in which some works are selected and others disregarded. The analysis of a wide and varied critical corpus enables the understanding of, not only the events leading to the consecration of the eponymous text or the relative neglect of the pamphlet, but also the critical trends, marginal publications, isolated critics, etc. which, embedded in the blind spots of the reception, provide the pamphlet and its components with a way to bypass the dominant discourse. Overall, the study of the reception of the pamphlet Total Refusal has helped change the critical focus from ""Total Refusal"" to Total Refusal. In addition, it lead to new ways of considering the reception of marginalized works and highlighted selected criteria in the constitution of the history and cultural memory in Quebec since 1948."

951	La parole pamphlétaire chez deux «partipristes» : Paul Chamberland et Pierre Vallières	The texts of the young intellectuals that appeared in Parti pris, written about the antagonistic and contentious theatre of violence and strife between classes and values in the social field, represent a singular case of Quebec’s pamphleteering circumscribed in the context of the 1960’s. This study wishes to question the critical faculties of the pamphleteers' texts in Quebec by uncovering the discursive and rhetorical strategies. The revolutionary political purpose put forward by the revue is certainly one of most successful in terms of consolidating its members around the Quebec identity (political, economic, literary, artistic and cultural). Amongst them, Paul Chamberland, whose texts ranged from editorials to poetry, and Pierre Vallières with his autobiographical essay Nègres blancs d’Amérique, are perhaps the most representative of their time and of the issues around which revolved the generation that Parti pris was representing. Drawing on theories of controversy, rhetoric and pragmatic speeches, our research aims to inform the reader of the articulation of Chamberland and Vallières’s thought, as well as the literary value of their work and their stylistic peculiarities. In addition to identifying an overview of the main issues addressed by the Parti pris’s leaders, this research questions the intentions that lie behind the discourse circulating in the revue and in the generation that was claiming it.

952	Analyse des processus de dérive lors de la gravure profonde du silicium dans des plasmas SF6 et C4F8	The purpose of this master thesis is to develop non-invasive diagnostic tools for in-situ characterization of process drifts in an industrial reactor used in production for deep silicon etching by the Bosch process. This process alternates between a SF6 plasma for isotropic Si etching and a C4F8 plasma for sidewall passivation to achieve deep and narrow trenches. In this context, a current-voltage probe was installed on the rf transmission line to the substrate holder for impedance studies and an optical spectrometer for plasma optical emission spectroscopy. We have shown that the time evolution of the impedance represents an excellent tool for monitoring changes in the process dynamics, including the complete removal of the photoresist due to process drifts. In addition, based on emission spectroscopy, we have demonstrated that carbon products are released from the substrate and reactor walls during etching.  A « spinning-wall » reactor was also developed for in-situ analysis of plasma-wall interactions. The main objective of our work on this reactor was to characterize the time evolution of the population of reactive neutrals and positive ions by plasma sampling mass spectrometry. Over the range of experimental conditions investigated, the percent dissociation of SF6 was 45%, while the one of C4F8 was 70%. SF6 was mostly dissociated in F and SF3, with SF3+ as the dominant ion. C4F8 is essentially fragmented in CF, CF3 and CF4 with many significant ions. In both cases, the dissociation chain remained incomplete. An important desorption of CF4 from the reactor walls was observed when going from passivation to etching cycles. A plasma-wall interaction model was proposed to explain such observation.

953	Appropriation de la décision collective : évaluation environnementale comme champ d’application de la participation publique au Bénin	Based upon the organizational principle of two types of political entities  found in Benin, the purpose of this research is to explore one or several joint, classic and traditional participation models in order to promote a participative democracy closer to citizens. Three spatial scales have been used for the field research: Africa, central Benin and communities close to ancient kingdoms. Documents and data generated through observation and interviews were analyzed using grounded theory principles and ”appréhension des phénomènes socio-spatiaux”. Among the  four original models including endogenous criteria for assessing participation which correspond to  Benin’s cultures, two – Togbésso-Hon-Togbassa and Daŋnou – appear as properly suited to meet the requirements of a democracy with territorialized forms of participation. When participation in Benin is compared with that of other African States, its good performance elevates it as a reference in terms of effectiveness of procedures and practices. As such, Benin has become a source of inspiration for implementation of participatory mechanisms within major democracies. Both its decision making instruments – namely participatory analysis and public hearing – may still be perfected. The first of the two –an interesting innovation which nonetheless deserves to be highlighted – limits participation to players selected according to criteria which generally remain implicit. Conversely, public hearing remains unsatisfactory by inadequately allowing the production of collective decision making, as well as by instituting a  model in contradiction with African political thought, which rather seeks consensus through an inclusive and deliberative approach known as ”la palabre”. At the founding of participative democracy, “la palabre” provides a synergistic, flexible and responsive model based on the DROIE principles for decision making, at the center of which prevail deliberation, ”le huis clos”, popular validation and reporting, use and repair, as well as quality control of decision. All of these are essential as much to management as to the structure of environmental assessment.

954	Danser au monde : étude du mouvement dans l'espace textuel de Marguerite Duras	Few studies have been undertaken on movement in the work of Marguerite Duras (1914-1996). Yet, the rewritings and repetitions that mark her scripturary practice allow for the thinking of displacements, metamorphoses that the present thesis proposes to read in the company of such thinkers as Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Gilles Deleuze, Georges Didi-Huberman, and in a more spectral, but no less essential way, Jacques Derrida, Claude Lévesque and Maurice Blanchot. The first chapter is interested in “the dancing-walk of the beggarwoman”, which takes place in Le Vice-consul (1966). The movement of loss in the beggarwoman proposes itself as a process of endless deterritorialization in which metamorphoses and becomings are ceaselessly operative. The latter draws into its rhizome places in which having an experience of the visible is isolatable with difficulty from its invisible doubling. Places are thus “created” to make of the “danced place a dancing space” (Chapter 2). It would not, however, be possible to account for movement without questioning “the rhythms of dance” (Chapter 3), the ordeal of which possesses a metamorphosizing power, and is particularly sensible in L’Après-midi de monsieur Andesmas (1962). But rhythm is also that through which time is opened. And Durassian time plunges her reader as well as her characters into a universe in which the virtual and the actual tirelessly exchange forces. Thus does the question of the event, of its possibility in encounter and crime, which is the object of “time parted by dance” (Chapter 4). The depository of a strange hiatus aroused  such that a distance can be excavated in order to speak the event, this work dreams, finally, through language, of the unseparated event in the perpetual movement of sense, in “the dance of sense” (Chapter 5). Nonetheless, if sense can first appear to be dancing because it is unstable, it must be recognized that one is always turning around certain words that escape. Something will always escape. That is what the sixth chapter, “Dance’s échappé(e),” apprehends, when movement, which has no finality other than itself, inscribes a perpetual incompletion to which the rewritings testify. Because she stages beings in movement in a work itself in movement, Marguerite Duras’s œuvre enables one to think the being-in-the-world as a dancer.

955	Passage du nihilisme biologique au nihilisme moral dans la pensée d'Alex Rosenberg	Evolutionary biology is at the center of contemporary debates about human behavior. Therefore the concepts of free will and morality in regard of these kinds of explanations should be studied. Today’s consensus posits that free will is only the experience of free will. The real question is more how this experience could take place in a Darwinian frame. However, others Darwinians seem to give free will a reality as well as accepting a Darwinian determinism. In this essay, Alex Rosenberg’s original position negating free will and determinism will be studied. More specifically, the physicalist and naturalist positions adopted by Rosenberg argues for the transition from the biological nihilism to moral nihilism. We will see how this transition illustrates Rosenberg’s position about free will and morality. To do so, the Second Law of Thermodynamics and the Theory of Natural Selection will be analyzed in the aim of demonstrating how they can be associated with the physicalist and naturalist positions. Finally, Alex Rosenberg’s arguments will be put in a metaethics frame to show a contradiction: moral nihilism might not be as nice as Rosenberg suggest.

956	L'art contemporain à l'ère des glissements du privé vers le public : pour une relecture de la vie privée	This Master’s thesis deals with the works of artists Sophie Calle, Sylvie Cotton, Donigan Cumming, Martin Dufrasne, and Marc-Antoine K. Phaneuf. The objective of this research is to observe the back and forth explored by the artists in their practices between the private and the public sphere and how these problematize our relationship with intimacy.  In the first chapter, I will determine the elements that respectively characterize the public and the private space, and then find the places and forms that define intimacy. In the second chapter, I will examine the private sphere's appropriation gestures and methods employed by the artists through a study of collecting, ethnographic, and surveillance practices. I will underline the impact of such practices on the artists' investment in time and their implication in contextual art. Finally, I will deliberate on my very own practices, considering how they differentiate or resemble the practices of the artists studied in this memoir.	art contemporain , surveillance , Sophie Calle , Sylvie Cotton , Martin Dufrasne , Donigan Cumming , Marc-Antoine K.

957	Intervention éducative visant le transfert des résultats probants par les infirmières dans la pratique du contact peau à peau en post-partum immédiat	Problem statement: Current perinatal practice does not meet the recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP, 2012) with regard to skin-to-skin contact immediately after birth, since newborns are quickly removed from their mothers for routine care (Moore, Anderson, Bergman, & Dowswell, 2012). This article presents the elaboration and evaluation of an educational intervention with and for nurses that aims to implement an adequate and evidence-based practice of skin-to-skin contact in the immediate post-partum period.  Method: Four educational sessions were developed based on an active learning approach. Pre and post observations were conducted to assess the impact of the educational intervention on the nursing practice. The Iowa Model of Evidence-Based Practice to Promote Quality Care (Titler et al., 2001) guided the various steps of the project.  Results: The educational intervention increased the time of continuous and uninterrupted skin-to-skin contact after birth (from 20 to 26 minutes) and improved the quality of information given to families on skin-to-skin contact. In addition, some routine care was done during the skin-to-skin contact while newborns were positioned on their mothers’ thorax. However, further improvements are still required since the observed duration time of the skin-to-skin contact and the family teaching are not meeting the experts’ recommendations for this practice.  Recommendations: The implementation of an educational intervention using active teaching/learning methods, combined with additional resources, seems to be effective in improving evidence-based clinical nursing practice in immediate post-partum. Further studies need to be conducted to evaluate the impact of such educational interventions that aim to implement evidence-based practices.

958	Etude des facteurs associés à la détresse psychologique lors de la transition des ainés vers la retraite	Rationale : Retirement is an important step in seniors’ life. It is a period characterized by several changes such as the end of role of worker, a considerable decrease in income, and a change in the way of living that may affect the psychological well-being of retirees. According to Atchley, the risk of psychological distress increases when the transition to retirement leads to discontinuity in internal and external resources which are available to individuals before and after retirement. Objectives : To examine the evolution of internal and external resources of individuals before and after retirement and to estimate the influence of the evolution of these factors on psychological distress of retirees. Methods : Data come from the Canadian National Population Health Survey, a longitudinal population-based survey conducted by Statistics Canada. The sample was made up of 426 retirees aged 55 and over at the time of retirement. Psychological distress was measured by Kessler’s K6. Independent variables included the sense of control (internal factor), stress, social network and social support (external factors). Data were analyzed by linear regression analysis. Results : Psychological distress of retirees increases according to their level of distress before retirement and to the financial and general stress experienced after retirement. It decreases according to their sense of control felt after retirement and to the change in their social network and sense of control before and after retirement. Conclusion : Contrary to what was predicted by the model of Atchley, discontinuity of internal and external resources is not necessarily a risk factor for distress of retirees since their situation after retirement can also affect their mental health.

959	Syndrome du QT long: étude clinique à l’Institut Cardiologique de Montréal et recherche de nouvelles variantes causales par séquençage à haut débit	Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a channelopathy, causing syncope and sudden death. Genetic testing of individuals identifies genetic variants in up to 50-70% of cases, suggesting that additional genes may be involved. We have identified 50 patients with a diagnosis of LQTS at MHI, and recruited 12 patients reported negative for clinical testing of mutations in LQTS for a whole-exome next generation DNA sequencing approach in order to identify new variants and candidate genes. We have developed a stepwise analytic approach that focuses on (1) the known LQTS genes, (2) the genes in loci identified in genome-wide association studies of QT-interval, and (3) the loci showing variants across multiple patients. Our approach identified new variants in (1) KCNJ2, ANK2 and AKAP9, and (2) in NOS1AP. We identify 2 patients with a very similar phenotype with a homozygous variant in TECRL, an novel candidate gene with an unknown role in LQTS.

960	Entre déracinement et émancipation : l’expérience des jeunes autochtones pris en charge par la protection de la jeunesse	"The forced implementation of children welfare services for Aboriginal peoples resulted in harmful consequences for Aboriginal youths and their families. Nowadays in Canada, these youths are overrepresented in the provincial child protection systems. Inspired by Dubet’s ""Sociology of experience"" (1994), this study focuses on the significations that young Aborigines attach to their care experience with child protection services so that the interventions may be planned in accordance with the meaning that they give to their reality. As part of a qualitative methodology, seven life stories have been gathered from young Aborigines, aged between 18 and 24, having been involved in child protective services and residing in urban areas. The analysis of these testimonies has permitted to highlight three types of experiences: rebellion, resignation and resilience. The intervention of child welfare agencies represents for these youths a protective measure that allowed them to escape from difficult living conditions. However, their perception becomes more qualified during the course of the out-of-home placement: the protection can be seen as « partial», «trite» or «total» depending on the uprooting, detachment or emancipation effect linked to the placement. The results show, on one hand, that youth protection represents an answer to poverty in Aboriginal populations and, on the other hand, that the links of young Aborigines with their environment of origin is essential if one wants to favor their welfare."	placement , interventions sociales , youth protection , young Aborigines , out-of-home placement , foster care , social interventions , life stories , sociology of experience , typology	en	11532.0
961	Les routes d’invasion du criocère du lis (Lilioceris lilii) en Amérique du Nord	The lily leaf beetle, Lilioceris lilii (Coleoptera : Chrysomelidae), a Eurasian pest of lilies and fritillaries, was first observed in North America in 1943 on the Island of Montréal, Canada. After being confined to Montréal for approximately 25 years, the beetle quickly progressed in North America, and is currently present in eight Canadian provinces and eight American states. During this study, we have investigated the routes of invasion followed by L. lilii in North America, using AFLP markers. We sampled and analysed 516 individuals from 34 sites across North America and Europe. Our first objective was to characterize the genetic structure of North American L. lilii populations to determine if they originated from a single or form multiple introductions from Europe. The second objective was to identify the geographical origin of the invasive population(s). Finally, the third objective was to trace back the geographical routes of invasion of L. lilii in North America, using information from both the dates of first observations and the genetic structure of sampled populations. Our results showed clear genetic difference between individuals from Canada and the USA, suggesting at least two different sources of introductions of L. lilii in North America. A first episode of introduction took place in Montréal, Canada in the 1940’s while a second introduction occurred in Cambridge, Massachusetts, around 1990. Also, both North American populations seem to originate from different populations in northern Europe, which support the hypothesis of two distinct sources of introduction. Each population next progressed in its respective country following a stratified dispersal. Indeed, continuous progression of the beetle in some regions of North America suggests a pattern of natural dispersion, while human-mediated carrying of infected lilies seemed to be responsible for the long-range movement of the beetle.

962	Étude et caractérisation de détecteurs à liquide en surchauffe	Experimental measurements show that only 4\% of the mass-energy density of the universe is made of atomic matter. Dark matter and dark energy are responsible for 24\% and 71\% of the mass-energy density. The theory of supersymmetry predicts a new set of particles. The neutralino, which is the lightest stable particle, is one of the favorite candidates for dark matter. The Project in Canada to Search for Supersymmetric Objects (PICASSO) seeks dark matter using superheated droplets detectors (SDD). A phase transition occurs when a particle interact with a C$_4$F$_{10}$ droplet and deposits enough energy within a certain critical radius. An acoustic wave is created during this phase transition and piezoelectric sensors transform this acoustic signal into an electrical signal. This signal is then amplified, digitised and recorded for further analysis. In this work is presented a study on superheated droplets detectors aiming in particular at an improvement of the alpha background discrimination. The data acquisition system has been tested in order to check the coupling between the piezoelectric sensors and the acrylic wall of the detector, the efficiency of the amplifier gain of the piezoelectric sensors and the effect of the gain on the quality of the signal. The SIMPLE (Superheated Instrument for Massive ParticLe Experiments) experiment stated that they could obtain a 97\% discrimination of the alpha background using superheated droplets detectors and electric microphones. This work concludes that PICASSO detectors are not sensitive to this effect. Finally, a small droplet detector has been studied and it has been concluded that a small droplets site does not improve the alpha background discrimination.

963	L’analogie juridique dans la Critique de la raison pure	A legal analogy runs through the Critique of Pure Reason, and studying it can shed light on the work. The metaphor of the “tribunal of reason”, first introduced in the Preface, will thus be the starting-point for our analysis. Due to its very nature, this tribunal must be based upon reason’s in-depth self-knowledge – a task to be accomplished over the course of the Critique. The special part played in this regard by the book’s three deductions will be thoroughly examined. In addition, we will see that a deduction itself has more to do with a legally inspired procedure than with an inference, while it nevertheless remains a legitimate philosophical proof. Kant’s frequent legal allusions throughout the text will therefore constitute the basis for our interpretation.

965	La maternité aux âges élevés : une analyse des trajectoires féminines au 18e siècle canadien	This thesis examines the probability that a French Canadian woman born between 1700 and 1749 and married had at least one birth in her forties, taking into account her particular individual profile, family characteristics and historical context.  Our analyses confirm that among the 14,727 Quebec women at risk of pregnancy between the ages of 40 and 49, 62% of them gave birth after the age of 40. Tangible differences are recognized in the probability of bearing children after age 40. Our results suggest a positive association between late maternity and several life course characteristics: a first union between the ages of 20-24 years, a spouse of the same age or younger, a continuous union (non-fractured by the death of a spouse) before and after 40 years, the survival of the previously-born child and a family history where her mother and at least one of her sisters gave birth over the age of 40. In addition, we observe a decrease of the proportion of Quebec women giving birth past 40 over time, especially among female cohorts giving birth after 1765. Furthermore, we found a negative association between an urban place of birth and late maternity. Perhaps the deterioration of general living conditions in the late 18th century, correlated with recurrence of infectious diseases, lack of hygiene and insalubrious environments explains the decreasing chances of giving birth at elevated ages.  Our results attest to the importance of contribution of French Canadian women to the phenomenon of natural fertility at older ages. Our exploratory study also provides useful insights on contemporary late childbearing, currently a hotly debated topic.

966	Of Songwriting and Storytelling as learned through the composition of WAG! The Musical	WAG! The Musical is Aleksey Shegolev's second full-length musical and it is the first to be performed in an off-Broadway theatre in New York during the summer of 2013. The idea for the plot was inspired by William Shakespeare’s Love’s Labour's Lost, and he and his partner, Julian Silverman, created a story fit for modern times. Shegolev was the composer and lyricist, while Silverman was the book writer. Good storytelling and strong songwriting depends on the characters having a goal to pursue as they overcome the obstacles in their paths. As the story progresses, the level of intensity must always rise to keep the audiences’ attention. Jazz and rock ‘n’ roll were the main musical influences on this piece and we will see how rhythm, harmony and texture played a part in creating WAG!. Musicalizing comedy by using various techniques in composition is another topic that will be explored. Finally, this dissertation will close with Shegolev's experiences during the workshop from dealing with the director to the endless revisions and cuts that had to be made before opening night.

967	Utilisation et développement de techniques pharmacocinétiques avancées afin d’améliorer le développement de molécules pharmaceutiques	Despite the scientific and technological breakthroughs that have graced the last century, the path to bringing a drug to the market is fraught with risk and remains an expensive and time-consuming process.  Significant improvements to this process are needed if patients are to continue to benefit from new therapies.  The objective of this thesis is to demonstrate the use of modeling and simulations in this regard.  It will show how advanced pharmacokinetic (PK) techniques can be used to answer critical questions that arise during the drug development process, and that their use can lead to cost and time savings. The first part of this thesis shows how modeling and simulations, including the development of an innovative model, can be used for the relative bioequivalence assessment of a new sodium ferric gluconate complex intravenous formulation.  Compared to traditional methods, this approach did not make inaccurate assumptions about drug characteristics, nor did it necessitate the enrollment of hundreds of subjects.  Thus, this scientifically robust approach was associated with significant financial savings and economy of time.  Although this research was conducted within the generic drug development, it could also be applied to innovator or biosimilar drug development. The second section illustrates the use of modeling and simulations in the development of an innovative biological therapeutic agent, pegloticase.  This approach allowed us to answer important questions pertaining to the factors influencing pegloticase’s PK and pharmacodynamics (PD), confirming that no special dosing adjustments were required, thus contributing to the official product labeling.  These questions were answered without conducting additional trials or performing supplementary assessments on patients, which resulted in significant cost and time savings.  In the future, such PK/PD models could be used to better understand other biological agents, including their immunogenicity profiles which remain a concern for clinicians. The third part of this thesis focuses on the use of modeling and simulations to select optimal dosing regimens for the Phase 2 study of the novel antibiotic TP-434.  A PK model for TP-434 was developed with Phase 1 data.  This model was continuously updated and confirmed as new Phase 1 data became available, similar to the approach advocated by Sheiner’s learn and confirm paradigm.  Based on simulations performed with this model, and knowledge of PK/PD relationships for another compound, Phase 2 dosing regimens were recommended that were likely to show efficacy in the patient population.  This rational approach to dose selection ensured that patients were not needlessly exposed to the drug, and that efficacy would likely be demonstrated in Phase 2.  Consequently, it was unnecessary to dose additional cohorts or conduct additional trials, which would have lengthened the process and been expensive.  Moreover, this was the first published account of Phase 2 dose regimen selection based solely on simulated Phase 1 data for an antimicrobial drug.   In summary, the research presented in this thesis illustrates how advanced pharmacokinetic techniques like modeling and simulations, including the creation of innovative models, can efficiently answer key drug development questions, leading to significant cost and time savings.	population modeling , pharmacokinetics , pharmacodynamics , drug development	en	11440.0
968	Regards des praticiens en design industriel sur les dimensions identitaires de la pratique du design au Québec	The following research examines societal changes that have emerged as the result of the negotiation between global and local influences on the profession of industrial design in Quebec. The study attempts to articulate these changes by analyzing theories and processes of identity and globalization. By reviewing current literature on the socio-cultural, political and economic dimensions of design, we will complete a portrait and highlight the complexities of the current state of industrial design in the province. Through qualitative interviews of nine practicing designers, divided into three generations, we will present an actual overview of the practice of industrial design in Quebec. In doing so, we will investigate the multidimensional aspects of their practice as well as explore their professional community and the value systems that influence their actions. This will provide a critique from the designers perspective of their practice, as well as their view of the future of design in Quebec.

969	Baby-boom, baby-bust and the Great Depression	The baby-boom and subsequent baby-bust have shaped much of the history of the second half of the 20th century; yet it is still largely unclear what caused them. This paper presents a new unified explanation of the fertility Boom-Bust that links the latter to the Great Depression and the subsequent economic recovery. We show that the 1929 Crash attracted young married women 20 to 34 years old in 1930 (whom we name D-cohort) in the labor market possibly via an added worker effect. Using several years of Census micro data, we further document that the same cohort kept entering into the market in the 1940s and 1950s as economic conditions improved, decreasing wages and reducing work incentives for younger women. Its retirement in the late 1950s and in the 1960s instead freed positions and created employment opportunities. Finally, we show that the entry of the D-cohort is associated with increased births in the 1950s, while its retirement turned the fertility Boom into a Bust in the 1960s. The work behavior of this cohort explains a large share of the changes in both yearly births and completed fertility of all cohorts involved.

970	La formine Diaphanous est essentielle pour l’organisation et la maturation de l’anneau contractile pendant la cytokinèse	Cytokinesis is the intricate process by which eukaryotic cells divide in two. It involves the coordination of many components in order to avoid the formation potentially cancerous cells. Initially, a Rho GTPase- and actomyosin-dependent contractile ring (CR) drives constriction at the cell equator until a stable actin-independent midbody ring (MR) forms and ultimately guides the separation of the two sister cells. Diaphanous (Dia), is a Rho-dependent formin that nucleates unbranched actin filaments, localises to the cleavage furrow and is required for cytokinesis. We have examined the role of Dia during cytokinesis by time lapse video microscopy of Drosophila S2 cells expressing markers tagged with fluorescent proteins (FPs). A functional Dia-FP was recruited to the CR independently of actin and stayed in the nascent MR, but was absent from the mature MR. The timing of its disappearance coincided with the transition of the MR to an actin-independent structure. RNAi-mediated depletion of Dia slowed furrow ingression, enhanced furrow oscillations and, in 70% of the failures, prevented furrow completion, consistent with a role for Dia in CR organization. The F-actin probe, LifeAct-FP, revealed a decrease in F-actin in Dia-depleted cells specifically at the CR while Anillin-FP and Myosin-FP were aberrantly recruited in punctate structures. Our findings are consistent with a model in which Dia nucleates actin filaments at the CR to maintain the dynamic organization of the actin-dependent CR and that the regulated loss of Dia from the nascent MR guides the formation of the stable, actin-independent MR.

971	Role Clarification Processes for Better Integration of Nurse Practitioners into Primary Healthcare Teams: A Multiple-Case Study	Role clarity is a crucial issue for effective interprofessional collaboration. Poorly defined roles can become a source of conflict in clinical teams and reduce the effectiveness of care and services delivered to the population. Our objective in this paper is to outline processes for clarifying professional roles when a new role is introduced into clinical teams, that of the primary healthcare nurse practitioner (PHCNP). To support our empirical analysis we used the Canadian National Interprofessional Competency Framework, which defines the essential components for role clarification among professionals. A qualitative multiple-case study was conducted on six cases in which the PHCNP role was introduced into primary care teams. Data collection included 34 semistructured interviews with key informants involved in the implementation of the PHCNP role. Our results revealed that the best performing primary care teams were those that used a variety of organizational and individual strategies to carry out role clarification processes. From this study, we conclude that role clarification is both an organizational process to be developed and a competency that each member of the primary care team must mobilize to ensure effective interprofessional collaboration.

972	La méthadone permet-elle de sortir du monde de la drogue? : points de vue de personnes inscrites aux programmes de substitution	Two paradigms are frequent when treating addiction in Quebec. First, there is the paradigm of abstinence with an intervention model often based on Alcoholics Anonymous. With this model, alcoholism (or addiction) is defined as a disease. The second paradigm, harm reduction, is aimed to reduce the harmful effects of drug use rather than eliminating their use (Brisson, 1997). We are particularly interested in an intervention found in this paradigm named methadone maintenance treatment. This research was aimed to identify the perceptions of people enrolled in this treatment, understand their recovery process while participation in this treatment and understanding the perceptions of users of methadone in regards to the consequences of addiction. A theoretical framework found in the symbolic interactionist perspective was selected. More specifically, the process of normative transformations of Maria Caiata Zufferey, the labelling theory of Howard Becker and the stigma theory of Erving Goffman were selected. A qualitative methodology was retained. Ten semi-structured interviews with men and women enrolled in a methadone maintenance treatment were conducted. The chapter that focussed on the results highlighted various reports on how methadone maintenance treatment was experienced by the participants. To do this, three figures constructed using typology analysis were developed. For some people, methadone was described as a necessary substitute, for others, it corresponded to a help that they wanted to eliminate and for a minority, it aroused ambivalence. One thing is certain, although the substitution remains the treatment of choice for opioid dependence, it is difficult to speak of the output of the drug world with the help of methadone because this treatment appears to be almost as stigmatized as the dependence on heroine (Lauzon, 2011). At first glance, the use of methadone can help distance a person from the world of drugs (easy money, theft, prostitution) and can help rebuild their lives on a basis of landmark stability, but to carefully consider, it confines the respondents in a state of ambivalence as it relates to the identity of an addict.

973	Modèle de confiance et ontologie probabiliste pilotés par réseaux bayésiens pour la gestion des accords de services dans l’environnement de services infonuagiques	Cloud Computing is a new paradigm of IT on-demand services which has experienced tremendous growth over the past decade. The provider of Cloud computing services   describes the service to be provided, its cost, and penalties for service violations within a document. This document is called Service Level Agreement (SLA). The signature of this contract by the customer and the provider guarantees the quality of service received by the customer. It also entails the provider to manage its resources efficiently to meet its commitments. Unfortunately, the SLA violation is common; it is usually caused by uncertainty about customer behavior that can make variable number of requests assuming that resources are boundless. This behavior may have an impact on the availability of the service, thus its related SLA. Repeated SLA violations will definitively have an impact on the trust level that the customer has about the provider that might no longer enjoys a good reputation in meeting its commitments. To cope with these problems, we have proposed a Framework driven by a Bayesian network that allows, first, to classify the suppliers in a Cloud directory according to their trust level. This directory can be managed by a third party entity, in which a client will choose a provider before starting SLA negotiation. Secondly, we have developed a probabilistic ontology, based on a Multi-Entity Bayesian network, which takes into account uncertainty, in the customer behavior, and makes predictions by inference; these predictions help preventing SLA violations based on historical data.. The results show the effectiveness of the probabilistic ontology for the prediction of SLA violations in a Cloud Computing environment.

974	Le rôle de la qualité alimentaire dans la prévention du déclin de l’autonomie fonctionnelle chez les personnes âgées atteintes du diabète type II faisant partie de la cohorte NuAge	The population is aging, and aging increases the risk of muscle strength (MS) loss, type II diabetes (T2D), and decline in functional capacity (FC). Independent of aging, diabetic older adults (OA) are at increased risk of MS loss and FC decline compared to their non-diabetic counterparts. Nutrition is a determinant of optimal aging, and is important in managing diabetes, and preventing, or at least slowing, the rate of development of diabetes complications; it also minimizes MS losses and finally, modulates decline in FC. In addition, physical activity (PA) offers benefits similar to those conferred by nutrition. Therefore, the main objective of this thesis is to determine the role of diet quality (DQ) in FC maintenance in community-dwelling diabetic OA in secondary analyses of the NuAge cohort database. In order to achieve this objective, characterization of several variables associated with FC was necessary. Thus, a descriptive analysis of the diet of these diabetic older adults was undertaken as our first objective. Then, the three articles are presented, each testing a specific objective in these diabetic OA, to: 1) determine if DQ alone, or combined with PA, is associated with MS maintenance; 2) determine if DQ alone, or combined with PA is associated with prevention of FC decline; and 3) examine the association between adequate protein and energy intakes and MS and FC maintenance. In addition, the association between DQ, PA and physical performance (PP) was studied. This doctoral thesis is the first to study the role of DQ on FC in diabetic OA. The results have demonstrated that diabetic OA in the NuAge cohort have a good diet overall and good dietary habits, and macronutrient intakes that meet nutrition recommendations. Nevertheless, these participants should increase their micronutrient intakes since the majority did not meet recommendations. Moreover, DQ alone was not associated with MS, PP or FC declines over the three year follow-up. However, DQ combined with PA showed associations with upper body MS. Specifically, good DQ combined with maintenance of PA over follow-up was associated with minimal MS losses in diabetic older men compared to others. However, no significant results were found for lower body MS in either males or females. Furthermore, DQ combined with PA was not associated with either PP or FC in these participants. Finally, our results have shown that adequate energy and protein intakes are associated with FC maintenance. In fact, diabetic older men with energy intakes of 30 kcal or greater/kg body weight experienced lesser declines in FC compared to those having inadequate energy intakes, while diabetic older women with protein intakes of 1g or more/kg body weight had minimal declines in FC compared to those with inadequate protein intakes. Finally, we have shown that adequate protein intakes minimized lower body MS losses in diabetic women in the NuAge cohort.  Taken together, the results of this thesis provide evidence that good DQ, adequate energy and protein intakes and the practice of PA are all factors that can minimize MS losses related to aging and accelerated by T2D, and hence maintain FC in diabetic OA. Nevertheless, further research is needed to confirm these results.

975	L'espace sacrificiel féminin dans le cinéma de Lars von Trier	In all eras, they have been immolated in faith and love. In all civilizations, the need to honor God was expressed by the voice of violence and blood, the need to be purified from the sin and to be protected against the supernatural forces, was manifested through the sacrifice. This theme of sacrifice has spread from the creation of the world until today, it embodies and performs conflicts and oppositions between life and death, God and the devil.  The sacred writings rarely tell us about the role of women in ancient civilizations. The greatest sacrifices were generally associated to free men. In Christian religions, these sacrificed men borrow the footsteps of Christ and obey God's request, while women, the fallen slaves, are always associated to the original sin.   This research studies the female sacrificial space and the female figure in the cinema of Lars von Trier (especially in Melancholia (2011) Antichrist (2009), Dogville (2003), Dancer in the Dark (2000) and Breaking the Waves (1996)). This sacrificial space is analyzed through a hermeneutic reading of sacred books, especially the Bible in its Old and New Testament.  Important issues related to religious, mythological and cinematographic aspects are investigated to understand the spiritual, provocative, mythological, iconological and religious dimension of these women who sacrifice themselves in these films. We propose in this research to observe the evolution of the female figure from the slave to the master status, from the image of the Christ to the devil, while opposing sacrifice to justice. We intend to demonstrate that Lars von Trier has built with his cinema and the representation of the female body, as dead, tortured and hysterical, a true sacrificial mental and virtual space that saturates the film frame. The body of this woman breaks down, sacrifices itself, dies and reborns in another body, an idea, and a biblical figure in a sacrificial space that poses her as an example, as the Christ image.    This theoretical analysis of the female sacrificial figure is also undertaken through the creation of an experimental and hybrid film. Images from art history, other from the world of von Trier are revisited with an intertextual approach. She is Lars is a personal exploration of the theme of the sacrifice as well as an homage to the cinema of Lars von Trier.

Methods: The association between the use of hormonal contraceptive and the risk of acquiring HIV-1 was evaluated using Cox proportionnal models. Relative risks of exposed women were estimated using as a reference group the women who do not use hormonal contraceptives. In addition, a multivariate Cox model was used to control for potentially confounding factors. Results: Injectable contraceptives were used by 52.1 % of women, while oral contraceptives were used by 20.7% of them. During the study, there were 192 seroconversions. The observed HIV-1 incidence was 2.28, 4.19 and 4.69 per 100 woman-years for oral, injectable and non-hormonal contraceptive users, respectively. In multivariate analysis, we found no significant association between the use of hormonal contraceptives and HIV-1 acquisition. The adjusted relative risk (aRR) for oral contraceptives was 0.573 (95% CI: [0.31 to 1.06]) and 0.981 (95% CI: [0.69, 1.39]) for injectable contraceptives. Conclusions: Although this study did not demonstrate an association between hormonal contraceptive use and the risk of HIV-1 infection, we conclude, however, that these methods of contraception do not protect against HIV-1, and it is thus recommended that women using contraceptive hormones always use condoms to prevent HIV-1.

977	Dynamique végétale récente du complexe tourbeux des Tourbières-de-Lanoraie (Québec)	Worldwide, wetlands are among the most threatened ecosystems by human exploitation, drainage and climate changes. In a conservation perspective, understanding the processes throughout a temporal perspective is an important issue. In this master, I aimed (1) to describe the dynamics of vegetation communities in two bogs of the Tourbières-de-Lanoraie wetland complex during the last three millennia and (2) to determine the impacts of human disturbances on that dynamics on the last 500 years. To achieve this objective, I used a multiproxy paleoecological approach. Vegetation dynamics was similar in the two studied sites. After an ombrotrophication of the wetland, the open bog with Sphagnum and Ericaceae became gradually a forested bog. The transition from minerotrophic to ombrotrophic conditions happened before the Little Ice Age (1570-1850 AD) when climatic conditions were relatively cooler and drier. The forested stage developed much later, at the beginning of the XXth century. Human activities seem to have triggered the shift. Indeed many disturbances like drainage increased during the last century. This study shows that human disturbances are the main drivers of recent vegetation dynamics over the two studied bogs.

978	Guider la pratique et la formation éthique des professionnels de la santé : établir les fondements du modèle de la déontologie réflexive (MDR)	If the competency approach seems to be particularly valorised in Canada and in the United States for orienting the practice of health care professionals (HCP) – and in clinical bioethics – material that could provide with a better understanding of the psychological, ontological and philosophical foundations of these competencies seems rather limited in the bioethical literature. The tools that are generally available can be divided into four main categories: 1) official documents (e.g., code of ethics, institutional policies); 2) the main ethical theories (e.g., virtue ethics, theories of justice, principlism); 3) scientific references (e.g., journals, books); 4) decision-making tools. These documents are important for bioethicists and HCPs, but their disparities and even contradictions, coupled with poor knowledge in professional ethics, may be a significant source of confusion in the decision making process and even lead to behaviour that does not meet the ethical standards of HCP. This thesis is an upstream reflection regarding these tools, whose pragmatic character has the disadvantage of simplifying theoretical reflection at the benefit of more concrete evidence useful for practical decision making. This project aims at developing the foundations for a flexible and inclusive model – a model of deontological reflexivity (MDR) – that will: 1) present the main philosophical, psychological, sociological and deontological landmarks characterising ethical issues encountered in practice; 2) understand, from a psychological and developmental perspective, the personal and professional requirements inherent to the status of the health care professional in the current context of health care. A theoretical enterprise, this project primarily consists in relating, in a dynamic manner, a variety of dimensions (legal, ethical, clinical, psychological) at work in complex ethical situations encountered by HCPs and bioethicists, inspired by the concept of ethical sensitivity, the “petite éthique” of Paul Ricoeur (1990), the self theory along with Blasi's Identity modes (Blasi, 1993). The analysis process will consist in three successive phases: 1) a putting into perspective of the bioethicist's and HCPs’ epistemological posture in light of the “petite éthique” of Paul Ricoeur (1990); 2) an interdisciplinary literature review of “ethical sensitivity” in order to propose a definition of the concept and place it into perspective with other ethical competencies; 3) the development of a framework regarding professional ethics iv and identity (professional ethics identity tendencies, PEIT), inspired both by the self theory and Blasi's Identity modes. These PEITs provide a normative benchmark related to the construction of identity in the health care context and suggest some innovative avenues for professional ethics research and education. This research wish to elaborate the theoretical foundations that will be utilised further in the future to develop the model of deontological reflexivity (MDR).

979	Meta-heuristic Solution Methods for Rich Vehicle Routing Problems	For more than half of century, since the paper of Dantzig and Ramser (1959)  was introduced, the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) has been one of the most extensively studied problems in operations research due to its methodological interest and practical relevance in many fields such as transportation, logistics, telecommunications, and production. The general goal of the VRP is to optimize the use of transportation resources to service customers with respect to side-constraints deriving from real-world applications.  The practical applications of the VRP may have a variety of constraints, and obviously, the larger the set of constraints that need to be considered, i.e., corresponding to `richer' VRPs, the more difficult the task of problem solving. The needs to study closer representations of actual applications and methodologies producing high-quality solutions quickly to larger-sized application problems have increased steadily, providing significant challenges for the VRP research community. This dissertation explores these extensional issues of the VRP.  The first part of the dissertation addresses the Periodic Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (PVRPTW) which generalizes the classical Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW) by extending the planning horizon to several days where customers generally do not require delivery on every day, but rather according to one of a limited number of possible combinations of visit days. This generalization extends the scope of applications to many commercial distribution activities such as waste collection, street sweeping, grocery distribution, mail delivery, etc. The major contribution of this part is the development of a population-based hybrid meta-heuristic in which a set of local search procedures and neighborhood-based meta-heuristics cooperate with the genetic algorithm population evolution mechanism to enhance the solution quality as well as to promote diversity of the genetic algorithm population. The results show that the proposed methodology is highly competitive, providing new best solutions in some large instances.  The second part of the dissertation aims to present, model and solve two rich vehicle routing problems which further extend the VRPTW with time-dependent demands of pickup and delivery, and hard time synchronization restrictions. They are called Time-dependent Multi-zone Multi-Trip Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (TMZT-VRPTW), and Multi-zone Mult-Trip Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows and Synchronization (MZT-PDTWS), respectively. These two problems originate from planning the operations of two-tiered City Logistics systems. The difficulty of these problems lies in handling two intertwined sets of decisions: the routing component which aims to determine the sequences of customers visited by each vehicle, and the scheduling component which consists in planning arrivals of vehicles at facilities within hard time synchronization restrictions. Previously, these issues have been addressed separately. Combining these decisions into one formulation and solution method should yield better results. In this dissertation we propose meta-heuristics that address the two decisions simultaneously, in a comprehensive and efficient way. Experiments confirm the good performance of the proposed methodology compared to the literature, providing system managers with solution requiring less vehicles and travel costs to perform efficiently the same amount of work. In the context of City Logistics systems, our results indicate a reduction in the presence of vehicles on the streets of the city and, thus, in their negative impact on congestion and environment.

980	Disclosure of Child Sexual Abuse : Impact of Interviewers’ Attitudes & Children's Collaboration during Forensic Interviews	Child Sexual Abuse (CSA) is a complex subject to investigate and an alleged victim’s disclosure is crucial as it may be the only substantial evidence for investigators to establish their case.  However, even when CSA is revealed, children may be reluctant to reveal personal and often embarrassing details to a stranger during a forensic interview.  As it is not always possible to obtain consent to film and it is relatively hard to measure children’s and interviewers’ non-verbal attitudes during forensic interviews, this doctoral dissertation was innovative in its creation of verbal scales of such attitudes.  In order to determine whether interviewers’ attitudes correlates with children’s collaboration during forensic interviews, 90 children ranging from 4 to 13 years of age were analysed. Interviews were audio taped, transcribed and then codified using verbal subscales of interviewers’ supportive and non-supportive attitudes as well as children's cooperative and reluctant attitudes. The proportion of details provided by the children in regards to the SA was calculated.      To determine if differences exist between National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Protocol and Non-Protocol interviews, a MANCOVA was conducted controlling for children’s age and the proportion of open-ended questions. As expected Protocol interviews obtained significantly more details from open-ended prompts than Non-Protocol interviews. However, it showed no differences according to children’s and interviewer’s attitudes. To find the variable that has the greatest impact on the quantity of detail disclosed by children, a hierarchical multiple regression analysis was conducted. After controlling for children’s age, NICHD Protocol and proportion of open-ended questions which are known to increase the quantity of details disclosed; children’s reluctance and interviewers’ non-supportive attitudes contributed to an additional 28% of the variance, when the total variance explained by the model as a whole was 58%.   Moreover, to determine whether children’s collaboration and interviewers’ attitudes vary according to the child’s age-group a MANOVA was conducted. It revealed that interviewers behaved similarly irrespective of children’s age, even though younger children were generally more reluctant and cooperated significantly less than pre-adolescents.  Finally, to determine which variables regarding child and SA characteristics, as well as interviewers’ attitudes, will have a greater chance at predicting children’s collaboration, a hierarchical multiple regression analysis was conducted. It showed that an interviewer’s support was a stronger correlating variable than children’s and SA characteristics in predicting children’s collaboration.            While we believe that the development of the NICHD Protocol has enabled considerable progress in the way children are interviewed leading to more details obtained from free recall strategies, and thus leading to more credible testimonies.  However, adherence to the Protocol is simply not sufficient to convince young reluctant children to talk in details about the SA to a stranger.  This dissertation results have great scientific value as it enhances the theoretical underpinnings of the attitudes expressed by both the child and the interviewer during forensic interviews.  Although, interviewers in this study did offer more support to reluctant children, regardless of their age, researchers need to find better ways to deal with young children’s reluctance as well as encourage practitioners to minimize non-supportive attitudes.	non-soutien , child sexual abuse , forensic interviews , NICHD protocol , age , reluctance , support , non-support , cooperation , sexual abuse characteristics , child characteristics	en	11196.0
981	Domain/Multi-Domain Protection and Provisioning in Optical Networks	Recent developments in the wavelength selective switch (WSS) technology enable multi-degree reconfigurable optical add/drop multiplexers (ROADM) architectures with colorless and directionless switching, which is regarded as a very promising enabler for future reconfigurable wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) mesh networks. However, its asymmetric switching property complicates the optimal routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) problem, which is NP-hard. Most of the existing RWA algorithms do not consider such property. Disruption of services through equipment failures on the lightpaths (output of RWA problem) is consequential as it involves the lost of large amounts of data. Therefore, substantial research efforts are needed to ensure the functional survivability of optical networks, i.e., the continuation of services even when equipment failures occur. Most previous publications have focused on using a protection scheme to guarantee the traffic connections in the event of single link failures. However, protection design against single link failures turns out not to be always sufficient to keep the WDM networks away from many downtime cases as other kinds of failures, such as node failures, dual link failures, triple link failures, etc., become common nowadays. Furthermore, there are challenges to protect large multi-domain optical networks which are composed of several singledomain networks, interconnected by inter-domain links, where the internal topological details of a domain are usually not shared externally. The objective of this thesis is to propose scalable models and solution methods for the above problems. The models enable to approach large problem instances while producing optimal or near optimal solutions with mathematically proven optimality gaps. For this, we rely on the column generation technique which is suitable to solve large scale linear programming problems. For the provisioning problem in optical networks, we propose a new ILP (Integer Linear Programming) model for RWA problem with the objective of maximizing the Grade of Service (GoS). The resulting model is a large scale optimization ILP model, which allows the exact solution of quite large RWA instances, assuming all nodes are asymmetric and with a given switching connectivity matrix. Next, we modify the model and propose a solution for the RWA problem with the objective of finding the best switching connectivity matrix for a given number of ports and a given number of switching connections, while satisfying/maximizing the GoS. For protection in single domain networks, we propose solutions for the protection against multiple failures. Indeed, we extent the protection of a single domain network against multiple failures, using FIPP and FDPP p-cycles. We propose a new generic flow formulation for FDPP p-cycles subject to multiple failures. Our new model ends up with a complex pricing problem, which has an exponential number of constraints due to some subtour elimination constraints. Consequently, in order to efficiently solve the pricing problem, we consider: (i) a hierarchical decomposition of the original pricing problem; (ii) heuristics in order to go around the large number of constraints in the pricing problem. For protection in multi-domain networks, we propose protection schemes against single link failures. Firstly, we propose an optimization model for a centralized protection scheme, assuming that the network management is aware of all the details of the physical topologies of the domains. We then propose a distributed optimization model for protection in multi-domain optical networks, a much more realistic formulation as it is based on the assumption of a distributed network management. Then, we add bandwidth sharing in order to reduce the cost of protection. Bandwidth of each intra-domain link is shared among FIPP p-cycles and p-cycles in a first study, and then among paths for link/path protection in a second study. Finally, we propose parallel strategies in order to obtain solutions for very large multi-domain optical networks. The result of this last study allows the efficent design of a protection scheme for a very large multi-domain network (45 domains), the largest one by far considered in the literature, both with a centralized and distributed scheme.

982	Vers des assemblages de complexes métalliques oligonucléaires, servant d’antenne solaire au niveau moléculaire	This research project involves synthetic metallosupramolecular systems developed to mimic the natural process of photosynthesis. Ideally, these systems would be able to provide the energy and the charge separation needed to catalyze multielectron-transfer reactions, such as water-splitting or carbon dioxide reduction. The realization of such a catalytic system would create a renewable energy source, in the form of chemical energy, created directly from solar energy. The system envisioned has three distinct parts in the form of an antenna. First of all, chromophores go into an excited state, while capturing the visible light energy of the Sun. Then comes a hub which binds all the chromophores and collects this excited state energy through an electron transfer. This electron is then transferred again to the last part, a catalytic reaction center. This assembly creates a charge separation between the chromophore and the reaction center which are separated by the hub, thus avoiding the recombination of charge. The project focuses on the synthesis, characterization and application in photocatalysis of chromophore-hub-catalyst assemblies. First of all, a study of fluorene and rhenium based chromophores was made to assess the electronic transfer between these two components. Then, tetraamidinate rhodium dimer based hubs have been created and studied in order to establish their photophysical and electrochemical characteristics. Then one of these assemblies was formed with chromophores of rhenium, thus creating discrete molecular species containing one to four chromophores. And finally, these assemblies were combined with a cobalt-based catalyst and were tested for hydrogen photoproduction. The latter required the development of a photoreactor which is also described in detail in this thesis.	chromophore , transfert de charge , rhodium , cobalt , rhenium , charge transfer , isomerization , Suzuki coupling , photophysics , electrochemistry , density functional theory , Hammett parameter , Taft parameters , solvatochromism , hydrogen , photocatalysis , gas phase chromatography	en	11182.0
983	Modeling High-Dimensional Audio Sequences with Recurrent Neural Networks	This thesis studies models of high-dimensional sequences based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and their application to music and speech. While in principle RNNs can represent the long-term dependencies and complex temporal dynamics present in real-world sequences such as video, audio and natural language, they have not been used to their full potential since their introduction by Rumelhart et al. (1986a) due to the difficulty to train them efficiently by gradient-based optimization. In recent years, the successful application of Hessian-free optimization and other advanced training techniques motivated an increase of their use in many state-of-the-art systems. The work of this thesis is part of this development.   The main idea is to exploit the power of RNNs to learn a probabilistic description of sequences of symbols, i.e. high-level information associated with observed signals, that in turn can be used as a prior to improve the accuracy of information retrieval. For example, by modeling the evolution of note patterns in polyphonic music, chords in a harmonic progression, phones in a spoken utterance, or individual sources in an audio mixture, we can improve significantly the accuracy of polyphonic transcription, chord recognition, speech recognition and audio source separation respectively. The practical application of our models to these tasks is detailed in the last four articles presented in this thesis.   In the first article, we replace the output layer of an RNN with conditional restricted Boltzmann machines to describe much richer multimodal output distributions. In the second article, we review and develop advanced techniques to train RNNs. In the last four articles, we explore various ways to combine our symbolic models with deep networks and non-negative matrix factorization algorithms, namely using products of experts, input/output architectures, and generative frameworks that generalize hidden Markov models. We also propose and analyze efficient inference procedures for those models, such as greedy chronological search, high-dimensional beam search, dynamic programming-like pruned beam search and gradient descent. Finally, we explore issues such as label bias, teacher forcing, temporal smoothing, regularization and pre-training.

984	Caractérisation de la voie de signalisation du récepteur des minéralocorticoïdes dans le rein foetal suite à une restriction de croissance intrautérine	Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) contributes to the development of diseases in adulthood, of which some are influenced by sex. Our laboratory has developed an IUGR model in the rat by administering a low-sodium diet during the last third of gestation which leads to a reduced volume expansion and uteroplacental perfusion. Plasma renin activity (PRA) and aldosterone concentration are increased in IUGR dams and foetuses. Previously, our laboratory has shown that gene and protein expression of Na+-K+-ATPase-α1 was increased solely in female IUGR kidneys. Therefore, we hypothesize that the reduced maternal volume will result in an increase and differential expression, influenced by foetal sex, of elements from the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) pathway. Gene expression is determined by qRT-PCR and for protein, Western blotting is performed. Although results show that gene expression of SGK1, α-ENaC and GILZ is increased in IUGR foetal kidneys, protein expression for SGK1, pSGK1 (Thr256), and α-ENaC is similar to controls. GILZ protein is not detected. For CNKSR3, no difference in mRNA or protein expression is observed between the groups. Gene expression of MR is unchanged, while its protein expression is decreased in IUGR foetuses. In conclusion, the increase in plasma aldosterone in IUGR foetuses stimulates gene transcription of several components of the sodium reabsorption pathway without affecting protein expression. These results suggest that there may be post-transcriptional regulation or a higher protein turnover. Despite the importance of biological sex in the development of disease, it did not affect the expression of elements from the sodium reabsorption pathway in the foetus. It would be important to verify this same pathway in animals of different ages to correlate gene and protein expression with the appearance of diseases.

985	Le problème de Coulomb-Dunkl dans le plan	This master's thesis, composed of an article in collaboration with Luc Vinet and Vincent X. Genest, is the result of a work done on superintegrable quantum systems defined by Hamiltonians of the Dunkl kind. More specifically, the aim of this paper is to analyse the Coulomb-Dunkl problem in the plane which is a generalization of the quantum system of hydrogen involving operators of reflection on the variables x and y. The model is defined by a potential in 1/r. First, we notice that the Hamiltonian is separable in polar coordinates and the wave functions are written in terms of products of generalized Laguerre polynomials and Dunkl harmonics on the circle. The algebra generated by the symmetry operators has also allowed us to confirm the maximally superintegrable character of the Coulomb-Dunkl problem. We also write explicitly the representations of the same algebra. We finally found the energy spectrum algebraically.

986	Special functions of Weyl groups and their continuous and discrete orthogonality	This thesis presents several properties and applications of four families of Weyl group orbit functions called $C$-, $S$-, $S^s$- and $S^l$-functions. These functions may be viewed as generalizations of the well-known Chebyshev polynomials. They are related to orthogonal polynomials associated with simple Lie algebras, e.g. the multivariate Jacobi and Macdonald polynomials. They have numerous remarkable properties such as continuous and discrete orthogonality. In particular, it is shown that the $S^s$- and $S^l$-functions characterized by certain parameters are mutually orthogonal with respect to a discrete measure. Their discrete orthogonality allows to deduce two types of Fourier-like discrete transforms for each simple Lie algebra with two different lengths of roots. Similarly to the Chebyshev polynomials, these four families of functions have applications in numerical integration. We obtain in this thesis various cubature formulas, for functions of several variables, arising from $C$-, $S^s$- and $S^l$-functions. We also provide a~complete description of discrete multivariate cosine transforms of types V--VIII involving the Weyl group orbit functions arising from simple Lie algebras $C_n$ and $B_n$, called antisymmetric and symmetric cosine functions. Furthermore, we study four families of multivariate Chebyshev-like orthogonal polynomials introduced via (anti)symmetric cosine functions.

987	Décisions et perspectives : de la théorie de l'utilité à la philosophie de la volonté	The philosophical implications of Prospect Theory (1979), notably those concerning the introduction of a value function on outcomes as well as a weighting function on probabilities, have not been explored until now. The goal of this thesis is to construct a philosophical theory of the will based on the results of Prospect Theory. In order to understand how Prospect Theory was arrived at, it is necessary to study the Theory of Expected Utility of which it is the critical culmination, in particular the mathematical treatments of decision and utility by Ramsey (1926), von Neumann & Morgenstern (1947), and Savage (1954), which together constitute the foundations of classical decision theory. It was primarily the critique – from economics and cognitive psychology – of the axiom of independence, the ordering axiom and the transitivity axiom that gave rise to the subjective representational elements on the basis of which Prospect Theory was elaborated. These criticisms were made by Allais (1953), Edwards (1954), Ellsberg (1961), and Slovic & Lichtenstein (1968); studying their articles will elucidate how the transition from Expected Utility Theory to Prospect Theory occurred. Following these analyses, the concept of a Decisional Frame of Reference is introduced, which is the natural generalization of Prospect Theory’s concepts of a value function and a weighting function. This system, whose function is sometimes heuristic, serves to model decision-making in the element of representation, and consists of three phases: decisional scope, edition, and evaluation. Based on this structure a philosophical theory is proposed, including a new typology of decisions and an original explanation of the phenomena of weakness of will (akrasia) and of procrastination founded on the concepts of risk aversion and present overweighting, both of which stem from Prospect Theory.

988	Feu, suivi de Sophie Calle : soi en négatif	Feu is an autofictional photo-text collection in which I revisited memories from a past relationship after a fire destroyed everything. Among a serie of short episodes, I tried to transmit the different emotions felt while mourning and to show my obsession for both the fire and my ex companion. I kept turning over souvenirs in a self-centered way until it lead to a deep emotional uneasiness. It started resorbing the moment an opening to others was made, but never ended. Pictures are used to illustrate the words as well as to participate in the exposure of loneliness.  In addition to a few sub-headings relating my project to Sophie Calle’s work, I tempted to recuperate some of her characteristic traits. Sophie Calle: Soi en négatif is an essay about the self-performance. It involves an autobiographic contract between the performer and the public, a network of intertextuality and in this case, specific concepts like otherness, mourning and absence. I tried to show how she managed to expose herself by the negative. Not only does she take advantage of the most painful negative moments of her life and the ones of others, but she also reveals herself only through documents or others. In a way, her words and her photos develop her life contained into her personal archives. When she exposes herself, art blows way beyond literature, cinema, interviews and photography to because a self-performance, in negative.

989	Le caractère adéquat du contenu de l'échelle de mesure de la conscience de l'environnement d'affaires	This paper’s main subject focuses on employee business awareness. The concept refers to the importance of considering various elements of the business environment, by the non-managerial employee, in order to make better business decisions or improve problem-solving in an environment using a participative approach to management. There are only two theses and one published article dedicated to the concept of employee business awareness. Ève St-Onge’s thesis (2007) tried to establish the concept’s legitimacy and to produce a first list of indicators related to elements of the business environment. Véronique Gauvreau-Jean’s thesis (2008) seeked to validate a first version of the employee business awareness scale. Haines, Rousseau, Brotheridge and St-Onge (2012) provided a list of indicators and dimensions related to the scale. This thesis is interested in verifying the content adequacy of the initial scale. Content adequacy «essentially consists in verifying the content of the test so that it can be representative and a sample of the behaviours that have to be measured» (Anastasi, 1982, p.132). Given the complexity of the concept of employee business awareness, this type of verification is needed to bring the right adjustments to the current scale so that it can later be applied to all business environments using a participative approach. In order to verify the content adequacy of the initial scale, two focus groups were held; one within a personnel placement agency and another in a paper product distributor. With the contents of both focus groups transcribed, data analysis was performed and a reformulated scale was created. The new scale received favourable assessments from two professors concerning its capacity to be easily understood and with regards to the adequate reflection of the elements related to the business environment. This finally led to the comparison of the reformulated scale’s content with the initial scale, in order to determiner the content adequacy of the existing scale’s content.	awareness , business environment , scale , validity	en	11110.0
990	Une étude sur l’effet médiateur du conflit travail-famille entre les conditions de l’organisation du travail et les symptômes dépressifs	The main objective of this master’s thesis is to advance the state of knowledge in social explanations of mental health problems in the workforce. It focuses on the mediating effect of work-family conflict in a causal sequence between the conditions of work organization and the development of depressive symptoms. The statistical analyses required for this study were performed using data from the SALVEO’s survey on determinants of mental health in the Canadian population. Multilevel path analysis supported that work-family conflict relate significantly with more depressive symptoms. However, the results did not suggest that work-family conflict fully mediated the relation between work organization conditions and depressive symptoms. Nevertheless, in an exploratory approach, some associations between the work organization conditions and depressive symptoms were completely mediated, some were partially mediated and some were only associated with depressive symptoms. Psychological demands, hours worked, work schedule, coworkers support and professional income were fully mediated by work-family conflict. Furthermore, work-family conflict partially mediated the relationship between job insecurity and depressive symptoms. Part of the effect of job insecurity was direct, while part of the effect was indirect through work-family conflicts. Therefore, these findings suggest that future researches and organizational interventions need a more complete understanding of the relationship between work organization and depressive symptoms, which can be achieved if work-family conflict is considered as a mediator in this dynamic.

991	Modélisation procédurale de mondes virtuels par pavage d'occultation	This thesis deals with procedural modeling applied to extended worlds for computer graphics.We study visibility applied to tiling patterns, aiming at two distinct objectives : (1) providing artists with efficient tools to generate 3D content for very extended virtual scenes, and (2) guaranteeing that this content improves performance of subsequent renderings, during its construction. We propose several methods for 2D and 3D visibility determination, in order to achieve interactive or real-time evaluation of potentially visible sets (PVS). They are based on the concepts of separating and supporting lines/planes, as well as objects hierarchies over tiles. Our first 2D method guarantees full occlusion of the visual field (view frustum) beyond a fixed distance, regardless of the observer’s location on a tiling. The second method enables fast estimation and localization of visible tiles, and builds up a virtual world accordingly. We also extend this method to 3D. Finally, we present two methods to optimize objects locations on tiles, and show how to improve rendering performance for scenes generated on the fly.

992	Facteurs de persévérance scolaire et d’insertion professionnelle d’adultes ayant présenté des troubles de comportements extériorisés durant leurs études secondaires	"School democratization has brought the contemporary issue of adaptation in education. A category among students with disabilities or learning and adaptation difficulties (EHDAA) classified by the MELS remains more problematic than others. Students with externalizing behavior disorders are more likely to not follow the regular path, or to drop out and to have difficulties in professional integration. How to explain a minority of them, against any statistical predicate, manages to graduate and be part of an exciting career? How  behavioral problems can be reduced in adulthood? This memory brings clarification on these questions and offers a sociological analysis of the factors of perseverance in school and employability of adults who experienced externalizing behavior problems during high school. Two interviews have been made on meaningful lives of two individuals who meet these criterias. Analysis of their trajectory demonstrates that social inclusion is formed by the ""interconnaissance"" and ""interreconnaissance"" of different types of capital as agreed by Pierre Bourdieu. Also, based on the analysis method of insertion stories proposed by Demazière and Dubar, four trends were identified regarding how the resources were mobilized by the respondents. Although the material is small, this study has a unique look at several aspects of the phenomenon, which hopefully will attract the attention of other researchers who will consider the finding tracks in this thesis."	insertion scolaire , behavioral disorders , perseverance in school , employability , school integration , adult	en	11070.0
993	Étude in vivo de la relation entre la structure et la fonction de la boucle variable de l'ARN de transfert de la sélénocystéine d'E. coli	Selenocysteine is the 21st genetically encoded amino acid and is found across the three domains of life. It is synthesized on the tRNA-Sec by a single process. The tRNA-Sec also stands out at the structural level. The acceptor stem has 8 (bacteria) and 9 (eukaryote) base pairs, in contrast to canonical tRNA which invariably has 7 base pairs in the acceptor stem. Furthermore, the D-stem has two additional bases pairs which replace the universal tertiary interactions 8-14, 15-48 which are absent in the tRNA-Sec. On the other hand, the length of the extra-arm of tRNA-Sec is longer than the majority of type II tRNA . In this dissertation, we focus on the extra-arm of tRNA-Sec. The research consists of distinguishing the base pairs of the extra-arm that are essential for the biosynthesis and insertion of selenocysteine. In addition, we examine if the additional base pair in the acceptor stem (bacteria) is essential for the insertion of selenocysteine. To study these questions, we used the experimental Instant Evolution approach which consists of the in vivo screening of functional tRNA-Sec clones in E. coli. In this work, it is shown that the insertion of selenocysteine does not require a specific length or sequence of the tRNA-Sec. It is also shown that neither the length of the acceptor stem or of the acceptor/T domain is required to have a functional tRNA-Sec .

994	Transgression in Matthew Lewis's The Monk and the Fragmentation of the Self	‘‘Transgression in Matthew Lewis’s The Monk and the Fragmentation of the Self’’ is an investigation of the different stages that the human conscience undertakes and the conducts that each stage produces. It pays particular attention to the conversion of good to evil and the motives that nourish this conversion. By focusing on the spiritual defilement as a first step that leads to the concrete manifestation of evil, the thesis explores the subsequent parallel between the conscience of virtue and the conscience of malice. It examines the confused identity of its characters under an oppressive ruling system and explores the mechanism of power in relation to discourse, knowledge, and the body.  The first chapter deals with the degradation of the path of sanctity into that of profanity. It closely examines the growth of evil in Ambrosio’s conscience from the first instance of defilement to the eventual act of sin and the subsequent destruction he endures. I focus on Matilda’s overwhelming manipulation of his character and demonstrate the ways they intertwine. By examining Ambrosio’s fragmentation and duplicity with Matilda, my chapter negotiates the fragmented nature of the monastic discourse with the human innate longing for worldly pleasures.  The second chapter scrutinizes the religious figure’s failure to maintain his status of power when the knowledge he possesses is inexperienced. In this chapter, I question the status of power as dissolved and disbanded when it does not succeed in disciplining the subjugated body. I examine the reversal of pastoral power to the credit of the female transgressive character; and I finally conclude with the analysis of the body as the locus of trauma in the nexus of power relations. The third chapter studies the loss of certainty in patriarchal society. It examines the impacts of the failed hierarchal system on gender and its performance. This chapter illuminates the immediate spiritual, sexual, and social corruptions, and tackles the variety of twinnings that take place in the novel as a response to the stated corruptions. I also negotiate the restoration of social justice when the corrupt characters are offered a chance to self-discovery but do not escape punishment at the end of their lives.

995	Conservatisme et innovation chez les potières iroquoiennes du site Droulers-Tsiionhiakwatha	This Masters project attempts to integrate the 15th Century village community of Droulers within our current understanding of the Iroquoian social and cultural sphere in the St. Lawrence Valley. Using a stylistic analysis of pottery rim sherds decorated with the dentate stamp technique, this study attempts to evaluate the cultural variability of the site as well as its place within the St. Lawrence Iroquoian world. The comparison of the stylistic specificities of the Droulers site with those of a variety of other sites is used to position this site within the development of the St. Lawrence Iroquoian sequence, and to map the cultural ties that linked this specific site to the rest of its proximate area and within the western and central provinces of the Saint-Lawrence Iroquoian territory. The simultaneous conservative and progressive characteristics of the pottery produced at the Droulers site are unique to this site, and help us to identify the specificity of the site and to establish its stylistic independence within the region. On the basis of this evidence, we have determined that the use of dentate designs cannot alone serve as a reliable indicator for the purpose of establishing the period of occupation of the site. However, the use of dentate designs can still be used as an indicator of patterns of regional interaction. The use of the dentate design, in conjunction with other significant regional variations, has also helped us better delineate a set of stylistic similarities and to determine that Droulers is most closely linked to the Mandeville and Lanoraie sites, and to a lesser extent to the McIvor site. Furthermore, we have also determined that the Droulers site is part of a complex network of interactions that ties it to communities located further East and West along the St. Lawrence Valley. Finally, the different patterns of stylistic variation, taken together, confirm the chronological position of the site at the end of the 15th Century, despite the high ratio of dentate designs traditionally considered to be characteristic of earlier settlements.

996	L'accès aux soins de santé mentale : le discours des jeunes adultes en difficulté	This Master's thesis aims to understand how the issue of access to mental health care arises in the world of young adults in difficulty. More precisely, the research's objectives are to document the barriers to access to mental health care, to analyze tendencies underlying these barriers and to evaluate the impact of being young adult in trouble on them. The approach of medical anthropology and the concept of social suffering, sensitive to cultural, socio-economic and political factors framed the analysis to the 12 semi-directed interviews conducted with young adults using services from Auberges du coeur to Montreal. First, the identification of barriers to access allowed to observe the obstacles in the experience of use of mental health care may come as institutions that young adults themselves. Secondly, the qualitative data analysis was used to identify three main logic underlying these barriers: the positivist bias, market logic, and the trend of psychologizing. The data collected suggest that political and economic influences are critical in maintaining different barriers to access, and full recognition of these deep issues is essential to act positively on access to mental health care of the general population, especially young adults in difficulty whose needs are urgent.

997	CEP78, a novel centrosomal protein	Background: The centrosome is a tiny organelle well-known for its role in establishing the bipolar spindle during cell division. Defects in centrosome function often give rise to human diseases including cancer and kidney cyst formation. We are interested in studying the function of one novel centrosomal protein named CEP78, identified in a proteomic screen for novel centrosomal components. Methods and results: Treatment of cells with nocodazole, a microtubule-depolymerizing agent that specifically depolymerizes cytoplasmic microtubules but not the stabilized centrosome microtubules, showed that CEP78 is a stable centrosomal component. Colocalization of this protein with other centrosomal markers such as CEP164, SAS6, Centrin, Polyglutamylated tubulin and POC5 at different phases of the cell cycle indicated that CEP78 specifically localizes to the distal end of the mother and daughter centrioles. There are 2 CEP78 dots during the interphase and as the cells go through mitosis, procentrioles mature, and the number of CEP78 dots increases to 4 dots per cell and by the end of telophase each daughter cell has 2 CEP78 dots. Characterization of CEP78 functional domains showed that Leucine-rich repeats are necessary for centrosomal localization of the protein. In addition, we found that overexpression of CEP78 did not change the number of centrioles and centrosomes but decreased the number and intensity of CEP170 dots (sub-distal appendage protein) without a decrease in the expression level of this protein. Further studies showed that there is no interaction between these 2 proteins. Finally, overexpression of CEP78 protects microtubules from depolymerization in the presence of nocodazole, suggesting its ability to bind microtubules. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that CEP78 is targeted to the distal end of mature centrioles via its lecuine-rich repeats, where it could be involved in centriolar maturation or regulation of sub-distal appendage assembly and/or remodeling, a structure known to nucleate and anchor microtubules. Understanding the function of CEP78 will shed light on the role of the centrosome in cell cycle.	CEP78 , Centrosome , CEP170 , Microtubules	en	11029.0
998	Un Dieu se dévoile : herméneutique processuelle d'Éz 16	Hermeneutic thinkers of the twentieth century have essentially redefined man as a being who is in search of meaning, constantly interpreting the 'world' through 'his own world', with this transformative understanding contributing to his future. Is it therefore relevant, in the search for meaning that characterizes a journey of faith, to read the Scriptures in ways that open new possibilities other than those currently offered by the Christian tradition? This essay proposes an affirmative answer to this challenge by applying a Process Approach to the text of Chapter 16 of the Book of Ezekiel, a prophet whom Jewish tradition has historically treated with suspicion and a particularly bold text that the Christians disregarded. After setting the parameters of the study (Chapter 1), a literal translation of the Hebrew text is presented, highlighting the nuances suggested by language choice as well as particular elements revealed by macro-syntax analysis (Chapter 2). The process analysis method chosen to interpret the text is unprecedented in the Francophone world, as is the process context of the study outlined in Chapters 3 and 4. The conclusions identify original theological concepts, most notably redefining God as a stubborn will that seeks to convince, and inscribing his forgiveness deeply in human liberty and responsibility.

999	Interaction entre la RNase HI et la RNase E dans le métabolisme des R-loops et la dégradation des ARNms chez Escherichia coli	In Escherichia coli, DNA topoisomerase I and DNA gyrase are the two main topoisomerases responsible for the regulation of DNA supercoiling. DNA topoisomerase I is encoded by topA while gyrase is encoded by gyrA and gyrB. In topA mutants, the accumulation of negative supercoiling behind the elongating RNA polymerase complex leads to the formation of R-loops. In vivo, R-loops are formed when the nascent RNA re-hybridizes with the template strand leaving the non-template strand single-stranded. RNase HI is an endoribonuclease encoded by rnhA and it is responsible for degrading the RNA in an R-loop, to make sure that replication is initiated only at oriC. Indeed, in rnhA mutants, oriC-independent replication also takes place. This type of replication, named cSDR for constitutive stable DNA replication, could explain, at least in part, the growth inhibition of double topA rnhA mutants. With the aid of the Tn5 transposon mutagenesis system, we were able to isolate extragenic suppressors that allowed double topA rnhA mutants to grow. In several of these suppressors, the transposon was inserted in the gene coding for RNase E, the major endoribonuclease responsible for mRNA degradation in E. coli. The majority of these insertions were located in the C-terminal half of the protein that is responsible for the assembly of the multiprotein complex called the degradosome. Our results show that the suppressors act by reducing cSDR as well as the SOS response which is constitutively expressed in the absence of rnhA. Since RNase HI is an endoribonuclease just like RNase E, collaboration between the two enzymes will imply that RNase E could also play a major role in the elimination of R-loops as well as their exclusion from the cell. Equally as well, RNase HI can also play a major role in the maturation and degradation of mRNAs.

Étude d’efficacité d’un programme d’entraînement intensif des processus attentionnels chez des jeunes ayant subi un traumatisme craniocérébral"	Attention dysfunctions following traumatic brain injury (TBI) frequently complicate the return to activities of daily living and negatively influence professional and socioacademic reintegration. Yet, clinicians in rehabilitation settings have limited access to cognitive remediation protocols for which efficacy has been demonstrated and that are adapted to French populations. Thus, the aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the intensive attention process training program « Attention! Prêt? On s’enTraine! » (Séguin, Lahaie & Beauchamp, 2012) based on a French adaptation of the « Attention Process Training-I » program (APT-I; Sohlberg & Mateer, 1987). Over five weeks, 17 participants who sustained TBI and demonstrated attention deficits received either the attention process training intervention (n = 8) or homework assistance (n = 9). Following the intervention, the experimental group improved on functions targeted by the « Attention! Prêt? On s’enTraine! » program, specifically, visual scanning, visual selective attention and attentional shifting. They also showed significant transfer gains on related tasks including measures of working memory, inhibition, mental flexibility and visuoconstructive planning. The demonstration of a positive effect of an intensive attention training program on attentional performances after TBI is likely to support and reinforce the development and validation of French cognitive remediation protocols, ultimately leading to improvements in the prognosis for individuals with TBI.

1001	La mise en scène du savoir-faire musical au cinéma	This research aims at making an inventory and an analysis of the narrative, rhetorical and formal processes, in which three movies are presenting the musical know-how, and especially the teaching-learning situation between a music professor and his student. These three films are: Tous les matins du monde, directed by Alain Corneau (1991); Bird, by Clint Eastwood (1988) and All That Jazz, by Bob Fosse (1979). Eventually, this inventory and this analysis will allow us to identify a prevailing thematic: in these movies, and even in Cinema in general, it seems like music and musical education are portrayed under social and psychological features that are characteristics. There is, one hand, the possession of the other, the submission, the sacrifice and the perpetual dissatisfaction. But on the other hand, there are many gratifications to which education for body mind and spirit is a guarantee. Our hypothesis is that certain cinematographic expression modes — related to variations of framing styles, angle and reverse shots and so on—, and certain film narrative modes might be explaining this ability that Cinema has to show the emotional and social threat that weighs on the musical professor and on his student. These very same processes, thematic and hypothesis will be examined in a feature length script that will focus on the ability of questioning theses topics using the poetical composition.

1002	La gouvernance autochtone en milieu urbain: le cas de Montréal	In recent years, Aboriginals have obtained from the Canadian State recognition of certain inherent rights, including the right to self-determination and the right to self-government. However, when implementing Aboriginal governance initiatives, the various levels of government have operated on the assumption that Aboriginal groups all have a land base on which they can achieve their objectives, such as First Nations, Inuit and Métis home communities. These models are inadequate for the majority of Aboriginals who live in urban areas and who form a diverse and extremely mobile population without a land base. In order to reconcile the exercise of self-government and urbanity, new theoretical models of governance were developed to provide for better political representation of urban Aboriginals. By taking into account the issue of identifying who holds the right to self-determination, the nature of powers to be exercised and the area over which they would be exercised, we will attempt to determine in this thesis which Aboriginal governance model is best suited for Montreal’s Aboriginal population.

1003	L'enseignement des sciences et de la technologie au primaire et les TIC : une analyse didactique des pratiques	The teaching of science and technology is in precarious condition in Quebec’s elementary schools. The information and communication technologies (ICT) can help teachers to promote students’ learning in their science education. This research first describes « Maître- TIC» teacher’s practice in science and technology then concerns itself with the ICT integration in the teaching of sciences in elementary schools. Our work includes an heuristic research with a mixed methodology. Some « Maître-TIC » teachers and fourth-year « Maître- TIC » students respond to an online survey. Then, a teacher was interviewed in order to provide a more detailed picture of her teaching practices. Using the data obtained, we created a list of the advantages and difficulties inherent to ICT integration in the teaching of science. We also made a list of various applications of ICT realised in science education by the teachers of this study. A final list has been set up with all the advantages of the University of Montreal’s « Maître-TIC » formation as cited by the teachers and the students. Finally, we specify some contributions of this research to the original objectives and to the evolution of the « Maître-TIC » formation.

1004	Entre ville complexe et projet urbain durable, l’exemple de l’Agence d’Écologie Urbaine de Barcelone	An urban project is an opportunity to locally and globally revitalize under certain conditions. That is, the project must encompass a sustainable ecosystem outlook, be forward thinking and consider the complex equilibrium and resiliency of social and ecological structures. In practice, the demand for clear and quantitative guidelines leave little room for uncertainty. How, then, can one operationalize urban ecology without applying reductionist simplifications nor feel overwhelmed by the enormity of such a task? In connecting the pieces between sustainable development, complexity, urban ecology and sustainable city, we put into perspective the broader process of a sustainable urban project. Considering a study case of Barcelona’s Urban Ecology Agency, we suggest that an ecosystemic outlook of an urban context can be used as an intentional model. It can also be partitioned into indicators of sustainability and operationalized through an iterative, integrative and multidisciplinary process of a sustainable urban project.

1005	Étude-pilote portant sur une intervention de groupe auprès de femmes souffrant d’hyperphagie boulimique et l’évaluation de ses effets potentiels	This study focuses on a group intervention for binge eating disorder (BED), by measuring its potential effects on the quality of life related to weight, frequency and severity of binge episodes, depressive symptoms, body dissatisfaction and body weight, and documenting the degree of acceptance of the intervention by the participants. Thus, 11 overweight women that met the BED diagnostic criteria were recruited from spring 2012 to winter 2013, in Montreal. The program includes eight weekly sessions based on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy provided by a nutritionist and a psychotherapist. Quality of life related to weight (Impact of Weight on Quality of Life), binge eating frequency (recall of the last seven days), binge eating severity (Binge Eating Scale), depression (Beck Inventory for depression), body dissatisfaction (Body Shape Questionnaire) and body weight were measured before and after the intervention. Then, a questionnaire to assess the acceptance by the participants was submitted at the end of the program. The rate of participation was also collected. The results showed that our program has resulted in significant improvements in the overall quality of life score related to weight of 8.4 ± 13.3, and in terms of self-esteem and work. We also observed a decrease in binge eating frequency by 2.1 ± 2.1 days as well as in binge eating severity, depressive symptoms and body dissatisfaction whose scores decreased by 10.9 ± 7.7, 8.3 ± 5.7 and 32.8 ± 17.1 respectively. However, there was no significant difference in weight at the end of the intervention. Also, the program was well accepted by the participants with a participation rate of 93.8%. Satisfaction and relevance of the program scored respectively 4,6 and 4,8 out of 5. These data suggest that the group intervention seems to be a promising method to improve the symptoms and consequences of HB, except for weight.

1006	Modélisation d'arythmies auriculaires modulées par le système nerveux autonome	Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most frequent arrhythmia and accounts for about one-third of hospitalizations for cardiac rhythm disturbances. The mechanisms of initiation and maintenance of atrial fibrillation are complex and multifaceted. Among them, a contribution of the autonomic nervous system has been identified but its exact role remains poorly understood. This work targets the study of the effect of autonomic modulation induced by acetylcholine (ACh) on the initiation and maintenance of AF, using a two-dimensional tissue model. Electrical impulse propagation in the tissue was described by as a non-linear reaction-diffusion equation solved on a rectangular mesh with finite difference methods, and ACh kinetics followed a predefined time evolution corresponding to parasympathetic activation. More than 4400 simulations were performed based on 4 fibrillatory initial conditions, 5 sizes of ACh patch, 10 ACh concentrations and 22 time constants representing ACh release and degradation speed. Our results suggest that vagal stimulation can sustain or terminate AF depending on the 4 parameters studied. Results demonstrate that rapid vagal discharge, represented by low time constants combined with sufficient quantities of ACh, has a high probability of breaking the primary reentry and causing fibrillatory activity. This activity is characterized by the generation of several wavelets from a primary rotor under the heterogeneity of repolarization gradient due to autonomic modulation.

1007	Isolation and identification of native microalgae for biodiesel production	The continuing increase in fuel demands, the dramatic situation in climate changes and the global warming are bringing the worldwide attention to the identification of alternative energy source for the production of combustibles that can replace fossil fuel. In last years, a lot of potential sources have been identified: the first potential biofuel feedstock that have been evaluated were oleaginous plants, but the utilization of vegetable, or vegetable oils, that may also be used for human feeding, could lead to the increase of food-grade oils costs and also generate ethic questions. Nevertheless, also using as biofuel sources not-edible oils, like oils from jatropha, tobacco seed or jojoba, the common problem for both edible and not-edible crops is the need to subtract arable land from agriculture and food industry.          In this context, the utilization of aquatic microorganisms like microalgae as substrate for the production of biofuel seems to be the better solution. Microalgae are easy to cultivate and can grow with little or no attention, they can grow in fresh, brackish or salt water and in non-arable lands, moreover they are not edible with no consequences on food industry, and the oil productivity, with respect to the other potential biofuel sources, can be much higher. In addition, the intensive cultivation of microalgae for biodiesel production could also play an important role in CO2 mitigation.          In this study, we isolated and morphologically identified Québec native micro algal species, surveyed and screened their potential for lipid (biodiesel) production. The sampling efforts made in three different regions of Québec: Montreal area, Gaspesie and Northern of Quebec; on fresh, brackish or saline water. One hundred strains were isolated from the Montreal area, characterized and screened for their lipid content and wastewater nutrient removal under different temperatures (10±2 ºC and 22±2 ºC). The high potential lipid producing algal species were selected. The use of wastewater as a substrate media decreases the economic cost realted to the biofuel production from microalgae as well as an interesting tool for wastewater treatment. We compared the biomass and lipid productivity of these strains on wastewater to a synthetic medium and identified a number of isolates that showed good growth at 10 ºC, gave a high lipid content (ranging from 20% to 45% of dry weight) or a high capacity for nutrient removal (>97% removal).         Furthermore, we characterized one of the interesting strains that revealed high lipid and biomass productivity, the novel microalga Chlorella sp. PCH90. Its molecular phylogeny was established and lipid production studies as a function of the initial concentrations of nitrate, phosphate, and sodium chloride were carried out using Response Surface Methodology. Under the appropriate conditions this microalga could produce up to 36% lipid and grew well in both synthetic medium and secondary effluent from a wastewater treatment plant at both 22°C and 10°C. Thus, this strain is promising for further development as a potential biofuels producer under local climatic conditions.

1008	Adaptation transculturelle et validation du questionnaire Upper Limb Functional Index (ULFI) pour la population canadienne française	Upper limb musculoskeletal disorders (UL-MSD) can negatively impact on patients' autonomy. There are no existing outcome measures available in French to assess activity limitations and participation restrictions caused by UL-MSD that have sound metrological properties and are applicable in a clinical context where clinicians have limited assessment time for each patient. The Upper Limb Functional Index (ULFI), having good metrological qualities and clinical applicability, is a relevant tool for clinicians since it promotes a patient-centered approach. However, the tool was only available in English and Spanish until now.   This research project included two studies and aimed at adapting the ULFI to the French Canadian population and to assess the metrological properties of the adapted version (ULFI-FC) and its clinical applicability. The first study examined its internal consistency, convergent validity and clinical applicability among 50 bilingual patients with UL-MSD. The second study aimed to analyse its test-retest reliability and responsiveness among 60 French-speaking patients.   The findings revealed that the ULFI-FC possesses sound metrological properties: a high internal consistency (Cronbach α = 0.93 for Part 1), an excellent test-retest reliability (ICC = 0.87-0.95), an excellent convergent validity (r = 0.70-0.85), and good to excellent responsiveness (effect size = 0.49-0.88; and r = 0.64 for Part 1), as well as good clinical applicability in a context where assessment time devoted to each patient is limited.   In conclusion, the ULFI-CF is a relevant and attractive tool assessing activity limitations and participation restrictions for clinicians working with French Canadian UL-MSD patients in a busy clinical setting.

1009	Modulation of nociception and pain by attention and stress	Psychological factors such as hypnosis, emotion, stress, and attention produce powerful modulatory effects on nociception and pain.  However, the influence of attention on nociception and pain and the underlying neural mechanism responsible are unclear. The current literature on attentional modulation of spinal nociceptive responses, as measured by the RIII reflex, and pain perception (pain intensity) is inconsistent and often contradictory. The present thesis provides a new component-based framework for the examination of attentional modulation of the RIII reflex and pain. A delayed-discrimination task was decomposed into the three components of attention – namely alerting, orienting, and executive control (sensory working memory). Previously, the multidimensional nature of attention was largely ignored in the pain literature. We show that each component of attention exerts a distinct modulatory effect on nociception and pain and suggest that this accounts for some of the confusion in the literature. By considering stress separately, we demonstrate for the first time that stress blocks attentional modulation of the RIII reflex, indicating an interaction and dissociation of attention- and stress-mediated modulation of spinal nociceptive responses. This important finding clarifies much of the disagreement in the literature, since cognitive tasks often induce increases in stress that consequently confound interpretation. Additionally, both visual and somatosensory stimuli were included in the discrimination task, revealing that the influence of attention on pain intensity is spatially-specific whereas attentional modulation of nociception is modality-specific, at least for the modalities investigated. From these findings a component-based model for the attentional modulation of pain processes is proposed. This model is substantially supported by the literature and provides a meaningful and cohesive explanation of the seemingly contradictory results across studies. Moreover, this model suggests potential neural mechanisms underlying the attentional modulation of pain.

Analyse de concours à Québec et à Toronto"	This thesis examines the concept of identity, its definitions and uses in the debates and practices of the city, architecture and heritage. Interventions on historic buildings reveal as much the relationship between the identity of society and its history as with the contemporary world. This research studies architectural competitions in two Canadian cities that aspire to be international, one focusing on the contemporary and global aspect (Toronto) and the other on the historical and local aspect (Quebec City). The objective of this research is on the one hand, to unravel the process of identity construction of the contemporary city through architectural projects. On the other hand, it is to analyze the process of identification and the architectural identity in its relation to history and contemporaneity in architectural practice of historic buildings.   The methodology used in this study combines discourse analysis and analysis of the architecture and its representation. The choice of the competition of Place-Royale Interpretation center in Quebec City (1996) and the competition for the expansion of Royal Ontario Museum (2001) in Toronto reveals the concept of identity’s different facets. The history of each competition and semantic analysis of the documentation clarify the relationship between processes and intentions and help to highlight local issues. The analysis of both textual and visual discourses of architects’ proposals reveals the process of identification of the projects, the different types of references involved and the communication strategies employed. The analysis of the projects reflects the identity characteristics of contemporary architecture.  This research reveals the importance of discourses and communication in the construction of cities’ identity, and the societal debates that these questions provoke. During the process of architectural identification, the specific approach of the brief, in the case of Quebec City, prompts a discourse with a historical focus by the architects. The proposed projects are presented within the historical setting and focus on the visual experience of visitors. In the Toronto case, the interest on the global and spectacular in the city’s identity construction generates enthusiasm for an attractive representation of the projects and for iconic architecture.

1011	L’immunoprotéasome : producteur de peptides-CMH I et régulateur de l’expression génique	The ubiquitin-proteasome system is the major mechanism by which intracellular proteins get degraded. Constitutive proteasomes (CPs) are thus essential for cellular homeostasis but also to regulate the majority of important cellular processes. However, the discovery of a second type of proteasome, named immunoproteasome (IP), raises new questions. Why are there more than one type of proteasome? Does the IP perform redundant or complementary roles with the CP? The IP is predominantly expressed in immune or cytokine-stimulated cells and several groups worked at defining its role during the immune response. Yet, the implication of its constitutive homolog in a variety of processes suggests that the IP may also have a much broader impact. The objective was to characterize cellular roles of the IP in dendritic cells. We first studied the global impact of the IP on class I antigen presentation. We discovered that the IP drastically increases the number and the diversity of peptide presented by class I major histocompatibility complexes. Cleavage differences between the CP and the IP are likely part of the explanation for this peptide repertoire diversity, notably due to IP’s apparent affinity for unstructured protein regions. Second, we discovered a new role for the IP in a process unrestricted to the immune system: transcription. We found that the IP affects transcript abundance mostly at the level of mRNA synthesis. The impact of IPs on the transcriptome is major and would be partly based on a different degradation of IRF, STAT and NF-kB transcription factor family members by the two types of proteasomes. IP-deficient dendritic cells are less potent activators of CD8+ T cells and we believe that this defect is at least partly caused by the transcriptome alterations induced by the absence of IPs. It is therefore important to understand the different molecular roles of the IP in order to better define its global contribution to cellular functions and to understand the evolutionary advantage, at the level of the organism, brought by such plasticity of the ubiquitin- proteasome system.

1012	La performance diagnostique des marqueurs tumoraux messagers dans le diagnostic et le suivi du cancer du sein	According to several evidences, the presence of occult tumor cells in blood circulation in the early stages of breast cancer could be the origin of metastatic lesions. Recent research studies have shown that the use of qRT-PCR for the detection of circulating tumor cells CTC offers the best sensitivity in the quantification of tumor markers. Currently routine monitoring of breast cancer is performed by immunoassay of serum markers CA15.3 and CEA. However, the low sensitivity of these markers in the early stages of the disease and the lack of tissue specificity does not allow their use in diagnosis and prognosis of breast cancer. The diagnosis of the disease is rather based on the analysis of biopsies of the tumor or lymph nodes. This is an invasive procedure, expensive and not suitable for routine monitoring of the risk of relapse and response to treatment. Despite these studies, detection of these cells in hospital laboratories is rare.  Our objective is to set up a new RT-PCR assay for the detection of malignant breast cancer cells in the circulation. The specificity and sensitivity of some potential markers will be compared. The ultimate goal of this project is to routinely offer the detection of one or of a combination of these markers routinely to patients with breast cancer.            Our results show a positive correlation between the expression of CK19 and HER2 mRNA with clinical data of patients. Furthermore, the sensitivity and specificity of our RT-PCR tests are similar to the recent literature. Finally, the comparison of our test with the immunoassay of serum tumor markers CEA and CA15.3 showed that the detection of HER2 and CK19 by RT-PCR is more sensitive in patients with metastatic breast cancer	Her2 , cancer , qrt-pcr , Ck19 , routine , monitoring , breast , Rt-Pcr	en	10880.0
1013	Étude sur les fonctions in vivo des GEFs DOCK chez les mammifères	Dock1 (also known as Dock180) is the prototypical member of the Dock family of Rho GTPase activators (RhoGEFs). Genetic studies in Drosophila and C. elegans have demonstrated that Dock1 orthologues act upstream of the Rac GTPase to activate it during various biological processes. Myoblast city (mbc), Dock1 ortholog in the Drosophila, is an important regulator of myoblast fusion during muscle fiber formation. Moreover, mbc regulates the collective migration of a cluster of border cells downstream of the activation of some tyrosine kinase receptors (RTKs). Migration of border cells is often view as a model for studying the invasive migration of cancer cells during metastasis development. Work done in cell lines also suggests that Dock1 is an important cytoskeletal regulator that controls cell migration. The Dock1/Rac pathway was also shown to act downstream of some RTKs to promote the invasion of glioblastoma cells. Yet, the in vivo functions of Dock1 in mammals are still poorly understood and the identification and characterization of some of these functions is the main objective of my thesis.  Guided by the function of mbc, in Aim #1 we revealed that Dock1 is essential to embryonic development by characterizing a Dock1 knock-out mouse model. A deficiency in myoblast fusion was observed in Dock1-null embryos which led to a reduction in their muscle mass. Furthermore, we uncovered a contribution of the other Dock1-related GEF, Dock5, to myofiber development.  In Aim #2 a correlation between high level of DOCK1 expression and a poor prognosis in HER2+ breast cancer patients was revealed. Amplification or overexpression of the HER2 receptor tyrosine kinase is associated with near 20% of breast cancer cases. The presence of this genetic abnormality correlates with a poor prognosis and the development of metastasis.  Biochemical and in vitro studies led us to identify that DOCK1 interacts with HER2 and is essential to HER2-mediated RAC activation and migration. The use of a HER2 breast cancer mouse model with Dock1 inactivation in the mammary gland led us to identify DOCK1-RAC signaling as novel effectors in HER2-mediated tumor growth and metastasis.  We conclude that the use of Dock1 mouse models allowed us to identify some of the key functions regulated by this gene in vivo. Much like its ortholog mbc, Dock1 is essential to embryonic development and regulates myoblast fusion. Our study also reveals important degree of conservation of the mechanisms that regulate fusion between species. In addition, DOCK1 acts downstream of the HER2 RTK in mammary epithelial cells where it contributes to the progression of breast cancer pathology and the formation of metastasis induced by this oncogene.

1014	The roles of TL1A and Pno1 in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis	Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by persistent inflammation of multiple small joints, which manifests pain, redness, swelling, and deformation. Studies with patients and animal models have found that autoantibodies, cytokines and tissue-destructive enzymes are important mediators of the pathogenesis of RA. In the past two decades, biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) have achieved great success in the treatment of RA. On the other hand, they are also associated with adverse effect like increasing the chance of opportunistic infections. The aim of present work was to investigate the roles of TNF-like molecule 1A (TL1A; TNFSF15) and partner of Nob1 (Pno1; YOR145c) in the pathogenesis of RA for developing novel drugs based on these molecules in the future. TL1A is a member of the TNF superfamily. It triggers costimulatory signals though death receptor 3 (DR3) and induces the proliferation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production in lymphocytes. Multiple lines of evidence suggest the implication of TL1A-DR3 signaling in several autoimmune diseases. Therefore, We hypothesized that 1) local TL1A production in the joints is a component of a vicious circle aggravating RA; 2) in RA, TL1A production in lymphoid organs enhances pathogenic autoantibody production. We demonstrated that the TL1A aggravates disease in murine collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). Moreover, we found elevated TL1A expression in RA-affected tissues, as well as in the draining lymph nodes (dLNs) of CIA mice. Mechanistically, we discovered that TL1A induces TNF-α and IL-17 production by T cells in vitro. These findings provided direct evidence that TL1A-DR3 signaling plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of RA. TL1A knockout (TL1A KO) mice were generated to further our study. We showed that TL1A KO mice have no visual anomaly, and no malfunction of immune system under a normal circumstance. However, they display ameliorated CIA and significantly reduced anti-Collagen II antibody levels in sera. We found that the draining lymph nodes (dLNs) from KO mice were smaller in size and lower in cellularity compared with their WT counterparts 14 days after immunization. Furthermore, we discovered that terminally differentiated plasma cells express DR3 and they survive better in the presence of TL1A. Our findings in this study present novel knowledge about the role of iii TL1A promoting the humoral responses in CIA; we suggest that TL1A could elevate the initial Ab response against Collagen II (CII), as well as prolong the survival of plasma cells producing such pathogenic Abs. Another molecule we were interested in present study is Pno1. Previous studies conducted in yeast suggest that Pno1 is essential to the proteasome and ribosome neogenesis. Since proteasome is crucial for the terminal differentiation of plasma cells during the humoral response in mammals, we hypothesized that Pno1 plays a role in the pathogenic Ab production in RA by affecting the proteasome assembly. For this purpose, we generated pno1 gene- modified mice to investigate the function of Pno1 in vivo. However, null-mutation in pno1 causes embryonic lethality in mice at a very early stage. On the other hand, a half amount reduction or overexpression of Pno1 is neither harmful nor useful to the T and B cell function, proteasome activities as well as humoral immune responses in CIA. These findings suggest that Pno1 is a vital molecule with no redundancy and is absolutely required for cell function, but animals can function normally with a small fraction of the normal Pno1 expression level. Thus, it might not be an appropriate target for developing therapeutic drugs. In conclusion, our studies suggest that TL1A seems not essential in maintaining the immune functions under normal circumstances, but plays critical roles in the pathogenesis of RA by promoting local inflammation and humoral immune responses against autoantigens. Therefore, inhibiting TL1A could be a propitious therapeutic strategy for treating RA. In contrast, Pno1 is vital to the normal cell function, and its disruption could cause disastrous consequences. Thus, it might not be a good drug target for treating RA.	TL1A , DR3 , Inflammation , Pno1 , Rheumatoid arthritis , Cytokine , Plasma cells , Proteasome	en	10874.0
1015	The effect of lesion size on cortical reorganization in the ipsi and contralesional hemispheres	While our understanding of ipsilesional plasticity and its role in recovery of hand function following ischemic stroke has increased dramatically, the reorganization of the contralesional motor cortex and its effect on recovery remain unclear. Currently published studies offer contradictory views on the role of contralesional motor cortex in recovery. Lesion extent has been suggested as the factor determining the type of reorganization of the contralesional motor cortex. The primary goal of this study was thus to evaluate the effect of unilateral strokes of different sizes in caudal forelimb area (CFA) of the rat on both physiological reorganization and behavioral recovery. At the end of a period of spontaneous recovery during which we monitored motor performance of both limbs, we obtained bilateral maps of the CFA and the putative premotor area of the rat – rostral forelimb area (RFA). We found that lesion volume in the CFA correlates with both the extent of behavioral recovery of the paretic hand and the extent of both ipsi and contralesional cortical reorganization. We found that rats with bigger lesions had larger hand representations in the ipsilesional hemisphere and more persistent deficits of the paretic hand. In the contralesional hemisphere we found that rats with larger hand representation in the RFA had bigger lesions and incomplete recovery of the paretic hand. Our results confirm the effect of lesion volume on the reorganization of the contralesional motor cortex and highlight contralesional RFA as the motor cortical area most influenced by lesion volume for future investigations.

1016	Façons de faire l’évaluation formative d’enseignants de français sénégalais : une analyse de leurs savoirs pratiques en contexte d’effectifs pléthoriques au Lycée	This research documents the ways formative assessment is operationalized by French teachers working in the context of overcrowded classrooms in a Senegalese High School. The recent choice for implementing the competency-based approach in this country invites teachers to promote the use of formative assessment which is geared towards the provision of high quality learning (Allal & Mottier Lopez, 2005, Black & Wiliam, 2009 Morrissette, 2010). However, Ministerial guidelines for its implementation are very general, and so far, research has not been carried out as regards its application in overcrowded classes. Building on the field of reflective practice (Schön, 1983) and an interactive situated vision of formative assessment (Mottier Lopez, 2007; Morrissette, 2010), I led a collaborative research with 14 French teachers working in the same High School. Six focus groups discussions were carried out which shed light on three dimensions related to formative assessment practices: contextual analysis of teacher practices, the negotiated construction of knowledge and the management of the overcrowded classrooms. Analysis of formative assessment practices in the context of « cultural strangeness » (free translation) (Douville, 2002) helped to conceptualize their know-how on evaluation in light of how they interpret the problems faced by students, their conception of what error constitutes and the ways they reinvent the traditional performance evaluation methods rooted in the school culture.	formative assessment practices , French teachers , Senegalese High School , reflective practice , interactionist perspective , collaborative research , focus group , thematic analysis , operationalization of formative assessment practices in overcrowded classrooms , cultural strangeness	en	10862.0
1017	Essays in partial identification and applications to treatment effects and policy evaluation	In this thesis, I have been interested in the nonparametric (partial) identification of structural potential outcome functions and Average Treatment Effect (ATE) in various discrete models with endogenous selection and treatment. This topic of treatment effect concerns measuring the impact of an intervention on an outcome of interest. The type of treatments and outcomes may be broadly defined in order to be applied in many different contexts. There are many examples of treatment in economics (Labor, health, education, trade, industrial organization) such that Job training programs, surgical procedures, higher education level, research and development investment, being a member of a trade union etc. The decision to be treated or not, is usually not random but is based on individual choices or preferences. In such a context, determining the impact of the treatment becomes an important issue since we have to take into account the selectivity bias. The parametric version of such models has been widely studied in the literature, however in models with discrete variation, the parametrization is a strong source of identification. Then, we don’t know if the empirical results we obtain, are driven by the data or by the parametrization imposed on the model. I propose to look at a fully nonparametric version of those models, in order, to have more robust policy recommendations. The central challenge in this nonparametric structural identification is that the hypothesized structure fails to identify a single generating process for the data, either because of multiple equilibria or data observability constraints. In such cases, many traditional identification techniques become inapplicable and a framework for identification in incomplete models is developing, with an initial focus on identification of the set of structural functions of interest compatible with the true data distribution (hereafter identified set). Therefore, in the first chapter, I provide a full characterization of the identified set for the ATE in a binary triangular system. In the second chapter, I consider a model with sector specific unobserved heterogeneity. I provide the full characterization of the identified set for the structural potential outcome functions of an instrumental variables model of sectoral choice with discrete outcomes. Assumptions on selection include the simple, extended and generalized Roy models. In the last chapter, I consider a binary model with several unobserved heterogeneity dimensions, such as entry and participation games. I provide the full characterization of the identified set for the payoffs in 2   2 games with perfect information, including duopoly entry and coordination games. In all chapters, the identified set of the functions of interest are nonparametric intersection bounds and are simple enough to lend themselves to existing inference methods.

1018	Des pères non-agresseurs face au dévoilement de l'agression sexuelle de leur enfant : impact psychologique et soutien paternel	Child sexual abuse is a devastating social epidemic. It threatens the physical and psychological integrity of children who have experienced it, and brings about horrific repercussions for them and their parents. Yet, parents are considered to be key actors in the recovery of their children. Unfortunately, the current state of knowledge on parental support concerns almost exclusively mothers and not much is known in regards to the role played by fathers.. The principal objective of the present thesis is to further the current understanding of the role and realities experienced by fathers who dealt with the disclosure of their child’s sexual abuse. The present thesis is made up of two scientific articles. The objective of the first article was to describe the experiences of non-offending fathers whose children had been sexually abused either by someone related to them or not, in terms of their emotional, cognitive and behavioral reactions following disclosure. To accomplish this, 17 fathers whose children were the victims of extra or intrafamiliar sexual abuse were recruited at either the Centre d’Expertise Marie-Vincent in Montreal, the Centre d’Intervention en Abus Sexuels pour la Famille in the nearby region of Gatineau, or in the general population, and were asked to participate in a semi-structured interview. Results indicate that fathers in this study suffered from a noticeable psychological shock following disclosure that resembles indirect trauma. This study also brought into light the existence of a grieving process among fathers who were confronted to their child’s loss of innocence. The objectives of the second article were to describe the repercussions of disclosure on the ways fathers involve themselves with their children and to isolate the different forms of support offered by fathers to their sexually abused children. Qualitative content analyses from 17 fathers who dealt with the disclosure of sexual abuse on their children suggests that it could be interpreted as an element of ‘severance’ in the bond with the child, which requires adaptation to a new reality. Even though all of the interviewed fathers expressed their concerns for their children and their desire to help them, findings highlight the difficulties of some fathers to involve themselves with their children because of their own important psychological distress, their ambivalence toward the child or because of feelings of uneasiness that were stirred up while providing to the primary needs of the child or during physical play. Analyses shed some light on these father’s capacities to help their children deal with the consequences of sexual abuse. The acknowledgement of a new form of support specific to fathers, namely, the ability to open the child to his outside world and in doing so playing a role in the development of self-esteem, constitutes a ground-breaking finding of the present thesis.

1019	Analyse des propriétés électroniques de supraconducteurs à l’aide de la théorie de la fonctionnelle de la densité	In this thesis, the electronic structure of different kinds of superconductors is explored with the density functional theory. A brief explanation of this theory is done in the in- troduction. The Hubbard model is also presented as it can be used to solve shortcomings of the theory in some materials such as cuprates. The blend of the two theories is the DFT+U which is used to describe materials with strongly correlated electrons. After- ward, a paper describing the electron-phonon coupling in the superconductor NbC1−xNx is presented. Results from this work show the role of the Fermi surface in the electron pairing mechanism leading to superconductivity. Based on these results, a model is de- veloped explaining how the critical temperature is influenced by the change in frequency of the vibration modes. Then, quantum oscillation results based on a detailed analysis of Fermi surfaces, allowing a direct comparison with experimental data, are presented within two papers. The first one is about a material in the iron pnictide family, the LaFe2P2. Our calculations show that the Fermi surface of this material is different from the superconducting doped BaFe2As2 which explains why this material shows no sign of superconductivity. The second paper is about the heavy fermion system YbCoIn5. To do this, a new efficient method to calculate de Haas-van Alphen frequencies is developed. Finally, a paper on superconducting YBa2Cu3O6.5 is presented. Using DFT+U, the role of various magnetic orders on the Fermi surface are studied. The results allow a better understanding of the measured quantum oscillations in this material.

1020	Le roman édifiant aux XVIIe et XVIIIe siècles	Edifying novels of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries - narrative prose fictions that clearly put forth their will to convey Christian values and influence the behavior of their readers in the sense of these values - develop a specific poetics, based on the research and the unveiling of Christian truth through mundane fiction. They therefore emphasize a  problem that has haunted writers and theorists of the Classical Age, namely the reconciliation of novelistic pleasure and morality. The narrative topics of the edifying novel (characters, places and times), its materiality (titles, internal divisions, groups of works) and voice (narrative and rhetorical) contribute to the development of significations that serve the persuasive and religious aim of the works while creating stories and imaginary worlds capable of satisfying the taste of the audience for the novel. This study aims to reintegrate in the history of the novel a body of works neglected by literary critics by showing their contribution to the development of the novel: the novel of the Old Regime, but also the modern novel of thesis and by extension, the entire ideological fiction.	narration , Seventeenth-century French literature , eighteenth-century French literature , edifying novel , Christianity , rhetoric , narration	en	10805.0
1021	Préoccupations et attentes en réadaptation physique dans des contextes pluralistes : vers un cadre théorique interculturel	This thesis is based on the intercultural and institutional dynamics of health care in pluralistic contexts. The clinical context makes it possible to understand what is at stake in encounters between people of different ethnic and religious backgrounds. The field of physical rehabilitation is a particularly interesting context for understanding these dynamics because interventions require long-term assessment and sustained collaboration on the part of clients. The current research examines three types of actors in this context: immigrant clients, health care specialists (or practitioners), and third party payers (CSST). In order to elaborate an intercultural theoretical framework, the thesis critically examines modernist and postmodernist orientations in anthropology, and through an epistemological approach proposes an interactionist orientation. These differing epistemological orientations are studied from a clinical standpoint and, the resulting analysis prepares the way for a dialogue between practitioners and anthropologists. The ethnographic context sheds light on various themes concerning the politics of healthcare in pluralistic contexts, but also the policies that influence different relationships between macroeconomics and local-level encounters in organizational settings. The system of physical rehabilitation in Quebec serves as a canvas to understand concerns and expectations of the different types actors solicited by this research. The ethnographic data presented here highlights the convergence and divergence between those who are involved in administering and receiving care. After describing the conditions and terms of intervention in the field of physical rehabilitation, there is a discussion of the specificity of immigrant clients and healthcare in pluriethnic contexts. Data collected from different actors highlights the difference between objective barriers to adequate services and factors which can be linked to culture. Analysis of the data focuses on communication in an intercultural or pluriethnic context and the flow of information, carefully examining the relationship between information, expertise and prejudice. The analysis also offers certain pathways to better understand the lack of reactivity in pluralistic contexts. The conclusion proposes a complementary approach which is intended to facilitate a dialogue between models based on discrimination and those on interculturalism. Anthropologists are presented as being particularly well positioned to answer new challenges generated by intercultural situations in an era of neoliberalism.	insertion sociale , discrimination , intervention , Canada , physical rehabilitation , health , reactivity , pluralistic contexts , pluriethnic contexts , handicaps , social insertion , intercultural relations , care , intercultural anthropology , neoliberalism	en	10790.0
1022	Associations entre des polymorphismes génétiques des gènes CHRN et l'étourdissement ressenti lors de l'initiation à la nicotine	Background: Numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in multiple nicotinic receptor genes (CHRN) are associated with smoking. However few studies have examined the association between CHRN SNPs and subjective responses to smoking which may relate to sustained smoking, such as dizziness at first inhalation. The objective of this study was to investigate the association between 61 SNPs in eight CHRN genes (CHRNA3 CHRNA4 CHRNA5, CHRNA6, CHRNA7, CHRNB2, CHRNB3, CHRNB4) and dizziness at first inhalation. Methods: Data were available in a longitudinal cohort investigation of 1293 students 12-13 years old at baseline. Students completed self-report questionnaires at-school every 3 months for 5 years during secondary school, and a mailed self-report questionnaire three years later. DNA extracted from blood or saliva was genotyped for 61 CHRN SNPs selected using a gene tagging approach. Associations were modeled using logistic regression controlling for sex, race and age at first cigarette. Results: The minor alleles of three SNPs in CHRNA6 (rs7812298, rs2304297, rs7828365) were associated a decreased probability of dizziness (OR (95% CI)=0.54(0.36, 0.81), 0.59(0.40,0.86) and 0.58(0.36,0.95, respectively), while one SNP in each of three other genes (rs3743077 (CHRNA3), rs755204 (CHRNA4), rs7178176 (CHRNA7)) was associated with an increased probability of dizziness (OR(95% CI)=1.40 (1.02,1.90), 1.85(1.05,3.27) and 1.51(1.06,2.15), respectively). Conclusion: Thus, several SNPs located in CHRN genes are associated with dizziness at first inhalation, a smoking initiation phenotype that may relate to sustained smoking.	adolescents , SNP , genetic association , nicotinic cholinergic receptors	en	10779.0
1023	Positionnement optimal de l'activité physique pour profiter de l'effet anorexigène	Energy balance (energy expenditure and energy intake) is the central of body weight control. Interestingly, physical activity can suppress appetite and energy intake, a phenomenon also called exercise-induced anorexia. However, orexigenic hormone, which decrease appetite, decreases during exercise to rapidly increase following the effort. Until now, no study has examined the optimal timing of physical activity to maximize this anorexigenic effect and this was the goal of the present thesis. Concretely, this project aimed to determine if energy intake is reduced when exercise immediately precedes the meal compared to a condition in which a pause is present between the exercise and the meal. To do so, twelve non-obese boys (15-20 years old) took part in the study. Each subject was individually evaluated performing the two following tasks in a randomized order: 1) Ex=30-minute exercise bout (70% VO2max) followed immediately by an ad libitum buffet at noon; 2) Expause=30-minute exercise bout (70% VO2max) followed by a 135-minute waiting period and an ad libitum buffet at noon. The visits were preceded by a standardized breakfast and completed with an ad libitum snack in the afternoon and a buffet-type dinner. While results shown that hunger was similar at all times, energy intake at lunch was lower for the Ex condition than for the Expause condition (5,072 vs. 5,718 kJ; p<0.05). No significant difference was noted for the afternoon snack and dinner. Interestingly, caloric intake of fat was lower at lunch, with 1,604 kJ for the Ex condition versus 2,085 kJ for the Ex pause condition (p<0.05). This study is the first to investigate the effect of the timing of physical activity on energy intake, and it reveals that being physically active right before a meal does play a role in energy intake reduction independently of pre-meal appetite sensations. Also, the absence of compensation during the rest of the day suggests that a negative energy balance, including a reduction in lipid consumption, could be more easily obtained by positioning physical activity before a meal.

1024	Contraintes psychosociales au travail et symptômes dépressifs majeurs chez les femmes enceintes	"The goal of our thesis was to evaluate psychosocial work demands and major depressive symptoms among pregnant women. More specifically, we evaluated factors associated with major depressive symptoms, ""high-strain"" or ""Iso-strain"" jobs, and measure the association between those psychosocial work demands and major depressive symptoms among pregnant workers.  Data analyzed are from the Montreal Prematurity Study, a prospective cohort study conducted in Montréal from May 1999 to April 2004. The study looked at prematurity among 5337 pregnant women recruited at 24-26 weeks of pregnancy in four hospitals in Montréal (Québec, Canada). The CES-D scale (Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale) was used to measure major depressive symptoms (CES-D score ≥23). Karasek's abbreviated scale was used to measure psychosocial work demands.  Four scientific articles have been written about the current study and will be submitted to peer-reviewed journals.  The objectives of the first article were to compare the prevalence of major depressive symptoms between subgroups of pregnant women: working women, women who had stopped working, housewives and students; and to identify risk factors for major depressive symptoms during pregnancy. At 24-26 weeks of pregnancy, prevalence of major depressive symptoms was 11.9% (11.0–12.8%) for all pregnant women (N=5 337). Working women had lower rates of major depressive symptoms [7,6% (6,6-8,7%); n=2 514] than housewives, for whom prevalence was highest [19,1% (16,5-21,8%); n=893], followed by women who had stopped working [14,4% (12,7-16,1%); n=1 665] and students [14,3% (10,3-19,1%); n=265]. Personal characteristics (non-occupational) associated with major depressive symptoms were, after adjusting for all variables, employment status, low level of education, low social support outside of work, having experienced acute stressful events, lack of money for basic needs, experiencing marital strain, chronic health problem, country of birth, and smoking.   The objective of the second article was to describe the exposure to psychosocial work demands and to identify factors that are associated among pregnant women in Montréal, Québec (N=3 765). In total, 24.4% of pregnant women were exposed to ""high-strain"" jobs and the proportion of workers exposed to ""Iso-strain"" was 69.1%. Risk factors associated with ""high-strain"" jobs were as follows: low social support at work, some sector of activity and skill level, working over 35 hours a week, irregular schedules, posture at work, lifting loads, young age of mothers, immigration ≥ 5 years, low level of education, single parenthood, and annual household income <$50,000.  The third article evaluated the association between psychosocial work demands and major depressive symptoms among working pregnant women (N=3 765). In bivariate and multivariate analyses, pregnant women who had ""high-strain"" or ""Iso-strain"" jobs were more likely to have major depressive symptoms. Psychosocial work demands were associated with the mental health of pregnant women, when other organizational and personal factors which they encountered outside the work settings were taken into account. Our study confirms accumulated findings related to Karasek and Theorell's ""demand-control"" and ""demand-control-support"" theoretical models. The impact of the ""demand-control-support"" model and the critical role of social support at work have been demonstrated among working pregnant women. The ""buffer"" hypothesis of ""demand-control-support"" model was refuted.   The objectives of the fourth article were as follows: assess exposure to psychosocial work demands among working pregnant women and women on preventive withdrawal from work; and measure the association between psychosocial work demands and major depressive symptoms, according to time of withdrawal from work (N=3 043). At 24-26 weeks of pregnancy, women on preventive withdrawal from work (31.4%) had been more exposed to ""high-strain"" jobs (31.1% vs. 21.1%) and ""Iso-strain"" (21.0% vs. 14.2%) than those who continued to work (p<0.0001), and had higher proportions of major depressive symptoms. After adjustment for personal and professional risk factors, ""Iso-strain"" remained significantly associated with major depressive symptoms in working women and women on preventive withdrawal from work, regardless of duration of activity before withdrawal (4 to 12 weeks/ 13 to 20 weeks/ ≥21 weeks).   Psychosocial work demands are an important risk factor for the mental health of pregnant workers. Despite the application of preventive measures during pregnancy, screening and intervention measures should be implemented in workplaces to reduce the prevalence of prenatal mental health problems and exposure to psychosocial work demands so as to prevent maternal and neonatal complications. In addition, prenatal depression is the main risk factor for postpartum depression, and infants born of mothers who suffer from depression are at higher risk of prematurity and low birth weight."

1025	La contribution de la stéréoscopie à la constance de forme	This study was conducted to evaluate the contribution of stereopsis to the shape constancy phenomenon. Four groups of eight participants each were asked to perform a visual exploration task. The first group was exposed to a stereoscopic stimulation, the second group was exposed to a reversed stereoscopic stimulation, the third group was exposed to a monocular stimulation with textures and shadow and the fourth group was exposed to a monocular stimulation with shadow only. Response times and error rates were used to measure participant's performance. Results show an interaction between rotation effects (familiar viewpoints vs. non-familiar viewpoints) and available depth cues (stereopsis, reversed stereopsis, textures and shadow, shadow only). The rotation cost was smaller in the group exposed to a reversed stereoscopic stimulation. These results are congruent with the use of tridimensional representations underlying visual processing.

1026	Le chant des amusiques : prédictions d'une dissociation entre les habiletés perceptives et vocales	Our goal was to examine to what extent vocal and perceptual pitch-matching abilities were related in congenital amusia. To do this, we asked 13 amusics and 12 matched controls to perform four tasks, including two pitch perception tasks and two vocal imitation tasks. We controlled for any timbral translation by recording the participants singing and using it as stimuli across most tasks. Results showed great variability in both perceptual and vocal imitation tasks in amusics, while controls had good performances on all tasks. We illustrated how some amusics could retain good perceptual pitch-matching abilities while being unable to perform well in the vocal tasks, and how some amusics could perform well in the vocal imitation tasks. These results help illustrate the potential for these abilities to be independent. However, further studies are required to fully understand their relation.	perception , congenital amusia , pitch perception , singing , perception	en	10729.0
1027	La phénoménologie de l’attention chez Husserl et l’idée d’une phénoménologie thérapeutique	The main objective of the present essay is to show that the central philosophical gesture in Husserlian phenomenology – the transcendental ἐποχή – beyond its methodological usefulness, possesses an inherent ethico-therapeutic value. It is by way of an in-depth study of the theme of attention in Husserl, and of its connections to the will, the ego and to language, that we will uncover the ethical value specific to the ἐποχή, but also to Husserl’s philosophy as a whole. Indeed, we will argue that it is the “humanist” aim – in line with the traditional German ideal of Bildung (the moral and cultural edification of mankind) – that allows us to better grasp the global project of our author, on the one hand, and to distance ourselves from the technicist tendency of the modern sciences of the mind, on the other.

1028	Le désir d'éternité : réflexion autour de la notion de plénitude chez Charles Taylor	This M.A. thesis unfolds a reflexion upon the concept of fullness as developed by Charles Taylor, especially in his book A Secular Age, in which the idea of fullness is intrinsically connected with modernity, belief and unbelief. For Taylor, the understanding of modernity implies a grasping of the change that allowed the transition from a context where unbelief in God was considered inconceivable to a context where belief remains only an option. That change consists essentially in a modification of our very representation of fullness. What is fullness for Charles Taylor? It is the condition to which any human being tends towards, and which implies an answer, unspoken or not, to the question of the meaning of life. My main goal will be the understanding of the nature of fullness as conceived by Charles Taylor. I shall show that the twofold definition of fullness in A Secular Age generates a tension between fullness conceived as a unique event, and fullness conceived as a constant aspiration towards meaning (which identifies with goodness). I shall suggest a resolution of this tension through an understanding of fullness which aims to restore its fundamental unity – the idea being to grasp the notion of fullness as a unique event and as the constant aspiration to meaning not separately, but in their relationship with one other. This interpretation model, provided by the idea of eternity, which is also present in A Secular Age, will allow me to establish a coincidence between the pursuit of fullness and the desire of eternity. Both of them share the same fundamental aim: through the inscription of qualitatively privileged and unique moments, constituents of life, in the very totality of this life, they aim to reveal its meaning and to bestow permanence to it. Moreover, I will argue from this coincidence between fullness and eternity that the quest for fullness doesn’t necessarily imply a religious perspective as unfolded in A Secular Age, but can lead rather to a form of transcendence that one can qualify as « temporal ».

1029	Environnement et légitimité morale de l'ordre constitutionnel libéral	The environmental crisis threatens the fundamental values of the political liberal tradition. As the autonomy, the security and the prosperity of persons and peoples are jeopardized by political inaction, the legitimacy of the liberal constitutional order is compromised. Because of important collective action problems, the democratic processes are unfit to address the present crisis and protect adequately the natural environment. Two institutional solutions deemed capable of preserving the legitimacy of the functional domination at the heart of social order are analyzed. The first is the constitutionalization of a right to an adequate natural environment, which purports to circumvent the paralysis of legislative power. The second is the declaration of a limited state of emergency and the use of exceptional powers, which purports to circumvent the paralysis of both legislative and judiciary powers. Despite their legitimacy, the diligent application of these political solutions remains improbable.

1030	Être et image : une approche de la notion de sujet chez Maître Eckhart	The following dissertation attemps to establish the presence of certain conceptual motives pertaining to the modern conception of subjectivity (as exemplified by the cartesian understanding of the self), in the middle-high german works of Master Eckhart of Hochheim, philosopher, theologian and predicator who was born in 1260 and died in 1328. In order to do so, it develops a three-fold argument taking place over three chapters, each of which presents a different approach - a different perspective - on Eckhart’s thought. The first chapter presents an ontological argument designed to explicitate the meaning of the key eckhartian notions of being, nothingness, intellect and image, whereas the second chapter exploits the existential consequences of Eckhart’s outlook on those notions – consequences which in ethical terms translate into the necessity for the human individual to practice a systematic annihilation of oneself in order to achieve an absolutely pure union with God. The third and last chapter of this dissertation attemps to explicitate de notion of “I” (ich), used by Eckhart to designate the identity that the detached human soul and God share, a type of identity in which we find similarities with the modern conception of the self – conception which Heidegger thought of as being entirely absent from precartesian philosophy.

1031	La connaissance de soi chez Thomas d’Aquin : l’auto-intellection humaine et le moi	The purpose of this thesis is to present the different theories of self-knowledge developed by Thomas Aquinas: namely reditio incompleta, refraction of the soul on its own phantasms, preconscious reflection, reflection by reflux, abstract analysis, critical judgment and reditio completa. Although the human soul cannot have knowledge of itself directly, it can however approach its essence with its own acts or acts of consciousness. The analysis is based on the cognitio habitualis, habitus of all knowledge, that is the root of the trinitarian image in humankind and that guarantees the truth of human intellection. This involved translating questions 87 to 89 of the Summa Theologiae, in which Aquinas considers humanity’s understanding of immaterial substances and the separate soul’s knowledge. This demonstrates how the human soul shares common ground with other substances of the universe.

1032	Un tragique de l'ébranlement : usages et enjeux de la catharsis dans Le Sang des promesses (Littoral, Incendies, Forêts, Ciels) de Wajdi Mouawad	This master's dissertation addresses Wajdi Mouawad's Blood Promises tetralogy, composed of the plays Tideline, Scorched, Forests, and Skies. As it focuses on the return of the concept of catharsis in discourses on contemporary theater, it aims to question theater's capacity to develop a thought of the living-together (vivre-ensemble). The first chapter focuses on the status of tragedy and the tragic as well as on the revisiting of several mythological Greek characters in Mouawad's tetralogy, whereas the second chapter takes an interest in contemporary manifestations of catharsis, as they involve the emotions of fear and compassion, and, in the case of Mouawad's work, particularly depend on the importance of acts of language. Finally, the third chapter attempts to link the cathartic to Jan Patočka's concept of the solidarity of the shaken, before it proceeds to analyze the critical reception of Mouawad's plays in order to underline their specific cathartic effect.

To do this, a theoretical analysis of specific aspects processed in the structural and temporal integration of linguistic or musical elements when being processed on-line is essential. Our goal is to question whether a musical training would benefit the aphasic population (Broca) with agrammatism, especially on processing syntactic structures.	agrammatism , Broca's aphasia , music , semantic , musical training	en	10690.0
1034	«Tu ne tueras plus!» : une étude du processus de «recivilisation» de la société ouest-allemande d’après les catéchismes catholiques (1945-1970)	Among scholars who have studied contemporary Germany, many consider that by perpetrating such a barbaric crime as the Holocaust, the Third Reich caused a “rupture of civilizationˮ (Zivilisationsbruch) in the history of the Western world. These experts have reflected on the meaning as well as on the historical and philosophical consequences of the Holocaust for the contemporary world. However, very few of them have examined the other side of this “rupture of civilizationˮ, i.e. the “recivilizingˮ process that occurred in West German society during the first postwar decades. Characterized by the rejection of violence and militarism, the restoration of elementary norms of civility and the growing importance attached to civic values such as democracy and human rights, this process explains how, within barely two decades, West Germans succeeded in building a stable and democratic state on the ruins of a genocidal dictatorship. Using the presentation of the Decalogue in the Catholic catechisms, this master’s thesis examines the role attributed to religious moral norms in the “recivilizingˮ process of West German society. It intends to show that during the 1950s and 1960s the Catholic catechisms published in the FRG presented numerous signs of a “recivilizingˮ will, which consisted in a particular attention to issues of war and peace, an updated view of parental authority and the adoption of a conception of civil authority based on the fulfilment of civic duties rather than on sheer obedience to hierarchy.

1035	La loi mémorielle de 2005 et la réaction des historiens. Perspective sur la pédagogie de la mémoire dans les cours d'histoire	The memorial law of February 23, 2005 created quite an uproar in France. Historians spearheaded the opposition, as the act collided head on with the very basis of their profession. Actually, the law of 2005 advocated the obligation for them to teach the positive values of French colonization, a recommendation that contradicted the freedom of thought essential to their role as historians. This dissertation analyzes how historians reacted in order to work out their positions and their understanding of the crisis. It sheds new light on the memorial crisis of 2005 and assesses what historians wrote and acted upon in the wake of the law. It turns out that the crisis was more complex than the interpretation given by historians. In this respect, the study underlines the importance of the public arena in the relationship between memorial communities and historians. To that effect, schools symbolize the meeting ground of memory and history.  The dissertation also examines the teaching of history in a school environment affected by memorial tensions. In response to these memorial excesses, historians have a duty to uphold intellectual rigor in school as well as in public space in general.	France , Memory , Law , Teaching , Colonization	en	10682.0
1036	Une comparaison entre l’utilisation des troupes africaines par la France et l’Allemagne pendant la Première Guerre mondiale	During World War I, the Western powers were forced to deploy every resource available to prevail. In the German colonies, the defence was conducted by the Schutztruppe, the protectorate forces composed mainly by black Africans. France, for her part, feared the demographic imbalance with Germany and so decided to reinforce her forces with African troops, the Tirailleurs Sénégalais being the most numerous. The present thesis aims to analyze and compare the recruitment and deployment of both countries, particularly the ideology that buttressed each case, the relations between Africans and Europeans during the war, the contribution of Africans to the war effort, as well as the implications of the increased visibility of Africans in European society. Overall, it is possible to observe remarkable similarities between France and Germany, particularly the fact that their utilization of colonial troops served to justify their own colonial policies and to demonize the opponent’s.

1037	La responsabilité sociale des entreprises transnationales : études de cas sur les audits sociaux et les droits des travailleurs en Chine	Current regulation of global supply chains mainly relies on non state mechanisms such as codes of conduct and social audits implemented by corporations, non governmental organizations (NGOs) and international organizations. This research seeks to assess if the audits carried out by Nike, Adidas and Puma can help strengthen the rights of Chinese workers. Through field work interviews conducted with auditors and NGOs, four basic conditions were defined and involve direct participation of workers, local capacity building, respect of freedom of association and professionalization of social auditors. The outcome of the study reveals progress still needs to be achieved for audits to become tools for the advancement of fundamental rights. The primary issue remains the development of democratic systems to allow workers to form free unions and negotiate their own collective labour agreements.

1038	Les pratiques entourant le programme d'hébergement avec encadrement intensif : une analyse qualitative de la perception des intervenants	This dissertation outlines practices regarding the placement in intensive supervision unit for youth centers since the advent of the reform. This was influenced by polemics and controversies caused by the belief that this measure does not respect the rights of young people by restraining their freedom. The intensive supervision unit was perceived by lawyers as illegal because no legal basis existed. To resolve this debate, the legislature established in the Youth Protection Act, in 2007, the article 11.1.1 that now frames the use of this measure. To know the effects of this reform in the practices of counsellors, qualitative interviews were conducted with twenty-five employees of youth centers in Montreal and Laval. Despite some implementation difficulties and some signs of resistance to change, the results suggest that this reform enhances the rights of young people. About living conditions, major changes are at the heavy profile of the clientele and the overcrowding intensive supervision units. Also, the mix profiles on the rehabilitation of youth is discussed and analyzed in terms of the concept of socio-cultural inertia and in regard of respecting human children rights.

1039	Molecular Networks Created by Charge-Assisted Hydrogen Bonds Between Bis(aminidinium) Cations and Carboxylates, Sulfonates, Phosphonates and Phosphates	The goal of this study is to learn how to create new molecular materials by design. At present, there is no general method for predicting structures and properties, but significant progress is being made, particularly in making ordered molecular materials such as crystals. In such materials, organization can be controlled effectively by the strategy of molecular tectonics. This approach uses molecules called “tectons”, which can associate in ways directed by predictable non-covalent interactions. In this way, the position of each molecule relative to its neighbors can be programmed with a high degree of reliability to create crystals and other ordered materials with desirable structural features and properties. The work that we will describe focuses on using the association of bis(aminidinium) cations with carboxylates, sulfonates, and phosphates to create predictable molecular networks. Such networks promise to be unusually robust because they are held together by multiple charge-assisted hydrogen bonds.

1040	Entre modernité et tradition : le cas du yoga du Cachemire à Montréal	The ancient practice of Yoga has seen a phenomenal revival in the last forty years.  It has become integrated into a world in which the individual and their relationship with their environment are no longer perceived the same way; yoga conveys malleable concepts, custom-fitting to the ever-changing Western landscape.  The province of Quebec, and more specifically the city of Montreal which is the site of my ethnography, has a rich religious past and present where one finds an effervescence of new spiritualities that have developed since the Quiet Revolution of the 1960s.   In this setting, I discovered a form of yoga originating from the northwestern Indian region of Kashmir and which is founded on the traditions of “non-dualistic tantric kashmir sivaism”.  This form of yoga is not yet well known, despite having been studied by academics in India, France, England, Italy, United States, and Canada.  It is referred to as “traditional” owing to its non-dualistic orientation of its teachings, based on the tantras.  Kashmirian yoga, which is fundamentally based on the senses and tactile exploration, does not exhibit the same characteristics as other mainstream yogas such as ashtanga, Iyengar, or hatha.   Our ethnographic exploration focuses on the members of this group and the practice and discourse of its teacher.  The members, predominantly of French-Canadian origin, grasp this approach and its soteriology with a uniquely identifiable cultural-religious background, whether it be at the level of the body, ideas, or an amalgamation they envision.  The teacher presents the practice as the direct application of the doctrines expressed in the traditional sciptures, the tantras, of Kashmirian Saiva tradition. The practice of Kashmirian yoga therefore seeks to remain traditional while nonetheless being acculturated within the contemporary context in which it is taught.  It is therefore crucial to comprehend the dynamics inherent in this process of transposition of tradition within a contemporary context. It is therefore this process of construction and transformation that we will attempt to explain; the latter seemingly established between traditional continuity and the breach of redefined and reinvented elements.  We will see that within this dynamic, observed as frequently in its discourse as in its practice, the limits are not as hermetic as they may appear, rather the concepts of cultural identity and temporality clash, building up one on top the other in a incessant and living movement.

1041	Interactions sociales et réseaux sociaux en économique : modélisation et estimation	This thesis includes three essays on social interactions in economics, both from a theoretical and applied perspective. The first essay (chapter 2) focusses on the (theoretical and empirical) study of a network formation process in small economies characterized by the fact that individuals have homophilic preferences and a time constraint. The second essay (chapter 3) is focussed on the study (mostly empirical) of a network formation process in large economies characterized by the fact that distant individuals have approximately independent behaviours. The last essay (chapter 4) is an empirical study of peer effects in education for Quebec high-school teenagers. The structural method used allows for the identification and estimation of the endogenous peer effect and the exogenous peer effects, while controlling for the presence of common shocks.

1042	Différents procédés statistiques pour détecter la non-stationnarité dans les séries de précipitation	The main goal of this master's thesis is to find whether the summer convective precipitations simulated  by the Canadian Regional Climate Model (CRCM) are stationary over time or not.  In order to answer that question, we propose both a frequentist and Bayesian statistical methodology. For the frequentist approach, we used  standard quality control and the CUSUM to determine if the mean has increased over the years. For the Bayesian approach, we compared the posterior distributions of the precipitations over time. In order to do the comparison, we  used a statistic based on the Hellinger's distance, the J-divergence and the L2 norm.  In this master's thesis, we  used the ARL (average run length) to calibrate each of our methods. Therefore, a big part of this thesis is about studying the actual property of the ARL. Once our tools are well calibrated, we  used the simulation to compare them together. Finally, we studied the data from the CRCM to decide, whether or not, the data are stationary.

1043	Les écrits du Sous-Commandant Marcos, vers une réhabilitation de la fonction heuristique et critique de l'utopie	This thesis focuses on the heuristic and critical character of the utopian discourse, as it will be demonstrated through the Subcomandante Marcos’ writings, which present an exemplary case of the mechanisms at play in the utopian discourse. Starting with the operational definition of utopia as an expression of a social imagination resulting from a utopian practice whose function would be to criticize the ideological nature of spatiotemporal representations imposed by the dominant order and, subsequently questioning the contemporary dominant order and the spatial nature of its hegemony with the help of Henri Lefebvre and David Harvey’s works, the objective will be to demonstrate how, in his texts, Marcos produces an alternative representational space in which a mechanism of neutralization of oppositions (Louis Marin), an epoché, a judgment suspension occur, that is the only condition of possibility for overcoming the dominant order constraints in the realm of discourse and representations.

1044	L'économie criminelle de la Camorra et la pratique discursive des différents points de vue dans Gomorra de Roberto Saviano	This thesis will study the Italian literary phenomenon Gomorra, viaggi nell'impero economico e nel sogno di dominio della Camorra. First, the focus will be on the text's hybrid nature and implications and also on its literary and intellectual inspirations (such as Truman Capote, Pier Paolo Pasolini and Leonardo Sciascia). Secondly, we will take a closer look at the structure of the novel's narrative and its literary details, in order to reveal the different processes used by Roberto Saviano to convince the reader. Interwoven in this book's central plot, we will find a main obsession: the need to understand.    Lastly, we will discuss the question of the great power treated in this novel, the one of a criminal organisation transformed by the revelations made throughout the story. These revelations will allow us to draw interesting comparisons between organized crime and merchant capitalism. For this part, we will refer to Guy Debord's La société du spectacle, and to Hannah Arendt's work on the question of totalitarianism. All of these elements will allow us to discuss the different perspectives within the narrative's framework, and more precisely, the figure of the narrator/author/character that gives Saviano's novel anthropological qualities, in the form of an ethnofiction (Augé).

1045	Simulation des fonctions de texture bidirectionnelles	The realism of objects in computer graphics requires adequate simulation of their appearence under different light/view directions and at various scales. A solution commonly adopted by researchers consists in measuring the reflectance of a real surface by means of calibrated devices. The measured data is encoded in the form of a reflectance model (BRDF) or a texture of reflectance (BTF). Despite significant progress in this area, the measured appearence data remain very infrequently used. This reluctance could be explained by two main reasons: (1) the limited number of high-quality measured materials and (2) the huge storage space required by the data. In this work, we suggest resolving these two problems from the angle of simulation. We consider that the level of realism in rendered images already produces satisfactory results with current techniques. Therefore, we propose to precompute and encode the effects of lighting on a completely synthetic micro-geometry, which will be applied on surfaces. This production pipeline being already well adopted by artists, it should better fit into their realizations. To ensure that this model also respects the requirements of multi-scale representations, we also propose an adaptation of the BTF to a MIP map encoding.

1046	Les perceptions de la sexualité et les relations de couple de femmes haïtiennes immigrantes au Québec : pour une exploration des rapports hommes femmes en Haïti	The purpose of this research was to explore the perceptions of Haitian women that had immigrated to Quebec in the past five years, of their sexual relationships with men and the extent to which it is reflected in the different types of conjugal relationships.  After choosing a qualitative research method, the intersectional feminist theory has been adopted for the analysis. Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted with 9 Haitian women, aged 18 and 60 years and having immigrated to Quebec in the past five years. The women’s perceptions of sexual relationships have been reported as being a set of practices and discourses interrelated built since childhood and reproducing the unequal relationships between men and women that exist in the Haitian society and in the couples. These unequal relationships are transmitted through the generations and through most of the social institutions such as family, school, culture, laws. This process is also influenced by socio-economic and power issues.  The results of this research give scientific data on women sexuality and couple relationships as well as the influence of immigration process. These results also emphasize the need for the Haitian social work to encourage the development of economic empowerment of women and their participation in current debates in society on the development of women.

1047	La leptospirose féline : sondage sérologique et de PCR urinaire chez des chats sains et des chats atteints de maladie rénale	Leptospirosis is a globally widespread zoonosis, with prevalence in cats varying from 8.8% to 35% depending on geographical localization. Although serologic evidence of feline exposure exists, clinical disease is rarely reported.  This study aimed to compare seropositivity and urinary PCR status for Leptospira spp. between healthy cats (H) and cats with kidney disease (KD: acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic KD stages IIb, III and IV).  The analytical sensitivity and specificity of the PCR performed by the Laboratoire de Diagnostic Moléculaire of the FMV were evaluated. In vitro validation showed that the PCR technique is effective for determining the presence of pathogenic leptospires in the urine of cats. A total of 251 cats were recruited, from which 240 cats were enrolled. Cats were enrolled from January 2010 to March 2012 and divided into two groups, H (n=125) and KD (n=115), based on complete blood count, serum biochemistry profile and urinalysis. Leptospira spp. serology by microscopic agglutination test (titers ≥ 1:100 considered positive) and urinary PCR were performed in all cats. Predicted seropositivity for Leptospira spp. was statistically different between groups; being 5% and 13,7% in the H and KD groups respectively (p=0.02).  Serovars involved were Pomona (n=16), Bratislava (n=8) and Grippotyphosa (n=1), with titers being significantly higher for Pomona (p=0.04). The excretory status was confirmed by a positive urine PCR in eight cats. Of the 26 seropositive cats, four (H=2, KD=2) were also PCR positive. The prevalence of PCR positive cats was higher in the KD group (5.3%; 6/113) compared with the H group (1.6%; 2/125), but the difference between groups did not reach statistical significance (0.9% in H, 5.5% in KD; p=0.09). Age, sex and rural versus urban environment did not influence serologic or PCR status for Leptospira spp. Predicted seropositivity was greater between June and August (p =0.02) and in known hunters (p<0.01). The presence of another cat at home also increased significantly the predicted seropositivity (p<0.01), although the presence of a dog did not. When evaluating the PCR status of cats in the GEE model for individually tested variables, only the variables “contact with raccoons” and “contact with skunks” were statistically significant (P ≤  .03).  Although the precise role of Leptospira spp. as an etiologic agent of feline KD remains unclear, the significant difference in the serologic status found between H and KD cats suggests that it may be an under-diagnosed cause of KD in cats. Several asymptomatic carriers were identified, suggesting that cats could be underestimated players in the transmission of the bacteria to humans.

1048	Optimisation et évaluation d’un nouveau test PAMPA amélioré pour la prédiction de l’absorption intestinale de médicaments	"This essay reports the optimization and evaluation of a new version of the Parallel Artificial Membrane Permeability Assay (PAMPA), called Neo-PAMPA. This test, used for the prediction of the drugs’ intestinal absorption, involves the use of a model intestine cell membrane in which a lipid bilayer is supported on a polymeric cushion deposited on a filter.  In this project, we are interested in the development of an artificial membrane that is more representative of the human intestinal wall. We determined, based on a comparative study of the properties of 8 drug candidates and their permeability coefficients obtained, that polycarbonate filters were the best choice of solid support for the membrane. We also verified the deposition time of the polydopamine cushion that brings the fluid nature to our membrane. The results from the permeability tests showed that the polymer cushion do not clog the pores of the filter after a 4h deposition. Then, we studied the deposition of the lipid bilayer on the polydopamine-coated filter. To do this, two methods of liposome preparation as well as several liposome sizes were tested. Moreover, several phospholipid compositions were tested. According to our evaluation, liposomes prepared according to the ""lipid film"" method from a mixture of DOPC and cholesterol are better suited. Nevertheless, a final optimization step for the bilayer deposition is still required. Finally, the gold standard Caco-2 assay used to assess the drug permeability across a monolayer of human Colon Colorectal adenocarcinoma cells was successfully implemented for permeability data comparison."

1049	Propriétés optiques dans l'infrarouge des nanotubes de carbone et du graphène	Carbon nanotubes and graphene are sp2 hybridized carbon nanostructures which electrical and optical properties raise considerable interest for the design of a new generation of electronic devices and optically active materials. However, many challenges remain before their implementation in industrial processes on a large scale. Materials chemistry, especially covalent functionalization, is a privileged avenue to resolve the difficulties related to the processing of these nanostructures. Covalent functionalization, however, disrupts the sp2 carbon nanostructures’ crystalline structure, and pertubs not only said electrical properties, but also the deriving optical properties. It is therefore essential to characterize the effects of defects and disorder in order to understand their consequences, but also to potentially exploit the benefits. This thesis deals with the optical properties in the infrared of carbon nanotubes and graphene, with the aim to understand and explain the fundamental mechanisms at the origin of the optical response in the infrared of sp2 carbon nanostructures. Subject to strict selection rules, infrared spectroscopy measures the high frequency AC conductivity of materials in an energy range corresponding to molecular vibrations, phonon modes and low energy electronic excitations. Our experimental method is therefore to explore a parameter space defined by the three axes that are i. the dimensionality of the material, ii. the chemical potential, and iii. the disorder level, which allows us to identify the various contributions to optical properties in the infrared of sp2 carbon nanostructures. At first, we focus on the infrared spectroscopy of single-walled carbon nanotubes as a function of doping and disorder level. We start by amending the commonly accepted origin of single-walled carbon nanotubes vibrational spectra. Using controlled chemical doping experiments, we show that the anomalies in the carbon nanotube spectra appear through electron-phonon interactions. The Fano resonance model provides a phenomenological explanation for the observations. Then, we establish the existence of localized states induced by covalent functionalization, which appear as a surface plasmon polariton resonance (nanoantenna) contributing to the terahertz conductivity peak. Control of the disorder level in carbon nanotube films allows us to observe the evolution of the nanoantenna resonance. We therefore conclude to an effective segmentation of the nanotubes by the grafts. Finally, we show that disorder activates phonon modes that are usually forbidden by infrared spectroscopy’s selection rules. Disorder-induced infrared activity originates from elastic collisions on defects that give access to phonon modes with non-zero wave vectors. In a second part, we focus on the properties of graphene. First, we demonstrate an electrografting method to rapidly functionalize graphene with high-density, regardless of the substrate. Subsequently, we use electrografting to show that disorder activates chemical potential dependent anomalies in the vibrational spectra of single-layer graphene. These anomalies are absent in the spectra of pristine samples. In order to explain this phenomenon, we present a theory based on the interaction of intraband optical transitions, phonon modes and elastic collisions. We conclude by studying the infrared spectra of graphene with bilayer islands, for which we propose to review the nature of the coupling mechanism in the light of our findings on single-layer graphene.	carbon nanotubes , graphene , infrared spectroscopy , electron-phonon interactions , Fano resonance , disorder , defects , covalent functionalization	en	10539.0
1050	“All work and no play … ?” : a critical investigation of an emerging public health discourse on children’s play	In many industrialised societies a high value is attributed to children’s play, mainly because it is deemed an essential component of childhood development and due to the conviction that play contributes to children’s happiness and well-being. However, concerns have arisen about the changing patterns of, and declines in, children’s play, especially outdoors. These have largely been attributed to increasing perceptions of risk in outdoor play and to societal changes popularising more structured and organised activities. Recently, the concerns about declining play, the mounting preoccupation with children’s sedentary ‘lifestyles’, and the focus on childhood obesity prevention have converged in public health discourses, and public health organisations have begun to promote active play as a way to increase children’s physical activity. What appears to be emerging is a public health discourse on children’s play.  Through four articles, this thesis explores the emerging public health discourse on play and examines some of its potential effects. Article 1 is a position paper and provides a frame for the thesis findings. It presents the central argument of the research, outlines the emerging positions that public health organisations are taking on play and also discusses how these positions may be problematic for children’s play. The thesis then discursively examines how the notion of play is being taken up by public health. Article 2 addresses this uptake through a discursive analysis of 150 public health documents addressing children’s health, physical activity, obesity, leisure and play. This article examines what values and assumptions underlie the promotion of play for children’s physical health and analyses how play is being shaped, disciplined and normalised in the public health discourse. It shows that within the public health context, play is viewed as a productive health activity for children, and that pleasure is drawn on to promote physical activity. Furthermore, children also appear to be encouraged to self-govern their leisure time for it to be health promoting.  Concerned with how the public health discourse may be shaping the way children engage and construct their own meanings and experiences of play, this thesis also examined the photographic and narrative constructions of play among 25 children 7 to 11 years old. Children’s photographs and narratives about play were analysed in Article 3. Children in this study suggested that importantly, play for them was an end in itself; that it was primarily emotionally important, intrinsically motivated and purposeless. This runs through all of the findings of the article, which suggest that enjoyable play is both active and inactive, that some children have a sense of ambivalence regarding scheduled forms of play, and that risk is sometimes considered an especially pleasurable component of play. These findings point to a dissonance between the forms of play promoted in public health and the meanings attributed to play by children.   Drawing on the Foucault-inspired analytical concept of biopedagogies, the fourth article in this thesis places the two components of this study in dialogue (i.e., Canadian public health discourse on play and children’s constructions of play). The findings suggest that while the public health discourse around ‘active play’ is taken up and reproduced by some children, other children highlight sedentary play as important for social and emotional well-being. Indeed, while ‘active play’ is deemed a solution to the risk of obesity within the public health discourses, it also embodies contradictions regarding risk in play for children, which children appear to have to negotiate. This article suggests that the public health discourse appears to enable some representations of play (i.e., active) and obscure others (i.e., sedentary), and that this may be having the unintended consequence of reshaping and narrowing the meanings that children attribute to their own play.  This thesis does not aim to provide directions for how play ought to be better addressed in public health. Rather, drawing on the critical work of Michel Foucault, this thesis presents an analysis of the emerging public health discourse on play. This work underscores relevant areas upon which public health ought to further critically reflect, particularly with respect to research concerning children. Importantly, considering the possible effects of this discourse on children’s play, this thesis concludes by emphasising the contingency of the current perspectives on play.

1051	Vers un marché du carbone au Québec : éléments de réflexion à la lumière de l'analyse économique du droit	As part of the launch of the Western Climate Initiative, the province of Québec has implemented on January 1st, 2012, one of the first carbon emissions trading system in North America (CETS). Such a system could in time become part of the emerging regulated market for carbon on the continent. However, it belongs to a category of economic instruments still timidly explored in legal literature. The CETS forms part of the economic regulation of the environment and is based on concepts drawn from the economic theory such as scarcity, property and the market. The thesis aims at contributing to the dialogue between jurists and economists around the design and implementation of this type of instrument.  In order to explore its architecture and uncover the legal issues at play, we applied the teachings of law and economics in order to reveal the underlying dynamics of incitation and efficiency built in the CETS regulations and highlight the pivotal role played by the formulation of legal rules in their operationalization. The exploration is conducted through a progressive modelling of the exchange of emission rights, which takes into account transaction costs. The resulting model brings to light friction points that are likely to occur at different stages of the exchange of emission rights and might negatively impact its economic efficiency.  The thesis contributes to the advancement of knowledge by offering jurists a coherent and intelligible legal analysis of the rules governing the exchange of emission rights in the CETS. Thus, it provides a systematic arrangement of these rules structured around the diversification strategies of the exchange and the institutionalization of its terms. It also raises market surveillance issues, particularly of the carbon derivatives market, in a context of fragmentation of market authorities.

1052	Carence en œstrogènes et bases moléculaires du métabolisme des triglycérides et du cholestérol dans le foie et l'intestin : effet de l'exercice physique	Hepatic steatosis and plasma lipid profile deterioration are metabolic diseases favored by post-menopausal estrogen deficiency. However, mechanisms underlying these diseases have not been systematically adressed. The aim of this thesis was to investigate molecular mechanisms causing hypercholesterolemia and lipids (triglycerides: TG and cholesterol) accumulation in the liver using animal model of menopause, the ovariectomized (Ovx) Sprague Dawley rat. We also examined whether lifestyle modifications such as physical activity can prevent or correct changes induced by Ovx. Finally, rosuvastatin (statine) was used as a pharmacological therapy of hypercholesterolemia in order to understand its effect at the molecular level in Ovx rats. The first study was designed to determine how the Ovx may affect levels of TG and cholesterol in the liver of rats fed a high-fat diet (HF: 42% fat). Rats were submitted to a HF or a normal diet for 6 weeks prior to Ovx or being sham operated, and then kept on the same diets for another 6 weeks. The Ovx increased liver TG content, but not the HF diet alone. However, the combination of Ovx and HF diet resulted in a greater liver TG accumulation than that observed in Ovx submitted to normal diet. The mRNA levels of CPT-1, PGC1 and PPARα involved in liver lipid oxidation significantly increased in rats fed the HF diet (p ˂ 0.001; p ˂ 0.01; p ˂ 0.05 respectively); but this increase was substantially less if HF fed rats were Ovx (p ˂ 0.05; p ˂ 0.05; p ˂ 0.07 respectively), thus favouring TG accumulation in the liver. The combination of HF diet and Ovx also induced hypercholesterolemia and an increase in liver total cholesterol content, in spite of the reduction of liver HMGCoA-r gene expression, the key enzyme for cholesterol synthesis. This was also associated with a decrease of liver CYP7a1 gene expression, suggesting a reduction in bile acids synthesis. Having found in the first study that the Ovx increases liver and plasma cholesterol levels, we aimed in the second study at determining the effects of Ovx on gene expression of hepatic and intestinal transporters and enzymes involved in cholesterol and bile acids metabolism; and to verify whether treadmill exercise could prevent or correct changes induced by Ovx. The Ovx resulted in hypercholesterolemia associated with a reduction in gene expression of hepatic low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R), lipoprotein remnants receptor (LRP1), SREBP-2 and PCSK9, suggesting a failure in the clearance of plasma lipoproteins particles. The Ovx also inhibited the expression of MTP and stimulated that of SR-B1 in the liver, but no change was observed with CYP7a1. These molecular changes might, therefore, favor cholesterol accumulation in the liver. Exercise training did not correct the deleterious effects caused by Ovx on gene expression of these molecular markers in the liver with the exception of SREBP-2. However, in the intestine (ileum) treadmill exercise reduced gene expression of molecular markers involved in the absorption of bile acids (OSTα/β, FXR, RXRα, Fgf15) and cholesterol (LXRα, NCP1L1) in Sham trained rats compared to sedentary rats. This could prevent the development of cholestasis and hypercholesterolemia protecting partially against the onset of atherosclerosis. In view of the deleterious effects (hypercholesterolemia and decreased in gene expression of LDL-R, PCSK9, LRP1, SREBP-2 and HMGCoA-r in the liver) caused by Ovx on cholesterol metabolism observed in the second study, the 3rd study was designed to test the effect of rosuvastatin (Ros) on gene expression of these molecular markers in Ovx sedentary rats or in Ovx rats submitted to voluntary training. Ros was injected to Ovx rats subcutaneously at dose of 5mg/kg/day during 21 days from the ninth week after ovariectomy. Ros failed to decrease plasma LDL-C and TC in Ovx rats. In contrast, Ros increased (P ˂ 0.05) PCSK9, SREBP-2, LRP1, HMGCoA-r and ACAT2 but not significantly (P ˂ 0.3) LDL-R mRNA in the Ovx sedentary and trained rat liver. Ros failed to decrease plasma LDL-C in Ovx rats probably because of a stronger induction of PCSK9 than LDL-R gene expression. However by increasing LRP1 expression, Ros could decrease circulating lipoprotein remnants and, therefore, protects partially against the onset of cardiovascular diseases. In conclusion, the studies of this thesis indicate that the decrease of ovarian estrogen levels causes radical changes in hepatic TG and cholesterol metabolism caused by alterations in the expression of key genes associated with metabolic pathways.

1053	Las visiones y los mundos: depredación, transformación y equilibrio en discursos de la Amazonía occidental	This dissertation delves into the knowledge-practices of Amazonian peoples, drawing on discourses produced by members of these nations. It explores sacred songs, stories and academic texts of ancient Indian thinkers. The dissertation signals that Amazonian practices belong to a context of meanings which consider that all living beings have thoughts and spirit; that spiritual beings defend these living beings against possible abuses. Human beings must transcend their state of consciousness, navigate the invisible worlds and establish communication with these spirits to uphold existential balance. According to Amazonian thought, human communities are not self-sufficient and must maintain a constant relationship with the multiplicity of beings that populate the visible environment and invisible worlds. Three key concepts account for the practices of Amazonian peoples: depredation, transformation and balance. Depredation refers to Amazonian practices involving the destruction of other beings in order to sustain the life of the community. According to Amazonian thought, depredation should be measured and only that which is necessary for survival should be killed. Depredation is governed by spiritual beings. Amazonian transformation practices are designed to safeguard community ties, transfiguring all that enters or leaves it, so that no external agent may jeopardize these ties of affection. The practices of depredation and transformation are complementary and both must be carried out in a balanced manner, respecting ancestral knowledge and cosmic laws established by higher spirits. With regard to the method of analysis, the dissertation considers Amazonian discourses from their own cultural logic and does not impose pre-established methodologies on them. Consequently, the present scholarly work makes a profound attempt at achieving an intercultural intellectual production; as it is indigenous voices themselves that express their ideas and the meaning of their practices. Overall, the dissertation enters into a critical dialogue with its field of study, both challenging and broadening certain concepts forged by the anthropological literature dedicated to the region’s study, drawing on the ancient Amazonian knowledge that nurtures the practices of those nations.	ayawaska , Amazonian thought , visionary epistemologies , ayawaska , ecological balance	en	10522.0
1054	The involvement of nitric oxide in bovine follicular development and ovulation	Understanding the paracrine events that regulate fertility in the cow is necessary not only because of the agricultural importance of this species, but also its potential use as a model for humans. Nitric oxide (NO), a free-radical gas, has been implicated in follicular growth and ovulation in rodents and other species, but the cow is an intriguing enigma: NO is produced by bovine granulosa cells and is regulated by FSH, but the presence and the expression pattern in granulosa cells of the enzymes responsible for NO synthesis (NOS) throughout follicular growth are unclear. The objectives of the present thesis were (1) to elucidate the mechanism of control of NOS and the consequences of nitric oxide production for granulosa cell function during follicle development in cattle; and (2) to determine the regulation of NOS during the LH-induced ovulatory cascade in bovine granulosa cells and whether NOS activity is critical for the ovulatory cascade in this species. The results are separated in 2 articles. In the first article, the regulation of NOS2 in bovine granulosa cells was explored. Abundance of mRNA encoding NOS2 was stimulated by FSH and IGF1 through increased estradiol, and a blockade of estradiol action consequently lowered NOS2 mRNA levels. Further, inhibition of NOS activity increased apoptosis in granulosa cells in vitro. In the second article, it was demonstrated that the LH surge induces NOS activation in granulosa cells, and that NOS activity induces the production of NO, which is essential for EREG/AREG/PTGS2 expression, critical genes in the LH-induced ovulatory cascade. Together, the results presented in these 2 articles suggest that physiological levels of NOS activity may contribute to growth and survival of granulosa cells, and also indicate that NO may be essential for ovulation in cattle.

1055	Différences culturelles au travail : impact sur l'intégration et la santé des travailleurs étrangers	This thesis focuses on the impact of cultural differences on foreign workers’ integration and health. Cultural differences are assessed using the concept of cultural distance between Hofstede’s cultural dimensions, integration using the concept of acculturation, and health using the concept of psychological health at work. The immigrants’ personal resources (proactivity, optimism and resilience) are also considered. The study was conducted in two call centers of a major financial cooperative in Quebec. The sample consists of 100 first generation immigrants in Montreal. The study’s results highlight the significant but moderate impacts of cultural differences on both the psychological health and the acculturation style at work, as well as the significant impact of personal resources (resilience) on foreign workers’ acculturation and psychological health at work. Strong cultural differences would generate greater psychological well-being at work and would engender the adoption of integrative acculturation style. Resilience stands out as a key personal resource for an immigrant’s health. The results further underline the particular role of the work sphere for foreign workers, with scientific literature supporting the idea that the workplace would have a significant impact on their psychological health. In addition to the above, a list of research limitations, recommendations for improvement and paths of action have been suggested.

1056	Transcendance et immanence chez Karl Rahner : échanges avec la philosophie de Gilles Deleuze	The question which moves throughout Karl Rahner’s work continues to lay down a principle: how can one make believable and convincing the revelation of God in Jesus to the people of today? This question must be considered again unceasingly in a practical reality of human life. In Rahner’s time, emphasis was placed into the transcendence of God. Since then, occidental culture was transformed: in the beginning of the 21st century, is showed a very obvious tendency of materialism, consumerism, individualism, relativism and secularism. Consequently, there is a tendency to evacuate the divine transcendence. Our research consists in exchanges between Karl Rahner’s theology and Gilles Deleuze’s philosophy, with the purpose of establishing possible conditions of Christian belief today. Deleuze’s philosophy introduces us into a creative process through which we can think radically of God as being at the same time transcendent and immanent. Our approach is developed with eight conceptual hybrids which help understand Rahners’s theology in another perspective and leads to the possibility of a Christian belief for today. Our research opens as well onto the perspective of theology meeting between the theological, philosophical, artistic and scientific worlds. Finally, it helps to enlighten the reality of the new evangelization in Christian Occident.	Immanence , Karl Rahner , Gilles Deleuze , Christian theology , Transcendence , Revelation	en	10505.0
1057	L'anorexie mentale chez les adolescents et les jeunes adultes de sexe masculin: Recension des écrits	Anorexia nervosa has been the target of many research efforts. The latest studies, however, are mainly focused on female subjects. The literature on males with anorexia nervosa is currently emerging. The review of this literature suggests pooling knowledge about male anorexia nervosa that can be extracted from the literature starting from1996 until 2011. The variables that are specifically targeted are clinical presentation, the premorbid conditions, personality characteristics, sexual orientation and gender identity, comorbid troubles, and prognosis. The comparison and the pooling of the results of 24 studies forming the review allow us in some cases to support observations made by previous research and to identify certain trends. Among other things, there appears to be similarities between the behavioral symptoms of boys and girls. The review identifies some areas where further research is needed and emphasizes the plurality and heterogeneity of research methods.

1058	Of master Hongyi's last calligraphic work	Hongyi (1860-1942) is a Master of Pure Land Buddhism in modern China. In the history of Chinese Buddhism, he is the only Buddhist Master who can rank among the greatest Chinese calligraphers. In the history of Chinese calligraphy, he is the first monk calligrapher who combines his Buddhist faith with his calligraphic art, and applies Western painting principles in his work of calligraphy. His calligraphic art well serves his religious belief, not independent from the latter as it is in most cases in the history. He uses the Buddhist concept of “a form without form” to interpret Chinese calligraphy, and puts forward a series of Buddhist calligraphic theories to guide his practice. Moreover, his calligraphy serves only to transcribe classical and contemporary Buddhist texts. In this sense, his calligraphic work exemplifies the influence of Chinese Buddhism on Chinese calligraphy. Traditionally, the last work of a calligrapher is often considered as his masterpiece according to two standards: its technique and its moral content. Furthermore, few of the last works by great calligraphers have survived. Scarcity makes these works even more valuable. Bei xin jiao ji (“悲欣交集”) is Hongyi’s last calligraphic work, which was completed three days before his nirvana. This thesis will study and analyze the influence of Hongyi’s Buddhist thought on the literary content and artistic form of this work and expounds that his last work fully displays the ultimate state of his Buddhist practice and the highest level of his calligraphy.

1059	Intertextualité et Oulipo - Étude de cinq œuvres contemporaines	The purpose of this study is to identify and analyze intertextual practices in five contemporary works by Oulipo writers: Les Gens de Légende (Olivier Salon), La Décomposition (Anne F Garréta), Vanghel (Jacques Jouet) Trois Pontes (Jacques Jouet) and Eléctrico W (Hervé Le Tellier). Following a review of the various theories of intertextuality available, the microtextual readings presented here seek to shed a new light on the complexity and ambiguity of the concept of literary filiation in the Oulipian writing process - either internal (references to works by members of the movement proper) or external (classical literature). Are also discussed in some detail the concepts of “contrainte” (constraint) and “plagiat par anticipation” (plagiarism by anticipation), but also the specific Oulipian aspiration to place the reader into a position that appears to be unique in literary history.

Both my essay and my creation intend to show that processes of rewriting can be used to defamiliarize the representative function of literature.

1061	"The impact of early life adversity on cortical structure in adolescent twins followed since
birth"	Animal studies have shown that fetal exposure to adversity affects brain development and emotion regulation later on. Emotion regulation would be related to a structural change in the brain, particularly the fronto-limbic circuitry. However, results have not been entirely confirmed in humans. The purpose of the present study was to test whether early adversity leads to structural changes in the fronto-limbic (prefrontal, orbitofrontal and cingulate) regions, previously identified as key areas in emotion (dys)regulation. Main measures of adversity were low birth weight and maternal hostility because these were among the best predictors of developmental and behavioral outcomes in humans. Secondary measures, including difficult child temperament and adolescent impulsivity, were used because of their link with brain and emotion development. Participants were identical twins part of Quebec Study of Newborn Twins (QSNT, N = 650 pairs), followed from 5 months to 15 years, their current age. Using identical twins allowed to better control the genetic factors and, thus, to better isolate the specific effects of early environment. Thirty-seven pairs have been recruited. Each twin’s brain structure was assessed with magnetic resonance imaging and analyzed using linear regression. Birth weight showed no effect on brain structure. Maternal hostility predicted a reduction in cortical area of posterior cingulate gyrus. Difficult child temperament predicted a reduction in cortical area of orbitofrontal cortex. Impulsivity was associated with smaller cortical area and volume in prefrontal cortex. These results highlight the importance of the early interventions in order to prevent the alterations leading to development of psychopathology.

1062	La détermination de la peine dans les cas de filicide	The purpose of our study is to understand the process of sentencing in cases of filicide from an analysis of criminal and legal criteria on which judges base themselves as well as from an analysis of penal functions aimed by the sentences issued for this type of homicide. The sample studied in this paper consists of fourteen sentencing judgments rendered by the judges at the sentencing. These judgments were all issued in Quebec between 1996 and 2008 inclusive. It is clear from our analysis that the guilty plea recorded by the accused, the lawyers' sentence suggestions, the method of filicide, repetition of misconduct or not in the parent, the number of victims, the age of the accused, the presence or absence of criminal history of the accused as well as the professional occupation of the latter may influence judges' decision concerning the sentence. These elements, however, do not necessarily carry the iv same weight in the process of sentencing from one judge to another. Nevertheless, we observe that the discretionary power the judges have does not seem to be used in a biased or inadequate manner. In fact, every sentence is clearly justified according to reasonable arguments and none is far from other sentences that have made jurisprudence.

1063	"Intersectionality in Practice : The Politics of Inclusion in the Québécois Women's
Movement"	As an important actor in Québécois political life, the women's movement has been successful at obtaining new rights for women and ameliorating their life conditions. However, its inability to recognize and take into account the particular experiences of women who are discriminated on more than one basis has been criticized by Aboriginal women, women of color, immigrant women, lesbians and women with disabilities, among others. For instance, in the last decades, an increasing number of immigrant and racialized women have organized separately to defend their specific interests. In this thesis, I explore the way in which the Québécois women's movement has responded to their struggles for recognition and adapted its practices to include women from ethnic and racial minority groups.   Although intersectionality theory has provided numerous critiques of social movements' attempts at being inclusive of diversity, only a few researches have examined how organizations take into account the specific identities and interests of intersectionally marginalized groups in their practices and discourses. Drawing on intersectionality theory and social movements literature, I analyze a set of 24 interviews conducted with activists working in women's organizations in Quebec to look at how they understand and conceptualize ethnic and racial differences and how this shapes their strategies for inclusion. I find that the way in which activists conceptualize the interconnected character of gender and race/ethnicity as axes that create women's experiences of oppression shapes organizations' political platforms, the strategies they put forth to foster the inclusion and integration of immigrant and racialized women and their capacity to engage in coalition work.

1064	"La revue de la Chambre de commerce de Montréal et la modernisation de la métropole
dans les années 1950 et 1960"	During the 1950s and 1960s, Montréal was becoming increasingly modernized. It is well known that the municipal administration had a considerable influence on this modernization. However, the perspectives of exterior actors have often been ignored. As such, this thesis examines the opinions of the Chambre de commerce de Montréal (the city’s francophone chamber of commerce) on the modernization of Québec’s metropolis during the above-mentioned decades. The main source that was used for this study was the Chambre’s weekly publication, Commerce-Montréal. The first chapter examines the Chambre’s opinions on municipal governance. It shows that, for the Chambre, the modernization of Montréal required the elimination of corrupt political practices and an increase in government efficiency. The second chapter studies traffic flow. It explains the Chambre’s positions on measures aimed at increasing the speed of traffic. The organization saw this as crucial to the modernization of the city. The third chapter discusses urban development. According to the Chambre, Montréal’s modernization necessitated a renewal of both its residential and commercial built environment. Studying these three themes confirmed that, from 1950 to 1970, the Chambre de commerce contributed to the debates concerning the modernization of Montréal, advocating in favour of it. It is also evident that the organization, despite its desire to appear apolitical, was influenced by its position as representative of the francophone business community. In particular, the Chambre’s emphasis on the profitability of modernization, as well as its focus on social stratification (regarding certain issues) attest to the organization’s conservative nature.

1065	Oxidative stress: a systemic factor implicated in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy	Although ammonia is considered the main factor involved in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy (HE), it correlates well with the severity of HE in acute liver failure, but not in chronic liver disease. Oxidative stress is another factor believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of this syndrome; it represents an imbalance between the production and neutralization of reactive oxygen species, which leads to cellular dysfunction. In the setting of liver disease, oxidative stress represents a systemic phenomenon induced by several mechanisms: decreased antioxidant synthesis, increased systemic release of oxidant enzymes, generation of reactive oxygen species, and impaired neutrophil function. High ammonia concentrations induce cerebral oxidative stress, thus contributing to severe hepatic encephalopathy, as observed in acute liver failure. In chronic liver disease, significantly lower degrees of hyperammonemia (<500 μM) do not induce cerebral nor systemic oxidative stress. Data from both animal and human studies sustain that there is a synergistic effect between systemic oxidative stress, and ammonia that is implicated in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy.

1066	Analyse de la transformation du métier d’auxiliaire familiale et sociale en CLSC au Québec depuis les années 1990	The aging population and the various reforms within the health system in Quebec have led to various changes over the years. Professional groups working in the field of home care services have seen their work transformed and evolved over the past decades. According to Bourque (1992), who was interested in the professionalization of  home-care workers  in the 1980s and the early 1990s, home-care workers are among the workers who experienced the most change in the nature of their tasks since their integration in the Health and Social Services in 1972. Our research focuses on the evolution of the professional practices of home-care workers in CLSC in Quebec since 1990. This study that was realized with semi-structured interviews with eight home-care workers led to understand the evolution of the tasks and functions of these workers. The result of this research shows a growing specialization of their work as well as increased tasks related to nursing care. However, the heterogeneity of these practices demonstrates the survival of certain tasks, particularly in terms of the activities of daily living. The major challenge in this group lies in the consolidation of a stronger and more inclusive association to assert their claims and to meet the challenges they face every day in order to recognize their work.	reconnaissance , home-care workers , home care services , labor division , professional group , recognition	en	10394.0
1067	La voix et le bruit, processus et parcours de création de mes œuvres	This Master’s thesis presents the creation path and process of works that I have composed during my studies at the Faculté de musique of the Université de Montréal between Fall 2010 and Winter 2013: Petite Toccata pour Orchestre (Little Toccata for Orchestra - Symphonic Orchestra), Définitions (prepared piano and voice), Accumulations (wind orchestra), Analogies (flute, bass clarinet, violin, cello, bass and percussion), Souffles (Breath - music for contemporary dance, electroacoustic support and female voice), 19 06 (viola), L’art de conjuguer (The art of conjugation - female voice), Miniature acousmatique (acousmatic music), Relinquere (guitar and electronic support), The Corporate Silence (string quartet). These works are made of common elements: noise as generative material, procedure generated by the creation process of electroacoustic music and the use of voice. This thesis is divided in three parts: First part: Presentation of a research, La voix et le bruit, I carried out during my studies.     Second part: Presentation of a catalog of compositions that I created during my studies.

1068	Les rétractations et leurs conséquences sur la carrière des coauteurs : analyse bibliométrique des fraudes et des erreurs dans le domaine biomédical	Over the last few years, major cases of scientific fraud shocked the scientific community, and the number of retractions each year increased considerably. Scientific misconduct accounts for approximately more than half of those retractions. It is assumed that co-authors of retracted papers are affected by their colleagues’ misconduct, and the aim of this study is to provide empirical evidence of how researchers’ careers are affected by a retraction. We retrieved all (443) publications retracted from 1996 to 2006 from PubMed, signed by 1818 authors. Using the Web of Science (WOS), we measured the productivity, impact and collaboration of each of those authors for a period of five years before and after the retraction. Our results show that retractions affect the career of co-authors, mostly in terms of scientific output. This impact is felt more strongly in cases of fraud and for first authors.	collaboration , scientific misconduct , retraction , collaboration , authorship , bibliometrics , fraud , error , research ethics , biomedical literature	en	10382.0
1069	Une culture du pluralisme religieux chez les jeunes au Collège Saint-Viateur de Ouagadougou comme prophylaxie contre l’intégrisme religieux au Burkina Faso	Saint-Viator College at Ouagadougou in Burkina Faso (West Africa) is a Catholic school, the mission of which is to evangelize the youth that attend it, while assuring them a Christian education of quality.  Besides the Catholics, many of the students are Muslims, Protestants or Animists. There is therefore a religious diversity among the educational community.  Since this situation has been accepted and recognized as such, we may very well speak of religious pluralism. In such a context, one must really wonder if it is always pertinent to want to evangelize the young Catholics as well as the students belonging to the other religions, or must we simply educate them to become better human beings in their own religion.  This question leads us to an adventure of five chapters corresponding to the five stages of pastoral praxeology.  The first chapter depicts the educational community of Saint-Viator College, in the pluralistic context of Burkina Faso, and demonstrates the strengths and weaknesses of the manner by which religious diversity is managed. The second chapter poses the problem of the relevance of the evangelization of youth of different religions, by ensuring their Christian education. The third chapter illustrates a hermeneutic of the act of evangelizing youth, taking into account the positive theological perspective of religious pluralism, in relation to the Church’s magisterium regarding Christian education of youth. The fourth chapter puts forth four proposals so that the evangelization of youth, in this context of religious pluralism, may take on the meaning of an integral education that draws the youth to becoming better human beings in their own faith. Finally, the fifth chapter expresses the hopes and beneficial effects of a culture of religious pluralism among the youth at Saint-Viator College of Ouagadougou. This culture would constitute simultaneously an evangelical prophylaxis against religious fundamentalism/integrism within the educational community and within the society of Burkina Faso.

Brain edema is a common feature associated with HE. In acute liver failure, brain edema contributes to an increase in intracranial pressure, which can fatally lead to brain stem herniation. In chronic liver disease, intracranial hypertension is rarely observed, even though brain edema may be present. This discrepancy in the development of intracranial hypertension in acute liver failure versus chronic liver disease suggests that brain edema plays a different role in relation to the onset of HE. Furthermore, the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the development of brain edema in acute liver failure and chronic liver disease are dissimilar. This review explores the types of brain edema, the cells, and pathogenic factors involved in its development, while emphasizing the differences in acute liver failure versus chronic liver disease. The implications of brain edema developing as a neuropathological consequence of HE, or as a cause of HE, are also discussed.

1071	A mitochondrial perspective on striated muscle physiopathology: insights from sepsis, denervation, and dystrophinopathies	Mitochondria are increasingly being recognized for their role in contributing in cellular damage. Mitochondrial dysfunctions, in addition to causing energy failure, contribute to apoptotic signaling, stimulate ROS production and calcium overload. These are all features of various types of myopathies. This thesis sheds light on how mitochondrial dyfunctions may contribute to the pathogenesis in certain myopathies that have been found to show mitochondrial abnormalities. Specifically, we found that although mitochondrial dysfunctions are involved in denervation-associated atrophy, desensitizing mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening through genetic ablation of CyclophilinD does not prevent mitochondrial apoptotic signaling nor atrophy in this model of chronic inactivity. We also observed mitochondrial dysfunctions in the Duchenne dystrophic muscle that were improved after PGC1-α transfection, which also resulted in an amelioration of the disease presentation. Finally, we found that mitochondrial recycling, led by Parkin and alternate mitophagy pathways a crucial component of cardiac recovery in sepsis.	mitochondria , striated muscle , muscular dystrophy , denervation , sepsis , mitophagy , cardiomyopathy , atrophy , biogenesis , cardiac metabolism , cardiomyopathie	en	10334.0
1072	Pharmacométrie de la ropivacaïne suivant l’anesthésie locorégionale chez les patients orthopédiques : caractérisation de l’intensité et de la durée du bloc sensitif	Background & Objectives: To provide postoperative analgesia, the anesthesiologist has at his disposal a panel of different medications and also regional techniques of neural blockade. Loco-regional analgesia (central or peripheral) blocks conduction of painful influx to the central nervous system by the use of local anesthetics (LA). Among these drugs, ropivacaine (ROP), has an enormous potential given is long-acting efficacy and low incidence of toxicity. Currently, ROP is not licensed for use in spinal anesthesia (central block) in all countries due to a lack of data from controlled clinical trials. So far, research efforts on this topic have mainly focused on safety and dose-finding issues. In addition, the most appropriate dose for a peripheral nerve block has never been estimated empirically. Dosing recommendation for LAs should be site-specific and adapted to the intensity of the stimuli produced by a surgery and to the duration of analgesia required. Ultimately, these should guide clinicians in identifying the most appropriate block for the individual patients by taking into account demographic factors that may affect the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of LA overall objective of the current research) Analytical Method Validation   Manuscript 1: First, a specific and sensitive assay has been developed and validated for the determination of ROP in human plasma.  Biomarker Validation Manuscript 2: Second, the reliability of a neurostimulator measuring current perception threshold (CPT) was assessed in healthy volunteers. The device uses a constant transcutaneous electrical sine wave stimulus at different frequencies specific to pain-conducting fibers. Our results suggest that CPT are reliable and can be applied to characterize, in a quantitative manner, the sensory onset of a peripheral nerve block in a clinical setting.  Clinical Studies Manuscript 3: The systemic absorption of ROP after a femoral nerve block in orthopedic patients was then characterized using extended rich PK-sampling, i.e. up to 4 days post-dosing. Our model used for data analysis confirms that, in a similar manner to neuraxial sites of LAs injection, the systemic absorption of ROP from the femoral space is biphasic, i.e. a rapid initial phase (mean absorption time of 25 min, % CI: 19 – 38 min) followed by a much slower phase (half-life (T1/2) of 3.9 h, % CI: 2.9 – 6.0 h). A significant age-related increase in the permeability of the LA was also observed in our elderly patients (n = 19, age = 62.6 ± 7.1 yr).  Manuscript 4: A population PK-PD analysis of the sensory anesthesia (CPT) of ROP using our PK model was also performed. The effect-site amount producing 90% of the maximum possible effect (AE90) was estimated as 20.2 ± 10.1 mg. At 2 x AE90, the sigmoid Emax model predicted an onset time of 23.4 ± 12.5 min and a duration of 22.9 ± 5.3 h. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first PK-PD model developed for a peripheral nerve block.  Manuscript 5: In the third and last study, a similar approach was used to characterise the PK-PD relationship of intrathecally administered ROP in patients undergoing minor lower limb surgery. The biphasic release of the agent from the intrathecal space was modeled using a rapid initial absorption phase (T1/2 of 49 min, % CI: 24 – 77 min) followed (lag-time of ~ 18 ± 2 min) by a slightly slower input rate (T1/2 of 66 min, % CI: 36 – 97 min). ROP maximal response was observed within 12.6 ± 4.9 min of dosing, with a subsequent return to baseline 210 ± 55 min after the administration of the LA. The effect-site amount producing 50 % of the Emax (AE50) was estimated at 7.3 ± 2.3 mg.   Conclusion: Altogether, the proposed models can be used to predict the time-course of sensory blockade after a femoral nerve block and spinal anesthesia using ROP and to optimize dosing regimen according to clinical needs with regard to important cofactors such as age.	ropivacaine , pharmacokinetics , pharmacodynamics , age , peripheral nerve block , spinal anesthesia , orthopedic patients	en	10331.0
1073	Étude structure/fonction des cotransporteurs Na+/glucose	This thesis is about the structure/function relationship in Na+/glucose cotransporters (SGLTs). SGLTs are membrane proteins which use the Na+ transmembrane electrochemical gradient to accumulate their substrates within the cell. As an introduction, a short review of the current state of the field will be followed by a presentation of the different technics used in this work. This work can be divided in three main projects. In the first project, we investigated the structural basis of water permeation through SGLTs. By using molecular modeling technics, we have identified, in silico, a passive permeation pathway used by water to go through the cotransporter across the membrane. Using voltage-clamp volumetric measurement, we were able to corroborate these findings for hSGLT1 expressed in oocytes. A second project allowed elucidation of some of hSGLT1 structural characteristics through the use of dipicrylamine (DPA), a fluorescence acceptor whose repartition in the lipid membrane is voltage-dependant. Use of DPA concomitantly with voltage-clamp fluorescence and FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer) has clearly demonstrated the extracellular localisation of part of the 12-13 loop which was previously assumed to be intracellular. In addition, we have shown that hSGLT1 forms a dimeric structure where the subunits are linked by a disulfide bridge. A last project aimed at characterizing the steady-state and pre-steadystate currents of a member of the SGLT family named hSMIT2 (human Na/myo-inositol transporter 2). We showed that phlorizin is a poor inhibitor of pre-steady state currents following depolarisation, and the presence of a time, membrane potential and substrate dependent leak current. A simulated annealing algorithm was developed in order to allow objective determination of both the connectivity and the parameters associated with the optimal kinetic model.

1074	Résultats des cupules de grand diamètre dans les reprises d’arthroplastie totale de hanche : suivi minimum de deux ans	Acetabular implant revision with large bone defects, can be challenging. One of the reconstruction options is a large outer diameter cup or “jumbo cup” (≥62 mm in women and ≥66 mm in men). We hypothesized that cementless jumbo cups is a reliable technique to preserve or reconstruct hip center of rotation. We also evaluated stability at least 2 two years follow up. Fifty-three consecutive non septic loosening acetabular arthroplasty revisions at Hopital Maisonneuve-Rosemont where a cementless jumbo cup was used were assessed. Bone defect was evaluated according to Paprosky classification. Mean implanted component size was 66 mm (62-81) in women and 68 mm (66-75) in men. Cancelous bone chips allograft was used in 34 cases and bulk bone allograft in 14. Immediate postoperative AP view showed a mean abduction cup angle of 41.3° (26.0-53.0). Hip centre were found at satisfy position in 78% on mediolateral axis, in 71% on craniopodal axis and it was improved in 27% in this late axis. At the mean follow up of 84.0 months (24.0-236.4) radiologically and 91.8 months (24.0-241.8) clinically: 6 patients were died and 3 were lost of follow up. Complications were: dislocation in 5 cases (4 revisions with constrained liner), infection in 4 cases (2 treated conservatively and 2 revised in 2 times procedure) and radiographic loosening in 1 case. Bone graft integration was completed in all except in 3 cases. Clinically, the mean HHS was 82% +/- 17, WOMAC 86 +/- 14, physical SF-12 46 +/- 12 and mentally SF-12 53 +/- 13.  Jumbo cups appear as a reliable procedure to manage bone loss in acetabular revision. It allows conservation or improvement of physiologic hip center. Also, cementless fixation promote bone integration. with subsequent cup stabilitity. The complication rate is comparable or may be less than others reconstruction procedures .

1075	États cohérents et comprimés du potentiel de Morse et intrication créée par un miroir semi-transparent	In order to describe the vibrations inside a diatomic molecule, the Morse potential is a better approximation than the harmonic oscillator system. Thus, based on the definition of the coherent states given in the context of the harmonic oscillator, the first part of this work suggests a construction for the squeezed coherent states of the Morse potential. Two types of states will be constructed and their diverse properties will be studied with special attention to the trajectories and dispersions in order to confirm their quasi-classicity. The second part of this work proposes to insert those two types of Morse squeezed coherent states in a beam splitter in order to introduce a new way of creating entanglement. This entanglement will be measured by the linear entropy and we will study the dependence with the coherence and squeezing parameters.

1076	Les effets des pratiques de leadership sur la performance de l’équipe : rôle médiateur de l’engagement des membres envers les objectifs d’équipe	The purpose of this research is to study the effect that leadership practices can have on team performance. We decided to concentrate this study on two types of leadership practices that are distinct: empowerment leadership and autocratic leadership. This research also tends to explain the mediating role of team goal commitment in the relation between leadership practices and team performance. Furthermore, we examine the harmonization of both leadership practices present among a team leader to notice if the adoption of one type of leadership would diminish or amplify the impact of the other leadership type.   Secondary data were collected in a public safety organization located in Canada. Overall, 381 members of 101 teams and their corresponding 101 immediate superiors were questioned through a questionnaire survey. Confirmatory factor analyses and a series of hierarchical multiple regression analyses were conducted to verify our eight hypothesis.   The results showed that leadership practices have a moderate and significant effect on team performance. Leadership practices are also strongly and significantly related to team goal commitment. Otherwise, the results points out the mediating role of team goal commitment. In fact, the mediating role of team goal commitment was complete between leadership practices and team performance. Contrariwise, the interaction effect between leadership practices turned out to be not significant. The verification of the mediating role of team goal commitment represents a theoretical implication within the comprehension of team work. Likewise, on the practical side results showed that team leaders had better to adopt managing practices that can allow the team to reach the team objectives while improving the members’ sense of commitment and the team performance.

1077	Criminal achievement and offender self-efficacy	The study of success in crime has been primarily restricted to a single objective indicator: earnings. While there is broad cultural agreement that money is a central component of career success, it is unlikely that earnings are the sole factor equated with achievement. Understanding how offenders subjectively define success for themselves might prove informative in understanding criminal career outcomes such as persistence and desistance. Self-efficacy – the belief that one can successfully perform a behavior leading to desired types of performance – has been shown to predict various legitimate occupational outcomes. Drawing from the self-efficacy and social cognitive career theories, this thesis explores how criminal self-efficacy beliefs are formed. It is argued that factors akin to the ones leading to the development of legitimate self-efficacy also serve as a basis for perceptions of success in crime. More specifically, it is hypothesized that criminal self-efficacy is forged as offenders interpret information from four experiential sources: personal performance accomplishments, vicarious learning, social persuasion, and physiological states and reactions. Because cognitive self-appraisals are not formed in a vacuum, it is also argued that individual and environmental characteristics exert a significant impact on the development of criminal self-efficacy. Based on interviews with 212 incarcerated offenders, our results suggest that criminal self-efficacy is complexly built from individual and environmental characteristics, as well as from personal experiences with crime. The potential repercussion of these findings on the understanding of criminal persistence and desistance are discussed.

1078	L’art de raconter une bonne histoire : une analyse de la couverture médiatique des gangs de rue au Québec	The media attribute a great significance to criminal events. However, those are not all reported in the same way. The media treatment of one generally depends of its sensationalism. The more impressive the event is, the more importance will be given by the media. Although street gangs have been very much present in the news content for several years, very few studies have assessed the extent to which the phenomenon is appealing to the media in relation to all criminal news. Considering the importance of media content and its impact on our society, the present study focuses on this question in order to determine whether the news about street gangs are treated differently. The sample of this study consists of 417 reports from Radio-Canada’s TV channel and Internet content, from that 210 are related to street gangs and 207 don’t bear on the phenomenon. The results suggest that the audiovisual and digital media present a more specific aspect of the phenomenon. Reports about street gangs are also more detailed and benefit from a greater mediatic treatment, regardless the medium of information used. Independently of the components that determine what make good news, the events involving street gangs and their members seem to receive a special media treatment.

1079	Arrestation et placement en détention avant jugement : points de vue et expériences des justiciables	This thesis aim to understand and analyze the experiences of individuals placed in pretrial detention. More specifically, this study aims to clarify that lived on the judicial and prison components involved in a remand. We want more free from the felling of such an investment. Finally, we wanted to reflect on the use of pretrial detention from the perspective of justice based on risk management and on the logic of efficiency, effectiveness and accountability. To do this, we used a qualitative approach to conduct our twenty-three interviews with men and women incarcerated awaiting trial in four detention facilities in Quebec. From these interviews, two main themes emerged, namely The judicial and prison experiences of the accused, marked by uncertainty, incomprehension, helplessness, dependency, difficult conditions of detention, losses and expectation and Sentiments from a remand, marked by suffering, injustice and the urgency out of this temporary situation. It is clear from our analysis that the way the system is administered justice, public opinion and the policies in effect have an impact on how to manage the use of remand in promoting the opposite of its original. Thus, the measurement is to be conducted at the expense of the main actor: the accused.	prison , prison , detention before trial , process , system of justice , lived , experiences , representations	en	10277.0
