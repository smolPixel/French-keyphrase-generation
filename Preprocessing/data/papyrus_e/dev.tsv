0	En quête de non-binarité : regards filmés sur les films qui nous montrent	Movies produced by main companies in the film industry make it possible to represent multiple identities through the characters shown, and to spread them widely to diverse audiences (through television channels, movie theatres, online broadcasting platforms). In this research-creation project, I look at the representations in so-called “main stream” movies of people’s identities identifying outside of a gender binary, and in particular the visibility of people identifying as non-binary.  I see a lack of representation of transgender and non-binary identities in mainstream films and series, compared to my own experience with the diversity of identities in queer and LGBTQ+ communities. To take into account the impressions of people within a wide range of gender identities, I recorded and filmed through Zoom discussions with nine persons from my close environment, in order to use their testimonies in my research work. In those discussions, they share their opinions, their experiences and their movie references for me to use as a complement to theoretical research in fields such as feminist studies, gender studies and community-specific work studying power relations against them (mainly Crip Studies, Trans Studies, Black Studies). I then linger on examples provided by the characters taken from some of the films and a Tv serie quoted in the interviews. I analyze some of the linguistic expressions used in these films as well as the representations of the characters, in order to compare them to the actual speeches of the communities affected by these representations. The interviews were edited as to form a collection of testimonies illustrating the importance for my interlocutors of finding faithful representations of their identities onscreen.	queer , oppression systemique , representation , transidentite , trans , research-creation , feminism , gender identity , non-binary , systemic oppression , normativity , transidentity	en	26507.0
1	«Failure may be your style» : le ratage comme esthétique queer dans le cinéma documentaire à la première personne	This research-creation masters thesis contains two parts : a written essay, « Failure may be your style » and a feature-length documentary film, Loin.  First person documentary is a genre that can be extended to video in general, because both express subjectivity and resemble the essayistic form due to their fragmentariness and incoherences. Failure is an essential element of this film category, because it can move the spectator by showing what could have been thrown away, what would have normally been situated off-camera and off-cinema, which can constitute forms of cinematographic punctum. Autobiography and autoethnography can combine with fiction and academic research in this vision of enlarged cinema. These approaches can be considered as part of a queer anti-aesthetic.  Loin is a first-person documentary shot and edited by the author of the text. It could be inscribed in this queer aesthetic of failure. The director interviews her French grand-mother about the past while depicting fragments of her daily life in Montréal.	queer , punctum , failure , documentary film , autobiography , first person	en	26502.0
2	"La transformation poétique de Judith dans le poème en vieil-anglais ""Judith"" : de veuve pieuse juive à vierge héroïque anglo-saxonne"	Between the second half of the10th century and the beginning of the 11th century, the Old English poem Judith was written in one of the great monastic centers of the Anglo-Saxon world. This poem, based on the biblical text of the Book of Judith, is the result of the meeting of traditional biblical material and the heroic Anglo-Saxon poetic tradition. From this encounter emerges a work celebrating biblical history and the moral teachings it carries, as well as the values of Anglo-Saxon aristocratic culture and heroism. The poem Judith is therefore a strong example of cultural adaptation of biblical material.  This thesis is concerned with this question of cultural adaptation, but even more with that of the coexistence of different traditions and cultural references within the Old English poem Judith. Throughout this thesis, it will be a question of determining the nature of this coexistence, namely how is it articulated? Does the poem present a case of hierarchization between these different cultural references? Or would it be fairer to speak of cultural pluralism and parallelism? Finally, how important is the historical context of the 10th and 11th centuries in the development of this poem?  Following our analysis of the poem and its historical context we will demonstrate that Judith is a work of cultural parallelism where each cultural reference is presented without the need for hierarchy. In addition, we will demonstrate that the Judith is the result of changes in Anglo-Saxon society between the 9th and 11th centuries and the political and military instability caused by conflicts between Anglo-Saxons and Scandinavians.

3	Honneur et individualité : dynamiques identitaires dans les sagas des Islandais	This study aspires to place thirteenth-century Iceland more fully within the historiographical debate on the individual in the Middle Ages, which has tended to focus on continental Western Europe. It interrogates the perception that the ancient Icelanders had of themselves in relation to the notion of individualism. In turn, it seeks to identify the sustained relationship with the collective, to determine if the Icelanders could conceive and define themselves beyond group structures or membership. Analysis of the content of the sagas of Icelanders (Íslendingasögur), a literary genre specific to Iceland, makes it possible to formulate a history of mentalité for this purpose. The notion of honor, a central theme in the texts, serves to evaluate the degree of individuality accorded the ancient Icelanders. The various dimensions of honor as expressed in the sagas are then dessected to answer this question. Honor is first considered in its relation to reputation. The importance of the idea of reputation as well as the process by which it is established is then observed. Analysis of how honor and its pursuit are motivating themes in the sagas are then considered. Finally, honor is perceived under the theme of the perception of oneʼs dignity and its social implications.

4	Mieux vaut prévenir et guérir : la réaction du public envers la posture de cyber-résilience des entreprises après un vol de données	Research shows that customers take few measures to protect themselves from crimes that may follow data theft at a business. They rather consider that the firm—the host of their personal information—holds exclusive responsibility over the continued confidentiality of their data. Companies that fail to properly secure customer information may, in return, risk experiencing ruinous reputational harm. That said, little explanatory research is done on the resilience of businesses to negative public reaction after data theft. Consequently, a vignette-based experimental study was conducted using the “ideal” victim model. The scenarios feature: (1) a breached business described as having a strong cyber-resilience posture; (2) a breached business described as having a weak cyber-resilience posture. A final sample of 664 participants was randomly assigned to one of the two main experimental conditions. Results reveal that compared to a weak cyber-resilience posture, a good cyber-resilience posture minimizes negative customer attitudes and promotes positive customer behavioural intentions towards the company. Considering these results, cyber-resilience, which has mainly received conceptual attention, gains empirical support. Furthermore, this research project contributes more broadly to the evolution of the victimology of businesses.

5	Les facteurs favorisant la réussite de l'instigation en matière de drogues à Montréal en 2018	"The rise of new public management is ""one of the most significant international trends in public administration"" (Hood, 1991). The police services were not spared by this new type of administration (Dupont, 2003). It is in this context of accountability, entrepreneurial management, economic constraints, the search for effectiveness and efficiency that many studies on the evaluation and performance of the police have been carried out based on 1970s, particularly in relation to the prioritization of files and the factors favoring its resolution. This study is in line with this aim of evaluating criminal investigations, in particular the effectiveness and efficiency of the management of drug investigations and the factors favoring its success. The present study aims to meet three objectives. The first objective is to draw up a detailed portrait of the drug instigation files at the SPVM in 2018. The second objective is, in an exploratory manner, to test the transferability of the model of Kilfeather's instigation (2011) to the drug instigation at the SPVM in 2018. Finally, the third objective, directly related to police efficiency, is to identify the non-institutional and institutional factors that promote the success of the instigation. Descriptive analyzes were produced in order to meet the first two objectives and logistic and linear regressions were used to identify the factors favoring the success of the drug investigation in Montreal in 2018. Descriptive analysis of the 324 files drug investigation in Montreal in 2018 reveals a process similar to Kilfeather (2011) in which three elements are essential in this type of investigation, namely the use of a human source, the use of physical surveillance and drug seizure, during a search or by an undercover officer. The study's multivariate analyzes suggest that, for the three definitions of success of resolving, arresting and submitting a lawsuit, the three significant factors that promote success are the fact that the offense is committed on public roads, the fact that the suspect is traveling in a vehicle and the number of watches."	investigation , instigation , Criminal investigation , Drug investigations , Solvability factors , Case screening , Managing drug investigations	en	26471.0
6	La mise en liberté sous condition provinciale : une analyse des pratiques des commissaires	"Every year, commissioners of the Québec Parole Board must render thousands of decisions on the conditional release of offenders serving a prison sentence of six months to two years less a day. The purpose of conditional release today is rehabilitation, which means for the offenders to be reformed and reintegrated into society, as well as the management of the risks posed by them. This thesis aims to analyze the practices of the commissioners of the Québec Parole Board in a context where the ideal of public safety through risk management occupies a central place in the penal system. In order to do so, semi-structured interviews with 11 Board members, man and woman, as well the analysis of thirty written decisions were conducted. It appears from our analysis that the Board members have several expectations in terms of the release plan and the characteristics that « ideal» candidates should have. The project must be adapted to the needs and risk of the prisoner estimated by the commissioners, offers supervision, intervention and support, promote social reintegration and the litigant must take ownership of the release plan. In addition, the commissioners pay attention to the profile of the delinquent. In this sense, the person requesting a conditional release must be considered to have a good potential for social reintegration. Board members will also look at the judicial and correctional history to assess whether the offender is a ""good"" candidate for conditional release."

7	Le pouvoir constitutif des controverses vu à travers le cas du complexe de liquéfaction gazière Énergie Saguenay : les pratiques de définition du gaz naturel	Like many large industrial projects, Énergie Saguenay has generated its share of controversy. Indeed, from 2014 to today, various groups of social actors have publicly shared their conceptions of the project. They defined it in their own way, agreeing on some points and disagreeing on others. My general research objective is therefore to describe the dispute process specific to Énergie Saguenay in its rhetorical characteristics and its own effects. To account for this objective, I will mobilize three scientific literatures. First, the literature on socio-technical controversies has allowed me to conceive how on the one hand, networks of social actors are formed and evolve during a controversy and on the other, how controversies create a space for learning and expression. Second, I was inspired by problematization, the first stage of the translation model (Callon, 1986), to identify the obligatory points of passage (OPP) of the Énergie Saguenay controversy, i.e., these main issues to which the various groups of social actors must agree to seal alliances. Finally, I appealed to the theory of definition arguments put forward by Schiappa (2003) and Zarefsky (1997) to define what category of controversy Énergie Saguenay fits into and how the specific definitions of a phenomenon (in particular gas as a transition energy) participate in the formulation of OPP. Overall, my research helps capture the ways in which defining practices help us understand how, at the rhetorical level, OPPs are created in controversy. More specifically, by analyzing the briefs submitted to the BAPE by the actors who make up the social groups who had participated in the controversy, my study puts forward the different definition practices that contributed to the conceptions of natural gas that currently exist in Québec, as so many OPPs allow the actors to align or oppose each other throughout the controversy.

8	Parcours de vie, subjectivité et facteurs de la réussite chez les femmes professionnelles immigrantes d'origine maghrébine à Montréal	In Quebec, the Maghrebi population is the largest immigrant community. As a result of a selective immigration process that prioritizes qualified, competent, and French-speaking profiles, Maghrebi women and men who settle in Quebec are highly educated. However, the province does not make the most of this skilled immigration as the Maghrebi population faces significant social and professional challenges. Indeed, several studies expose the various obstacles Maghrebi immigrants, particularly women, face as they encounter Quebec’s labor market. This research focuses on Maghrebi women in Montreal who consider themselves successful. Could this perspective enable us to understand and explain the failure of other immigrant women? How do the experiences of those who consider themselves successful differ from the others? To answer these questions, this analysis focuses on the factors involved in women’s migratory paths and how they contributed to their success. Also, this research develops a case study around thirteen Maghrebi women’s subjective perceptions of success. Starting from their country of departure to their settlement in Montreal, the study documents these women’s migratory paths through their life stories. Helped by family and social networks, as well as personal agency and other factors, success arises from family-work balance, professional aspirations, entrepreneurship, peace of mind and flourishes in honor of the parents and the racialized women who preceded them.	immigration , Maghrebi women , socio-professional integration , success factors , subjectivity , agency , social networks , life courses	en	26453.0
9	De la réalité à la fiction : trois décennies de représentation de l'Étranger dans les anime : une analyse critique des conceptions identitaires japonaises	This master thesis attempts to highlight the relevance of Japanese animation series in the study of Japanese identity. Indeed, through an interactive process of creation between producers, sponsors and consumers, anime, and the culture surrounding the medium, makes it possible to explore the dynamics of identity construction between Japan, as painted by nationalistic discourses, and the Foreign, which appears as its counterpart. Anime thus becomes a tool for cultural negotiation. More specifically, this work considers the dynamics of production and creation established since the 1990s, when the international audience started to become significant in a field which, previously, considered almost exclusively its Japanese audience. The 1990s also are a time of expansion for the anime industry which then becomes, to a certain extent, a source of pride for Japan and a banner of its identity. In view of the nationalistic and political potential of anime, as promoters of Japanese culture, the issue of their representations starts to arise. It is particularly on the idea of a contrast between hegemonic and minority representations that this thesis focuses. It consequently sheds light on hierarchical conceptions of the Foreign. Simultaneously, it testifies to an evolution of Japan’s position regarding otherness over the last decades.

10	Dynamique des communautés bactériennes et effet du glyphosate lors du compostage de biomasse lignocellulosique	"Composting is an anthropic process based on the natural decay of biomass that exploits the enzymatic activity of microorganisms under the control of several environmental factors. Due to their composition and low moisture content, lignocellulosic residues are particularly suitable for composting and serve as a structuring element, which confers them an important role in the process. Although mostly of plant origin, the organic matter (OM) directed towards composting sites is highly diversified, as are the types of contaminants it can contain. The impact of these contaminants, such as glyphosate, on the biodegradation process and their persistence in the environment remain to be investigated. The objective of this thesis is thus to report on the effect of the composition of the lignocellulosic biomass and the presence of glyphosate on the evolution of the physicochemical parameters and the recruitment of bacteria during composting, while ensuring the follow-up of the transformation of the vegetable organic matter and the degradation of glyphosate during the process.  Two field studies were conducted to measure the effect of stem age and winter storage on the transformation of wood chips, and to study the dynamics of bacterial succession involved in the carbon and nitrogen cycle during the composting of plant residues. The results obtained revealed a difference in the composition of 2-year-old and 3-year-old stems from shrub willow (Salix sp.), with the younger ones containing more extractable compounds and the more mature ones richer in structural sugars. These differences were reflected in a higher and faster temperature rise in the younger chip pile. A decrease in extractives, retention of structural sugars, and an increase in the proportion of lignin demonstrate the importance of the soluble carbon source for the initiation of wood decomposition and recalcitrance of lignocellulosic elements. The second experiment revealed a very high diversity of bacteria responsible for the decomposition of cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin during the thermophilic phase of composting. This phase, during which intense activity took place, had fewer species, but they were very abundant, a trend that reversed as the organic matter matured. The observed dynamics reflect a functional redundancy of the communities, which seems to evolve according to the temperature, oxygen level and nature of the available substrate.  A third experiment conducted in a controlled environment demonstrated the negligible impact of glyphosate on microbial activity and the evolution of physicochemical parameters during composting. Glyphosate was almost or completely degraded after composting, while the main product of degradation, aminoethylphosphonic acid (AMPA), was not detected. The impact of glyphosate on bacterial communities was also negligible, while species richness at different sampling times was the same when comparing the control treatment and the treatment containing ""pure"" glyphosate. The beta-diversity analysis found no significant difference between the communities present in the control and glyphosate treatments, while a few bacteria were differentially abundant between the two treatments, the vast majority being less abundant in the glyphosate treatment.  This thesis has thus highlighted the importance of the initial nature of the organic matter on microbial activity as well as on the recruitment and dynamics of bacterial communities during composting, while the presence of glyphosate was shown to be a weak determinant of decomposition processes and species abundance. This information should help to optimize the treatment of organic matter by composting and to better assess the potential risks associated with composting contaminated biomass."

11	Études sur la gravitation en théorie des champs classiques et quantiques	This thesis concerns gravitation and some of its connections with field theory. The starting point of this research was the study of the Newtonian limit of general relativity. Our interest was focused on the effect of retarded time and its role in the absence of aberration. Lack of aberration is the reason why the gravitational force points in the instantaneous (extrapolated) direction for unaccelerated sources, despite the finite speed of propagation of gravity (this also holds true for electromagnetism). Naturally this led us to compute the resulting gravitational field of accelerating masses, where aberration is not absent. In particular, we considered the motion of two masses such that their total Newtonian force at a position vanished but the retarded gravitational effects were non-zero. We were able to calculate these retarded effects and to propose two situations where they could be observed in the future. The study of the linearization of general relativity naturally arouse our interest toward the physics of gravitons, the quantized version of the linear classical theory. In particular, there has been much thought and literature on the impossibility of directly observing a graviton [1, 2] as well as thought experiments on the possibility of quantizing gravity or not [3]. This led to the calculation of the cross section (and gravitational potential) in the case of the gravitational scattering off a massive particle that is in a spatially non-local quantum superposition. In parallel with this research, some discussions with my colleague Kévin Nguyen about his article [4] on the problem of the cosmological constant, focussed my interest on this problem and the elegant solution proposed. The solution is based on the addition of a nonminimally coupled scalar and makes it possible to explain the tiny value of the cosmological constant through some small parameters of the scalar field. The solution is however very theoretical as it was only done in a matter free universe. We therefore examined at the effect of different kinds of matter on the evolution of the scalar field. We show that in one part of the parameter space, the theory we considered resolved the cosmological constant problem while being indistinguishable from general relativity.

12	Heretical thoughts into hepatic encephalopathy	Clinical progress in the development of new diagnostic modalities and therapeutic strategies for the management of patients with hepatic encephalopathy has lagged behind the vast knowledge that has been generated from basic studies. In this article, we critically assess matters that should be revisited such as definition, classification, diagnosis and grading of hepatic encephalopathy that are difficult to apply reproducibly using the current criteria. Many lines of investigation have confirmed that hepatic encephalopathy is irreversible in many patients and suggests the need for further studies focussing on mechanisms of neuronal injury and death to guide future drug development for these patients. The clinical evidence behind using lactulose for all severities of hepatic encephalopathy, which is currently considered the standard of care is poor and placebo-controlled trials for hepatic encephalopathy should be considered ethically sound. This expert opinion identifies current challenges in hepatic encephalopathy and highlights areas which require further debate and investigation in order to help advance the field both scientifically and clinically.

13	Defining ectosubjectivity : extraction and implantation of protosubjective fragments	This article questions the reterritorialization of human subjectivities by deep learning algorithms and adaptive web platforms, by introducing the concept of ectosubjectivity. This concept, surfacing from a study of the machinic theorizations of Karl Marx and Félix Guattari, attempts to grasp the processual extraction and implantation of subjective fragments by algorithms. The transformative oscillations engendered by these processes are redistributions of human subjectivities towards serialization and mass production. Thus, this article defines ectosubjectivity and questions the transformation of these subjective fragments to fit a homogenized mold.

15	Molecular interactions of tannic acid with proteins associated with SARS-CoV-2 infectivity	The overall impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on our society is unprecedented. The identification of small natural ligands that could prevent the entry and/or replication of the coronavirus remains a pertinent approach to fight the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Previously, we showed that the phenolic compounds corilagin and 1,3,6-tri-O-galloyl-β-D-glucose (TGG) inhibit the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the SARS-CoV-2 target receptor on the cell membrane of the host organism. Building on these promising results, we now assess the effects of these phenolic ligands on two other crucial targets involved in SARS-CoV-2 cell entry and replication, respectively: transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and 3-chymotrypsin like protease (3CLpro) inhibitors. Since corilagin, TGG, and tannic acid (TA) share many physicochemical and structural properties, we investigate the binding of TA to these targets. In this work, a combination of experimental methods (biochemical inhibition assays, surface plasmon resonance, and quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring) confirms the potential role of TA in the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity through the inhibition of extracellular RBD/ACE2 interactions and TMPRSS2 and 3CLpro activity. Moreover, molecular docking prediction followed by dynamic simulation and molecular mechanics Poisson–Boltzmann surface area (MMPBSA) free energy calculation also shows that TA binds to RBD, TMPRSS2, and 3CLpro with higher affinities than TGG and corilagin. Overall, these results suggest that naturally occurring TA is a promising candidate to prevent and inhibit the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2.

16	Motivation, engagement et satisfaction des besoins psychologiques en formation initiale à l’enseignement lors des premières vagues de COVID-19	The impact of online courses on students’ motivation, academic engagement, and satisfaction of psychological needs during the first waves of COVID-19 was examined with a questionnaire administered to a sample of teachers in training (n = 272) of a French-speaking university in Montreal (Canada). Analysis of the data reveals that participants were less motivated, less engaged and had more problems meeting their psychological needs in online courses than in traditional face-to-face classes. These results are discussed from the perspective of literature currently available on the subject and future developments in online training.

18	A multilevel meta-analysis of the relationship between basic psychological needs and autonomous motivation at work	Self-determination theory (SDT) argues that autonomous motivation is influenced by three basic psychological needs: autonomy, competence, and relatedness. The purpose of this systematic review was to test SDT’s assumption that all three basic psychological needs influence levels of autonomous work motivation equally, both when satisfied and when frustrated. Business Source Premier, CINAHL, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Scopus databases were searched as of June 14th, 2019 for articles examining the effect of satisfying and/or frustrating the needs for autonomy, competence, and/or relatedness on autonomous motivation in a work context. A total of 98 articles met eligibility criteria; of these articles, 97 reporting on need satisfaction underwent multilevel meta-analysis. Effect size estimates for autonomy (r = 0.38; 95% CI [0.34, 0.41]; p < .0001), competence (r = 0.41; 95% CI [0.35, 0.46]; p < .0001), and relatedness (r = 0.37; 95% CI [0.31, 0.43]; p < .0001) did not differ significantly from one another in terms of their association with autonomous work motivation. However, relative weight analysis results pointed to relatedness as the most important predictor of autonomous motivation, intrinsic motivation, and identified regulation, explaining ~ 49% of the predicted variance in these outcomes. These results call into question SDT’s tenet that autonomy, competence, and relatedness exert equal influence on autonomous motivation when satisfied. Findings are limited to the work domain and should be interpreted with caution due to the indirect nature of the evidence analyzed. Recommendations for satisfying basic psychological needs in the workplace are provided.

19	Deciphering mRNP – nuclear pore interactions : study of basket protein dynamics in budding yeast	The export of mRNAs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm is one of many steps along the gene expression pathway and is fundamental for mRNAs to meet with ribosomes for translation in the cytoplasm. Exchanges between nucleus and cytoplasm occur through the nuclear pore complex (NPC), which is a large multi-protein complex embedded in the nuclear membrane and assembled by 30 different proteins the nucleoporins. The nucleoplasmic side of the pore is believed to orchestrate many fundamental nuclear processes. Indeed, a growing body of evidence suggests that the nuclear pore is involved in a broad range of activities including modulation of DNA topology, DNA repair, epigenetic regulation of gene expression, and selective access to exporting molecules. The structural component required for orchestrating those nucleoplasmic functions is the basket, a ∼60- to 80-nm-long structure protruding into the nucleoplasm. The consensus view depicts the basket as a structure assembled by filamentous proteins, TPR (Translocated Promoter Region protein) in humans and by its two paralogues Mlp1 and Mlp2 (myosin-like proteins) in yeast, converging into a distal ring. In the first part of this thesis, we characterized the motion of specific mRNAs at the vicinity of the nuclear periphery. We observed that transcripts scan along the nuclear envelope, likely to find a nuclear pore to be exported. We also showed the scanning behavior was affected upon Mlp1 deletion or truncation as well as upon mutation of the nuclear poly(A) binding protein Nab2. These observations indicated that Mlp1 and hence baskets, as well as specific RNA binding proteins, facilitate the interaction of mRNA with the nuclear periphery. While the canonical structure of the NPC is well established, our understanding of the conditions and factors contributing to the assembly of a basket, as well as the stoichiometry of its components, remains incomplete. Although basket proteins have been implicated in the regulation of gene expression through gene anchoring to the nuclear periphery and in mRNA scanning before export, how this is mediated by Mlp1/2 is poorly understood. Moreover, the dynamics of basket proteins in yeast seem to obey different rules than those of other nucleoporins as their turnover at the pore is faster than any other NPC components. Furthermore, it has been observed that during heat shock Mlp1 and Mlp2 dissociate from nuclear pores and form intra-nuclear granules, sequestering mRNAs and RNA export factors. Yet the mechanism for the formation of these granules or their role during heat shock is poorly understood. In yeast, the nuclear baskets are not associated with all NPCs, as no baskets assemble on the pores adjacent to the nucleolus. Yet, how cells establish these basket-less pores and whether they represent specialized nuclear pores with different functions from basket-containing pores is still unknown. To understand the dynamics of basket assembly and the biological relevance of establishing distinct sets of pores, we dissected the biological processes leading to the formation of baskets. In addition, to highlight potential functional differences between the two types of pores, we identified the interactors of nuclear basket-containing and nucleolar basket-less pores. We showed that assembling a basket is not a default mode for a pore in the nucleoplasm and that active mRNA processing is required to maintain baskets integrity. While mRNA can be found associated with both types of pores, our results suggest that export kinetics may be different on basket-containing and basket-less pores. The eukaryotes organize their nucleus in discrete functional regions and the nuclear envelope has been envisioned as an organelle by and of itself. Our analyzes indicate that mRNAs and Mlp1 participate in an additional degree of nuclear compartmentalization by enabling the formation of a dynamic structure: the basket. Overall my project sheds new light on the nuclear organization and highlights the surprising entanglement between mRNA export and NPC plasticity.

20	Characterising (pre-)mrnp organisation at different stages of gene regulation using single-molecule microscopy	mRNAs act as the central molecules in gene regulation, helping convert the genetic information stored in the DNA to functional proteins. As a single-stranded polymer, hundreds to thousands of nucleotides in length, mRNAs can form extensive secondary and tertiary structures and, together with proteins, are packaged into assemblies called messenger ribonucleoproteins (mRNPs). The 3D organisation of (pre-)mRNPs influences many aspects of what happens to them, including regulating their processing, export and translation in the cytoplasm. Despite their significance, our understanding of the structural organisation of (pre-)mRNPs in vivo is minimal, as is our comprehension of the principles that govern it.  During my PhD, I have developed an RNA-centric view on (pre-)mRNP organisation. For this, I have established an approach combining single-molecule RNA in situ hybridisation (smFISH) with structured illumination microscopy (SIM) and used it to study mRNP organisation in the nucleus and cytoplasm. Our results suggest that (pre-)mRNP organisation is altered at various stages during its lifetime. We show that (pre-)mRNP packaging starts co-transcriptionally, with introns organised into compact conformations. This organisation is altered during the course of transcription as the polymerase travels along the gene, finally assembling an intron with the ends in proximity in a spliceosome dependent manner, suggesting that co-transcriptional intron organisation could be critical in determining its excision. Once released, mRNPs have a compact linear organisation in the nucleoplasm and possibly a rod-like conformation. mRNP organisation in the cytoplasm is influenced by its translational status. While translation opens up mRNPs, separating the ends of the mRNA, translation inhibition and release of ribosomes, or recruitment to stress granules result in mRNPs having a highly compact structure. Interestingly, we rarely find mRNAs with the 5’ and 3’ ends in proximity, suggesting that closed-looped translation is not a universal state for all translating mRNAs. Together, our results provide a unique and essential view of mRNP organisation in cells and reveal important insight into the role of mRNP conformation in regulating translation and mRNP processing.	mRNP , pre-mRNP , mRNP organization , single molecule microscopy , closed-loop model , smFISH , mRNP architecture , mRNA structure , 5’-3’ communication , mRNA translation , mRNA splicing , RNA compaction , RNA imaging , super-resolution microscopy , U1-Pol II tethering , intron looping	en	26309.0
21	Renforcement de la sécurité à travers les réseaux programmables	The original design of Internet did not take into consideration security aspects of the network; the priority was to facilitate the process of communication. Therefore, many of the protocols that are part of the Internet infrastructure expose a set of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers to carry out a set of attacks. Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) represents a big threat and one of the most devastating and destructive attacks plaguing network operators and Internet service providers (ISPs) in a stealthy way. Software defined networks (SDN), an emerging technology, promise to solve the limitations of the conventional network architecture by decoupling the control plane from the data plane. On one hand, the separation of the control plane from the data plane allows for more control over the network and brings new capabilities to deal with DDoS attacks. On the other hand, this separation introduces new challenges regarding the security of the control plane. This thesis aims to deal with various types of attacks including DDoS attacks while protecting the resources of the control plane. In this thesis, we contribute to the mitigation of both intra-domain and inter-domain DDoS attacks, and to the reinforcement of security aspects in SDN.

22	La métaphore vacante : concurrence des images entre 1929 et 1936 : photographie, surréalisme, revue, publicité	This thesis in visual history revisits Surrealist photography from interwar Paris in order to demonstrate the role of periodicals and advertising as agents (dispositifs) of photographic production and dissemination between 1929 and 1936. During a period which I refer to as the “second birth of photography,” I identify a previously overlooked relationship between the dissemination strategies used for photography in periodicals produced in the Surrealist context and the logics of the spectacle that governed the intensified circulation of images through print media. To explore this relationship, I draw upon the concept of competition (concurrence), which I elaborate by way of a pragmatic and energetic approach inspired by theories of the “iconic turn” (such as W. J. T. Mitchell’s), by Jean-François Lyotard’s idea of the dispositif, and by intermedial studies of the kind practiced by the Centre de Recherches sur l’Intermédialité (arts, lettres, techniques).  Adopting the tenets of microhistory, this thesis is structured around a series of case studies involving varied configurations between photography, Surrealism, the periodical and advertising. I offer close readings of the Surrealist periodical Le Surréalisme au service de la révolution (1930–1933), the first publication years of Minotaure (1933–1935), as well as the Électricité portfolio (1931), an advertising commission completed by Man Ray, and the advertising projects for Pétrole Hahn (1933–1935) produced by the Kéfer-Dora Maar studio. My analysis of this carefully chosen body of works sheds new light on the medial relations shaping the vitality of photographic images in the context of an intense visual proliferation. By proposing new conceptual tools to interpret visual sequences and image circulation, the thesis contributes to current conversations in visual studies regarding periodicals and the dissemination of photographs. The history of Surrealist photography I offer, with its novel concern for the energetics of images, also demonstrates the value of continuing to re-evaluate historical avant-gardes in the light of methodological innovations.

23	Reconnaissance identitaire et mouvement coopératif dans l’expérience des Inuit du Nunavik	Cooperatives operate in a multitude of regions and cultures. More than a secondary element, the cultural and identity aspect of cooperative development is at the heart of its development issues and its very definition. Indeed, historically, the establishment and development of cooperatives have been associated with important identity realities, as illustrated by the Acadian, Basque, Quebecois and Inuit cooperative experiences.  This thesis studies the experience of the 14 Nunavik cooperatives and their federation. Multiservice consumer cooperatives, whose members are almost all Inuit, they are the initiative of various actors (state, religious, store managers). The first cooperatives were established in the late 1950s and were quickly managed by the Inuit themselves. Coming to break the monopoly of the Hudson's Bay Company, the establishment of cooperatives in Nunavik also corresponds to a fundamental change in the economy and politics of the territory and the communities that live there.  Through some sixty semi-structured interviews and several on-site visits, this suggestive case study allows us to understand the contribution of the member cooperatives of the Fédération des coopératives du Nouveau-Québec (FCNQ) to the recognition of the persons’ and communities’ identities affected by their activities. By mobilizing Axel Honneth's theory of recognition and social freedom (2000. 2014) and the triple cooperative movement approach (Draperi, 2007), the analysis of the experience of Nunavik cooperatives reveals recognition expectations and effects associated with emotional recognition, legal recognition and the recognition of the contribution to society. These effects act on different types of capital, through means set up by cooperatives. Certain internal conditions specific to cooperatives also influence identity recognition of Inuit. This thesis contributes to a better understanding of cooperatives in terms of identity and cultural recognition. It accounts for the interweaving of the needs and aspirations of members and provides clarification of the definitions of these two central terms of cooperative theories. From the experience of the Nunavik cooperatives, we can see that the profound and concomitant consideration of the three cooperative movements (thought movement, social movement and business movement) produces recognition of the identity of individuals and communities. Cooperatives are a mean and a place of emotional recognition (by responding to basic needs and setting up a meeting place), of legal recognition (by means of democratic principles, mutual responsability and values of equality and equity) and of recognition of particularities and skills (through everyone’s participation in the achievement of a common mission and their education and training activities). Ultimately, they enable individuals and communities to exercise their social freedom and ensure respect of their dignity.

24	Les effets du processus de parrainage sur les dynamiques conjugales et les parcours de vie	This thesis focuses on the effects of the sponsorship process on marital dynamics and life courses. Based on a qualitative and interdisciplinary research approach, 20 participants, 7 men and 13 women, who had a sponsorship experience as a sponsor or a sponsored spouse, were interviewed. In this thesis, we explore the effects on conjugal dynamics in two key moments: 1) from the beginning of the sponsorship application process to obtaining the permanent residence visa, and 2) during the sponsorship undertaking of three years. We also document the experiences of a marital separation that occurs during the sponsorship undertaking. The vertical and cross-sectional analysis method used in this thesis made it possible for us to report on the diversity of pathways by articulating the experience of the sponsorship process, in particular with migration trajectory, marital composition, gender and ethnicity. If, at first glance, it seemed obvious that sponsorship creates inequality in couples by positioning the sponsored person under the financial responsibility of his or her sponsor, it turned out that the analysis of conjugal dynamics was more complex. Finally, in the light of the results of the study, we propose a typology of typical pathways that reflects both the diversity of pathways and levels of influence that the sponsorship process can produce on conjugal dynamics.

25	Des bleus sur l'arc-en-ciel : archéologie des dynamiques de violence dans le couple lesbien	Context. Domestic violence in lesbian couples is a widespread and largely ignored phenomenon. There is a lack of interest in this issue on the part of the various communities concerned, despite more recently renewed attention to the phenomenon. The taboos and debates surrounding female homoconjugal violence continue to exclude it from most of the movements fighting violence against women. However, each year, women suffer in silence from their partner's violence and each year these victims lose themselves a little more in the invisibility of their condition. The subject of conjugal violence in the lesbian couple raises many questions both on understanding and on the clinical solutions proposed. How to provide an appropriate response to this category of unrecognized victims who are very often confronted with intolerance, prejudice and ignorance from those who are supposed to help them? Methods. Women victims of domestic violence in a lesbian couple were met as well as practitioners from several disciplines of the humanities familiar with the theme of female homosexual violence. Using an interview guide and semi-structured interviews, we asked them to describe their experiences on this issue. The meaning they give to the violence experienced or reported has been gathered from a Weberian sociological perspective. The data analysis was scrupulously carried out according to a very precise grid in order to bring out the most emblematic themes and sub-themes of their narratives. The interdisciplinary perspective allows us for a more complete holistic understanding of the problem and can also be considered in itself as an avenue of intervention in the context of female homosexual violence Results. It appears that the type of violence abusers most commonly use to exert power, domination or control on the victim is psychological, verbal, sexual and, to a lesser degree, physical to exercise an authority, a domination, and a control on the victim. The conjugal violence cycle was also identified. In comparison to female victims of male partners, female homo-conjugal victims experience greater social isolation and stress, largely related to their sexual orientation, commonly referred to as stress of sexual minorities. New types of domestic violence have also been identified, such as internalized lesbophobia. Violence between two women is trivialized, minimized, and reduced to “cat fights.” This conception considerably detracts from the reality of what is happening in the lesbian alcove. Above all, it constitutes an additional attack on the victim. Finally, it appears that counseling support is very problematic and unsatisfactory for these women because of the lack of adequate support structures, training for practitioners and awareness of lesbian conjugal violence phenomenon. Furthermore, the prejudice from different personal socio-judiciary regarding lesbianism is still taking a stronger hold and can slow down the intervention process. Conclusion. Domestic violence in the lesbian couple is rooted in the spider web that the abuser weaves to take power over his partner with the complicity of society's harmful view of lesbianism, lack of information and professional training on the subject as well as the silence of the communities on violence against women. We must promote the mobilization, inclusion, education, information and training of all on this important issue. Domestic violence between lesbians is not a private matter. This is everyone's problem.	Intervention , Ressources , Domestic violent , IPV , Lesbien domestic violence , Femal homo-conjugal , Sexual minority , Lesbians	en	26236.0
26	Overcoming conversion therapy : a qualitative investigation of experiences of survivors	Sexual orientation and gender identity and expression change efforts (SOGIECE)—often referred to as conversion therapy—are practices that aim to change, deny, or suppress transgender and non-heteronormative sexual orientations, gender expressions and gender identities. SOGIECE are ineffective and associated with negative psychosocial consequences. This qualitative study follows an interpretative description design to explore how individuals who have experienced SOGIECE recover from these practices. We conducted in-depth interviews with 20 Canadian adult participants with experiences of SOGIECE. Using thematic analysis of the data, three overarching themes were derived pertaining to participants’ recovery from SOGIECE: 1) rebuilding social support and finding strength in lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and Two-Spirit (LGBTQ2S+) and LGBTQ2S+-affirming communities; 2) overcoming SOGIECE through affirming therapy and healthcare support; and 3) managing SOGIECE instigators. Based on these findings, we offer recommendations to facilitate the recovery process of people who experience SOGIECE.

27	Étude de l’effet neuro-protecteur de polyphénols issus de la Pomme-Grenade ainsi que de leurs dérivés métaboliques	Nowadays, a myriad of beneficial effects is attributed to dietary polyphenols. Most of these claims are based on in vitro studies, some in vivo studies, and almost never on clinical trials. It is increasingly realized that the interest of polyphenols does not only lie in their antioxidant power but also in their ability to target multiple molecular pathways such as inflammation. In addition, many studies are beginning to take into account the bioavailability of polyphenols in the body and their interaction with the gut microbiota. That's why in addition to two polyphenols from Pomegranate, we looked at two of their metabolic derivatives. Almost no study has examined the effect of these molecules in the context of neurodegenerative diseases. To do this, we tested punicalagin, ellagic acid, urolithin A and urolithin B on C. elegans models of ALS and Huntington's disease that had motor phenotypes, neurodegeneration and inflammation. Furthermore, we used a mouse model that underwent an axotomy of the optic nerve to confirm the neuroprotective power of urolithin A. Our results showed that these compounds in different proportions were able to reduce the neuronal toxicity of proteins. related to ALS and HD and thus decrease the levels of paralysis and neuro-degeneration of our C. elegans models. In parallel, we observed that this neuroprotection was done through a reduction of the inflammation and for urolithin A an improvement of the morphology of mitochondria via mitophagy. Lastly, we found that urolithin A was able to promote neuronal survival in mice as a result of optic nerve injury. To conclude, this study by its in vivo approach to multiple neuro-degenerative diseases reinforces existing evidence of the beneficial effect of pomegranate consumption and encourages the pharmacological use of urolithin A.

28	Développement d’un modèle conceptuel pour la pratique d’activités de pagaie adaptées pour des personnes utilisant un fauteuil roulant comme principal mode de locomotion	Individuals with physical impairments and related disabilities who use a wheelchair as their primary mode of locomotion (WCUsers) face challenges in their daily lives that interfere with meaningful recreational and leisure participation. This accelerates the development or exacerbation of physical health and psychological well-being difficulties, thus creating a vicious cycle of inactivity. Emerging evidence suggests that adapted physical activity (APA) allows WCUsers to mitigate, even overcome, these difficulties. Nowadays, though broad ranges of adapted sports are available, adapted paddling activities have received limited attention. Identifying and modeling the factors influencing their practice remains crucial to further promote adapted paddling activities. This study aimed to develop a novel conceptual model of factors influencing the practice of adapted paddling activities using a four-phase process: 1) the systematized search of the literature and a synthesis of currently-available conceptual models in APA practice, 2) the conceptualization of a preliminary model for the practice of adapted paddling activities, 3) the validation of its construct and content by three APA experts and two independent scientific experts to co-create the final model (i.e., Montreal Model of Adapted Paddling Activities – M2APA) and 4) the testing of the applicability of the M2APA with three WCUsers who previously practiced adapted paddle boarding. Based on these findings, the M2APA offers a comprehensive model allowing one to map key personal and environmental factors needing consideration for the practice of adapted paddling activities. Moreover, the M2APA provides insights to promote participation into adapted paddling activities and, ultimately, strengthen social inclusion of WCusers.

29	Assessment of the occupational exposures to fine and ultrafine particles in several industrial settings and exploration of its respiratory health effects	Respiratory effects, such as lung function, of short-term exposures to fine and ultrafine particles are not well documented for occupational exposures, even though many workers are exposed daily to levels considerably higher than in the general environment. This limited understanding can be attributed to the lack of exposure data. Currently, studies assessing occupational exposures to fine particles and ultrafine fraction are few and lack standardized methods to allow a general conclusion about workers’ exposures. The steps for improving exposure assessment include the harmonization of sampling strategies and the assessment of additional information related to the size distribution (e.g. particles of median diameter of 2.5 and 4 µm, and ultrafine particles), chemical composition, and the oxidative potential of these particles. Thus, in a context of uncertainty about the acute respiratory risks, with many potentially exposed workers and in the absence of comparable exposure data, the needs for developing knowledge in this field are enormous. Hence, the main objective of this thesis was to estimate the risk of daily exposures to fine and ultrafine particles in various workplaces with three specific objectives: (1)  to quantify and characterize exposures to fine and ultrafine particles in different workplaces in Québec by an innovative multi-metric approach; (2) to estimate the oxidative potential and oxidative burden of particles in two occupational settings from a construction trades school; (3) to separately estimate, by a systematic review and meta-analysis, the associations between short-term (i.e. daily and sub-daily) occupational and environmental exposures to fine particles and its acute respiratory effects on lung function in healthy adults.  For the first objective, measurements were performed in an underground mine, a subway tunnel, a truck repair workshop, and a smelting industry for at least 12 sampling days each. Direct-reading instruments and filter-based methods were used and included measurements of the number concentration, mass concentration, size distribution, transmission electron microscopy and composition (e.g. Total carbon (TC) and elemental carbon (EC)) of particles. For the second objective, the oxidative potential (OPAA) and oxidative burden (OBAA) were assessed by the ascorbate assay with a synthetic respiratory tract lining fluid. Personal PM4 (Nwelding = 53; Nconstruction = 54) samples were collected from the breathing zone, while area samples of both PM4 (Nwelding = 54; Nconstruction = 33) and PM2.5 fractions (Nwelding = 53; Nconstruction = 34) were collected at distances of around 1.5 meter from the apprentices. For the third objective, we searched bibliographic databases to identify studies investigating associations between daily and sub-daily exposures to fine particles (i.e. PM2.5 and PM4) and lung function parameters (e.g. Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 sec, FEV1) in healthy adults. Separately for environmental and occupational studies, we summarized findings using random-effects meta-analyses when five or more independent estimates of association were available. The highest particle number concentrations were observed in the underground mine, welding shop and smelting industry. For the workplaces with diesel exposure, the underground mine had the highest geometric mean of particle number concentration (134,000 particles/cm3) compared to the subway tunnel (32,800 particles/cm3) and the truck repair workshop (22,700 particles/cm3). This same pattern of exposure in these workplaces were also observed for the mass concentration of fine particles, TC and EC. The TC/EC ratio was 1.4 in the mine, 2.5 in the tunnel and 8.7 in the workshop, indicating significant organic carbon interference in the non-mining workplaces that can affect exposure estimation when TC is used as an indicator of diesel exposure. Measurements of the size distribution and images captured by transmission electron microscopy indicated that the particles found in all workplaces were mainly in the ultrafine size fraction. Particles collected in the welding shop and construction site were associated with important levels of redox activity. Welding particles had higher OPAA (3.3 ρmol/min/µg) and OBAA (1,750 ρmol/min/m3) compared to the construction site (OPAA = 1.4 ρmol/min/µg; OBAA = 486 ρmol/min/m3). These levels of OBAA largely exceeded the levels found in environmental settings. In both workplaces, OPAA levels were not influenced by the different sampling strategies (i.e. area versus personal measurements) or size fractions (i.e. PM2.5 and PM4). However, driven by the higher particulate matter concentrations, the OBAA from personal samples was higher compared to area samples in the welding shop. The systematic review and meta-analysis showed that associations between daily exposures to fine particles and lung function in environmental settings were more pronounced than in occupational settings for a same exposure increment. An increase of 10 µg/m3 in the daily and sub-daily exposures to respirable fine particles were associated with FEV1 reductions of 0.87 mL (95% CI: -1.36 to -0.37 mL; I2= 54%) in occupational studies, and a similar increase in fine particles was associated with a reduction of 7.63 mL (95% CI: -10.62 to -4.63 mL; I2= 0%) in environmental studies. Similar results were observed for associations with the forced vital capacity.  In summary, this thesis’s results showed that workers are exposed to important levels of particles expressed in terms of mass and number concentrations, and these particles are mainly in the ultrafine size range. The high particulate matter concentrations combined with an elevated oxidative potential resulted in significant levels of oxidative burden that largely exceeded those from environmental settings. Also, occupational exposures during a work shift may result in respiratory health effects described in terms of reduction in workers’ lung function. Based on our results, improvements in industrial hygiene practices and the surveillance of exposure to fine and ultrafine particles in the workplace are needed to control and limit potential health risks of daily exposure to these pollutants.	fine particles , ultrafine particles , occupational exposures , oxidative potential , oxidative burden , lung function	en	26192.0
30	De la conception prospective et innovante dans les organisations municipales québécoises : vers une régénération des routines en urbanisme ?	Ecological and digital transitions, along with concerns over social inequalities, signal the advent of complex new challenges for contemporary cities. These changes raise the issue of the dynamic capability of urban planners: more specifically, their ability to review their tools and planning routines in urban projects in order to explore the potential of new paradigms of collective action and foster innovative transition paths for cities. European companies, especially in public transportation, have responded to this challenge, with convincing results, by developing tools based on innovative design theories. One of these methodological tools, the Definition-Knowledge-Concept-Proposition (DKCP) process, was used to generate a new range of planning options for three urban districts in Montreal, Canada. The traditional planner’s routine generally focuses on a single activity in the process, the formulation of propositions (Phase P), by slightly adapting former projects to the local context and rules. However, the future urban planners’ routine should include new capabilities for managing upstream stages of projects in the form of a succession of DKCP phases. The need to tackle the complex challenges of the 21st century city opens the way to a new professional identity: the “innovative urban planner”.

31	Caractérisation de la modulation de l’activité du récepteur nucléaire orphelin NUR77 (NR4A1) par ses modifications post-traductionnelles et son interactome	NUR77 is an orphan nuclear receptor (NR) involved in the regulation of multiple cell biology processes including cell death, in particular in Parkinson's disease (PD), which results of the loss of dopaminergic neurons, and in breast cancer (BC), which is caused by the proliferation of mammary epithelial cells. NUR77 is involved in triggering and inhibiting cell death and its activity is believed to be independent of a ligand binding. We hypothesized that the regulation of NUR77 activity does not occur through a ligand, but through the influence of its post-translational modifications (PTMs) and its interaction partners. The general objective of this PhD project was to characterize the PTMs and the interacting partners that modulate the activity of NUR77 in cultured cell models, to better understand its physiological roles, in particular in the regulation of cell death. The first objective of this thesis was to characterize the role of SUMOylation, a modification that regulates NR activity, in regulating NUR77 transcriptional activity in reporter assays in Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK293) cells. Overexpression of the E3 SUMO ligase PIASγ or/and the isoform 2 of SUMO, both important regulators in SUMOylation of the NUR77 homolog NURR1, produced a repressive effect on the transcriptional activity of NUR77. The effect of PIASγ on the activity of NUR77 was shown to be modulated by the Sentrin SUMO-specific protease 1 protein, which removes SUMO tags on target proteins. In addition, mutations of lysine residues in SUMO consensus sites in NUR77 (K102 and K577) had opposite effects on its transcriptional activity, suggesting different recruitment of coregulators of transcription in the regions. The combination of these results indicates that SUMOylation is an important PTM for the regulation of NUR77 activity and that PIASγ and SUMO2 proteins are important transcriptional coregulators of NUR77. The second objective of this thesis was to evaluate NUR77 interactome in HEK293 living cells to identify the interactors that can modulate its activity, using a biotin-labelling method for proximal proteins based on the APEX2 peroxidase combined with mass spectrometry. This approach identified 336 potential interactors of NUR77, some that are consistent with the literature. Coimmunoprecipitation and coimmunofluorescence assays carried out in HEK293 cells and in MCF-7 breast cancer cell line have shown that the regulator of apoptosis Apoptosis Inhibitor 5 vi (API5), interacted and colocalized with NUR77. By depriving cells of serum and decreasing API5 expression, increased protein levels and activity of NUR77 was observed, as well as a decrease in cell viability. These data support that API5 is a regulator of NUR77 in its involvement in signalling pathways associated with cell death and that this interaction could be a target for modulating apoptosis. More generally, they validate the APEX2 tool which can be used to identify novel NUR77 interactors. In conclusion, the work of this thesis resulted in the generation of tools to better understand the activity of NUR77 and revealed important coregulators in this activity. The continued characterization of these interactors may provide opportunities to target NUR77 as a regulator of cell death, particularly in PD and in breast cancer.

32	Are older people living alone socially isolated? : a qualitative study of their experiences	This article discusses the experiences of social isolation among older people living alone. The current state of knowledge suggests that they are at a higher risk of social isolation which, in turn, can compromise their health and well-being to varying degrees. Yet, few qualitative studies have tried to understand the subjective experience of living alone and the ways it can impact older people’s relationships. The data presented here are based on 43 individual interviews with men and women aged 65 to 93 living alone in the Montreal area (Canada), and group discussions with 120 actors involved in intervention. The results showed that the majority of the participating older people did not see living alone as a problem. Their stories revealed the extent of their resilience and their ability to maintain satisfactory social relations with family and peers. However, for a minority, mostly men over 80 years old, solo living translated into being alone and could become problematic. The article presents reflections for social work intervention, inviting practitioners to consider different vulnerabilities affecting the capacity of older people living alone to maintain their social networks and highlighting the importance of fostering reciprocity in their relationships.

33	Classification angiographique d’anévrismes cérébraux traités par voie chirurgicale ou endovasculaire : revue systématique et étude d’accord inter & intra-observateur	INTRODUCTION Intracranial aneurysms are a medical condition associated with serious morbidity and mortality when ruptured. They are mainly treated with surgical clipping or endovascular coiling, and randomized clinical trials comparing both treatments often use angiographic results as a surrogate outcome of treatment success. The development of a standardized, reliable method to report angiographic results, applicable to both treatments using any angiographic modality (Conventional [CA], Computed tomography [CTA], or magnetic resonance [MRA] angiography) is needed. We sought to systematically review existing methods of classifying treated aneurysms and to assess the inter-/intra-rater reliability of a new angiographic grading scale, as well as its clinical relevance.  METHODS We conducted two separate systematic reviews in 5 databases to collect post-clipping and post-coiling grading scales, along with their reliability when reported. The CA of 60 cases of clipped (n=30) and coiled (n=30) aneurysms were independently evaluated by 19 raters of various backgrounds and experiences using a new 3-grade scale. Raters were also asked how they would manage each case (delayed, close follow-up, or retreatment). Fifteen raters performed a 2nd evaluation of the same cases (in a permuted order) at least one month apart. The same methodology was used to study the reliability of the scale when 60 noninvasive angiography cases of clipped (30 CTA) or coiled (30 MRA) aneurysms were evaluated by 24 raters. Inter and intra-rater agreements were assessed using Krippendorff’s Alpha statistics (aK), and the relationship between occlusion grade and clinical management using Cramer’s V test.  RESULTS The systematic reviews found 70 grading scales (44 post-clipping, 26 post-coiling) with significant heterogeneity in terms of reliability (kappa values from 0.12 to 1.00), raters, and patients. Overall inter-rater agreement for the grading scale was substantial for CA results (aK=0.76; 0.67–0.83) as well as for noninvasive results (aK=0.63; 0.55–0.70); regardless of background, experience, or treatment used. A strong relationship was found between angiographic grades and management decisions (V=0.80±0.12 for CA; V=0.77±0.14 for CTA/MRA [p<0.001]).  CONCLUSION A standardized 3-grade scale was found to be a reliable and clinically meaningful tool to compare the results of clipping and coiling of aneurysms using any angiographic modality. It could be used as a valid tool to adjudicate results of comparative randomized trials, and to standardize the reporting of aneurysm treatments.	clipping chirurgical , Intracranial aneurysm , interrater reliability , surgical clipping , endovascular coiling , grading scale , catheter angiography , computed tomography angiography , magnetic resonance angiography	en	26156.0
34	Foliar spectra accurately distinguish the invasive common reed from co-occurring plant species throughout a growing season	Invasive plant species are one of the main drivers of biodiversity change in terrestrial ecosystems. Accurate detection of exotic species is critical to monitor on-going invasions and early detection of incipient invasions is necessary to prevent further spread. At present, surveillance methods of biological invasions allow to track the spread of invaders across geographic ranges, but less attention has been given to invasive species monitoring across time. Remote sensing platforms, capable of providing detailed information on foliar trait variations across time and space, are uniquely positioned for monitoring invasive plants in real time. Temporal changes in foliar traits are expressed in a species spectral profile through specific absorption features related to variation in photosynthetic pigments and chemical constituents driven by phenology. Thus, variations in a plant’s spectral response can be used to improve the identification of individual species. One of Canada’s most problematic invaders is the common reed, Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steudel subspecies australis, whose spread threatens biodiversity in wetland ecosystems in North America. Determining the time of year when the invader is spectrally and functionally more distinct from other plants in the community would be central to better management of common reed. To do so, we collected a time-series of foliar traits and high-resolution leaf spectral data over the course of a growing season at Boucherville, Quebec, Canada, to determine the spectral separability of the invader from co-occurring species and how its detection varies over time. Our results revealed that leaf-level spectroscopy distinguished Phragmites and co-occurring species with > 95% accuracy throughout the growing season – a promising result for the future remote detection of invasive plant species.

35	Covariates of turnover intentions of teleworking call center agents in Québec during the COVID-19 pandemic	Teleworkers from multiple call centers in Québec provided questionnaire data about their various job demands (measured by organizational stressors, mental load, and emotional load), job resources (measured by independence in the work, participation, and relationship with supervisors) as well as for outcome measures of job satisfaction, organizational commitment, and turnover intentions. Hypotheses structured by the JD-R model were tested using correlational methods. As predicted, job resources were significantly related to both job satisfaction and organizational commitment perceived by the sample. Job demands predicted job satisfaction, but they did not relate to organizational commitment. The theoretical and practical implications of these results were discussed.	teleworkers , call centers , turnover intentions , job satisfaction , organizational commitment	en	26109.0
36	Electrophysiological markers for hostile attribution bias among individuals with anxiety	Background: Anxiety disorders constitute the most prevalent subgroup of mental health conditions. While anxious individuals are more widely known as being socially withdrawn and shy, recent research highlights a rather non-prototypical image, one that is aggressive. The main goal of this event-related brain potentials (ERPs) study is to augment our knowledge of the neurophysiological responding of hostile attribution biases of anxious individuals to ambiguous situations. Methods: Using pre-collected data from a sample of 68 undergraduate and community-based adult participants, this study aims to explore the N400 deflection utilising Gagnon et al.’s (2016) Hostile Expectancy Violation Paradigm with anxious individuals, and whether the N400 deflection persists after controlling for aggression. Results: A more negative amplitude was observed in response to a critical word that mismatched rather than matched with the character’s expected hostile intention. Regression analyses revealed that anxiety scores negatively predicted the N400 following the mismatched expected hostile intention while controlling for reactive aggression suggesting that the violation of hostile expectancy about the intention behind an ambiguous provocative behavior is more pronounced among anxious participants. Conversely, in the hostile condition, the overall model was significant, although anxiety scores did not account for the overall effect, reactive aggression did. Conclusion: This study provides preliminary evidence that anxiety symptoms are uniquely related to hostile attribution bias independent of reactive aggression. Future research should aim to replicate these findings with a clinically diagnosed sample of individuals with anxiety disorders.

37	Excitations et ergodicité des chaînes de spins quantiques critiques à partir de la dynamique classique hors d’équilibre	We study a quantum spin-1/2 chain that is dual to the non-equilibrium Kawasaki dynamics of a classical Ising chain coupled to a thermal bath. The Hamiltonian is obtained for the general disordered case with non-uniform Ising couplings. The quantum spin chain is stoquastic, and depends on the Ising couplings normalized by the bath’s temperature. Proceeding with uniform couplings, we give the exact groundstates of the gapless spin chain, as well as its single-magnon excitations. Solutions for the two-magnon spectra are derived via a Bethe Ansatz scheme. In the antiferromagnetic regime, the two-magnon branch states show intricate behavior, especially regarding hybridization with the continuum. Our analysis, when combined with previous studies, suggests that the system hosts multiple dynamics at low energy as seen via the presence of multiple dynamical critical exponents. Finally, we analyze the full energy level spacing distribution as a function of the Ising coupling. We conclude that the system is non-integrable for generic parameters, or equivalently, that the corresponding non-equilibrium classical dynamics are ergodic.	intégrabilité , stoquasticité , Quantum spin chains , Kawasaki non-equilibrium classical dynamics , Integrability , Stoquasticity , Bethe ansatz , Dynamical critical exponents	en	26100.0
38	Cartographie moléculaire d'exoplanètes avec le télescope spatial James Webb	Hot Jupiter atmospheres, receiving extreme amounts of irradiation from their host star, enable us to study the atmospheric chemistry and dynamics of atmospheres at regimes that would otherwise be inaccessible from solar system observations. Transmission and emission spectroscopy of these atmospheres enables their characterization. However, these methods do not consider the spatial distribution of the molecular abundances, temperature profile, and clouds. Using multi-wavelength secondary eclipse mapping, it is possible to measure the spatial distribution of the atmospheric parameters. Secondary eclipse mapping has only been applied for photometric Spitzer/IRAC 8 μm observations of HD 189733 b so far. With the imminent launch of JWST, high-precision spectrophotometric observations of hot Jupiters are expected, reinforcing the need for a framework that can simulate and retrieve secondary eclipse mapping observations. We present a novel method to simulate secondary eclipse light curves for non-uniform atmospheres at multiple wavelengths, as well as a statistical method to retrieve the distribution from observations. The simulation of the multi-wavelength light curves is discretized to enable the fast computation necessary for statistical analysis of observations. We apply these methods to simulated JWST NIRSpec observations of WASP-33 b for various distributions of the water dissociation coefficient and conclude that 5 secondary eclipse observations are sufficient to constrain significant spatial variations in longitude and latitude. The application of the multi-wavelength secondary eclipse mapping to JWST will further deepen our understanding of the atmospheric dynamics processes to which hot Jupiter atmospheres are subjected.

39	Nature et enjeux de la relation entre la sensibilité et l’intellect chez Thomas d’Aquin	The Peripatetic epistemology of Aquinas supposes an ontological distinction between sensitivity and the intellect within the soul. The sensitive soul is mobile and corruptible while the intellect is immobile and incorruptible. In regard to this, it seems evident that the grasp of intellectual data, the species intelligibiles, shouldn’t be affected by the body’s corruption. However, it isn’t the case : the sensible memory losses affect the intellective memory’s activity. Since the intellect is immutable, the fact that it forgets points to a structural dependency of the intellect to its body, which would be the origin of omission. This research tries to excavate the nature and the logic of this structural dependency. More precisely, it tries to answer the following question : does the soul always need to turn towards phantasms when it thinks the intelligible species and, if so, how does it do it? The first and second literature show distinctly Thomas’ belief that the soul must always turn toward phantasms to think. Nevertheless, how it happens is a whole different issue. As shown by Piché (2019), the conversio ad phantasmata, also called “reflexio”, is described in two different ways all along the Thomasian corpus : either the return toward phantasms happens by accident when the intellect grasps the universal, either the conversio is an autoreflexive process achieved by the intellect toward its own intellectual act of thinking. Although the commentators (Gilson, Kretzmann, Lonergan and Pasnau) haven’t categorized Thomas’ explanations in terms of a dichotomy as Piché did, they all seem to agree with the first explanation provided by Aquinas.  We will build our text according to the following plan : after a brief introduction, we will expose the salient features of Thomas Aquinas’ epistemology to reveal the structural links in between the intellect and the sensible soul. Then, we will show that the intellect always turns toward phantasms while it’s active. Thereafter, we will confront the possible explanations relative to the way this turn occurs. Finally, we’ll expose the modality aporia, as I call it, which ensues necessarily from the relationship in between the sensible soul and intellect.

40	Estimation bayésienne d'une fonction de Pickands par des splines cubiques	The subject of our thesis is intersection between two fields: The Extreme Value Theory (EVT) and copulas. The object of EVT is to find the limit law of the maximum of a sample. Due to the results of EVT, we can model extreme phenomena. In addition, there is a bivariate variant of EVT. The bivariate variant of EVT uses a family of copulas called extreme value copulas to account for the connection between the two extreme events. Any copula with extreme values depends on a Pickands function. The object of our thesis is to estimate the Pickands function from data. We have found a way to build a Pickands function using cubic splines. From this construction, we obtain an extended family of Pickands functions in which we perform our statistical inference. We chose the Bayesian approach to build the estimator and the MCMC methods for the estimates. The method was applied on simulated and real data.

41	Créer un atlas numérique de l'architecture publique en France (1795-1840) : éditorialisation d'une base de données en histoire de l'art	This master's thesis entails in the creation of a digital atlas of public architecture in France during the first half of the XIXth century. The Council of Civil Buildings, the public institution in charge of civil architecture after the revolution, had as aim to build the Republic. Thus, their architectural project takes on a symbolic function, the inscription of power into space, as well as the function to control the public space. A rationalisation and codification of the architectural practice, as well a mindset structured by the advancements in cartography and statistics, form in order to build a territory mirroring the new nation-state. Derived from the analysis of the Coucil’s sessions’ reports between 1795 and 1840, the CONBAVIL database presents the opportunity to study Council’s work through a spatial and quantitative approach uniting territory, knowledge, and power. After a critical analysis of its contents, the editorialisation of CONBAVIL takes the shape of as a web application. This research tool maps and visualizes this data using the D3.js code library. The multiple forms of representation, whose interactivity multiply their analytical potential, aim to reveal a new understanding of the political and architectural doings of the Council of Civil Buildings. The digital dimension of the atlas will allow a visual, multidimensional and hyperlinked explora-tion of the CONBAVIL data, until now only accessible through a form and as static records. Thus this research explores the potential of editorialising a database into a digital atlas for a visual epistemology in art history.

42	L'allégorie de la justice transitionnelle: résistance à l'oubli et construction du récit mémoriel en Uruguay post-dictatorial	In the 1960s, Uruguay endured an economic crisis that quickly turned into a conflict between the National Liberation Movement-Tupamaros (MLN-T) and the state then ruled by Juan María Bordaberry of the Colorado Party. The radicalization of the MLN-T and the rise of State repression granted growing power to the Armed Forces, leading to the coup d'État of June 27, 1973 followed by the establishment of a civic-military dictatorship. The next twelve years were marked by repression, censorship, violence and numerous disappearances. Like other Latin American Cold War dictatorships, Uruguay joined Operation Condor: a South American network led by the United States with the goal of tracking down and annihilating political opponents.   The 1985 elections marked the end of the dictatorship and return of democracy. However, in the aftermath of the victory of Julio María Sanguinetti of the Colorado party, a struggle erupted in the heart of society over who was to blame for the country’s fall into authoritarianism, state repression and violence. On the one hand, the Armed Forces were accused of abuse of power and crimes against humanity. On the other, some defended the military as though they had saved the country from the “subversive” threat.    This study analyzes Uruguay’s transitional process which, unlike its Latin American counterparts, has not included a formal mechanism for the search for truth upon the return of democracy. Uruguay rather chose to amnesty the Tupamaros detained during the dictatorship, all the while promulgating the Law of Caducity which granted impunity to the military. By collecting different perspectives on the recent past through art and cultural productions produced by civil society after le return du democracy, this thesis studies the evolution of memorial speeches as they are expressed in public spaces. Our goal is to better understand how memorial discourses emerge in a country where democratic remedies have confirmed impunity.

43	Utilisation des propriétés spectrales pour détecter le stress dans les peuplements nordiques d'épinettes noires	In the boreal forest of northern Québec, the size and quantity of lichen woodlands patches is increasing, and taking over the spruce-moss forest territory. The phenomenon has been observed, and scientists now believe that the northern limit of the spruce-moss forest will slowly move south. This shift of ecosystem happens when the forest stand is already fragilized, and a perturbation occurs. Vegetation’s spectral properties can be used as a tool to assess and identify disturbed forest areas The main objective of this study is to establish relations between data extracted from spectral signatures, vegetation indexes and different types of stress that could affect boreal ecosystems. The identification spruce-moss woodlands prone to regeneration failure could be achieved with the study of spectral properties as stress indicators. In order to achieve this objective, sites from 3 latitudes (51, 52 and 53) have been sampled on James Bay Road. Plots have been regrouped in pairs for subsequent pairwise statistical tests to compare results from both forest stand types. Spectral signatures have been measured on 5 randomly chosen black spruces. These measurements were taken throughout the growing season (3 sampling campaigns). Four vegetation indexes have been extracted from spectral signatures (NDVI, NDWI, PRI and SIPI), and the mean slope of the red-edge area have been calculated. Results have shown that some of the spruce-moss stands have had very similar values to those from the lichen woodlands, that are considered as stressed ecosystems. From these results, it is possible to assume that stressed ecosystems can be detected at landscape level (on satellite images). Monitoring vegetation stress can help improve forest management after forest fires and insect’s epidemics to prevent the loss of this beautiful ecosystem.

44	L’image des personnages dans les jeux mobiles du genre Josei-Muke : étude de cas sur Mr. Love : Queen’s Choice	Female players (women) have become more active in the mobile game market in recent years. And women’s games, which used to be a niche category, have entered the public eye due to the increased audience. At the same time, however, not much research has been done on these games in academia, especially in Europe and the US. Therefore, the main objective of this paper is to analyse the character design of this category of games, addressing the case of Mr. Love: Queen's Choice, a mobile game for women that has become a big hit in the Asian market. Based on the elements of game value research proposed by Belman, this paper will study the character design features in this category of games from four major aspects: basic game features, gameplay, aesthetics and narrative. At the same time, since the study of this paper does not involve any interviews, it mainly focuses on textual analysis. The ideas of textual analysis in it are mainly inspired by Roland Barthes’ mythology as well as semiotic theory. The paper is divided into six chapters. The first chapter is the introduction, which presents the context and meaning of the topic; the second chapter is the literature review, which aims to identify the results of current academic research on video games, mobile games, gender issues in games and women-oriented games; the third chapter presents the problematic; the next chapter discusses the methodology and briefly presents the main guiding ideas and structure throughout the research process. The fifth chapter is entirely devoted to the analysis to answer the problematic and the last chapter constitutes a conclusion and discussions.

45	Étude théorique d’une réaction d’alkynylation de thiol catalysée au cuivre I	This thesis is about the theoretical study of a reaction allowing the formation of macrocycles via Cu(I) -catalyzed S-C(sp) coupling to form a macrocyclic alkynyl sulfide. This type of reaction involves the coupling between a thiol and a C(sp) carbon. Although the synthetic part of that reaction is complete, to date, no information exists regarding the reaction mechanism. Theoretical tools such as density functional theory (DFT), transition state theory (TST) and natural bond orbitals (NBO) were used in order to undertake this study. The thesis also includes an experimental part associated with the total synthesis of the macrocycle used in the model reaction. The thesis will begin with an introduction on the S-C(sp) bond and on macrocycles in general. Afterwards, we will introduce the concept of theoretical study applied to a reaction mechanism. The goal and strategy of the study will then be established. The introduction will be followed by a chapter on the methodology, in which we make an overview of important theoretical concepts concerning electronic structure calculations and thermodynamic properties of a chemical system. We will then discuss theoretical concepts that have been used in concert with chemical kinetics and chemical environment. This chapter will be followed by a discussion on the choice of the computational method. For that purpose, different chemical properties were predicted and compared with experimental results using different electronic structure calculation methods. Finally, we will discuss the results of the study on the reaction investigated, which include a short section concerning the total synthesis of the macrocycle, a section concerning the energy profile of the studied mechanisms and a section where we provide a description of the most probable mechanisms based on a natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis. The results of the study are in favor of the α-addition mechanism, but the α-cuprathiolation and oxidative addition - reductive elimination mechanism should also be considered. Nevertheless, a thorough experimental study would be necessary in order to be able to obtain more information about the mechanism.

46	"Effectiveness of interprofessional manikin-based simulation training on
teamwork among real teams during trauma resuscitation in adult emergency
departments : a systematic review"	This systematic review synthesizes the relevant evidence about the effectiveness of interprofessional manikin-based simulation training on teamwork among real teams during trauma resuscitation in adult civilian emergency departments. A systematic literature search was conducted in MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, EBM reviews, PsycINFO, and Web of Science with no time limit. Only experimental and quasi-experimental studies were included. Effects of the simulation intervention on teamwork were categorized according to a modified version of the Kirkpatrick's model. From the 1120 studies found, 11 studies were included for synthesis. All studies showed immediate improvement in teamwork after training, but divergent results were found regarding skills retention. Although this review focused on interprofessional manikin-based simulations in real trauma teams, the results are similar to previous systematic reviews including different types of simulation. This raises significant questions regarding the importance of simulation design characteristics to improve teamwork in trauma care.

47	Understanding the shared genetic risk for psychosis and substance use disorders : a study of genetic markers of endogenous and exogenous cannabinoid-related Risk	Cannabis consumption during adolescence, increases the likelihood of adverse mental health outcomes, including substance abuse and psychosis. Considering that part of the etiology of these disorders are heritable, we aimed to elucidate the genetic risk for psychosis and substance use disorders and their relationships to cannabis and the endocannabinoid system. In our first work, we investigated the relationship between endocannabinoid genetic markers and alcohol use disorder in two adolescent cohorts. Through candidate gene approaches we demonstrated a significant relationship between these endocannabinoid genes and AUD, but the results were not replicated in the second cohort. In a second work, we examined if the relationship between polygenic risk score for schizophrenia (PRS-Sz) and psychotic like experiences (PLE) is mediated and/or moderated by cannabis use, in two cohorts. Mediation and moderation regression models were used to examine the extent to which the prospective relationship between PRS-Sz and PLE is accounted for by cannabis use. The results of both the mediation and moderation analyses were not significant, although PRS-Sz and cannabis use both independently predicted PLE. These results suggest that cannabis use remains a risk factor for psychotic-like experiences, over and above known genetic vulnerability for schizophrenia and there was no evidence that genetically vulnerable individuals were more susceptible to the psychosis-related outcomes of adolescent onset cannabis use. The work described demonstrates that the risks posed by adolescent cannabis consumption may be unrelated to one’s genetic predisposition to psychiatric disease, notwithstanding the involvement of the endocannabinoid system in the pathogenesis of these same diseases.

48	Évolution de la maladie de Crohn luminale chez les enfants au courant de la dernière décennie et facteurs associés à la mise en rémission rapide et durable des patients, une étude de cohorte rétrospective au CHU Sainte-Justine, Montréal	Crohn's disease (CD) has a high incidence in the pediatric population in North America. The etiology of CD remains unknown and the disease incidence has been increasing. The natural evolution of CD is misunderstood, especially in the pediatric population. The trends of time-to-remission over the years and the influencing factors are very limited in the literature. Few risk factors are identified in the literature to predict relapses of the disease in children. The first part of this study was to describe the trends in the clinical phenotype, endoscopic, histological, and laboratory characteristics of pediatric CD during the last decade and to describe the seasonal variation of disease presentation at diagnosis. The secondary part of this study was to describe the time to remission in children with CD as well as its evolution over the past decade and to determine factors associated with time to remission. The third part of the study was to describe the rate of relapses in children with CD, its evolution over the past decade and to determine risk factors associated with relapse of the disease.  Eligible patients were aged from 4 to 18 years and diagnosed between 2009 and 2019. All clinical, endoscopic, histological, laboratory and treatment data were collected from their medical records. Survival analyses and linear regression models were used to assess the impact of those factors on time to remission. Likewise, survival analyses and Cox regression models were applied to assess the impact of those risk factors on relapse.  A total of 654 patients were included in this retrospective cohort study. The number of new diagnoses per year increased over the decade. Patients diagnosed between 2015 and 2019 had a lower age at diagnosis (OR 2.53, 95% CI [1.29; 4.98]), more perianal diseases (OR: 2.30, 95% CI [1.52; 3.48]), more granulomas (OR: 1.61, 95% CI [1.17; 2.22]), but less eosinophils (OR: 0.35, 95% CI [0.25; 0.48]) and less chronic lympho-plasma cells infiltrate (OR: 0.56, 95% CI [0.36; 0.86]) on ileo-colonic biopsies compared to patients diagnosed in 2015-2019. There were fewer diagnoses of CD in children in winter. Patients diagnosed in fall had lower PCDAIs and less failure to thrive. CD diagnosed in spring and summer had lower hemoglobin levels and higher erythrocyte sedimentation rate levels. In addition, arthritis and erythema nodosum were more frequent in spring and summer. Colonic location was significantly more frequent in summer and fall.    There was no change in the time to clinical remission over the past decade. Female sex in adolescents (adjusted bêta regression coefficient (aβ)= 31.8 days, p=0.02), upper digestive tract involvement (aβ= 46.4 days, p=0.04) perianal disease (aβ= 32.2 days, p=0.04), presence of active inflammation on biopsies (aβ= 46.7 days, p=0.01) and oral 5-ASA exposure (aβ= 56.6 days, p=0.002) were all associated with longer time to clinical remission. However, antibiotic exposure (aβ= -29.3 days, p=0.04), increased eosinophils on biopsies (aβ= -29.6 days, p=0.008) and combination of exclusive enteral nutrition and TNF-alpha inhibitors as induction therapy (aβ= -36.8 days, p=0.04) were associated with shorter time to clinical remission.    There has been a decrease in the relapse rate over the past decade : 69.6% in patients diagnosed between 2009 and 2014 and 47.8% in patients diagnosed between 2015 and 2019 (p<0.0001). Female sex (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 1.51, p=0.0009), high PCDAI (aHR= 1.02, p=0.04) and SES-CD (aHR= 1.03, p=0.03) scores at diagnosis, upper digestive tract involvement (aHR= 1.59, p=0.0003), exposure to oral 5-ASA (aHR= 1.91, p=0.0003), use of immunomodulatory agents compared to TNF-alpha inhibitors (methotrexate aHR= 1.91, p=0.0006; thiopurines aHR= 2.06, p<0.0001), presence of granulomas (aHR= 1.27, p=0.04) and increased eosinophils on biopsies (aHR= 1.34, p=0.02), high levels of C-reactive protein (aHR= 1.01, p<0.0001) and fecal calprotectin (aHR=1.09, p<0.0001) during clinical remission and low serum infliximab levels during maintenance (aHR for mean serum infliximab level under 7ug/mL = 2.48, p=0.005) were all significantly associated with relapse in patients.  The disease phenotype has changed over the years and important trends in the frequency and severity of diagnoses exist according to the diagnosis period within a year, suggesting etiological hypotheses such as vitamin D deficiency in winter, seasonal bacterial and viral colitis and academic stress. Many of the results of the study are original and brought new knowledge while confirming certain statements which had not obtained consensus in recent studies of expert opinions and some could be incorporated into management guidelines of pediatric CD to short time to remission and avoid relapse in patients.

49	Conséquences imprévues : comprendre les maladies cardiovasculaires chez les adultes âgés atteints d’épilepsie	INTRODUCTION. The global burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is steadily increasing. A population particularly vulnerable to these diseases are the older adults with a neurological condition: epilepsy. Several studies show that older adults with epilepsy have a higher risk of developing CVD when compared to the general population. This association is surprisingly poorly studied among people with epilepsy. In order to develop health care programs to prevent the onset of CVD comorbidity in people with epilepsy, creating an accurate portrait of older adults with epilepsy is required. OBJECTIVES. In order to fill the gaps in the scientific literature on the causes of the high burden of CVD in older adults with epilepsy, the purpose of this thesis is to investigate the distribution of social factors, lifestyle and behaviors, as well as chronic disease CVD risk factors, in people with epilepsy as compared to the general population. In addition, we aim to measure the cross-sectional association between epilepsy and CVD in older adults, with and without adjustments for a history of stroke as well as looking for evidence of interactions between epilepsy and CVD risk factors. METHODS. We analysed data for 44,817 participants in the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA), a longitudinal study cohort of individuals aged at least 45 years and where more than 700 individuals have a lifetime self-reported history of epilepsy. Adjusting for age, sex and stroke, we used log-binomial regression to model the cross-sectional associations between CVD risk factors, epilepsy, and CVD such as heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, and myocardial infarction. We compared the CVD burden attributable to stroke in the population with and without epilepsy. Multivariable regression models were also stratified across levels of epilepsy status to observe for differences in these associations between epilepsy and people without epilepsy. Finally, we tested the existence of interactions between CVD risk factors and epilepsy and their association with CVD status. We used multiple imputation to replace missing data. RESULTS. The majority of the sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle and behavior and chronic diseases, selected as CVD risk factors in our study, were significantly more prevalent in people with epilepsy as compared to the general population without epilepsy. The CVD burden attributable to stroke in people with epilepsy was only 36%, similar to the general population which reached 32%. Even after adjusting for a history of stroke, as well as age and sex, people with epilepsy had a significantly higher prevalence of heart disease [prevalence ratio (PR) = 1.27 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.57)] and peripheral vascular disease [PR = 1.88 (95% CI: 1.50, 2.36)]. Although no longer significant, the trend towards an increase in the prevalence of myocardial infarction in people with epilepsy was maintained [PR = 1.19 (95% CI: 0.89, 1.60)]. Finally, among all the CVD risks factors, only age, hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were associated with significant increases in the prevalence of one or more of the CVD. CONCLUSION. The large sample size and breadth of health information captured by the CLSA (i.e. demographic, social, physical, psychological, economic, physiological) allowed us to model in-depth analysis and present a fair reflection of an older adult population. The presented thesis demonstrates that CVD risk factors are more frequently seen in people with epilepsy and that the association between epilepsy and CVD is independent of the association between epilepsy and stroke. These findings are important first steps in more comprehensively understanding the origins of CVD in people with epilepsy. Mediation analysis could have been a way of further examining my analysis. This was not possible with the current analysis given that we had no way to establish the temporal sequence of our data. Older adults are a vulnerable population in which health care providers should pay particular attention. Conducting longitudinal studies of individuals with newly diagnosed epilepsy seizures and fully characterized chronic disease, sociodemographic characteristics and lifestyle (prior to and post a epilepsy diagnosis) are needed.	comorbidity , seizure , heart disease , social determinants of health	en	25976.0
50	Enjeux de santé mentale et consommation de substances psychoactives en contexte sexuel ou «chemsex» chez les HARSAH à Montréal	Background: Gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (GBM) are at higher risk of anxiety and/or depression symptoms compared to the general population. Chemsex is defined as the use of gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid, methamphetamine, cocaine, ecstasy and ketamine during sex. Little is known regarding the association between chemsex and anxiety and depression symptoms, and if this relation is moderated by HIV status. Methods: Montréal baseline data from the Engage cohort study were used. 1179 sexually active GBM ≥ 16 years old were recruited via respondent-driven sampling (RDS). Presence of anxiety and depression symptoms were defined using a score of ≥ 8 on either the anxiety- or depression-subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Using two logistic multivariate models, we assessed the association of chemsex with symptoms of anxiety and depression. Statistical interaction between self-reported HIV status and chemsex were tested in each multivariate model adjusting for potential confounders. Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) are reported; analyses were RDS-adjusted. Results: Effect modification by self-reported HIV status was statistically significant for anxiety and depression symptoms. Anxiety symptoms were positively associated with HIV-negative GBM engaging in chemsex compared to HIV-negative GBM not engaging in chemsex (aOR=1.75, 95%CI:1.14-2.68); significant confounders included being younger (aOR=1.04, 95%CI:1.02-1.05), education ≤ high school diploma (aOR=1.89, 95%CI:1.28-2.82), alcohol misuse (aOR=1.45, 95%CI:1.08-1.96), lifetime history of sexual abuse (aOR=3.47, 95%CI:2.46-4.92) and being positive to C. trachomatis, gonococcal or syphilis infection (aOR=0.45, 95%CI:0.27-0.75). Depression symptoms were positively associated with HIV-negative GBM engaging in chemsex compared to HIV-negative GBM not engaging in chemsex (aOR=1.66, 95%CI:1.11-2.46); significant confounders included not identifying as a cis-gendered male (aOR=2.77, 95%CI:1.78-4.28) and lifetime history of sexual abuse (aOR=2.85, 95%CI:2.08-3.91). Conclusions: Results suggest that engaging in chemsex is linked to anxiety and depression symptoms among HIV-negative GBM but not for GBM living with HIV. Longitudinal research is needed to understand the directionality of identified associations. Implications of results for intervention strategies are discussed.

51	Health capabilities, public policies and the determinants of infant mortality in Brazil	Abstract The infant mortality rate is an indicator of population health and the effectiveness of health systems that is also capable of estimating the extent of social and health inequalities between populations. Over the last 30 years, Brazil has recorded significant reductions in child mortality rates. Between 1990 and 2017, the under-five mortality rate dropped from 53.7 to 15.6 deaths per thousand live births, a 71% reduction over the period. The national reduction average was 6% per year in the 1990s, decreasing to 4.8% in the 2000s and to 3.2% per year between 2011 and 2015, and many factors have been reported as the cause of these improvements.  Even after the implementation of health and social policies that positively affected the health of the populations in Brazil in the last decades, since 2009 the country has experienced a slow decrease in the decline in infant mortality that remained at high levels, registering great regional disparities. After an economic crisis that evolved into a troubled period of political crisis, in 2016 the country recorded increases in under-one-year infant mortality and under-five-year infant mortality rates, that raised from 12.43 deaths to 12.72 deaths per thousand live births and from 14.28 deaths to 14.89 deaths per thousand live births, respectively.  These facts call attention to the possible impact of social determinants of health on infant mortality rates in Brazil after the implementation of these health and social policies. This anomaly in the trend of child mortality, particularly when combined with regional disparities and a slow decrease in the decline in infant mortality rates is of great concern and raise questions about what is the extent of these health and social policies on the country’s ability to maintain a longer-term decline in the infant mortality rate, is it capable of placing this rate at the level of developed countries and what are the determinants of infant mortality in Brazil after the implementation of these public policies.  The overarching goal of this thesis was to identify the determinants of infant mortality in Brazil after the implementation of  the Family Health Strategy and the Bolsa Família programs in order to raise plausible hypotheses for the slowdown, the regional disparities, and the anomaly observed in the trend of declines in the infant mortality rate in Brazil. To attain this objective, we conducted three research papers: 1. a scoping review that aimed at identifying and summarizing the determinants of infant mortality in Brazil under the influence of Family Health Strategy and Bolsa Família programs, with a view of raising hypothesis for the recent changes in the infant mortality rates in Brazil and identifying gaps in terms of research concerning the determinants of infant mortality in the country, 2. a descriptive retrospective analysis according to the perspective of Public Health and health inequalities by adopting the analytical framework proposed by the World Health Organization’s Commission on Social Determinants of Health, using data from under-one-year old infant mortality rate and from possible determinants of infant mortality in Brazil according to the findings of our scoping review (article 1), and 3. a methodological proposal in order to overcome the challenges to developing a panel data model using aggregated data from the 26 Brazilian states and different subregions according to the Conceptual Model of Health Capability, with a view of inferring possible associations between our independent variables and infant mortality rates in Brazil, aiming at reviewing the hypothesis raised in the scoping review about the recent changes in the country's infant mortality indicators.  The global results of these studies demonstrated that in the light of the Conceptual Model of Health Capability and the social determinants of health, regional disparities related to inequalities in factors such as income, education, employment, fertility rate, access, and quality of health services, account for inequalities in infant mortality rates, especially in the north and Northeast macro-regions of the country, which likely hamper further reductions of infant mortality. Those inequalities would explain both the slowdown in the reduction and the tendency of the infant mortality rate to remain at relatively high levels. Results also demonstrated that variations in those factors for reasons relating to the economic and political crisis, likely have interrupted the secular trend of declining infant mortality rates. In this regard, results suggest that a sharp reduction in employment rate observed between 2014 and 2015, among other factors, may have had a delayed impact on infant mortality rates in 2016. The results also identified an association between employment and different infant mortality indicators, with employment rate possibly impacting child mortality up to three years. Finally, the studies have shown that a household income threshold acts as a protective factor against child mortality, the bigger the proportion of households below this income bracket, the greater the risk of an increase in child mortality.

52	Impact de la culture organisationnelle sur l'ergomanie	The main goal of this thesis is to study of the influence of organizational culture on workaholism. Workaholism is an addiction to work that requires working excessively and compulsively. The existing literature on the subject has enabled us to distinguish workaholism leading to burnout from workaholism not leading to burnout. We have developed a typology of workaholics’ profiles which classifies workers along two continuums: the vertical axis represents the degree of workaholism (we will here contrast individuals showing no sign of addiction to highly addicted individuals). The horizontal axis provides information on the degree of burnout. It leads to four groups of workers: relaxed workers, tired workers, non-toxic workaholics and toxic workaholics. The data comes from the SALVEO study conducted in Canada by the Équipe de Recherche sur le Travail et la Santé Mentale (ERTSM). The data was collected between 2009 and 2012 in 63 workplaces with a response rate of 71.3%, equivalent to 2,162 employees. First, performed descriptive analyzes of our population in order to know the fundamental characteristics of the entire SALVEO sample. Then, we performed bivariate analyzes to determine the absence or presence of a significant linear relationship between the variables. We have then performed multivariate analyzes of our variables in order to obtain the net effects of our variables on the workaholic profil. These have shown that rational culture associates positively with workers with toxic workaholism and, conversely, group culture associates negatively with workers with toxic workaholism.	surengagement , Workaholism , organizational culture , burnout , over commitment	en	25968.0
53	L'épuisement professionnel des enseignants et les comportements extériorisés d'élèves du 2e et 3e cycle du primaire : le rôle de la relation maître-élèves	Students with externalized behavioral problems in elementary school represent an important issue for Québec schools and society. Indeed, they are more at risk to encounter psychosocial difficulties throughout their school career and at the start of their adulthood. Consequently, to find new possible interventions, it is necessary to study factors of school context that allow development, maintenance, and exacerbation of these behaviors. This study therefore focuses on teacher burnout, a factor that may influence student behavior in the classroom, but on which little research has been done. With a longitudinal design, the aim of this study was first to assess whether teacher burnout is associated with increase in externalized behavioral problems among students in 2nd and 3rd cycle of elementary school. Secondly, we aimed to determine if this association is moderated by the quality of the teacher-student relationship. Hierarchical regression analyzes were performed on two samples differing by their multiethnic composition. Data from the first sample were collected of 735 students and their 43 teachers, in seven francophone elementary schools of Montérégie. Data from the second sample were collected of 616 students and their 64 teachers, in five francophone elementary schools of Montréal. Results suggest that teacher burnout is associated with an increase in externalized behaviors among students. However, results do not allow to conclude a generalized moderating role of the teacher-student relationship. Implications of the results for research and psychoeducational practice are discussed. We suggest that psychoeducators can prevent and reduce the signs of professional burnout among teachers by practicing an advisory role with teachers and management, by leading professional development workshops and by setting up intervention programs.

54	Diabète secondaire à la fibrose kystique : simplification du dépistage et impact clinique de l’hyperglycémie	The life expectancy of people living with cystic fibrosis (CF) is increasing and is now over 50 years old in Canada.  Higher life expectancy is associated with the emergence of new secondary complications of the disease; the most important being CF-related diabetes (CFRD). Almost half of adults with CF have CFRD. It has been associated with lung function decrease, weight loss and increased morbidity. End-stage lung disease is the leading cause of death in CF, while weight loss is associated with decreased lung function. Thus, CFRD increases the risk of early mortality. It is primarily caused by a decrease in insulin secretion secondary to chronic pancreatitis. However, minimal insulin secretion is maintained, usually allowing fasting blood glucose to remain normal for a long time. Whether or not there is insulin resistance is controversial. Our research group hypothesized that in a context of low insulin secretion, a change in insulin resistance (secondary to pulmonary infection, medication, a high fat diet, etc.) can lead to glucose intolerance. An annual screening test, the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), is recommended from the age of 10. The OGTT requires fasting, venous access, and lasts for two hours. This test is widely criticized in the scientific literature, since the diagnostic thresholds are based on the risk of microvascular complications (thresholds for type 2 diabetes) and not on pulmonary complications of CF. Our research group therefore aims to study alternative screening tests for CFRD. Glycemia at 1-hour of the OGTT is currently being investigated in CF, as it is believed to be associated with clinical decline specific to CF. Our research group hypothesized that the 1-h OGTT blood glucose can predict changes in weight and lung function over several years. The work of this thesis is divided into two sections. First, we wanted to study the impact of insulin resistance on the evolution of glucose tolerance over two years and the impact of 1-h glycemia and insulin of the OGTT on the CF clinical parameters over 4 years. Secondly, a review of the literature on current and alternative CFRD screening methods was carried out. Validation studies on diabetes biomarkers were also performed in our cohort of CF patients (over 300 patients). Two cohorts of CF patients are being studied. First, the Montreal Cystic Fibrosis Cohort (MCFC) includes patients followed at the Centre Hospitalier de l’Université de Montréal (CHUM). Established in 2004, this observational cohort includes over 300 patients with an OGTT every 12 to 24 months. Then, data from the MCFC were pooled with those of a similar cohort established in Lyon, France (150 patients). The new cohort named GLYCONE aims to study the impact of 1-h glycemia and insulin of the OGTT on the clinical course of CF patients (prospective follow-up of 4 years). The main conclusions of this thesis are:  1. Insulin resistance is implicated in the change in glucose tolerance over 2 years in our adult patients; 2. The patients of the MCFC have better lung function and a higher weight than the French patients. However, the incidence of diabetes and pre-diabetes is higher in the Canadian population; 3. The GLYCONE international cohort shows that 1-hour and 2-hour glucose levels of the OGTT do not influence the clinical course of weight and lung function over 4 years, suggesting that mechanisms occurring earlier in life allow the onset of clinical differences in blood glucose levels; 4. A scientific literature review shows that the 2-h OGTT blood glucose should remain the standard test for CFRD, since other alternatives methods have not been shown to be effective and; 5. Alternative screening biomarkers for CFRD such as glycated hemoglobin, fasting blood glucose and insulin sensitivity index do not allow us to target diabetic patients in our MCFC. However, the use of these markers could reduce the number of required annual OGTT.	cystic fibrosis , diabetes , pulmonary function , weight , insulin resistance , insulin secretion , oral glucose tolerance test , screening test	en	25950.0
55	Inflammation d’origine non-pathogénique durant la gestation, implication dans les complications de la grossesse et impact sur le développement cérébral	INTRODUCTION: Intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR), preeclampsia (PE) and preterm birth (PTB) are important pathologies of pregnancy strongly associated with poor placental function, a central organ for fetal development. About 5-12% of all pregnancies are pathological and this increases the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders. Inflammation is central to all pregnancy complications and the causal link has been demonstrated with several animal models of prenatal inflammation leading to brain damage in newborns. However, these models use infectious stimuli although pathogens are rarely detected clinically. Despite the absence of detectable infection, evidence of inflammation, such as elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and alarmins, is observed. Alarmins are endogenous mediators, another cause of inflammation increasingly associated with pathological pregnancies. Uric acid is one of the most studied alarmins, however its effect on pregnancy is mostly unknown. Thus, my hypothesis was that prenatal exposure particularly to uric acid is associated with pregnancy complications and is a cause of placental damage which subsequently impairs fetal neurodevelopment, leading to long-term brain damage in the child.  My general OBJECTIVE was to understand the link between non-pathogenic prenatal inflammation, pregnancy complications and its effect on the placenta and the developing brain. Specifically, I detected the presence of inflammation in major pregnancy complications and subsequently focused on PE and its immune activation. In parallel, I established the causal link between non-infectious inflammation, placental damage and IUGR. Finally, I evaluated brain development following in utero inflammation and investigated a therapeutic target in my preclinical model.  METHODS AND RESULTS: I analyzed the inflammatory profile of 200 women with or without pregnancy complications (Ctrl, IUGR, PE, PTB) and demonstrated that each complication has a distinct circulating inflammatory profile, particularly in women with PE. In addition, I further analyzed women with PE and observed a uric acid increase in the maternal circulation, related to an altered immune profile and structural changes in the placenta. To determine the direct effects of uric acid, we used cultures of primary trophoblasts, the main cell of the placenta, and human placental explants. We have shown that uric acid induces a pro-inflammatory profile, particularly increasing the secretion of IL-1β and IL-6 and induces apoptosis of trophoblasts. In parallel, I developed a new preclinical model of pregnant rats that were injected intraperitoneally with uric acid from gestation time 18 (G18) to G21. The injection of uric acid at the end of gestation in the rat caused increase cytokines (IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-6), the infiltration of immune cells in the placenta as well as an IUGR in the fetus that persisted into the postnatal period. Additionally, babies exposed to uric acid in utero have neurodevelopmental impairment characterized by microglial and astroglial activation in addition to decreased motor function. These effects of uric acid was dependent on IL-1β and was blocked by the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra).  CONCLUSIONS: Inflammation is associated with all pregnancy complications, however, with different profiles depending on the pathology studied. PE is associated with significant immune changes. Uric acid at the maternal-fetal interface induced inflammation and altered placental functions in an IL-1-dependent manner. Ultimately, exposure to uric acid in late rat pregnancy induced placental inflammation, IUGR, and impaired brain development. Prenatal anti-inflammatory treatment helped minimize inflammation and these negative effects on the brain.

56	Étude rétrospective céphalométrique comparant les changements dento-alvéolaires à la suite d’un traitement avec Twin Block, Carrière® Motion 3D™ Appliance et Xbow	Introduction: The objective of this retrospective study is to compare the skeletal and dento-alveolar changes caused by three functional appliances, the Twin Block (TB), the Xbow (Xb), and the Carrière® Motion 3D™ Appliance (CMA), during the first phase of treatment for class II correction. Methods: The pre-treatment (T0) and post-functional treatment (T1) lateral cephalometric radiographs of 43 adolescent patients treated with a TB (15), an Xb (7) or a CMA (21) were recovered and traced, and 12 skeletal and 10 dental measurements were analyzed. The differences (T1-T0) between the appliances will be compared using the ANOVA analysis, independent samples t-tests, or Mann-Whitney U-tests. Results: On average, the treatments lasted 10.1 ± 3.2 months with the TB and 7.4 ± 2.7 months with the CMA. The TB group experienced greater mandibular length and sagittal position changes by increasing Cd-Pg (3.4 mm), Pg-Go (1.3 mm), N-B (//FH) (1.3 mm), and S-N-B (1.2°) more than the CMA. The TB improved the Wits appraisal 2.2 mm more than the CMA. The TB also had a superior retroclining effect on the maxillary incisor inclination and position by reducing U1–FH (4.2°) more than the CMA. The CMA restrained the antero-posterior movement of the maxillary first molar while the TB had no significant effect on this variable. The only clinically significant change that the CMA displayed was in relation to mandibular incisor proclination, L1–MP (4.1°). The results related to the Xb group were excluded due to its very small sample size. Conclusion: Class II correction is achieved by a combination of skeletal and dento-alveolar changes with the TB, but primarily through dento-alveolar effects with the CMA. A bigger sample size is required in order to properly compare the effects of the Xb.	Twin Block , Carrière® Motion 3D™ Appliance , Xbow , Dento-alveolar effects	en	25935.0
57	Les phénomènes d'hypermnésie amnésiante dans le solo 887 de Robert Lepage	With the advent of digital technology, we were in a position to think that these unprecedented technological advances would ensure archival sustainability and make the triumph of knowledge a reality. However, it is clear that nothing has ever been so lost and forgotten. The migration of archives - from one medium to another ever more powerful - leads to their deletion, their loss. The obsession for excessive preservation is part of the current phenomena of “amnesing hypermagnesia,” which inexorably leads societies towards the disappearance of their historicity.  Robert Lepage’s solo show 887 (premiered in Quebec City in 2015) is based on the traces of the past - a memory that is both intimate and collective, rooted in the 1960s and 1970s. The title refers to the address where the artist spent his childhood : 887 Murray Avenue, in the Montcalm district of Quebec City. The piece brings to light a paradoxical aspect of forgetting, namely that one must, through the various modalities of memory, make the effort not to forget and at the same time, one must forget in order to remember. Indeed, recent studies in neuroscience show that forgetting is not only inseparable from memory - being its corollary and not an adversary - but that it is vital. Solo 887 fights tirelessly against amnesic surges. In this sense we argue that it is a work of resistance against forgetting, finding its regulation by remembering as much as it forgets.  It is on this paradox that this research will focus. It questions the Lepagian autobiography revealing that the authenticity of the memorial discourse requires the adhesion of the audience and demands its copresence to reconstruct the fragments of the past. In 887, the mnemonic traces spring up, through the architecture of the scene by the images, the screens - surfaces of inscription if any - the objects and the characters. The characters shaped by the artist stand as places of memory, and the interactions that take place between the different components of the stage - including the actor - are mediations of the past.  This memory is based on opposed considerations. On the one hand, on Henri Bergson and Paul Ricœur’s, for whom forgetting is the destruction of all life, and on the other hand, on the work of Friedrich Nietzsche, who sees it as one of the essential conditions of all action. At the end of this study, it is a renewed vision of oblivion that we are trying to bring about.

58	A study of virtual reality-mediated affective state and cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease	Alzheimer’s disease is an irreversible disease which causes progressive memory loss and cognitive decline, eventually leading to severe inability to perform basic day-to-day tasks. The urgency to find an effective cure to the disease is crucial, as the medical and economical spin-offs could be disastrous. The present thesis explores a novel approach to help attenuate the psychological and cognitive effects of the disease. The research carried out for this thesis explored cognitive effects and impacts on overall well-being of a virtual reality intervention on people suffering from subjective cognitive decline. Two virtual environments were tested: the first being an environment in which the participant travels through different climates by train, and the second being a music therapy environment modified as a function of emotional response. To measure the effects on affective state, electroencephalography readings were taken and analyzed to infer the emotion felt by the participant before, during the experiment. Results show a general improvement in emotional state. To measure the effects of the environments on cognitive functions, attention and memory tasks were carried out by the participants before and after the immersion.  Results show a small improvement in attention skills and a more substantial improvement in memory skills. We appropriate this discrepancy in the music therapy experiment to the musical activation of a network of brain structures involved in rewarding and pleasurable experiences. We propose that music could facilitate memory retention in people sufferance for dementia. Importantly, the results of the previous experiments rely heavily on the accuracy of the cognitive measurement tool used to evaluate attention and memory performances before and after the intervention. To provide this accuracy, this thesis presents a cognitive performance measurement tool based on cognitive tasks which have repeatedly shown to output reliable results. This tool is created to serve for people with pre-clinical Alzheimer’s disease and diagnosed Alzheimer’s disease. Additionally, this tool is designed in such a way as to minimize the effects of repetition as well as varying levels of education and language.    This thesis presents a novel and promising research in the realms of computer sciences and health care.

59	Système intelligent pour le suivi et l’optimisation de l’état cognitif	The human’s emotions change regularly and sometimes suddenly leading to changes in their mental state which is the brain’s ability to function normally. This mental state’s changes affect the users’ cognitive ability (or cognitive state) to reason, access memory, or make inferences, which varies depending on the mental state. Consequently, this affects the users’ performances which varies according to their cognitive states. This thesis aims to optimize the users’ cognitive state during their interactions with a virtual environment. Since this state depends on emotions, optimization of cognitive state can be achieved through the optimization of emotions and in particular the reduction of negative emotions. In a first part, we present the means of measuring in real time (using a Measuring module) the users’ emotional and mental state during their interactions with a virtual environment. We performed four experimental studies with four different environments. We have shown that these measurements can be performed using different physiological sensors. We have also shown that it is possible to predict the tendency of excitement (a mental state) using an eye tracker. In a second part, we present the Neural Agent which modifies virtual environments to provoke a modification on the users’ emotional state in order to improve their cognitive state. We performed four experimental studies with four virtual environments, in which the Neural Agent intervenes in these environments to change the users’ emotional state. We have shown that the agent is able to intervene in several types of environments and able to modify the users’ emotions. In a third part, we present the Limbic Agent, which personalizes and improves the adaptations performed by the Neural Agent through the observation and the learning from the virtual environments changes’ impacts and the users’ emotional reactions. We have shown that this agent is able to analyze the Neural Agent’s interventions and able to modify them. We have also shown that the Limbic Agent is able to generate a new intervention rule and predict its impact on the user. The combination of the Measuring Module, the Neural Agent, and the Limbic Agent, allowed us to create an intelligent cognitive control system that we called the Digital Limbic System.

60	Se loger dans un quartier tremplin : trajectoires et stratégies résidentielles des familles immigrantes à Parc-Extension et Saint-Michel, Montréal	This research in urban and social geography investigates the residential trajectories and strategies of immigrant families in Saint-Michel and Parc-Extension, two inner suburbs of immigration in Montreal. While researchers still refer to them as transitional spaces, these two neighborhoods no longer seem to foster the social and spatial mobility of newcomers. Whereas most low-income tenants live in precarious housing situations in the private sector, a handful of immigrant families manage to access the social sector. How can we explain the residential stabilization of immigrant families in Parc-Extension and Saint-Michel and the access to social housing of a minority within these transitional neighborhoods? If there is a tendency to view immigrant families as multi-determined individuals in the housing market, they are still capable of decision-making. The idea is to give back a certain ability to act to families by insisting on the intentionality in their search and successive housing choices, while showing how these residential strategies are affected by specific barriers, notably related to their immigrant identity. To do so, I combine several qualitative survey techniques. Semi-directive interviews and a participatory photography project with 61 immigrant families form the basis of this analysis. If I use the interview transcripts and the photographs to understand the complexity of the residential choices and the housing search process, the systematic work of encoding the interviews helps me to reconstruct the long-term trajectories of the households since their arrival in Montreal. The thirty or so semi-directive interviews conducted with social landlords, elected officials and urban planners, as well as the participant observation carried out as a volunteer within a community organization in each neighborhood, provide an outside perspective on the structures which prevail over these immigrant families. Far from simply making choices on the basis of their immigrant identity, most families select their homes and neighborhoods as parents, the children being at the heart of their residential strategies. However, the structure of the housing supply, information dissemination issues or discriminatory practices by landlords and institutions lead to a social stratification in which the most integrated immigrant households manage to obtain good quality and affordable accommodation, while the most economically, socially and culturally vulnerable families are relegated to the de facto social stock. The ongoing changes in the two neighborhoods affect the projects of the interviewed families and increase their residential insecurity. While I am questioning the long-term continuation of the gateway function in Saint-Michel and Parc-Extension, tenant rights organizations try to compensate for the inaction of public authorities. With a theoretical and methodological intermediate position within studies on residential trajectories, this thesis aims to open up new research perspectives on urban restructuring and residential mobility at work in the transitional neighborhoods of major Canadian cities.

61	Le rôle de LATS1 et de LATS2 dans le développement du cortex surrénalien	The Hippo signaling pathway is a highly conserved kinase cascade that controls fundamental cellular processes such as proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation. In this cascade, the Large tumor suppressor kinase 1 and 2 (LATS1/2) phosphorylate and inactivate the main downstream effectors, Yes-associated protein (YAP) and Transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ), to finely regulate the development, size and homeostasis of several organs. It was recently demonstrated that YAP and TAZ were essential for the maintenance of the adrenal cortex during adult life, but the role of the upstream kinases has never been studied. The objective of the present project was therefore to elucidate the role of LATS1 and LATS2 in adrenocortical development. We generated a Lats1flox/flox;Lats2flox/flox;Nr5a1-cre mouse model in which Lats1/2 were conditionally inactivated in steroidogenic cells. The characterization of this model revealed that Lats1/2 were required to maintain proper adrenocortical cell identity during embryonic development. In the absence of Lats1/2, adrenocortical cells acquire myofibroblastic properties and lose their steroidogenic capacity, leading to adrenal deficiency and death at 2 to 3 weeks of age. This transdifferentiation is probably caused, at least in part, by an increased transcriptional activity of YAP/TAZ since a stronger nuclear expression of YAP/YAZ and higher expression levels of Hippo target genes were observed in the myofibroblastic population. These results suggest an important novel role of Hippo signaling in adrenal cortex development.

62	Law in the present future : approaching the legal imaginary of smart cities with science (and) fiction	This doctoral research concerns smart cities, describing digital solutions and social issues related to their innovative technologies, adopted models, and major projects around the world. The many perspectives mentioned in it were identified by online tools used for the textual analysis of two databases that were built from relevant publications on the main subject by authors coming from media and academia. Expected legal elements emerged from the applied process, such as privacy, security, transparency, participation, accountability, and governance. A general review was produced on the information available about the public policies of Big Data in the two municipal cases of Rio de Janeiro and Montréal, and their regulation in the Brazilian and Canadian contexts. The combined approaches from science and literature were explored to reflect on the normative concerns represented by the global challenges and local risks brought by urban surveillance, climate change, and other neoliberal conditions. Cyberpunk Science Fiction reveals itself useful for engaging with the shared problems that need to be faced in the present time, all involving democracy. The results achieved reveal that this work was, in fact, about the complex network of practices and senses between (post)modern law and the imaginary of the future.

63	«Partout où il y a des gens qui parlent, il y a des fausses nouvelles» : perceptions des fausses nouvelles chez des Québécois.es d’opinions diversifiées sur la question	Particularly popularized during the 2016 American election campaign, the concept of fake news is not new, but has evolved over the last decade, in line with the digitization of media and the arrival of social networking platforms. The notion of fake news can be considered as polysemous, while there is no real consensus as to its definition, both among researchers and the general public. For some, it can be a question of false content taking on the appearance of “real” news, and for others, it is more a question of “bad” journalism. In Quebec, the phenomenon is well and truly present and worries experts and journalists, but we still know very little about Quebecers’ perceptions of the issue.  Using folk theories, this paper explored the perceptions of twelve Quebecers with diverse opinions on the issue of fake news and the media ecosystem. Through three focus groups, the participants demonstrated that they do not have a definition of the concept, but rather identify fake news through various cues or specific characteristics. They also shared some of their criticisms of the news media in Quebec, demonstrating a growing skepticism about the quality and veracity of news content. Some also said they have difficulty making a clear distinction between “real” and “fake” news. Finally, a majority felt that fake news was circulating not only on social networks, but also in the news media.

64	Caractérisation d'une nouvelle voie de signalisation PTEN/PLCXD régulant le PtdIns(4,5)P2 endolysosomal	Phosphatidylinositol(4,5)P2 (PtdIns(4,5)P2) is essential for various cellular processes, including cell signaling, intracellular traffic and cytokinesis. Therefore, strict control of its homeostasis is crucial. Indeed, the deregulation of the kinases, phosphatases and phospholipases which controls PtdIns(4,5)P2 leads to multiple pathologies. Among them, the Lowe syndrome is a rare and incurable disease caused by mutations in the OCRL gene which codes for PtdIns(4,5)P2 phosphatase OCRL1. Depletion of dOCRL, the orthologue of OCRL1 in drosophila, alters the homeostasis of PtdIns(4,5)P2 with (i) an abnormal accumulation of PtdIns(4,5)P2 on the endomembranes leading (ii) to cytokinesis defects and multinucleation. The objective of this thesis was to understand how PtdIns(4,5)P2 is regulated on endomembranes. In drosophila cells, we have discovered a new and unexpected function for the tumor suppressor PTEN independent of its phosphatase activity. Indeed, we have found that PTEN reduces the levels of PtdIns(4,5)P2 on endolysosomes thanks to the enzymatic action of dPLCXD, an atypical phospholipase C (PLC). Thus, the PTEN/dPLCXD signaling pathway can compensate for cytokinesis defects due to the loss of dOCRL. Finally, we identified a chemical activator of PLC that restores the functional loss of OCRL in three distinct Lowe syndrome models. Next, we studied the role of this newly identified PTEN/PLCXD pathway during autophagy, a self-digestion mechanism. Indeed, the homeostasis of lysosomal PtdIns(4,5)P2 is essential for the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes during autophagy. We have observed that depletion of PLCXD and overexpression of a catalytically inactive mutant of PTEN both alter autophagy in Drosophila and mammalian cells. These data suggest that this newly identified PTEN/PLCXD pathway regulates the autophagic flux. In this thesis, we have highlighted a new PTEN/dPLCXD signaling pathway which controls the levels of PtdIns(4,5)P2 on endolysosomes. This new PTEN function is independent of its phosphatase activity and the first biological function for PLCXD can regulate autophagy and compensate for the loss of dOCRL. This discovery led to the identification of a potential therapeutic strategy for treating patients with Lowe’s syndrome.

65	Development and validation of the treatment expectations in chronic pain scale	Objectives: To develop and examine the psychometric properties of the Treatment Expectations in Chronic Pain (TEC) scale, a brief measure of treatment expectations of chronic non-cancer pain treatment.  Design: A cross-sectional study design was used.  Methods: After conducting a literature review and expert discussions, a preliminary version of the TEC scale was developed. Cognitive interviews with 10 clinicians and 14 patients were conducted to examine the scale's face validity and item wording. Last, two hundred and five patients on the waitlist for a multidisciplinary pain treatment centre completed a battery of self-report questionnaires to examine the TEC scale's reliability and construct validity. Mokken scale analysis was conducted to select the final items. Reliability (Cronbach's alpha and Guttman's lambda2 ) and construct validity (Pearson correlations) were assessed.  Results: The final scale was composed of nine items that each measured ideal and predicted expectations about process and outcome of treatment. Mokken scale analysis showed the presence of two subscales: ideal and predicted expectations. The TEC scale had good internal consistency (α = 0.876-0.869) and adequate discriminant validity as assessed by its low correlation with measures of depression, anxiety, and quality of life (r = -.038 to .114). The scale had however low correlation with a theoretically related measure of optimism (r = .240).  Conclusion: The TEC scale is a reliable scale measuring pain treatment expectation. Further evaluation of its psychometric properties is needed. The scale has the potential to deepen our understanding of the role treatment expectations play in chronic non-cancer pain treatment response. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Expectations play a role in pain perception and the response to pain treatment Patients' expectations about pain and its management are associated with treatment satisfaction The absence of a validated tool to measure treatment expectations in chronic non-cancer pain prevents further exploration and understanding of the role of expectations in the context of multidisciplinary pain treatment . What does this study add? A new, reliable 9-item scale measuring treatment expectations among chronic non-cancer pain patients attending specialized multidisciplinary pain clinics .

66	Caractérisation phénotypique et fonctionnelle des cellules NK en contexte physiologique et néoplasique	NK cells are part of the innate immune system and participate in anti-tumor immunosurveillance. Understanding the factors affecting their biology, such as genetics, is therefore crucial. First, we evaluated the role of the integrin subunit CD11d on the phenotype and expression of other subunits (CD11a, CD11b, CD11c, CD18) of various immune cells between a CD11d-KO mouse model and a C57BL/6 (B6) mouse. We noted that the effect of CD11d deletion on the expression of other integrin subunits is specific to each immune cell type. The most notable difference in CD11b and CD11c expression was observed in NK cells. Loss of CD11d in NK cells resulted in decreased CD107a expression after their activation, suggesting impaired NK cell degranulation. Second, despite similar melanoma growth, a greater proportion of CD11d-KO-derived NK cells accumulated in tumor beds compared to their B6 counterpart. We then exploited the NOD mouse model, known to have significant immune defects. The acquisition of cytotoxic functions of NK cells occurs through a process called functional maturation where an NK cell is first CD27-CD11b-, followed by the CD27+CD11b- stage, then CD27+CD11b+ and finally CD27-CD11b+, the most mature and cytotoxic stage. We demonstrated that NK cells from NOD mice produce significantly less IFN-γ, TNFα, and Granzyme B and fail to regulate the expression of the activation receptor NKG2D for each stage of functional maturation. Finally, we treated immunodeficient tumor-bearing mice with NOD and B6 NK cells. We demonstrated that, as with B6 NK cells, NOD CD27+ NK cells predominantly accumulated in tumors. However, mice injected with NOD NK cells showed significantly greater tumor growth.  Overall, these studies are the first to elucidate the impact of the absence of CD11d on the phenotype and function of NK cells as well as their functional defects in NOD mice during their functional maturation.	cellule Natural Killer , NK , CD11d , souris Non-Obese Diabetic , Natural Killer cell , integrin , CD11d , Non-Obese Diabetic mouse , functional maturation	en	25862.0
67	Quantified desistance : a scoping review of conventions in the scientific literature	This paper adopts a conventionalist approach to shed light on the measurement and reification problems that underlie the quantification of desistance from crime in the scientific literature. Analysis of 100 papers spanning three decades indicates that approaches based on theoretical classification have recently lost ground in favor of more sophisticated techniques aimed at empirically identifying subgroups. These techniques convey the impression of objectiveness among statistics users and consumers and, as a result, the classification “desisters” and “persisters” are increasingly reified. Findings suggest that the quantification of desistance is intimately linked to the maintenance of a classification system that constitutes delinquency as a stable category and contributes to “making” up new kinds of people over which institutions can legitimately intervene.

69	Trajectories and predictors of functional capacity decline in older adults from a Brazilian Northeastern hospital	Background and Purpose:  Older adults face increased risk of loss of functional capacity both before and during hospitalization, so identifying older adults at risk for loss in functional capacity during hospitalization would help researchers and clinicians make informed decisions. This study aims to evaluate functional changes from preadmission (baseline) until discharge of hospitalized older adults and identify predictors of loss in functional capacity.  Methods:  This is a prospective cohort study conducted at a tertiary care hospital in Natal, Brazil, and enrolled all consecutive patients aged 60 years and older between January 1, 2014, and April 30, 2015. Independent variables included personal characteristics, instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) (evaluated by the Lawton and Brody scale), cognition (evaluated by the Leganés cognitive test), depression (assessed by the Geriatric Depression Scale—15), and in-hospital mobility (evaluated by the Short Physical Performance Battery). The dependent variable functional capacity was assessed by the Katz scale. These instruments were applied at 2 different times: upon admission (within first 24 hours) and at discharge (12-24 hours before). Functional trajectories were defined as the course of functioning from preadmission until discharge using functional capacity data. A multivariate analysis with generalized estimating equation estimated the longitudinal changes in functional capacity.  Results and Discussion:  The final sample consisted of 1191 older adults and 53.9% were less than 70 years of age. Regarding changes in functional capacity, 52.5% of the older adults presented worse functional capacity at discharge than at baseline. Being dependent for IADL instrumental daily living activities, the presence of depressive symptoms, low levels of cognition, and in-hospital mobility were risk factors for greater loss in functional capacity during a hospitalization event.  Conclusion:  Hospitalization events may be catastrophic for functional capacity in older adults in Brazil. Functional, cognitive, and emotional status and in-hospital mobility must be carefully assessed at hospital admission and monitored during hospitalization. Effective strategies for preventing loss in functional capacity in older people must improve in the Brazilian hospital system.	Aged , Functioning , Hospitalization , Mobility limitation	en	25799.0
71	Risk factors associated with driving after cannabis use among Canadian young adults	This study identifid the most prominent risk factors associated with driving after cannabis use (DACU). 1,126 Canadian drivers (17–35 years old) who have used cannabis in the past 12 months completed an online questionnaire about sociodemographic information, substance use habits, cannabis effect expectancies, driving behaviours and peers’ behaviours and attitudes concerning DACU. A hierarchical logistic regression allowed identifying variables that were associated with DACU. Income (CA$30,000–CA$69,000), weekly-to-daily cannabis use, higher level of cannabis-related problems, expectation that cannabis facilitates social interactions, drunk driving, belief that DACU is safe, general risky driving behaviours, having a few friends who had DACU and injunctive norms predicted past 12-month DACU. Older age, holding negative expectations concerning cannabis, driving aggressively and perceived accessibility of public transportation decreased the probability of DACU. With restricted resources, programmes will be more efficient by targeting Canadian young adults most inclined to DACU by focussing on these risk factors.

72	A novel computerized assessment of manual spatial exploration in unilateral spatial neglect	Unilateral spatial neglect is a neuropsychological syndrome commonly observed after stroke and defined by the inability to attend or respond to contralesional stimuli. Typically, symptoms are assessed using clinical tests that rely upon visual/perceptual abilities. However, neglect may affect high-level representations controlling attention in other modalities as well. Here we developed a novel manual exploration test using a touch screen computer to quantify spatial search behaviour without visual input. Twelve chronic stroke patients with left neglect and 27 patients without neglect (based on clinical tests) completed our task. Four of the 12 “neglect” patients exhibited clear signs of neglect on our task as compared to “non-neglect” patients and healthy controls, and six other patients (from both groups) also demonstrated signs of neglect compared to healthy controls only. While some patients made asymmetrical responses on only one task, generally, patients with the strongest neglect performed poorly on multiple tasks. This suggests that representations associated with different modalities may be affected separately, but that severe forms of neglect are more likely related to damage in a common underlying representation. Our manual exploration task is easy to administer and can be added to standard neglect screenings to better measure symptom severity.

73	Implementation of a sexuality interview guide in stroke rehabilitation : a feasibility study	Background: Although people who sustain a stroke can experience sexual difficulties, few address them during rehabilitation. Objectives: Explore the feasibility of implementing a Sexuality Interview Guide (SIG) in stroke rehabilitation and describe the factors perceived as influencing its implementation. Materials and Methods: Using a mixed research design, the SIG was implemented for four months in a rehabilitation hospital. The frequency with which clinicians addressed sexuality and their level of comfort pre-post implementation was measured. Perceived factors influencing implementation were determined through individual interviews and focus groups with five stroke clients, 15 clinicians and a coordinator. A paired-specimen Wilcoxon test was used to explore differences in pre- post-level of comfort. Qualitative data was analyzed by two independent evaluators using thematic analysis. Results: The SIG was used 28 times and clinicians' level of comfort in addressing sexuality improved significantly (p = 0.001). The factors perceived as influencing implementation were: the acceptability of the SIG, the individual characteristics, the context of the rehabilitation hospital and the implementation process. Conclusion: This study showed that the SIG can be used in stroke rehabilitation and that, with sufficient financial and human resources, and training for clinicians, it would be feasible to implement it in usual care.

74	Training persons with early-stage Alzheimer’s disease how to use an electronic medication management device : development of an intervention protocol	Background/Objectives: Medication management is challenging for persons with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and their caregivers. Electronic medication management devices (eMMDs) are specifically designed to support this task. However, theory-driven interventions for eMMD training with this population are rarely described. This study aimed to develop and assess the appropriateness of an intervention protocol to train persons with early-stage AD how to use an eMMD.  Methods: Interviews with three categories of participants [persons with early-stage AD (n = 3), caregivers (n = 3), and clinicians (n = 3)] were conducted to understand medication management needs, perceived usefulness of an eMMD, and to explore training strategies. Subsequently, this knowledge was integrated in an intervention protocol which was validated with the three clinicians. A content analysis led to iterative modifications to maximize the acceptability and coherence of the intervention protocol in a homecare context.  Results: The final intervention protocol specifies the expertise required to provide the training intervention and the target population, followed by an extensive presentation of eMMD features. Specific learning strategies tailored to the cognitive profile of persons with AD with step-by-step instructions for clinicians are included. Finally, it presents theoretical information on cognitive impairment in AD and how eMMDs can support them.  Conclusions: This intervention protocol with its theoretical and pragmatic foundation is an important starting point to enable persons with early-stage AD to become active users of eMMDs. Next steps should evaluate the immediate and long-term impacts of its implementation on medication management in the daily lives of persons with AD and their caregivers.

75	Pathological implications of the interaction between neurexins and alpha-synuclein in synucleinopathies	Parkinson’s disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) are the second and the third most common neurodegenerative disorders and are part of a class of diseases called synucleinopathies. Synucleinopathies are associated with an α-synuclein (α-syn) pathology which shows an accumulation of α-syn in neurons, forming Lewy bodies. This pathological α-syn can form oligomers and fibrils, which are toxic for neurons and their synapses. One of the first changes to occur in patients’ brain with synucleinopathies is synaptic dysfunction often combined with synapse loss. Synaptic α-syn oligomers were revealed to precede the formation of Lewy bodies, and their transmission to other neurons to correlate with the progression of the symptoms. Yet, the molecular mechanisms underlying how α-syn leads to synaptic dysfunction are unknown. Synaptic function is highly regulated by a protein family called synaptic organizers. Synaptic organizers are cell adhesion molecules that regulate synaptogenesis, plasticity, neurotransmitter release, synaptic plasticity and cognitive functions. Of this family, we have found that α-syn interacts with the β-isoforms of the neurexins (NRXs) family members (β-NRXs). My project aimed to characterize α-syn/β-NRX interaction and to evaluate how this interaction contributes to α-syn pathology. We hypothesized that this interaction affects NRX trafficking and its synaptic function. Firstly, to test our hypothesis, the α-syn/β-NRX interaction was characterized by performing cell surface binding assays. I found that α-syn oligomers strongly bind to NRX1,2β in a histidine rich domain (HRD)-dependent manner, without disrupting NRX binding to its postsynaptic binding partners, neuroligin 1 (NLG1) and leucine rich repeat transmembrane neuronal 2 (LRRTM2). Moreover, using internalization assays, we discovered that α-syn oligomers impair NRX trafficking by increasing NRX1β internalization in an HRD-dependent manner and impair NRX-dependent inhibitory presynaptic differentiation. Thereby, we suggest that this increased internalization affects the inhibitory synaptogenic function of NRX-based synaptic organizing complexes. This work contributes to a better understanding of how α-syn causes synaptic dysfunction, providing promising new molecular mechanisms and pharmacological insights into synucleinopathies.

76	Le rôle de la tomographie par cohérence optique dans la chirurgie endocrinienne cervico-faciale	Background. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a non-invasive imaging modality that renders real-time tissue images with resolution in the order of micrometers, allowing to unveil their microarchitecture. Given its properties, there is growing interest in determining the potential applications of OCT in thyroid and parathyroid surgery. Methodology. Thirty-six patients undergoing thyroidectomy, parathyroidectomy and/or neck dissection for well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma (WDTC) were prospectively recruited in a single tertiary center. Freshly excised specimens of healthy and pathologic thyroid, parathyroid glands, lymph nodes and adipose tissues were imaged with OCT prior to histopathological analysis. Images were reviewed by two blinded independent raters, and a multidisciplinary team. Results. Based on 137 surgical specimens, OCT could not consistently differentiate benign from malignant thyroid nodules, and parathyroid adenomas from normal lymph nodes. For healthy tissues, OCT could differentiate each tissue type with high sensitivity and specificity 100% and 99% for thyroid tissue, 93% and 100% for parathyroid glands, 100% and 99% for adipose tissue, and 98% and 99% for lymph nodes. Cohen’s kappa coefficients for intra- and inter-rater agreement were 0.968 and 0.951. OCT could also differentiate benign from malignant lymph nodes in WDTC with sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of 85.1%, 89.5%, 80.8%, and 92.2%. Cohen’s kappa coefficients for intra- and inter-rater reliability were 0.836, and 0.792. Conclusion. Evidence suggests that OCT could serve as an adjunct tool to identify parathyroid glands during thyroidectomy and differentiate benign from metastatic lymph nodes in WDTC.	thyroid , parathyroid , imaging , optical coherence tomography , tissue biopsy	en	25675.0
77	The effects of celastrol on endothelial cells survival and proliferation	Introduction: Coronary artery bypass grafts are most commonly performed using saphenous vein grafts to complement the internal thoracic artery. The saphenous vein will remain popular despite its lower patency rate because it is easily accessible and lengthy enough to perform multiple bypasses. Therefore, several approaches have been studied, with the common goal of finding the optimal conditions that reduce graft failure. They include novel harvest techniques, new preservation preparations, innovative genetic therapies and experimental drugs. We believe a pharmacological pre-conditioning with an anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory drug during the crucial time of harvest may spark beneficial survival response from the endothelial cells. One particular compound is Celastrol, an HSP90 inhibitor, which displays those antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Methods: Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were pretreated with various concentrations of Celastrol (10-10M, 10-8M and 10-6M). In order to reproduce oxidative stress found in ischemia/reperfusion, cells were exposed to hydrogen peroxide for a short and extended period (1h and 24h). To mimic storage condition encountered in clinical settings, cells were also exposed in heparinized normal saline. The viability was assessed by LIVE/DEAD assay. As for migrative and proliferative properties, scratch tests were performed. Finally, various protective intracellular pathways were evaluated by Western blot. Results: This study shows that pre-treatment with Celastrol promotes survival in HUVEC submitted to oxidative stress. Notable improvement in cellular viability was detected as early as 1 hour after oxidative stress (H2O2 4 mM), 76.6% vs 66.1% (p=0.005). Significant survival benefits are also reported after prolonged oxidative stress (H2O2 0.5 mM for 24 hours); viability was 93.7% vs 76.9% (p=0.001) for Cel 10- 8 M and 96.6% vs 76.9% (p=0.002) for Celastrol 10-10M when compared to the vehicle. Celastrol, however, did not significantly affect viability of HUVEC stored in heparinized normal saline.  Celastrol at 10-6 M promotes faster and more complete wound closure compared to the vehicle or to lower dosages. Celastrol triggers early activation of the RISK pathway, inducing activation of both Akt and ERK1/2 within the first 15 minutes of treatment. Celastrol also induces the expression of HSP70 and HO-1, effectors of the Heat Shock Response and the anti-oxidative response respectively.  Conclusion: Pre-treatment by Celastrol provides survival benefits in endothelial cells under oxidative stress. It also stimulates endothelial cell proliferation and migration, promoting faster and more complete re-endothelialisation. Celastrol can potentially be used as an additive to storage solutions to limit endothelial injury and promote graft protection.

78	Signification des plis palmaires orangés dans l’évaluation des dyslipidémies	After a brief review of cardiovascular risk factors and lipid metabolism, classification of dyslipidemias, the pathophysiology of xanthomas as well as dysbetalipoproteinemia will be discussed.  This dyslipidemia which is characterized by the accumulation of remnants particules, generally secondary to an abnormal apolipoprotein E, is highly atherogenic, both at the peripheral vascular and coronary levels.  The striated palmar xanthomas, defined as a yellow to orange (sometimes brownish) coloration of the palmar and digital folds, are considered pathognomonic of this formerly called type III dyslipidemia. By studying an adult Caucasian population from the Saguenay–Lac Saint-Jean region, we were able to demonstrate a prevalence of 18.8% of orange palmar folds in patients with dysbetalipoproteinemia. Also, this study allowed to shed light on the absence of criteria for dysbetalipoproteinemia in 10.7% of subjects with this type of xanthoma.  These data suggest that the expression of striated palmar xanthomas is associated with the presence of a sustained or recurrent accumulation of remnants. The accumulation of these remnants is possible in a broad spectrum of lipid disorders where there is interference in the hydrolysis or clearance of the remnants, including postprandial dyslipidemia, chylomicronemia, partial lipoprotein lipase deficiency and familial hypercholesterolemia mainly in homozygotes. Clinical research of striated palmar xanthomas could provide additional information in the evaluation of cardiovascular risk as a marker of an accumulation of remnants which, for their part, have been shown to confer an increased cardiovascular risk, both in primary prevention and secondary.

79	Caractérisation in silico et purification des ligases à ARN de type RtcB de Diplonema papillatum	Ribonucleic acids (RNA) undergo several post-transcriptional modifications before fulfilling their role in the cell. One of the actors responsible for these modifications are RNA ligases. There are two main families of RNA ligases, namely “ATP-grasp” and “RtcB-like”. Despite the fact that these enzymes have similar biological roles in the cell, their molecular mechanisms are very different. Our team has discovered in a marine eukaryote the presence of three genes encoding RtcB RNA ligase homologs. This is unusual considering that eukaryotes generally have only one gene encoding for an homolog of this ligase. Diplonema papillatum, the organism in question, is a eukaryote that has grown in popularity in recent years due to the particular mode of expression of its mitochondrial genetic material. Its genome is fragmented into several pieces called modules which, during the RNA maturation process, these modules undergo ligation via trans-splicing. We posit that one of the RtcB-type ligases present in D. papillatum, more specifically DpRTCB1, is a major player in this trans-splicing phenomenon. We also believe that the other two RtcB ligases present in this organism, DpRTCB2 and DpRTCB3, each have its own role in the cell. We therefore established in silico models for these proteins which could hint at the cofactors required by these three enzymes. We also propose a classification system for RtcB-type ligases according to their biological roles and variations in known active site residues. We attempted to purify DpRTCB fusion proteins for future enzymatic assays in order to get a better understanding in the biological role of these enzymes. These proteins, however, formed inclusion bodies making their purification difficult. Thus, we demonstrate various techniques that currently exist to attempt to purify proteins from insoluble aggregates. This Master’s thesis attempts to predict the potential cofactors and substrates necessary for future biochemical assays of DpRTCB enzymes. We also establish a robust foundation for a classification system of RtcB-type ligases. Among other things, this document provides basic solutions to researchers wishing to purify proteins that form inclusion bodies before considering switching to more laborious and expensive purification methods.

80	Role of GSK-3 and T-bet in anti-tumor immunity	The transcription factor T-bet plays a central role in regulating T-cell differentiation, while the protein tyrosine kinase, glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) inhibits T-cell activation and controls                           the expression of inhibitory receptors PD-1 and LAG-3 on T-cells. Although GSK-3 inhibition can increase T-bet expression, the inter-relationship between T-bet and GSK-3 in tumor immunity is unknown. In this study, we show that T-bet knock-out (Tbet-/-) mice are compromised in their ability to control the growth of the B16 melanoma tumor cells. However, the injection of a small              molecule inhibitor (SMI) of GSK-3 reverses this compromised condition resulting in the control of tumor growth similar to that seen in wild type mice. An examination of Tbet-/- showed a loss of                  dendritic cells (DC) and potentially suppressive polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMN) and CD4+ cell tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) accompanied by an increase in CD8+ cells. viSNE   analysis (advanced tSNE- t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) further showed a reduction of antigen experienced effector marker CD44 in CD8+ TILs in           Tbet-/-. GSK-3 inhibition showed no effect on the loss of DCs, CD4+ TILs or the presence of PMNs or CD8+ T-cells or the loss of Granzyme B (GZMB) on CD8+ cells. The one exception was a minor but statistically significant increase in the transcription factor Eomesodermin (Eomes) in CD8+ TILs. The study demonstrates an unexpected compensatory effect of GSK-3 inhibition on the loss of T-bet. The full nature of the pathway that accounts for this compensation remains to be elucidated.

81	Vingt ans après l'arrêt Harper: l'évolution constitutionnelle du plafonnement des dépenses électorales des tierces parties	This work seeks to determine whether the reasoning of the Supreme Court majority in Harper v. Canada (Attorney General), which validates third parties’ spending limits during the election period,still avails almost two decades after being rendered. The limits on third parties' spending as established by the Canada Election Act are examined in detail. The majority’s reasons are also discussed at length. Then, the core analysis begins. Three new social phenomena are examined to determine whether the Court’s reasoning in Harper should be called into question. These phenomena are: the advent of a “permanent campaign” in Canada, the rise of new information technologies and the decline of political parties. It is concluded that Harper’s logic remains highly compelling, though it may entail some modifications to the current electoral law, such as the abolition of pre-electoral spending limits and the application of some form of limitation to electoral spending regarding personal web sites and social media account.

82	La rivalité entre les croyants d'Allah : l'Iran et l'Arabie saoudite	This research is to address the strained relationship and interactions of different levels between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Indeed, the study questions the causes of this rigid bond since the Shiite Mullahs came to power in Iran in 1979, and the different perspectives of Islam being implemented by the two theocratic states. These two regional and major powers in the Arab-Muslim world are each trying in their own way to propagate their ideology in the Islamic world and even beyond.   However, the arrival of Mohamed bin Salman in Saudi Arabia whose political rise as crown prince has led to all-out offensives against Iran, but also against certain allies. Ultimately, under the current circumstances, it is difficult to reach an understanding between the two countries. Confidence is lacking and the different interpretation of religion complicates the relationship between Imamate Iran and Wahhabi Saudi Arabia.

83	Évaluation des facteurs de modulation de l’exposition du consommateur de poissons et de mammifères marins au méthylmercure : utilisation d’approches in vitro, in vivo et probabiliste	Fish flesh and marine mammals is an important source of proteins and nutrients, such as selenium (Se), vitamin E and long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. However, flesh of those animals may bioaccumulate the organic form of mercury (Hg), methylmercury (MeHg). This contaminant has been the subject of various epidemiological studies, namely because of its neurotoxicity through in utero exposure, closely related to highly MeHg contaminated fish consumption. In response to this toxicological risk, health authorities have set fish consumption guidelines in order to protect the population. Still, those guidelines present limits that are related to premises and omissions of the determinist equation used by Health Canada in order to assess the exposure to MeHg: (1) it considers that 100% of Hg in fish flesh is MeHg, (2) it supposes that MeHg is homogeneously distributed within fish flesh, (3) it takes for granted that 100% of MeHg will be absorbed by the consumer and (4) by using a determinist approach, they omit the potential uncertainty and intra-population variability in the data. The aim of this thesis was to address these limits, in order to better understand the exposure of MeHg for consumers. We first assessed the distribution of MeHg, Se (MeHg antagonist) and arsenic (As, Se antagonist) within fish musculature, as a function of its biomolecule composition (proteins and lipids). Our results demonstrated that the concomitant presence of white and red muscle induces a large gradient of protein and lipid within the muscular apparatus of the same individual. This in turn causes on average a variation by 2.2-fold regarding MeHg, Se and As bioaccumulation, which are distributed according to their biochemical affinity. Those results confirmed that MeHg can distribute heterogeneously within fish muscle, which could lead to an under- or overestimation of MeHg exposure for consumers, as function of the part of the fish consumed. Subsequently, we focused on the hypothesis stipulating that 100% of MeHg is absorbed by the consumer. A method used to assess the fraction of MeHg that would be available to be further absorbed by the gut wall consists of measuring the bioaccessibility, i.e. the soluble fraction of MeHg, using an in vitro digestion model. Several studies that assessed the bioaccessibility of cooked fish flesh observed a decreased of MeHg solubility, that would potentially diminish its intestinal absorption. However, those results have not been yet validated in vivo. To that end, we conducted an in vivo experience using the pig model and, in parallel, we used an in vitro digestion model. According to the pig’s blood profile, the oral bioavailability of MeHg from cooked tuna flesh is not less bioavailable than the MeHg from the raw tuna. Contrasting results have been found with the in vitro model, with a decrease of MeHg bioaccessibility observed when fish flesh is cooked. Our results demonstrated that in vitro digestion models are not optimized to be directly used in MeHg exposure calculus as recently proposed in the literature. Finally, we tested the impact of adding variables to the deterministic equation currently used by Health Canada to assess consumer exposure to MeHg, by conducting a probabilistic risk assessment. We considered (1) the proportion of Hg that is MeHg, (2) the MeHg bioaccessibility and (3) the increased of MeHg level after the cooking of fish flesh due to moisture loss. Our results showed that each individual variable significantly increases or decreases the calculated exposure. Thereby, it highlights the sensitivity of the equation used to assess the exposure of MeHg. It strongly suggests that more research is needed to improve Hg exposure calculation to avoid underestimating the potential health risks of MeHg exposure. This thesis presents important results regarding the exposure of MeHg through fish and marine mammals’ consumption. This thesis shows that the recommendations are difficult to generalize since the flesh of fish and mammals has different properties, depending on the animal species considered. The conclusions of this thesis demonstrate that the premises and omissions of the deterministic equation used by Health Canada in the assessment of exposure to Hg should be better investigated by the scientific sphere, especially in the case of marine mammals.	arsenic , Methylmercury , Fish , Muscle type , Bioaccessibility , Oral bioavailability , Probabilistic risk assessment , Country food	en	25608.0
84	L’analyse appliquée du comportement en autisme et ses enjeux : une évaluation du potentiel de la technologie pour améliorer la pratique et la recherche	Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by significant deficits in social communication and social interactions and by the presence of restricted and repetitive behaviors or interests. Empirical evidence suggests that interventions based on applied behavior analysis (ABA) are the most effective for treating individuals with ASD. Nevertheless, interventions based on behavior analysis present some issues. In particular, intervention services are hard to access, knowledge about the underlying factors of the effectiveness of interventions is lacking and divergent perceptions about of ABA hamper the adoption of the science. This dissertation includes three studies in which technology is used to better understand or improve these issues regarding ABA. As part of my first study, the effects of a fully self-guided interactive web training (IWT) developed for teaching parents of children with ASD ABA-derived strategies to reduce their child's challenging behaviors were evaluated using a randomized waitlist trial. The results of this study support the effectiveness of the IWT for increasing the frequency of parents’ use of behavioral interventions as well as for reducing the frequency and severity of their child’s challenging behaviors. In contrast, no significant difference was observed for the measurement of parenting practices. Ethical and practical consideration regarding the dissemination of fully self-guided online trainings are discussed. The second study of my doctoral thesis aimed to show how to use machine learning algorithms to predict individuals who were most likely to improve following an intervention. Specifically, a demonstration of how to implement four machine learning algorithms to predict the participants from my first study who were the most likely to report a decrease in their child's iv challenging behaviors. This study argues that machine learning algorithms can be used with small samples to support clinicians’ and researchers’ decision making. The third study of my dissertation aimed to quantify the information about ABA published on four subforums of an internet forum; an online resource often used by families to identify potential interventions for their child. This goal was achieved through the use of a data mining procedure. The analyses showed that parents who visited the forum were exposed to a significant proportion of messages that disapproved of ABA for individuals with ASD or that inaccurately described its underlying principles, methods, procedures, or interventions. Together, the studies carried out as part of my doctoral dissertation highlight the benefits of technology to support assessments, interventions, and knowledge gains or transfer within psychosocial practices. As highlighted in the three studies of this dissertation, each of the tools used presents limitations and should therefore be used to support clinicians and researchers, and should not replace their interventions and clinical judgment. Future studies should continue to focus on the effectiveness of technological tools and on the underlying factors that will promote their use. Finally, researchers must reflect on the ethical considerations related to use of technology when working with humans.

85	Exploration du rôle de signalisation des Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases lors de la fécondation chez les plantes	Reproduction is a crucial event for plant life. This process requires the formation of pollen and ovules. The germ cells will undergo meiosis and then a succession of mitosis, two for the pollen and three for the ovule, which will allow them to acquire their final structures. Once formed, these two gametes must meet each other. For this, the pollen grain will germinate on the stigmas to form the pollen tube. The growth of the pollen tube will pass through the different female tissues and thus pull the two sperm cells to the ovum for reproduction. An important cellular signaling network is necessary to allow these events to occur. The Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPKs) cascades are one of the most studied signaling networks in plants. These kinases are involved in a wide range of developmental processes such as embryo formation and stomata. However, their roles remain poorly characterized during fertilization. The aim of this project is to better understand the role played by MAPKs during the formation of male and female gametes as well as during the growth of pollen tubes. Several members of the MAPK superfamily have been characterized for their role in the sexual reproduction of plants. Previous work in Daniel P. Matton's laboratory has demonstrated the involvement of two MAPK Kinases (MAP3K), Solanum chacoense Fertilization-Related Kinase 1 (ScFRK1) and ScFRK2. These two kinases are necessary for egg and pollen development in S. chacoense, a diploid wild potato species. In a first step, we studied the functionality of a new ScFRK, ScFRK3. This third member of the class of FRKs in S. chacoense, is also involved in the development of male and female gametophytes. From the expression pattern to the establishment of a potential signaling pathway, through the phenotypic characterization of mutants, several experiments have been performed in order to understand the role of ScFRK3 in the formation of gametes in S. chacoense. We show that ScFRK3 is involved in the formation of pollen as well as that of the embryonic sac. We then continued our research by refining the phenotyping of the overexpression mutant ScFRK2. Indeed, previous studies have shown that ScFRK2 overexpression leads the ovular primordium to the formation of carpeloid structures. However, the sets of ovular primordia have not become capeloid structures. We show here that only 10% of the eggs in the ovary have become carpeloid. Our study shows that in addition to the carpeloid structures, a large number of ova do not have an embryonic sac in the anthesis, which explains the low number of seeds per fruit. The analysis of the development of the embryonic sacs shows that 7 overexpression of ScFRK2 leads to the cessation of the functional megaspore stage. This phenotype is similar to what has been observed in interfering RNA lines reducing expression of ScFRK1 and ScFRK3. Previous studies in Arabidopsis thaliana suggest that members of the MAPK superfamily are not essential for pollen tube growth. To understand the role that MAPKs play in pollen tube elongation, we used a MAP Kinase Kinase (MKK) inhibitor called U0126. The presence of this drug in the growth medium of pollen grains causes a decrease in germination and elongation of the pollen tube. The use of the semi in vivo method shows a loss of polarization of the pollen tube growth caused by the inhibition of MKK. The presence of the inhibitor leads to a decrease in the number of actin filaments and their disorganization at the apex of the tube. Exocytosis is also affected by MKK inhibition. We show in this chapter that MAPK cascades are necessary for polarized pollen tube growth in Arabidopsis thaliana. Finally, we wanted to identify some members of the MAPK superfamily involved in pollen tube growth. We were first interested in the ScFRK family orthologs in Arabidopsis thaliana. AtMAP3K19-20-21 are the closest orthologs to ScFRK3. These AtMAP3K are expressed during the development of pollen grains and during the elongation of the pollen tube. Pollen analysis of the different mutant lines shows that in their absence the pollen does not present any development problems unlike ScFRK3. On the other hand, double mutants and triple mutant for AtMAP3K19-20-21 show a decrease in germination capacity. Pollen tube elongation is affected when at least one of the AtMAP3Ks is mutated. These two studies demonstrate that MAPKs are essential for the formation and elongation of the pollen tube and that AtMAP3K19-20-21 participate in these biological processes.

The crimes against humanity in Guinea had direct and indirect impacts on the lives of the victims, their families, and their loved ones. They have left thousands of dead, they resulted in the exile of countless individuals and the rape and abuse of hundreds of women (Human Rights Watch, 2011).  While some efforts have been made to address this violence, victims nevertheless persist in their demand for justice. This raises many questions: what is justice for the victims of crimes against humanity in Guinea? How do victims come to the sense of justice? In this paper, we explore the perceptions of justice of 31 victims of crimes against humanity in Guinea. More specifically, we use justice as a theoretical framework to examine perceptions and experiences of victims in relation to justice in order to promote reconciliation and lasting peace. The results indicate that justice has several dimensions, namely distributive justice, procedural justice and interactional justice. Although distributive justice (punishment and reparation) comes more quickly in victims’ discourse, procedural justice (neutrality of authorities, constancy, etc.) and interactional justice (respect, information, etc.) are equally important in the eyes of the victims. There are several similarities between the two groups of victims (1958–1984 and 2009) as regards the violence committed, their consequences, and the definition of justice. However, there are differences as well, particularly regarding the types of violence, the duration of the crimes, the method used to commit the crimes, the interchangeability of victim-offender roles, the duration of the consequences of crimes and the importance of the elements included in the definition of justice. Some elements included in the definition of justice would be more important than others for each group of victims given the time that has passed since the commission of crimes, the death of most perpetrators, and the interchangeability of victims perpetrators’ roles. That said, justice as a whole is a condition for reconciliation. However, the lack of justice experienced by the victims calls into question reconciliation in Guinea.

87	La mémoire d’un territoire : projet d’archéologie publique de camps forestiers du XXe siècle au Témiscouata, Québec	This study explores 20th century lumber camps through a public archaeology project in Témiscouata, Québec. Using archaeological, historical and oral sources, this research examines the material and structural conditions shaping lumberjacks’ lives. Two lumber camp sites of the 1940s located at Lake-Témiscouata national Park were examined archaeologically. The sites revealed an industrialized and homogenous artifact assemblage generally selected by the lumber company. Despite the controlled material world of the industrial frontier, it is possible to shed light on individual workers’ behaviour and consumption habits. Material culture analysis shows that workers used a variety of strategies to navigate their corporate environment and maintain a certain form of control over their lives, such as the consumption of alcohol and patent medicine. Today, how can we translate the material past of lumberjacks’ daily lives for present communities? Residents of Témiscouata maintain a strong historical connection and identity towards the lumber industry, and so public archaeology offers a compelling approach to conduct a more inclusive and relevant research for the local community. This study explores the role archaeology plays in the revitalization of memory surrounding lumber camps, while addressing how communities can contribute to the documentation of their past. We used numerous participative strategies such as a public excavation activity, an interactive public workshop and interviews with the elders who worked in the former lumber camps. An analytical framework enabled the categorization of participants’ comments generated during these activities. This analysis brings greater understanding to the nature of the community's contribution to research. Drawing on the mnemonic quality of material remains, this study shows that public archaeology can act as a “memory trigger” to encourage the sharing of local knowledge and personal stories.

88	A Multi-Modal, Modified-Feedback and Self-Paced Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) to Control an Embodied Avatar's Gait	Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) have been used to control the gait of a virtual self-avatar with the aim of being used in gait rehabilitation. A BCI decodes the brain signals representing a desire to do something and transforms them into a control command for controlling external devices. The feelings described by the participants when they control a self-avatar in an immersive virtual environment (VE) demonstrate that humans can be embodied in the surrogate body of an avatar (ownership illusion). It has recently been shown that inducing the ownership illusion and then manipulating the movements of one’s self-avatar can lead to compensatory motor control strategies. In order to maximize this effect, there is a need for a method that measures and monitors embodiment levels of participants immersed in virtual reality (VR) to induce and maintain a strong ownership illusion. This is particularly true given that reaching a high level of both BCI performance and embodiment are inter-connected. To reach one of them, the second must be reached as well. Some limitations of many existing systems hinder their adoption for neurorehabilitation: 1- some use motor imagery (MI) of movements other than gait; 2- most systems allow the user to take single steps or to walk but do not allow both, which prevents users from progressing from steps to gait; 3- most of them function in a single BCI mode (cue-paced or self-paced), which prevents users from progressing from machine-dependent to machine-independent walking. Overcoming the aforementioned limitations can be done by combining different control modes and options in one single system. However, this would have a negative impact on BCI performance, therefore diminishing its usefulness as a potential rehabilitation tool. In this case, there will be a need to enhance BCI performance. For such purpose, many techniques have been used in the literature, such as providing modified feedback (whereby the presented feedback is not consistent with the user’s MI), sequential training (recalibrating the classifier as more data becomes available). This thesis was developed over 3 studies. The objective in study 1 was to investigate the possibility of measuring the level of embodiment of an immersive self-avatar, during the performing, observing and imagining of gait, using electroencephalogram (EEG) techniques, by presenting visual feedback that conflicts with the desired movement of embodied participants. The objective of study 2 was to develop and validate a BCI to control single steps and forward walking of an immersive virtual reality (VR) self-avatar, using mental imagery of these actions, in cue-paced and self-paced modes. Different performance enhancement strategies were implemented to increase BCI performance. The data of these two studies were then used in study 3 to construct a generic classifier that could eliminate offline calibration for future users and shorten training time. Twenty different healthy participants took part in studies 1 and 2. In study 1, participants wore an EEG cap and motion capture markers, with an avatar displayed in a head-mounted display (HMD) from a first-person perspective (1PP). They were cued to either perform, watch or imagine a single step forward or to initiate walking on a treadmill. For some of the trials, the avatar took a step with the contralateral limb or stopped walking before the participant stopped (modified feedback). In study 2, participants completed a 4-day sequential training to control the gait of an avatar in both BCI modes. In cue-paced mode, they were cued to imagine a single step forward, using their right or left foot, or to walk forward. In the self-paced mode, they were instructed to reach a target using the MI of multiple steps (switch control mode) or maintaining the MI of forward walking (continuous control mode). The avatar moved as a response to two calibrated regularized linear discriminant analysis (RLDA) classifiers that used the μ power spectral density (PSD) over the foot area of the motor cortex as features. The classifiers were retrained after every session. During the training, and for some of the trials, positive modified feedback was presented to half of the participants, where the avatar moved correctly regardless of the participant’s real performance. In both studies, the participants’ subjective experience was analyzed using a questionnaire. Results of study 1 show that subjective levels of embodiment correlate strongly with the power differences of the event-related synchronization (ERS) within the μ frequency band, and over the motor and pre-motor cortices between the modified and regular feedback trials. Results of study 2 show that all participants were able to operate the cued-paced BCI and the selfpaced BCI in both modes. For the cue-paced BCI, the average offline performance (classification rate) on day 1 was 67±6.1% and 86±6.1% on day 3, showing that the recalibration of the classifiers enhanced the offline performance of the BCI (p < 0.01). The average online performance was 85.9±8.4% for the modified feedback group (77-97%) versus 75% for the non-modified feedback group. For self-paced BCI, the average performance was 83% at switch control and 92% at continuous control mode, with a maximum of 12 seconds of control. Modified feedback enhanced BCI performances (p =0.001). Finally, results of study 3 show that the constructed generic models performed as well as models obtained from participant-specific offline data. The results show that there it is possible to design a participant-independent zero-training BCI.

89	Évaluation de la fidélité des interventions en santé publique dans le cadre des essais randomisés en grappes dans les pays du Sud : revue systématique et étude de cas	Evidence-based public health should be based on the best available evidence to make informed decisions and to implement interventions aimed at maintaining and improving the health and well-being of all people. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are often used in clinical research to test the effects of a drug, therapy, or intervention on an experimental group that may benefit from the intervention, comparing it to a control group that received either a placebo or no intervention treatment. Although the debate persists, randomized controlled trials are an important and objectively high quality method for evaluating the effectiveness of health interventions. Due to multiple factors, cluster randomized trials (CRTs) are widely used to assess the delivery of health services and public health interventions. In this type of trial, it is no longer individuals who are randomized, but groups of individuals such as families, doctors, and village communities who receive the intervention. These interventions may differ during implementation as a result of various factors related to the complexity of the intervention design, context, participants, and stakeholders involved. These factors should be considered at the time of assessment and before replication in other contexts. Implementation fidelity assessment, a key tool in process evaluation, examines study processes to assess the extent to which the intervention was carried out as originally intended. The fidelity of implementation is an essential part of the scale-up process.  This thesis aimed to examine the fidelity of implementation of public health interventions in the context of cluster randomized trials, to determine whether the interventions implemented under a controlled model should consider this type of evaluation to strengthen their results and facilitate their replication on a large scale. This thesis has two parts: a systematic review and a single case study with three units of analysis using a mixed triangulated approach. The first article assessed the implementation fidelity of public health interventions in the context of cluster randomized trials. The systematic review highlighted the finding that public health interventions implemented under this model did not systematically consider this type of evaluation, that the way of doing it was very heterogeneous, and that the evaluation was not adequately documented. The second and third articles were the research findings of the evaluation of an intervention, using a case study as the research method, that was conducted to first examine the plausibility of the intervention theory and to better understand the design and context of the intervention being evaluated, and second, to evaluate implementation fidelity and its acceptability among the participants with the aim of making improvements (if necessary) before large-scale replication. The evaluation of the case study highlighted several key findings. First, the results of the evaluation reflected that the underlying theory and model of the public health intervention were well designed to achieve the desired results. The evaluation provided key points and actions to consider during intervention development to serve hard-to-reach communities and improve health outcomes. Further, it was shown that the results demonstrated a high degree of implementation fidelity. The clarity of the theory of the intervention, the motivation and commitment of the stakeholders as well as the periodic meetings of supervisors with the field team largely explained the high level of fidelity obtained. Contextual factors such as geographical distance to the intervention, access to a mobile phone, level of education, and gender norms contributed to the heterogeneity of the participation of the intervention target group. Finally, this evaluation underlined the finding that the mobile platform coupled with community mobilization, both key components of the intervention, were well received by the participants and may be an effective means of improving health knowledge and changing health-related behaviors.  This thesis contributes to the development of methodological knowledge concerning the evaluation of the fidelity of implementation of public health interventions by identifying gaps in this field, and by suggesting a tool that facilitates advancing this evaluation practice. This thesis also contributes to the strengthening of research in implementation sciences, and empirically provides key elements essential to assess the fidelity of the implementation of this type of intervention using CRT studies and evaluation of this fidelity, which is the subject of this doctoral research.

90	La prise de décision stratégique en contexte hospitalier pluraliste	The Lebanese health system is experiencing a chaotic evolution of its health sector, in a world of increasing competition. In addition, in the organization of this system, various groups of actors evolve and influence directly or indirectly the strategic decision-making of the Lebanese healthcare establishments. In a context in which evolves a plurality of actors who are interdependent and pursue divergent objectives, strategic decision-making seems a major challenge. Therefore, the present study aims to understand and analyze the dynamic processes of decisionmakers having an influence on strategic decision-making in a healthcare organization, in a pluralistic context, where various external and internal forces exert an influence on this strategic decision-making. To achieve this, strategic decision-making is analyzed from a power relation’s perspective, starting with the players in the health organization and the context in which they operate. This research proposes a conceptual model based on the general concepts of strategic analysis of Crozier and Friedberg (1977) combined with the garbage can model. The proposed elements of this conceptual framework are relevant for explaining the interaction between the freedom of actors and the power relations that emerge from it, the fortuitous presence of the currents leading to decision-making and the environment in which the actors are immersed which have a major influence on the development of strategic decision-making in a pluralistic healthcare establishment. To meet the objective of this research, we started with a literature review on strategic decisionmaking in a pluralistic context. Then, we used a qualitative approach based on semi-structured interviews and documentary analysis, within two Lebanese hospitals that are representative of the Lebanese hospital basin. This case study made it possible to trace 4 decisions from which the strategic behaviors mobilized by the actors were highlighted. To cite only a few listed strategies, we take the example of strategies of adapting to the environment, involving external actors as well as collaboration and negotiation that take into consideration the turbulent environment in which these establishments are surrounded. The results of this thesis show how the strategies developed by internal and external actors led to the formation of a broad constellation of leadership. This constellation is composed of multiple strategic actors who are in constant interaction, thus influencing the decision-making process through their power relations and strategic plays. Also, the results of this thesis highlight the 7 political decision-making process that takes place in a pluralistic health care organistion, leading to a better understanding of the strategic decision-making process in these establishments. In conclusion, concrete recommendations are made for decision-makers, to better manage health care organisations. In addition, the theoretical encounter developed for the first time in this thesis, makes an interesting contribution to the theories of organizations. Ultimately, the thesis opens the way to promising lines of reflection on strategic decision-making, in a pluralistic context.	health care institutions , decision-making process , pluralism , strategic actors , power relations , Garbage Can Model , window of opportunity	en	25527.0
91	Toward more sustainable behavior : an investigation into the mobility responses to an involuntary workplace relocation of 10,000 employees in Montreal, Canada	Despite traffic congestion, air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, as well as the connection to road crashes and physical inactivity, the car remains the prevalent mode of transport in North America. This over-reliance on cars relative to public and active transport modes is even more evident during peak hours. However, evidence suggests that the habit of car use is likely to be disrupted in important life-changing situations such as the birth of a child, or the relocation of a workplace. In such circumstances, attentiveness to alternative solutions and transport modes will increase, hence, a higher probability of a conscious (re)consideration of current travel behavior and a change is expected. From a policy planning perspective, these moments are highly valuable as they open up a “window of opportunity” for introducing and encouraging the use of sustainable transportation alternatives and for promoting health and environmental concerns.  Whether it is voluntary or involuntary, uprooting and moving an activity to another location is a complex event from a socio-psychological perspective. It exposes people to a novel situation regarding geographical accessibility to home, work, amenities, transport services, parking, bike lanes, as well as other contextual characteristics including diversity of population and security, all of which can trigger the need for mobility rearrangement. Furthermore, relocation can stimulate travel behaviour change by influencing individual’s attitudes, values, and habits. In fact, modal choice is a very complex decision process determined by a wide range of spatial, economic, social, and psychological factors. In this context, a deeper understanding of individual’s daily travel behaviour and modal choices is necessary in order to take adequate policy measures to guide mobility towards more sustainable behaviors.  In this context, this dissertation targets the travel behaviour of more than 10,000 employees of the McGill University Health Center (MUHC), Montreal, who experienced a significant life-changing event when five different work locations within the downtown core were merged into one peri-central location, the Glen Site, in 2015. One of the largest employment relocations in North American history, the super-hospital situated near the Vendome intermodal station is a strategic opportunity to advance basic knowledge on sustainable travel demand management. The underlying principle is to derive benefit from the disruption of habits and identifying the barriers of using low-carbon transport modes and to offer green transport opportunities in situations where there is increased attentiveness to alternative modes. Accordingly, this dissertation will answer the following research question: In an attempt to guide mobility towards a more sustainable future, how do the travel-related impacts of involuntary workplace relocation help improve our understanding of the choice of household’s daily mobility in metropolitan territory?  To answer this question, the following objectives will be pursued through the production of three journal papers built on one another: 1. To develop a comprehensive presentation of modal choice determinants, and in particular factors affecting commuting behaviour during the process of workplace relocation as well as effective measures that incentivize sustainable commuting. 2. To examine the extent to which commute mode choice and satisfaction are interdependent by looking at socio-demographic characteristics, residential location and car ownership in the context of a major involuntary workplace relocation. 3. To expand our understanding of the complex causalities and rationales underlying travel-related choices and changes as well as their links to travel attitudes, dissonance and satisfaction. 4. To understand how individuals rank and prioritize their travel-related attitudes and values within the various domains of life in order to maximize their life satisfaction when experiencing a context change. Using both quantitative (n=1977, ~26% response rate) and qualitative (n=19) methods, we collected and analyzed data on before- and after-the-move decisions made by the employees regarding: 1) their travel patterns, 2) barriers of using low-carbon transport modes, and 3) the underlying rationales for change (or not). Whereas research in this field is dominated by quantitative analyses, few studies have applied mixed method approaches where a qualitative approach provides a deeper insight into the complex causal relationships between subjective psychological concepts that quantitative methods are often unable to address thoroughly.  The overarching finding indicated that, while the existence of a regional train (in addition to metro and bus) at a major workplace has a positive impact on reducing private automobile use (15 percent increase in public transit use and 10 percent increase in travel satisfaction), the simple existence of alternatives is insufficient and further efforts are needed to encourage the use of low-carbon transport modes for daily commute. These efforts are most effective and functional if they are made at different stages during the process of the relocation, i.e., before, during, and after the relocation. The quantitative part also provided valuable insights into the importance of considering commuter’s travel-related characteristics (including home location, car ownership, and other socio-economic status) when planning for major workplace relocations. Furthermore, results from our in-depth interviews shed light on the concept of weighted decision-making by discussing how individuals maximize their (travel and life) satisfaction by attributing different value and attitudinal weights to their choice alternatives. The perspective of weighted decision-making helped improve understanding of that satisfaction in various travel-related domains are interdependent and each can affect or be affected by overall life satisfaction. Among the respondents, the majority of the relatively low-income households (e.g., service jobs) lived in areas with low accessibility to adequate public transit, whereas many high-income employees (e.g., doctors and specialists) lived in affluent transit-oriented residential neighbourhoods allowing them to commute by low-carbon transport modes compared to the former group who felt forced to commute by car or endure frustrating commutes with multiple transfers between lines. Moreover, the construction of motorway interchanges and the corresponding heavy congestion around the Glen site has resulted in commute dissatisfaction for drivers, bus users, bicyclists and even pedestrian commuters. This dissertation calls for the contribution of key urban-transportation planners to tackle commute challenges in an attempt to increase subjective well-being, work satisfaction, and quality of life and guide mobility towards a more sustainable future.

92	L’expérience vécue des professionnels de la santé dans un grand centre hospitalier universitaire à Montréal : un regard contextuel	The objective of this doctoral research is to understand how healthcare professionals live in their work environment and what attributes of this physical environment facilitate their work and promote their well-being. The recent emerging hospital context and the construction of new large university hospital centres (CHU) in Quebec during the last decade have changed the nature of the hospital environment significantly. This new environment considers the multiplicity of users, stressors and multiple interactions of health professionals. Furthermore, this new hospital complex integrates new design approaches to alleviate users stress levels and ensure their well-being. The patient centred design approach implemented prioritizes the patient’s well-being and yet little is known about how the physical environment affects the experiences of healthcare professionals. This study examines these issues and their pertinence in light of prior scientific literature, that until recently has placed less emphasis on the healthcare professionals’ interactions within the physical work environment itself. Using a constructivist approach, this study explores these issues in the context of experiences within two care units at one new university hospital complex known as the CHU (Centre Hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal), Canada. Data collection methods included observations of the physical setting and healthcare experiences, supported by semi structured interviews and cognitive mapping that were used to collect data from 44 healthcare professionals. Data analysis uses both a comparative and interpretative approach to analyse the lived experiences of healthcare professionals from diverse perspectives. Results indicate that healthcare professionals evaluated their work environment as supportive. However, they perceived some attributes of the physical environment in this hospital as stressors and the stress faced by these professionals affect the quality of care of patients within the physical environment. The physical environment has an impact on the functioning of the care unit and its management. This study’s contribution includes establishing a portrait of the lived experiences of healthcare professionals and identify both the quality of care issues and the stress limitations among healthcare professionals as these are related to the physical environment. It highlights the importance of adapting the organizational and management system to the spatial configuration of care units in order to achieve optimal performance.

93	Modèle épidémiologique compartimental à délai pour le virus de la dengue	"Dengue is a viral infection affecting from 100 to 400 million people each year. According to the WHO, ""severe dengue is a leading cause of serious illness and death in some Asian and Latin American countries"". This justifies the modelling of this illness's propagation in a population using mathematical compartmental models. Results of Forshey et al. on dengue fever seem to indicate the possibility that a dengue infection does not yield a long term immunity against the different dengue serotypes, and that an homotypical reinfection could be common. We study a SIRS model for the dengue virus that takes into account this loss of immunity via a system of delay differential equations. We characterize the stationary states and their stability in terms of the different parameters considered, in particular the basic reproduction ratios associated to each dengue serotype. We study the system's bifurcations in its main parameters, especially the Hopf bifurcations arising from the presence of a delay in the system of differential equations. Numerical simulations of the model are presented to represent the model's different regimes."	dengue , compartmental models , epidemiology , delay differential equations , retarded differential equations , Hopf bifurcation	en	25474.0

95	La gestion de la face et de la figuration lors d'interactions interculturelles au sein d'une organisation à but non lucratif	In a society where many workers seek to engage in meaningful, mission-centered work, non-profit organizations (NPOs) are an increasingly attractive workplace. NPOs’ focus on employee engagement, participation and collaborative practices has sometimes meant that scholars have neglected the unique challenges of managing conflicts in this organizational context. Some researchers state that conflict is viewed as inappropriate for NPOs, whereas others argue that conflict is ubiquitous in all types of organizations. Although, the concepts of face and facework are often used to examine organizational and intercultural conflicts, few if any empirical studies have analyzed conflict in NPOs using this theoretical framework. As face and facework are co-constructed in and through interaction, this thesis focuses specifically on this “meso” analytic level, while also taking into account the intercultural dimensions of interactions. Based on observations of team meetings and interviews with team members of a culturally-diverse NPO in Montreal, this thesis aims to understand how members of the organization managed their face and facework during intercultural interactions. Relying on an analysis of speech acts, the results revealed that tensions are indeed viewed as inappropriate, but that participants used facework strategies that avoided or minimized them and oriented their facework to transcendent objectives.

96	Création et validation d’un outil d’appréciation interdisciplinaire en français et en arts plastiques destiné aux enseignants du primaire pour sélectionner des albums jeunesse	"The richness of the text and images in some children's books can be used for cultural and interdisciplinary teaching in French and in the visual arts at the primary level. However, there are few tools to support and encourage teachers to apply such practices. The objective of this research and development is to design and test a tool for elementary school teachers to develop, among students, the skills to appreciate literary and artistic works, such as targeted in French and visual arts curriculum (MEQ, 2001) using a children's book. More specifically, this objective has been divided into three sub-objectives: 1) to design a prototype with the help of experts; 2) to develop the prototype based on testing with teachers; and 3) to develop a repertoire of children's books with pedagogical suggestions for validating the tool and encouraging the implementation of interdisciplinary practices in French and the visual arts. The prototype was evaluated by six experts and five elementary school teachers. The data collected from the evaluation questionnaires, the logbook kept during the training sessions and the documents related to the prototype made it possible to conclude that the tool allowed to deepen the teachers' knowledge concerning children's books and the skills ""to appreciate"". The creation of the repertoire based the modified version of the prototype also demonstrates that the children's books contain many elements appropriate for implementing interdisciplinary practices."	arts , research and development , children's book , appreciation , elementary school teachers , visual arts , French , interdisciplinarity	en	25417.0
97	The role of coping style in the relationship between stressful life events and depressive symptoms in young adults	Introduction: Identifying potential mechanisms underpinning the association between stressful life events and depression is key to developing targeted public health interventions. To cope with stressful experiences, individuals adopt coping styles which are differentially associated with depressive symptoms. However, no study has assessed whether coping style mediates and/or moderates this association. Objectives: To examine each of problem-focused, emotion-focused and avoidant coping style as a mediator and/or moderator of the association between stressful life events and depressive symptoms in young adults. Methods: The Nicotine Dependence in Teens (NDIT) is a longitudinal study including 1294 participants recruited in grade 7 from 10 high schools in Montreal Quebec between 1999–2000. The current analysis uses data (n = 782) from self-report questionnaires collected post-high school between 2011–2012. Using VanderWeele’s four-way decomposition approach, the total effect of stressful life events on depressive symptoms was decomposed into components representing moderation only, mediation only, mediated interaction and neither mediation nor moderation by each coping style. Results: We observed moderation by problem-focused coping (β ̂(95%CI)=-1.51(-2.22, -1.06)) and mediation (0.15(0.05, 0.17)) and moderation (1.16(1.05, 1.68) by emotion-focused coping.  An avoidant coping style neither mediated nor moderated this association. Thus, individuals reporting more problem-focused coping experienced fewer depressive symptoms when exposed to more stressful life events; those reporting more emotion-focused coping experienced more depressive symptoms. Conclusion: These results suggest that preventive interventions for depression in young adults should include components to reinforce problem-focused coping strategies and should minimize negative emotion-focused coping strategies.

98	Dopaminergic mechanisms underlying the expression of antipsychotic-induced dopamine supersensitivity in rats	Antipsychotic treatment can produce a dopamine-supersensitive state, potentiating the response to dopamine receptor stimulation. In both schizophrenia patients and rats, this is linked to tolerance to ongoing antipsychotic treatment. In rodents, dopamine supersensitivity is often confirmed by an exaggerated psychomotor response to d-amphetamine after discontinuation of antipsychotic exposure. Here we examined in rats the dopaminergic mechanisms mediating this enhanced behavioural response, as this could uncover pathophysiological processes underlying the expression of antipsychotic-evoked dopamine supersensitivity. Rats received 0.5 mg/kg/day haloperidol via osmotic minipump for 2 weeks, before treatment was discontinued. After cessation of antipsychotic treatment, rats showed a supersensitive psychomotor response to the D2 agonist quinpirole, but not to the D1 partial agonist SKF38393 or the dopamine reuptake blocker GBR12783. Furthermore, acute D1 receptor blockade (using SCH39166) decreased the exaggerated psychomotor response to d-amphetamine in haloperidol-pretreated rats, whereas acute D2 receptor blockade (using sulpiride) enhanced it. Thus, after discontinuation of antipsychotic treatment, D1- and D2-mediated transmission differentially modulate the expression of a supersensitive response to d-amphetamine. This supersensitive behavioural response was accompanied by enhanced GSK3β activity and suppressed ERK1/2 activity in the nucleus accumbens (but not caudate-putamen), suggesting increased mesolimbic D2 transmission. Finally, after discontinuing haloperidol treatment, neither increasing ventral midbrain dopamine impulse flow nor infusing d-amphetamine into the cerebral ventricles triggered the expression of already established dopamine supersensitivity, suggesting that peripheral effects are required. Thus, while dopamine receptor-mediated signalling regulates the expression of antipsychotic-evoked dopamine supersensitivity, a simple increase in central dopamine neurotransmission is insufficient to trigger this supersensitivity.

99	Assessment of left ventricular diastolic function by transesophageal echocardiography before cardiopulmonary bypass : clinical implications of a restrictive profile	Objective Left ventricular (LV) diastolic function can be assessed by transesophageal echocardiography before cardiopulmonary bypass in the setting of cardiac surgery. The objective of this study was to determine whether the assessment of LV diastolic dysfunction (LVDD) improves mortality risk prediction.  Design Retrospective single-center cohort study.  Setting Single tertiary cardiac surgery center.  Participants Data from patients undergoing cardiac surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and for which an evaluation for LVDD was performed before CPB between February 1999 and November 2015.  Interventions Cases were reviewed retrospectively from a transesophageal echocardiography hemodynamic database. LV diastolic function was graded as normal, impaired relaxation (grade 1), pseudo-normalization (grade 2), or restrictive (grade 3) determined by mitral inflow waves, tissue Doppler imaging of the mitral annulus, and pulmonary venous flow. The main outcome was in-hospital mortality.  Measurements and Main Results A total of 760 patients were included, 144 (18.9%) patients with normal diastolic function, 331 (43.6%) patients with grade 1 LVDD, 218 (28.7%) patients with grade 2 LVDD, and 67 (8.8%) patients with grade 3 LVDD. In-hospital mortality occurred in 31 patients (4.1%). The presence of grade 3 LVDD was associated with an increased likelihood of in-hospital mortality (odds ratio [OR]: 19.39, confidence interval [CI]: 2.37-158.48, p = 0.006). In contrast, LV systolic dysfunction was not independently associated with increased mortality. When added to the Parsonnet score, the addition of diastolic function resulted in a net reclassification improvement of in-hospital mortality (NRI: 0.419 CI: 0.049-0.759, p = 0.02), and in integrated discrimination improvement (IDI: 0.0179 CI: 0.0049-0.031, p = 0.007). Difficult separation from CPB was observed more frequently in patients with grade 3 LVDD (62.9% v 36.1%, p = 0.01).  Conclusions In contrast to LV systolic dysfunction, restrictive LVDD is associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality in cardiac surgical patients. Further studies should explore how this information may be used by the attending anesthesiologist to tailor perioperative management.

100	Doppler renal resistance index for the prediction of response to passive leg-raising following cardiac surgery	Purpose: Doppler-based renal resistance index (RI) can be measured at the bedside of critically illpatients. This study was designed to assess if the RI predicted an increase in cardiac output (CO)following passive leg-raising (PLR) in patients admitted to the intensive care unit after cardiacsurgery.Methods: During this single center prospective study, Doppler assessment of RI and measure-ments of CO using the thermodilution method were performed, after surgery, in the intensive careunit before and after PLR. A positive response to PLR was defined as a 10% increase in CO.Results: We included 30 patients. The mean RI was higher before (0.694 60.069) than after PLR(0.679 6 0.069) (P 5 .02) with a median change of 20.012 (IQR: 20.042;0.000). Following PLR, 9patients (30%) had a >10% increase in CO. In patients with a positive PLR response, the decreasein the RI during PLR was more pronounced than in patients who did not respond to PLR (PLR 60.042 (IQR: 20.051; 20.040) vs PLR 620.008 (IQR: 20.032; 0.015) (P 5 .004). There was a sig-nificant negative association between RI change in response to PLR and a 10% increase in COfollowing PLR (OR: 1.63 (CI:1.07–2.47) (P 5 .02) per 20.01 change).Conclusion: An increase in CO following PLR was associated with a significant decrease in RI. Var-iations of RI in response to PLR should be further studied as a tool to predict fluid responsiveness.However, their clinical utility could be limited by the small magnitude of the variations.

101	Violences en contexte conjugal et stratégies de protection adoptées par les femmes	Intimate partner violence can take different forms (physical, sexual, verbal psychological and economic). They may change in frequency and intensity over time. Various strategies can be used to deal with such violence. The present study examines the protection strategies adopted by 75 women who experienced at least one form of intimate partner violence within a window period of three years. Data were collected during face-to-face interviews using closed-ended questions and life history calendars. The aim is to present a portrait of the strategies implemented by victims to minimize revictimization. When the dynamics of the events are not taken into consideration, the results suggest a relative effectiveness of the measures used.

102	"Séquestration nucléolaire des histones durant le traitement anticancer à l'inhibition du protéasome : un mécanisme inédit de régulation
post-traductionnelle, possiblement à l'origine de la mort cellulaire."	By degrading most of cellular proteins, the proteasome is positioned as a key regulator of the proteome, against which most tumors have a strong addiction, due to the protein imbalance that characterizes them. Although its inhibition has been shown to be a good anticancer strategy, it is still limited to blood cancers. Unfortunately, their treatment sooner or later becomes compromised by cellular resistance. This is why the elucidation of the mechanism of death involved could allow a better understanding of this resistance, which would in turn constitute the basis for a more effective treatment One of the most spectacular and early events to manifest during this treatment is the massive deubiquitylation of histone H2A on lysine (K) 119. A rather paradoxical positive correlation between this event, which is associated with gene expression, and cellular sensitivity to proteasome inhibition, has been noticed. This led to an interest in its biological significance. Cancer and primary cells have been used as systems for proteomic study by immunoblot and immunofluorescence, to analyze chromatin status and the spatio-temporal distribution of histones during proteasome inhibition. Chemical inhibitors, interfering RNAs and expression vectors have been used for this purpose. An impressive phenomenon occurring during the proteasome inhibition has been revealed. Indeed, a drastic drop in histones level on chromatin occurs simultaneously with the deubiquitylation of H2A-ub (K119). The proteasome being inhibited, these, and possibly histones synthesized in S phase, would undergo an irreversible translocation in the nucleoli before the onset of apoptosis. This phenomenon is replicated by various proteasome inhibitors and siRNA, and occurs in both cancer and primary cells, but not in resistant cells, which do not demonstrate deubiquitination of H2A-ub (K119). Furthermore, overexpression of exogenous histones has been shown to lead to their nucleolar translocation, and it is thought that the combination of proteasome inhibition with this overexpression could be lethal. Although mostly preliminary, the results would reveal a surprising mechanism of post-translational regulation of endogenous histones, which would be sequestered in nucleoli when not incorporated into chromatin. Indeed, inhibition of the proteasome causes a significant disruption of the chromatin for several hours. Due to the intrinsic cytotoxicity of free histones and to their great cellular abundance, these may well be the cause of the death induced by proteasome inhibition. Finally, as a major stress sensor, the nucleolus could be the starting point of the death signaling.

103	Metabotropic group II glutamate receptors in the basolateral amygdala mediate cue-triggered increases in incentive motivation	Rationale: Reward-associated cues can trigger incentive motivation for reward and invigorate reward-seeking behaviour via Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer (PIT). Glutamate signaling within the basolateral amygdala (BLA) modulates cue-triggered increases in incentive motivation. However, the role of BLA metabotropic group II glutamate (mGlu2/3) receptors is largely unknown.  Objectives: In Experiment 1, we characterized cue-triggered increases in incentive motivation for water reward using the PIT paradigm. In Experiment 2, we assessed the influence of intra-BLA microinjections of the mGlu2/3 receptor agonist LY379268 on this effect.  Methods: Water-restricted male Sprague-Dawley rats learned to press a lever for water. Separately, they learned to associate one of two auditory cues with free water. On test days, rats could lever press under extinction conditions (no water), with intermittent, non-contingent CS+ and CS- presentations. In Experiment 1, rats were tested under baseline conditions. In Experiment 2, rats received intra-BLA microinjections of LY379268 (0, 3 and 6 [Formula: see text]g/hemisphere) before testing.  Results: Across experiments, CS+, but not CS-, presentations increased water-associated lever pressing during testing, even though responding was reinforced neither by water nor the CS+. Intra-BLA LY379268 abolished both CS+ potentiated pressing on the water-associated lever and CS+ evoked conditioned approach to the site of water delivery. LY379268 did not influence locomotion or instrumental and Pavlovian response rates during intervals between CS presentations or during the CS-, indicating no motor effects.  Conclusions: mGlu2/3 receptor activity in the BLA mediates cue-triggered potentiation of incentive motivation for reward, suppressing both cue-induced increases in instrumental pursuit of the reward and anticipatory approach behaviour.

104	Metal–ligand interactions and salt bridges as sacrificial bonds in mussel byssus-derived materials	The byssus that anchors mussels to solid surfaces is a protein-based material combining strength and toughness as well as a self-healing ability. These exceptional mechanical properties are explained in part by the presence of metal ions forming sacrificial bonds with amino acids. In this study, we show that the properties of hydrogel films prepared from a byssus protein hydrolyzate (BPH) can also be improved following the biomimetic formation of sacrificial bonds. Strengthening and toughening of the materials are both observed when treating films with multivalent ions (Ca2+ or Fe3+) or at the BPH isoelectric point (pI) as a result of the formation of metal–ligand bonds and salt bridges, respectively. These treatments also provide a self-healing behavior to the films during recovery time following a deformation. While pI and Ca2+ treatments have a similar but limited pH-dependent effect, the modulus, strength, and toughness of the films increase largely with Fe3+ concentration and reach much higher values. The affinity of Fe3+ with multiple amino acid ligands, as shown by vibrational spectroscopy, and the more covalent nature of this interaction can explain these observations. Thus, a judicious choice of treatments on polyampholyte protein-based materials enables control of their mechanical performance and self-healing behavior through the strategic exploitation of reversible sacrificial bonds.

105	Exploitation du potentiel thérapeutique des cellules Natural Killer pour traiter les cancers	Despite the overwhelming success of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified T lymphocytes against leukemias, some limitations have been observed, such as the risk of developing CRS and the lack of efficiency in solid tumor settings. Many other cell-based immunotherapies have been explored to circumvent those caveats. Natural killer (NK) cells present many advantageous properties that could make them a very promising alternative to T cells in immunotherapies. However, NK cells have some caveats, mainly they are hard to modify using conventional tools and they are sensitive to many inhibitory signals expressed by cancer cells. We managed to greatly improve the efficiency of transduction using a novel viral glycoprotein, BaEVRless. In the process, we determined that this novel enveloppe glycoprotein did not modify the phenotype or intrinsic activity of the transduced NK cells. In a leukemia model, we also showed that the BaEVRless can be used to generate functionnal CAR-NK cells. Moreover, the NK cells can be transduced with larger lentiviral constructions bearing two simultaneous CAR-coding sequences. We also demonstrated that Clustered Regularly Interspersed Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) modification of NK cells using a non-viral approach was possible. Using this approach, we generated NK cells with lower NKG2A expression, that were resistant to the inhibitory effects of HLA-E. This affect was seen in a breast cancer model and a colon cancer model. The in vitro results were confirmed in an in vivo preclinical xenogeneic model. Together, those results represent two improvements applicable to NK cell-based immunotherapies.

106	Rôle de la modulation de la phosphatidylsérine dans l’activation des cellules T	T lymphocytes protect us against pathogens by orchestrating the adaptive immune response. T lymphocytes possess a specific surface receptor, the T cell receptor (TCR), which conveys the stimulation signal towards the cytoplasm for the initiation of the T cell activation cascade. The TCR is a multimeric complex composed of the TCRαβ, CDεγ, CD3εδ and CD3ζζ dimers. The TCRαβ chains recognize the pathogenic antigens while the CD3 chains initiate the T cells signaling cascade through the phosphorylation of their cytoplasmic tails. It is not yet understood how the TCR activating signal is transmitted through the membrane from the TCRαβ chains towards the cytoplasmic tails of the CD3 chains. In resting T cells, the CD3ε and CD3ζ chains are associated to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane (PM). The cytoplasmic tails of CD3ε and CD3ζ are rich in basic amino acids, which allow electrostatic association with acidic phospholipids at the PM. Phosphatidylserine (PS) is the most abundant acidic phospholipid and is exclusively distributed towards the cytoplasmic PM leaflet. During T cell activation, the CD3ε and CD3ζ cytoplasmic tails have to dissociate from PS for their phosphorylation. The membrane dissociation of a large number of CD3 chains is essential for the amplification of T cell activation. A mechanism of CD3ε and CD3ζ chain dissociation that has been proposed in the literature is through intracellular calcium elevation. A robust calcium influx is generated following T cell stimulation. In addition to its essential role in regulating T cell activation, it has been proposed that calcium ions neutralize the PM acidic phospholipids for CD3 chain dissociation. Calcium is also an essential cofactor for the activity of many enzymes, such as the phospholipid scramblase TMEM16F. TMEM16F redistributes PS at the PM following intracellular calcium mobilization, resulting in a reduction of inner leaflet PS. We propose that calcium regulates CD3 chain dissociation through TMEM16F activity. Our study demonstrates that calcium-dependent PS redistribution by TMEM16F is required for CD3ε membrane dissociation in the Jurkat T cell line. Reduction of TMEM16F expression by shRNA targeting (shTMEM16F) prevents massive CD3ε chain dissociation following 8 T cell stimulation. The shTMEM16F cells show a reduction in the phosphorylation of TCR-proximal signaling molecules. In contrast, expression of a constitutively active mutant of TMEM16F increases PS redistribution, CD3ε chain dissociation and phosphorylation of TCR-proximal signaling molecules. Our study demonstrates that PS redistribution by the calcium-dependent TMEM16F scramblase regulates CD3 chain dissociation for the amplification of T cell activation. In addition, we have confirmed T cell activation defects in shTMEM16F murine primary T cells during an immune response. In conclusion, our study demonstrates the role of PS regulation by TMEM16F in T cell activation. We showed that we could modify the level of T cell activation by modulating the concentration of PS at the inner leaflet of the PM. Our results thus have important implications for the development and improvement of immune receptor-based cancer immunotherapies.

108	Étude internationale : l'effet modérateur d'un trait culturel sur la relation entre les traits psychopathiques et la coopération sociale chez des individus non incarcérés	Psychopathy is characterized by various emotional and behavioural manifestations that include a lack of empathy towards others, manipulation and exploitation. To date, studies of psychopathy have focused primarily on antisocial behaviours, while little attention has been paid to the potential for prosocial behaviours.  Although generally observed in about 10% of the carceral population, psychopathy is also found in the general population. In order to better understand what might distinguish psychopaths adapted to life in society from those involved in criminal activities, some researchers have attempted to study the relationship between psychopathic traits and the ability to cooperate in non-incarcerated individuals. However, the results are inconsistent from one study to another. To date, no research has explored the moderating effect of a third variable, that could potentially explain this discrepancy in data.  For example, some cultural traits, such as individualism versus collectivism, are conceptually linked to both psychopathic traits and social cooperation. The objective of the thesis was to verify the relationship between psychopathic traits and cooperative behaviours among individuals in the general population, while taking into account the effect of participants individualistic or collectivist traits. It was expected that: 1) psychopathic traits would predict uncooperative choices; and 2) this relationship would differ according to the individualistic or collectivist attitudes reported by participants. Recruitment was conducted on the international scene via social networks, classified advertisement sites and some university departments. A total of 134 participants completed the entire study. They completed the following tests in random order: the Levenson Scale of Psychopathy, the Scenarios for the measurement of collectivism and individualism, and an iterative simulation of the prisoner's dilemma involving 12 trials. A hierarchical regression was conducted and did not confirm the hypotheses. Various exploratory analyses were also attempted, including logistic regressions and contrast analyses.  Psychopathic traits were not significantly predictive of cooperative choices in the prisoner's dilemma, nor did the cultural traits have a significant impact on this relationship. An in-depth discussion was conducted to explain these results and to place them in the context of the current scientific literature. More specifically, the Discussion focused on the conceptualization of psychopathic traits and their manifestations in the general population, as well as on research in an intercultural context. A second experiment was conducted with a new sample, correcting the methodological flaws identified in the international study. This second experiment focused on the relationship between psychopathic traits and social cooperation, without considering cultural traits. To improve the research design, only males were recruited, the sample size was increased, and recruitment was not conducted internationally in order to limit variability among participants. Also, a questionnaire measuring the presence of clues to psychopathic traits in childhood and adolescence was added. The objective of this second experiment was to further explore the relationship between psychopathic traits and the adoption of cooperative behaviours in individuals from the general population. Psychopathic traits were expected to be predictors of uncooperative choices. More specifically, the hypothesis was that the more individuals report psychopathic traits in adulthood and psychopathic traits present in childhood, the less likely they are to be cooperative. Recruitment was conducted via social networks. A total of 150 men completed the entire study. Each completed the following tests in random order: the Levenson Psychopathy Scale, the Childhood and Adolescent Taxon Scale-Self Report, and an iterative simulation of the prisoner's dilemma involving 12 trials. Standard and hierarchical multiple regressions were performed. The hypotheses were partially confirmed. Childhood psychopathy indices were predictive of decisions made in the prisoner's dilemma, however the direction of the relationship was not as expected. The results indicated that the higher the score on the Childhood and Adolescent Taxon Scale-Self Report, the more cooperative the individuals were to the prisoner's dilemma.  Second, psychopathic traits in adulthood, as measured by scores on the Levenson Psychopathy Scale, alone did not predict decisions about the prisoner's dilemma. Adult psychopathic traits were predictive of cooperative behaviour only when considered in conjunction with measures of childhood psychopathic trait indicators. The percentage of variance in cooperative behaviour that was explained by the model was small. Also, the predictive value of adult psychopathic traits was entirely attributable to Factor 1 traits (interpersonal and emotional). This time, the relationship was as expected: the higher the score on Levenson's Psychopathy Scale, the less cooperative participants were to the prisoner's dilemma. These results were interpreted in a new Discussion, which shed light on the similarities and differences between the two experiments carried out in the framework of the thesis. Also, questions surrounding the validity of the concept of psychopathy in the general population were supported. Based on the entire thesis, recommendations for future research were formulated.

109	Hyperactivation cérébrale et réseaux fonctionnels associés chez les individus à risque de développer la maladie d'Alzheimer	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in older adults. Its early diagnosis is essential to better understand the brain mechanisms underlying the phenotypical manifestation of the disease and develop consequent interventions. The study of individuals at risk of AD, for example those presenting with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI), offers the opportunity to examine the neuropathophysiological processes preceding the dementia stage. This would allow, among other things, to identify early biomarkers of the disease. The general aim of this thesis was to determine the presence of cerebral hyperactivation and to assess functional brain networks associated with hyperactivation. Hyperactivation is defined by the presence of higher levels of brain activation in individuals at risk of AD (i.e. SCD, MCI) in comparison to cognitively healthy controls. Hyperactivation is most often measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while participants perform a cognitive task. In this thesis, the reader will first be exposed to the studies which used fMRI to examine patterns of brain activation and connectivity in individuals with a clinical diagnosis of AD, MCI or presenting with SCD. Theoretical models resulting from these studies will then be presented. The scientific issues remaining to be addressed to better understand the phenomenon of hyperactivation and its relation to functional brain networks will then be described (Chapter 1). Three empirical studies forming the core of this thesis will be presented. The first study aimed to assess the presence, localization and longitudinal evolution of hyperactivation associated with an episodic memory task in individuals meeting criteria for MCI and having subsequently progressed towards dementia (Chapter 2). The second study aimed to determine the trajectory of brain activation associated with an associative memory task as a function of disease severity in a group of individuals at risk of AD. It also aimed to determine if hyperactivation is present in viii participants meeting criteria for SCD plus (or SCD+), who are individuals presenting with memory complaint in addition to genetic and/or neurodegeneresence markers of AD (Chapter 3). The third and last study aimed to examine patterns of functional connectivity related to regions of hyperactivation, and to assess how hyperactivation and its associated functional networks relate to memory performance in individuals at risk of AD (Chapter 4). Results from the first study highlighted the presence of hyperactivation in individuals with MCI who subsequently progressed to the dementia stage. Findings from the second study revealed a quadratic function describing the relationship between proxies of disease severity (neurodegeneration, memory performance) and left superior parietal activation in a group of individuals at risk of AD (SCD+ and MCI). Moreover, higher levels of activation, i.e. hyperactivation, were found in hippocampal and temporo-parietal regions in the SCD+ group. Hypoactivation was rather found in the left superior parietal area in the MCI group. Finally, results from the third study revealed that hyperactivation of predetermined regions was associated with dysfunction of functional brain networks underlying associative memory in SCD+ and MCI. Moreover, these hyperactivation-network interactions were associated with increasing symptomatology. The implications of this thesis and its limits are addressed in the discussion section (Chapter 5).

110	La distinction entre l’être et l’essence chez Hervé de Nédellec	Hervaeus Natalis o.p. played a leading role in defending the doctrinal heritage of Thomas Aquinas against the effects of the condemnations of the end of the 13th and beginning of the 14th centuries. Nevertheless, he would have supported a position on the distinction between being and essence which is irreconcilable with the Thomasian distinction, even though this element is central to the thought of the illustrious Dominican. The present study verifies this discrepancy and give an account of it, considering the historical context and the role assumed by Hervaeus in the defence of the thought of his confrere. Allen (1958) characterizes the Hervean perspective by its essentialism and its semantic approach, as well as by the rejection of the real distinction (Giles of Rome and Aquinas) and the intentional distinction (Henri of Ghent). He also evokes the influence of Godfrey of Fontaines, Siger of Brabant and Averroes with regard to the distinction between being (esse) and essence according to the mode of signifying adopted by Hervaeus. These claims are here confirmed by the exposition and comparison of the ontological principles assumed by the different stances. By the same token, it is made clear that Siger of Brabant, Godefroid of Fontaines, Hervaeus Natalis and also Dietrich of Freiberg, the proponents of the semantic distinction, reject the opposing positions on the basis of the same elements that they criticize in them. The doctrinal community between the distinction according to the mode of signifying and the Modist theory, as well as their common source in the Commentary on the Metaphysics of Averroes are also brought to light. The Modists distinguish between the object signified and the properties concerning (circa) the object signified. In the semantic perspective, essence, ens and esse are conceived as properties concerning the object signified in the manner of the circa properties of speculative grammar. Like the circa properties, “essence”, “ens” and “esse” do not differ because they signify different determinations, but they differ in the sense that they signify the same thing in different ways. The analysis of the objections raised by the proponents of the semantic distinction and of the constitutive elements of their position provides new tools for appreciating the distinction between being (esse) and essence in Aquinas. It proves to proceed from a theoretical framework that is irreconcilable with that adopted by Hervaeus. We argue here that this doctrinal freedom of Hervaeus is explained by the fact that the distinction between being (esse) and essence was not constitutive of the Thomasian fund concerned by the Dominican teaching ordinances of the end of the 13th and beginning of the 14th centuries, especially since it was not targeted by the ecclesial doctrinal condemnations nor by the correctory of William de la Mare.

111	Contribution de l’imagerie dronique pour la caractérisation des paramètres biophysiques des cultures agricoles	Thanks to information technologies and GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System), precision agriculture is refining the scale of observation and intervention, from the field to the individual plant. Remote sensing, in particular through satellite imagery, has also made it possible to monitor the crop dynamics, with increasing time frequency and spatial resolution. Crop vigor is a crucial parameter allowing the optimization of inputs, and consequently economic and environmental benefits. Several ways to estimate crop vigor are possible. For a row crop such as corn (Zea Mays L.), aboveground biomass has been favored and will serve as a proxy for vigor. Our study is based on the hypothesis that the recent advent of agricultural UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) will pave the way for a better estimation of crop vigor. We assume that the flexibility of the UAV combined with the very high spatial resolution of their images will allow a more accurate monitoring of crop vigor, both in space and time – conditions which are critical for the deployment of precision agriculture. Research over the past 15 years has relied on the UAV to collect images of very high spatial resolution. However, the processing of those images is mainly based on vegetation indices, especially the NDVI. Several questions arise from the above observations: – Is the use of NDVI the most efficient way to exploit the spatial resolution of UAV images? If not, is there a better way to exploit this imagery? – How to respond to time and logistical constraints in the image processing so that it is ultimately adopted by farmers? – Since UAV-borne sensors can be oriented quite freely, what are the effects of the acquisition angles on the results? First, we assessed the relevance of the traditional approach which uses the NDVI index to determine crop parameters. To do that, we compared the UAV platform with the GreenSeeker proximal sensor. The results showed that the UAV is less efficient than the GreenSeeker in estimating corn biomass. We thus moved away from the traditional approach and opted for a method extracting the apparent leaf area, through computer vision techniques applied to RGB images. This method took advantage of the very high spatial resolution offered by UAV images and produced a robust proxy for corn biomass, at the surface (per square meter) and row levels. We also found that the results were not affected by the acquisition angles of the images (nadir and oblique). Therefore, this research opens the perspective to UAV applications in precision agriculture, for the estimation of vigor and other fundamental parameters used in input optimization algorithms. It also offers the possibility to imagine non-UAV based platforms for the acquisition of very high resolution images in the context of fertilization.

112	"L’expérience d’immigrants, candidats aux ordres professionnels, lors de l’évaluation authentique de leurs compétences langagières, quant à l’épreuve de
français de l’Office québécois de la langue française (OQLF)"	Since a few years, Quebec faces an unprecedented economic situation. Indeed, an ageing and declining population combined with a lack of qualified workers on the labour market is slowing down the economic development of the province. In this context, migrants represent an asset to remain competitive in the economic battle which opposes us to other countries (Boudarbat and Boulet, 2010; Posca, 2019). This fact is further sustained by The Chamber of commerce of metropolitan Montreal (2019); the Quebec council of employers (2015) and the Ministry of Labor, Employment and Social solidarity (2019).However, to be able to exercise a regulated profession, migrants must pass the French examination of the Office québécois de la langue française (OQLF). The one which is proposed by this organism since winter 2018 is novel and consists of an evaluation situation which is meant to be authentic, i.e., complex and contextualized (Stiggins, 2007; Wiggins, 1993). Succeeding this examination is a prerequisite to professional licensure. A critical constructivist perspective was thus sought to understand migrants’ experience regarding this examination. More specifically, we sought to shed light on the factors which influence preparation, participation and results announcement of the latter. So, following a comprehensive-interpretative approach, in this exploratory-descriptive research, data were collected through semi-directed interviews of 30 candidates of different professional orders.Results show that in each of the phases of preparation, participation and results announcement, the experience of candidates is influenced both positively and negatively. So, preparation was facilitated by studies and work experience in Quebec, as well as specialized courses. However, the cost of courses and lack of time and resources for self learning acted as barriers to the preparation of candidates. As regards participation, several aspects influenced candidates’ experience positively and negatively. Furthermore, the experience analysis of candidates shed light on certain anomalies: the exam protocol was not standardized across various sessions; candidates shared information among themselves during break time; candidates used deceptive strategies when in difficulty; candidates were frequently absent or just came to respect the exigencies of the French Charter; and the OQLF did not adapt its exam sessions to take into consideration planned absences of candidates. As regards results announcement, candidates’ experiences helped identify the perceived use of the documentation received. The decisions which entailed announcement of results were also put forward as well as the psychological impact of repeated failures on candidates. Moreover, we also discussed the economic impact of candidate failure and their opinions on the examination. Lastly, the problems identified by this study require special attention of the organism so as to enhance candidates’ experience.	immigration , Authentic evaluation , French as second and foreign language , immigration , critical constructivism , candidates’ experience	en	25230.0
113	Rethinking development interventions through the lens of decoloniality in sub-Saharan Africa : the case of global health	There has been much talk about decolonizing global health lately. The movement, which has arisen in various communities around the world, suggests an interesting critique of the Western dominant model of representations. Building upon the ‘decolonial thinking’ movement from the perspective of Francophone African philosophers, we comment on its potential for inspiring the field of global healthinterventions. Using existing literature and personal reflections, we reflect on two widely known illustrations of global health interventions implemented in sub-Saharan Africa – distribution of contraceptives and dissemination of Ebola virus prevention and treatment devices – featuring different temporal backdrops. We show how these solutions have most often targeted the superficial dimensions of global health problems, sidestepping the structures and mental models that shape the actions and reactions of African populations. Lastly, we question the ways through which the decolonial approach might indeed offer a credible positioning for rethinking global health interventions.

114	Développement d’un instrument d’évaluation de l’environnement des personnes ayant un trouble du spectre de l’autisme	Introduction: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is prevalent in 1% of the world's population. Within individuals living with ASD, some environmental elements (e.g., noise, light, distribution) are just some disruptive factors; the manifestations may persist throughout life. Therefore, it is important to assess the environment in order to provide interventions for adults living with ASD, improving their quality of life. Purpose: To develop tool for assessing the environment of adults living with ASD. Methods: This study was developed in two steps: 1) Exploration of environmental factors that impact young people living with ASD with parents and 2) Consultation of potential users about the first version of the HoPE - ASD version.  Results: The HoPE-ASD version was developed on the basis of the Model of Competence, explaining the person-environment relationship, considering the human and non-human environmental components that have an impact on adults living with ASD (e.g., sensory elements, related to the safety and functionality of spaces, stability, visitors or trusted persons). During the consultation of potential users (occupational therapists), some modifications related to the content, mode of administration, format and applicability of the instrument were suggested. Conclusion: The HoPE-ASD version could fill a gap in the clinical and scientific practice of occupational therapists working with adults living with ASD. Thus, environmental interventions adapted to this population will be promoted.

115	Interventions innovantes dans le traitement des maladies valvulaires mitrales et aortiques : options de traitement actuelles et perspectives futures	"Valvular heart disease is an important cause of morbidity and mortality. In western countries, mitral regurgitation and aortic stenosis are the most frequent valvular pathologies and their prevalence increases with age. With the increase in life expectancy in these countries, the prevalence of degenerative valve disease will increase with a significant burden on healthcare systems. Advances in cardiac surgery as well as new breakthroughs in interventional cardiology have considerably modified the management of patients with valvular disease, by offering minimally invasive approaches, especially for patients at high surgical risk. In this thesis, two retrospective cohort studies were carried out. The first compares the postoperative and 3 years outcomes of mitral valve surgery vs MitraClip, a transcatheter procedure, in 259 patients with severe ischemic mitral regurgitation. The second study compares the postoperative results of two minimally invasive techniques (ministernotomy and minithoracotomy) for aortic valve replacement to conventional sternotomy. In the first study, MitraClip procedure had lower postoperative and 3-year mortality rate than surgery, but it was associated with higher recurrence rate of mitral regurgitation after 3 years. The second study showed that the two minimally invasive approaches had similar intrahospital mortality rate to sternotomy. Minithoracotomy was associated with less perioperative bleeding and less pain at rest than sternotomy. In conclusion, minimally invasive approaches offer an excellent alternative to conventional surgery in the treatment of valvular disease. The clinical benefits are more highlighted when patients are properly selected; hence the importance of a ""Heart Team"" that collaborates for better patient care."

116	Utilité d’une application, adaptée du programme APAP (Augmentation de la Psychothérapie par Amorçage Préconscient) pour l’autogestion des difficultés liées à l’anxiété et à l’insomnie dans la population générale	Anxiety and insomnia are among the most common mental health disorders with negative consequences for patients, their families and society as a whole. Pharmacological treatment options with initial efficacy are available but are associated with unwanted side effects and tolerance in the longer term. Cognitive-behavioral therapy is a treatment of choice that provides an effective and longer-term solution, but availability is limited with long waiting-lists. Alternative effective options are needed to address the needs of all those suffering from anxiety and insomnia in a cost effective and timely manner. In particular, the development of new applications of technologies that are already widely used in the general population hold the potential to address the lack of access to traditional resources for those with mental health problems.   Our team took the initiative to evaluate the efficacy of the Muzzz app, which consists of listening to positive suggestions inspired by Schultz's autogenic training., and is designed to reduce anxiety and to improve sleep These suggestions are masked by relaxing music and delivered in a subliminal format as a derivative of the APAP (Augmentation of Psychotherapy through Alternative Preconscious Priming) program. The APAP program developed by Borgeat et al. (2013) consists of listening of positive personalized suggestions masked by relaxing music, which has previously shown effectiveness in increasing positive cognitions (d = 0.53) and decreasing negative cognitions (d = 0.73).   To assess the effectiveness of the Muzzz app and its application among those with anxiety and insomnia a total of 20 participants (10 men and 10 women were recruited at the Saint-Michel and Rosemont CLSCs (local community service centers) and invited to use the app for 4 weeks in a psychoeducational context. To measure the effects of the app they were administered the Beck Anxiety Inventory, the Insomnia Severity Index and the Penn State Worry Questionnaire at the beginning of the study and then at 2 and 4 weeks respectively. Anxiety, insomnia and worry was also assessed with the Emax app which is used to collect data in real time. In addition, change in cognitions were assessed with the Idiosyncratic Measure of Convictions in Thoughts at the beginning and at the end of the study. The results showed a statistically significant reduction in anxiety (d=0.78) at the end of the intervention period. In addition, there was a significant improvement in the quality of sleep (d=0.78) and reduction in worries (d=0.77). Finally, a significant improvement in cognitions was observed with the decrease in negative cognitions as assessed by the Idiosyncratic Measure of Convictions in Thoughts (d=1.59). We can therefore conclude that the use of the Muzzz app in a psychoeducational context is effective for temporarily relieving symptoms of people with anxiety and insomnia, while they are on waiting-list to see a healthcare professional. Results are limited by a relatively small size and await confirmation in future larger-scale studies.	Apap , Emax , Anxiety , Insomnia , Muzzz app	en	25184.0
117	Biocompatible polymer coatings for implants in the peripheral nervous system : in vivo study of polymer-coated microbeads in the rat sciatic model	Background: Implants in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) can potentially restore sensory feedback, improve motor control and alleviate phantom-limb pain in upper-limb amputees. However, nervous system implants have poor long-term function and biocompatibility when implanted into the body due to foreign body reaction. Dendrimer (DND) and Poly-D-Lysine (PDL) are two synthetic polymers with properties that could improve the performance of these interfaces. In my masters’ research, my objective is to determine whether these synthetic polymers could promote the formation of presynaptic elements on artificial surfaces in vivo making intraneural implants more biocompatible and long-lasting. Methods: In the coated microsphere in vivo experiment, a nerve crush injury model in the rat was used for the study. PDL-coated, DND-coated and uncoated beads were injected into the rat sciatic nerve at the crush site and 5 mm distal to the crush site. The nerves were then harvested after 4, 6 and 8 weeks and stained for neurofilament and synaptophysin. Synaptophysin puncta were then counted on the bead surface for each group. Additionally, in a proof-of-concept experiment, two uncoated electrodes were implanted into the rat sciatic nerve. Nerve recordings were then performed every week, and the threshold nerve potential in the sciatic nerve was measured by only varying the pulse duration of the stimulation. Results: The coated microsphere in vivo experiment demonstrated that DND-coated microspheres had a significantly higher number of synaptophysin puncta around their surface from 4 to 8 weeks compared to uncoated beads. At 4 weeks, the DND condition also showed a significantly higher number of synaptophysin puncta around its microbeads vs. the PDL condition for the distal site. In the uncoated electrode in vivo experiment, the results showed that the two implants could stimulate and record threshold nerve potentials in the rat sciatic nerve for one week and two weeks respectively before being non-functional. Conclusion: Our study showed for the first time that DND has a stable synapse-promoting property that is superior to PDL in vivo and that our electrode design can be used to assess the long-term signal stability of peripheral nerve implants.

118	Perceptions de communautés québécoises à l’égard des ressources comestibles du fleuve Saint-Laurent	Context: The Saint-Lawrence hosts a great variety of edible resources, but they are largely unknown. Quebeckers currently consume mostly imported seafood products whereas the few marine species that are commercially fished in Quebec are mainly exported. However, it is reasonable to assume that habitants along the Saint-Lawrence River have a closer relationship with edible marine resources and a vision for promoting them which deserves to be heard. Manger notre Saint-Laurent (Sustenance from our Saint-Lawrence) is a research-action multidisciplinary project aiming the promotion of edible local marine resources in the Saint-Lawrence. Objectives: (1) Critical analysis of the participatory process used in four communities in Quebec for Manger notre Saint-Laurent, and (2) Analysis of results generated. Methods: Four partner communities have been identified as actors in this project: Cap-Chat, Sainte-Thérèse-de-Gaspé, the Magdalen Islands and the Wolastoqiyik Wahsipekuk (Maliseet Viger) First Nation. A group of 10 to 14 participants from various backgrounds was recruited from each community. The Nominal group technique was used and transcripts were qualitatively analyzed.  Results: All communities combined, winning strategies to increase supply were increasing local distribution networks and facilitating sustenance fishing. Winning strategies to increase demand were discovering the products through tasting and cooking, protecting cultural history of fishing, and marketing and educating about the products. Emergent species (sea urchins, algae, seals) particularly interested participants. The most popular target groups were youth and the community as a whole. Qualitative analysis revealed the important cultural ties to fishing in all communities. Also, critical analysis of the method revealed aspects like the importance of correctly recruiting participants, of having an experienced facilitator, and the usefulness of qualitative analysis. Conclusion: Our sample of Saint-Lawrence coastal communities created consensus around many resources that should receive more availability and more promotion, and around target groups that should include everyone in a community while targeting youth. This study is a first step in a research project that will lead to Quebeckers getting Sustenance from our Saint-Lawrence.	fish , seafood , qualitative research , participatory , stakeholder , community , Saint-Lawrence , Magdalen Islands , Maliseet Viger	en	25179.0
119	The consequences of CCL23/CCR1 axis signaling in KMT2A-MLLT3 acute myeloid leukemia	Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is caused by abnormal proliferation of immature blood stem cells. Our lab focuses on an AML subgroup accounting for almost 20% of pediatric AML and characterized by a chromosomal translocation that generates the gene fusion: KMT2A-MLLT3 (KM3). Interestingly, RNA-seq analysis of our KM3 AML model and AML patient samples has revealed that the chemokine CCL23 and its corresponding receptor CCR1 are highly upregulated in this disease. Although it has been reported that CCL23 and CCR1 are implicated in leukocyte trafficking and development of inflammation, the exact roles of these two proteins in leukemia are unknown.  To illustrate the effects of CCL23/CCR1 signaling in the KMT2A-MLLT3 rearranged leukemia we employed the enhanced bystander bioluminescence resonance energy transfer 2 (ebBRET2) technique along with phospho-immunoblots assays. Our results revealed that CCL23/CCR1 axis signaling activates multiple intermolecular signaling effectors, including Gi2, G12/13, and β-arrestin1/2 albeit with a bias towards β-arrestin recruitment. We also showed that the CCR1 receptor exhibits a constitutive activity which can couple to a G-protein mediated pathway to activate the MAPK cascade. Finally, we showed that CCL23/CCR1 axis signaling causes an activation of ERK1/2 in AML cell lines potentially through a β-arrestin-mediated pathway.   These results indicate that the CCL23/CCR1 axis signaling activates several biological pathways than can provide major advantages for the AML disease development and progression thus presenting both CCL23 and CCR1 as interesting candidates for targeted therapy against KMT2A-MLLT3 AML.

120	Analyse protéomique de la sénescence induite par la chimiothérapie dans le cancer de l'ovaire	Patients treated for an advanced ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC) have a poor 5-year survival rate due to treatment resistance. Since 30 years, the therapeutic strategy consists of a combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel (CP). It is of the upmost urgency to find new treatments against this cancer. We studied the impact of CP treatment on an OCCC cell line and observed that it induced a senescence state in the cells. Senescent cells do not proliferate anymore but have a huge impact on their microenvironment by secreting a complex mix of molecules. We need to know better the characteristics of chemotherapy-induced senescent cells to be able to target them with new treatments. Consequently, we studied the cell surface proteins of senescent cells with a cutting-edge proteomic method. We found that the protein DNAJC5 was upregulated at the cell surface of senescent cells. This chaperone is implicated in exo- and endocytosis mechanisms, as well as in a non-conventional secretion pathway. We wanted to know if this pathway was activated in senescent cells and we studied the impact of DNAJC5 inhibition on the cell proteotoxicity and on senescence establishment. Our first results suggest that DNAJC5 would have a role in senescence, which has never been observed. In the future, this discovery could contribute to the development of new treatments for the COCC.	surfaceome , DNAJC5 , Ovarian cancer , non-conventional secretion pathways	en	25172.0
121	Toujours mieux à deux? : reconstruction identitaire lors de la retraite chez les femmes sans conjoint	Retirement is often thought of in terms of couplehood, and the absence of a spouse as a source of support is often described in the existing literature as an obstacle to a positive adjustment to the transition to retirement. This dissertation examines the experience of the transition to retirement of women without a partner, as their reality is not explored, to our knowledge, in the current Quebec context. It has three objectives: to describe how they experience the impacts of retirement, to identify the factors that play a role in the experience of this transition, and finally it aims to understand how the (re)construction of their identities is realized during their transition to retirement, knowing that our identity reconstructs throughout the life course. It is through life stories that we were able to identify these changes, more specifically through the professional and romantic trajectories of ten retired women we interviewed in this study. Despite the importance highlighted in literature that partners are an important source of support during the transition to retirement, our results emphasize that not having a partner is not, for the majority, a source of difficulty during this transition or on a daily basis. On the contrary, many women consider themselves happy with their transitions and in their daily lives in the absence of a spouse. We also note a feeling of pride amongst the participants, enabled by the fact that they consider themselves as independent, and capable of supporting themselves. Beyond this feeling of accomplishment, and despite the wish of some to engage in a potential future relationship, these women perceive very positively their transition to retirement. In the absence of a spouse, the organization of their daily lives can then be carried out without having to negotiate, make compromises or sacrifices, their plans for retirement and their well-being belonging only to themselves.

122	La parentalité d’accueil dans le contexte des visites supervisées : étude sur le point de vue des parents d’accueil	The main objective of this research is to understand how foster parenting is exercised in the context of supervised visitation. From the foster families' point of view, this study aims to describe their understanding of supervised visits; their involvement in their planning; the support they provide to the child; the communication they have with various parties involved in supervised visits. To this end, semi-structured interviews were conducted with fourteen foster parents affiliated with the youth program division from the Centre intégré universitaire de santé et de services sociaux du Centre-Sud-de-l'Île-de-Montréal. The interviews were subject to a continuous thematization. The theoretical and conceptual ecosystemic model of parenting was used to describe the various dimensions of foster parenting. The results of this research show that foster families have a good understanding of supervised visits in terms of their objectives and the reasons for their implementation. The foster families’ involvement in the planning of supervised visits varies. Some are involved in decision-making. While others have choices imposed on them by caseworkers. As for the accompaniment of children, a need for training and/or coaching was identified by a good number of foster families. This study also shows that the majority of foster families have positive exchanges with caseworkers. As for communication with the child’s biological parents, a variety of experiences were reported by the foster families. The participants' discourse analysis highlighted the challenges of foster parenting in the context of supervised visits. It also raised issues related to the recognition of foster families as partners in the delivery of services to children. In conclusion, this research offers interesting avenues for reflection regarding foster parenting and practices for supervised visits.	foster care , supervised visitation , parenthood , child protection	en	25156.0
123	Quelles représentations sociales de la délinquance sexuelle chez les utilisateurs de réseaux sociaux numériques? : une étude exploratoire	The phenomenon of sexual offending has generated strong emotions and reactions among the population. Long lasting interest, curiosity, but especially social reactions, keep the subject popular on the social, political and media scenes. The legal and political measures adopted to manage this phenomenon have evolved according to these reactions, or rather, according to the social representations inspiring these reactions. Indeed, it has been shown that the public and activist movements had a great influence in the adoption of these measures. In addition, the rise in popularity of digital social networks (DSN) has offered a new environment in which these groups can exchange, debate, recruit and mobilize. Thereby, given the influence of the discourse of those groups on the adoption of measures to manage the phenomenon and given the growing popularity of DSN as a place of exchange on common interests, we found it relevant to look at the social representations carried by their users. Thus, the main objective of this master’s thesis is to describe the social representations of sexual offending carried by the users of a specific Facebook page. To do this, we performed a thematic content analysis of the comments and interactions between users, according to Moscovici’s social representation theory and its three components : information, representational field and attitudes. Overall, 821 comments, coming from 14 publications, were analyzed. The results show that sexual offending is a phenomenon that generates a lot of reactions and negative attitudes. The representations of the latter would also be organized under three dimensions : its cause and durability factors, its manifestations (acts, perpetrators and victims), as well as the responses to it. The results of this research open the door to new thoughts on the place and influence of attitudes in the social representation theory.

124	Facteurs spatio-temporels influençant les gaz à effet de serre en rivière tempérée	Carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous dioxide (N2O) are three of the main greenhouse gases (GHGs) that influence climate change (IPCC, 2014). Variability in the riverine concentrations of these three GHGs is often related to land use, within river features, and hydrologic regimes. However, few studies have looked at the interacting influence of these factors on the coupled dynamics of these gases across seasons. Here, we measured CO2, CH4, and N2O concentrations and fluxes along a 146.6 km stretch of the main stem of a north temperate river, with a change in geology resulting in a sharp shift in land use once per season for three consecutive years. Strong seasonal differences in gas concentrations were observed: CO2 and N2O were both higher overall during winter but were occasionally undersaturated, whereas summer had the highest concentrations of CH4. Sites of major confluence had the highest emissions, acting as vents. Concentrations were influenced by land use, with the highest concentrations of all gases found in the lower reaches where urban and agricultural activity are most intensive. However, spatial variability was minimized during periods of high flow when the river acted more like a pipe. This suggests that how major gases are coupled is largely a function of differential processes across seasons. Although land use influenced the spatial variability in concentrations along the river, seasonal changes in temperature influenced the relative importance of the gases, and hydrology mediated their overall concentrations and emissions.	hydrologie , carbon dioxide , methane , nitrous oxide , rivers , greenhouse gases , biogeochemistry , seasons , hydrology	en	25152.0
125	L’effet de la présence syndicale sur l’accès à des mesures de conciliation emploi-famille et leur efficacité perçue par les professionnel(le)s en ressources humaines	Even though workplaces have undergone several transformations in recent decades, employers are constantly looking for flexibility, which has particularly impacted employment status and working time. These changes had the effect of raising the issue of work/life balance (WLB) at the heart of discussions.  Although there has been progress in the labor market regarding WLB in recent years, some issues remain. The main one being the incompatibility between the professional and family spheres which can have negative repercussions.  This research will examine the effects of union presence on access to WLB measures and their perceived effectiveness by human resources professionals. This quantitative study is based on data collected by Émilie Genin and Mélanie Laroche, professors at the School of Industrial Relations of the University of Montreal between 2017 and 2018. The data was collected in partnership with the Ordre des conseillers en ressources humaines et relations industrielles agréés du Québec (CRHA). Our data is constituted by a sampling of 249 respondents. The research hypotheses were tested using data collected from human resources or industrial relations professionals, members of the Ordre des CRHA du Québec.  In this research, we sought to understand whether unionization has an effect on the number of WLB measures offered in the workplace and whether unionization has a moderating effect on the relationship between WLB measures and their perceived effectiveness. Our model allows us to make various findings. Research results show that unionization has no effect on the number of WLB measures offered in organizations. A positive relationship was also observed between the number of WLB measures and their perceived effectiveness by human resources professionals. Finally, our results show that unionization does not have a moderating relationship on the presence of WLB measures and their perceived effectiveness.  We aimed to contribute to the literature by focusing on the effect of union presence on access to WLB measures and their perceived effectiveness. While little research specifically examines these elements, our study allows for reflection on the impact of union presence on the WLB. This study also serves as a reference for all employers, unions and governments who wish to shed some light on the issue of WLB.

126	Le biais d’attribution d’intention hostile et les traits de la personnalité limite : une étude de potentiel relié aux évènements	This thesis examined cognitive processes underlying aggressive behaviour in a population with borderline personality traits (BPD), but not necessarily the diagnosis. The association between hostile attributional bias (HAB) and aggressive behaviour has been demonstrated in the literature, but this relationship has never been considered in people with BPD traits that show reactive aggressive behaviour. Our first aim was to conduct a methodological replication of the results of Gagnon and al. (2016) that used an event-related potential (ERP) method to evaluate HAB. The hostile expectancy violation paradigm elicits an N400 component, representing a negative-going ERP deflection when intention expectations are violated. The second aim was to verify the hypothesis that HAB would mediate the relationship between BPD traits and reactive aggressive behaviour. Sixty-three participants participated in the study.  The Personality Assessment Inventory-Borderline (PAI-BOR) was used to measure BPD traits and the Reactive-Proactive Aggression Questionnaire (RPQ) was used to measure their tendency to react in aggressive manner. The results confirmed the existing relationship between BPD traits and reactive aggression, and between HAB and reactive aggression. The expected N400 effect in the non-hostile condition measuring the violation of hostile expectations, on the relationship between BPD traits and reactive aggression was not found. Other studies are necessary before suggesting that treatment based on biased interpretations in social interaction is effective.

127	Le statut de personne peut-il être octroyé aux animaux non humains?	In a context where the recognition of legal rights to certain nonhuman entities appears to be an increasingly plausible legal development, this master’s thesis proposes an exploration of the philosophical and legal literature in favor of granting legal personhood to animals. First, I will provide a brief historical overview of the notion of “person.” I will also note that, while it has been strongly associated with moral autonomy in the history of law and philosophy, this definition of personhood suffers from substantial inconsistencies in justifying the granting of legal personhood to non-autonomous human beings. It is the case, for instance, of children, comatose human beings, the mentally disabled, and the elderly. We will also see that granting legal rights to these individuals while refusing to recognize these same rights to nonhuman animals is based on fragile theoretical foundations that need to be rectified with a thorough analysis of the theories of animal rights proposed since the 1970s. These theories, specifically the ones put forward by Peter Singer, Tom Regan, and Gary Francione, will be examined to identify their respective strengths and weaknesses. Finally, the final chapter of this research will examine the decisive role that appeals to moral rights can play in granting legal rights to animals. It also outlines the various forms of legal personhood and political status that might be attributed to nonhuman animals.

128	Autonomie et consentement éclairé à la participation aux biobanques : entre fondements philosophiques de l’éthique de la recherche et de l'éthique de la santé publique	This master's thesis attempts to answer the following question: what is the value of autonomy in biomedical research, and more particularly in the context of biobanks? To answer this question, we will study the concept of autonomy in two areas of applied ethics: research ethics and public health ethics. Since the second half of the 20th century, respect for individual autonomy has been a programmatic principle of research ethics. However, many authors consider this conceptualization to be too individualistic to respond to the challenges that characterize health research today. In public health ethics, on the contrary, individual autonomy takes a less preponderant role and acknowledges some socio-political dimensions of autonomy that have been neglected by the field of research ethics. These dimensions highlight the role of institutions in promoting autonomy as well as the need for individuals to have the opportunity to participate in the development of health policies in order to achieve their autonomy. Finally, the case study of biobanks will provide an opportunity to apply these different conceptualizations of autonomy to a rapidly expanding field of research located at the crossroads between research ethics and public health.	philosophy , biobanks , autonomy , research ethics , public health ethics , informed consent	en	25121.0
129	Théorie des émotions et émotions animales	Do animals have emotions? This question constitutes a sizable challenge for the philosophical theories of emotions, which already struggle to find consensus in a definition of human emotions. However, the evidence of emotional life in animals is undeniable. We believe that any successful theory of emotions must be able to account for the existence of animal emotions while respecting the criterion of intentionality of emotions. In this dissertation, we provide a brief overview of three approaches to the theory of emotions that hold that animals are capable of emotional experiences. First, we discuss the evolutionary approach (Darwin, Ekman and Plutchik) which centers its definition of emotion around its usefulness for the survival of the organism and defends the universalism of basic emotions. Next, we examine the somatic approach to emotions (James, Damasio and Prinz) which maintains that emotions are sensations and bodily changes. Finally, we observe the judgmental cognitivist theory (Solomon, Nussbaum) which considers that emotions are fundamentally evaluative judgments. As our investigation progresses, we apply the criteria of the various theories of emotions to non-human animals in order to highlight their potentially problematic elements. Finally, we evaluate the implications of the philosophical presuppositions of animal emotions in a practical aim in animal ethics.	philosophy , emotion , non-human animals	en	25119.0
130	"Dialogue et solidarité en démocratie : l
’éducation dialogique comme complément à la délibération politique"	Philosophy and dialogue are known to go hand in hand, while the relationship between dialogue and politics remains unclear. Using deliberation, a well-established type of discourse in our societies, as a comparative standpoint, this memoire will show how dialogue can be complementary to deliberation to form a proper democratic society. To get a wide enough conception of what dialogue means, we will explore how it pertains to identity, rationality, intersubjectivity, and education. A shift from an egocentric perspective, an authentic ear, and a critical open mindedness, being essential elements to dialogue, will help us to demonstrate how it can not only show a greater inclusiveness than deliberation can, but also respond in and of itself to crucial socio-political needs such as cooperation and solidarity. Education will be shown to be an excellent way to promote dialogue onto the political grounds, letting it then accomplish its purpose of facilitator for the establishment of a harmonious civic life. And to go even further, we propose that democratic education, if it is to accomplish its goals, must make use of dialogue.	dialogue , education , deliberation , solidarity , perspectives	en	25117.0
131	Utilisation de l’estimateur d’Agresti-Coull dans la construction d’intervalles de confiance bootstrap pour une proportion	A few bootstrap approaches exist to create confidence intervals. Some difficulties appear for the specific case of a proportion when the usual estimator, the proportion of success in a sample, is 0. In the classical case where the observations are independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) from a Bernoulli distribution, the bootstrap samples only contain zeros with probability 1 and the resulting bootstrap confidence intervals are degenerate at the value 0. We are facing the same problem in the survey sampling case when we apply the bootstrap method to a sample with all observations equal to 0. A possible solution is suggested by the estimator found in the confidence intervals of [Wilson, 1927] and [Agresti et Coull, 1998] where they use ˜p the proportion of success in a augmented sample consisting of adding two successes and two failures to the original sample. The proposed solution is to use the bootstrap method on ˆp but where the bootstrap is based on the augmented sample with two additional successes and failures, whether the sample comes from i.i.d. Bernoulli variables or from a simple random sample. Results show that a version of the percentile method is the most efficient bootstrap method to construct confidence intervals for a proportion both in the classical setting or in the case of a simple random sample. Our results also show that this percentile interval can compete with the best traditional methods.	bootstrap , pseudo-population , binomial proportion estimate , sampling , pseudo-population , bootstrap weights , bootstrap confidence interval	en	25111.0
132	On improving variational inference with low-variance multi-sample estimators	Advances in variational inference, such as variational autoencoders (VI) (Kingma and Welling (2013), Rezende et al. (2014)) along with its numerous modifications, have proven highly successful for learning latent representations of data. Importance-weighted variational inference (IWVI) by Burda et al. (2015) improves the variational inference by using multiple i.i.d. samples for obtaining tighter variational lower bounds. Recent works like hierarchical importance-weighted autoencoders (HIWVI) by Huang et al. (2019) and joint distribution modeling by Klys et al. (2018) demonstrate the idea of modeling a joint distribution over samples to further improve over IWVI by making it sample efficient. The underlying idea in this thesis is to connect the statistical properties of the estimators to the tightness of the variational bounds. Towards this, we first demonstrate an upper bound on the variational gap in terms of the variance of the estimators under certain conditions. We prove that the variational gap can be made to vanish at the rate of O(1/n) for a large family of VI approaches. Based on these results, we propose the approach of Conditional-IWVI (CIWVI), which explicitly models the sequential and conditional sampling of latent variables to perform importance-weighted variational inference, and a related approach of Antithetic-IWVI (AIWVI) by Klys et al. (2018). Our experiments on the benchmarking datasets MNIST (LeCun et al. (2010)) and OMNIGLOT (Lake et al. (2015)) demonstrate that our approaches perform either competitively or better than the baselines IWVI and HIWVI as the number of samples increases. Further, we also demonstrate that the results are in accordance with the theoretical properties we proved. In conclusion, our work provides a perspective on the rate of improvement in VI with the number of samples used and the utility of modeling the joint distribution over latent representations for sample efficiency in VI.

133	Leveraging deep reinforcement learning in the smart grid environment	While modern statistical learning is achieving impressive results, as computers start exceeding human baselines in some applications like computer vision, or even beating pro- fessional human players at strategy games without any prior knowledge, reliable deployed applications are still in their infancy compared to what these new opportunities could fathom. In this perspective, with a keen focus on sequential decision theory and recent statistical learning research, we demonstrate efficient application of such methods on instances involving the energy grid and the optimization of its actors, from energy storage and electric cars to smart buildings and thermal controls. We conclude by introducing a new hybrid approach combining the modern performance of deep learning and reinforcement learning with the proven application framework of operations research, in the objective of facilitating seamlessly the integration of new statistical learning-oriented methodologies in concrete applications.

134	La « Ludo-simulation » : étude de la simulation comme matière créative dans la construction d’un jeu de survie	This master thesis aims to study the survival game genre through the prism of the simulation.  Most of the computer games published today present atypical game structures with a tendency  to liberate the player from any prescribed constraint for the benefit of a more expressive play.  Minecraft (Mojang, 2010) is a prime example not explicitly offering “modalities of play” to the  player, confronting most of the more traditional ludic forms, like game or sport, in which  objectives are usually more convenient to determine. This tendency of games to develop complex  agencies without necessarily prescribing an associated “must do” is the basis of several ongoing  questions. Imposing a simulation perspective for the benefit of game studies makes possible to  answer several of these questions by focusing research attention on the broader “modalities of  doing” rather than on the prescriptions of uses which tend more and more to disappear.   The objective of this work is to reflect on the contributions of simulation in a corpus of six  survival games in order to study the crossing between game and simulation to understand how a  game perspective increases the creativity of a simulation which, in turn, increases the practicable  complexity of the game. In order to achieve this, we first develop the necessary theoretical  foundation to tackle the question of simulation. Then, an exposition of survival in games is offered  in chapter 2 in order to fully understand how the subject is modelled inside the medium. Our  methodological presentation in chapter 3 aims to develop a descriptive introduction of the results  and an interpretative analysis of the survival of the corpus in chapter 4. The objective of this work  is to advance two new concepts for video game studies: Ludic-simulation as a research posture  and the Videogame survivalist as a player posture. These two concepts are further defined in  chapters 1 and 2 and questioned in chapter 4.	ludic simulation , simulation , survival , video game , videogame survivalist	en	25091.0
135	Du son et de la musique à la concrétion sonore : structuration audio du conflit en jeu vidéo	This dissertation is the result of research in ludomusicology, game studies and cinema studies. It is an exploration of sound in the context of a conflict situation present in a video game. We apprehend the sound construction of the conflict situation, characterized by a fight between a playable character and an antagonist. We propose the following questions: how is sound constructed in a video game conflict situation? What does this construction bring to the player?  By studying the cinema and then animation, we consider sound in its audio-visual structure, linked to a moving image. It quickly appears that the sound in relation to the image has functions that allow the listener-spectator to apprehend, even amplify both the story and the emotions.  Through cognitivism, we then transpose these functions to video games, taking into account the paradigm of playability. By focusing on the player, we start from his listening attitudes to suggest the construction of a sound concretion, a set of sounds and music inherent to any audio-visual situation. It is no longer a question of separating sounds, music and noises, but rather of prioritizing them according to the player's needs, which are determined by the gaming situation. A case study allows us to explain the sound concretion.  Finally, we specify the stakes related to sound concretion in the context of the conflict situation. It appears through our research that sound, noises and music have functions that depend less on their structure than on the entire sound assembly. Many examples will present sound layers with multiple functions. Music and sound can be both an aid and a hindrance to playability. Production techniques (volume, spatialization, sound complexity) allow the player to prioritize the sound concretion to enjoy a better audio-visual experience.	video game , fighting , sound design , listening , audio-visual , sound functions , antagonist	en	25089.0
136	"L'importance de la Lumière et du ""laser spirituel"" dans l'enseignement du maître Omraam Mikhaël Aïvanhov (1900-1986)"	Disciple of Bulgarian Master Beinsa Douno (Peter Deunov) (1864-1944), Michaël Ivanoff (1900-1986) has been known under the name of Omraam Mikhaël Aïvanhov since 1960. Between 1938 and 1985, he taught a spiritual teaching on Light in France. This teaching was inspired by the Christian esoterism of the Johannist tradition, by Transcendentalism, Kabbalah, Zoroastrianism, Hinduism and Buddhism. When Mikhaël Ivanoff returned from India in 1960 after a one-year trip, he developed the concept of the spiritual laser, transferring by analogy the physician Theodore Maiman’s recent discovery into a practice of individual and collective meditation on the spiritual Light, which would have the aim of awakening the consciousness of human beings all around the world.  The present M. A. thesis studies the teachings on the spiritual Light, called Vidélina in Bulgarian, which were given by master Aïvanhov in the period 1938 to 1980, in the multireligious heritage where they come from. It also presents the practice of the spiritual laser that he created in 1962, through the review of his lectures and the participating observation of this practice from 1980 to 1995, then from 2011 to 2020 at three centers of the Universal White Brotherhood of this master. Finally this thesis draws the adequate conditions to ensure the continuity of this collective spiritual practice.

137	«En finir avec la géographie» : détournements ludiques de l’écriture du voyage dans Six degrés de liberté de Nicolas Dickner et Document 1 de François Blais	Influenced by travel and exploration stories, as well as the American and Quebec road narratives, the contemporary novels Six Degrees of Freedom by Nicolas Dickner and Document 1 by François Blais subvert travel writing by challenging its conventions and assumptions, while interrogating a stable understanding of space. These two novels feature unusual journeys: whether on board a refrigerated container or through the web, crossing vast territories or confined, Blais and Dickner’s protagonists transform the cartographic purpose of travel. As they rewrite codified travel narratives and take over a number of topoï and clichés, these two texts deploy singular cartographies, which mix invention and reality, geographical spaces and imaginary places. This thesis therefore intends to focus on the representation of space and travel in these two novels, with a particular attention to the way novelists play with their reader, for it is through a ludic irony that Document 1 and Six degrees of freedom observe and record today’s reality.

138	Azacyclopeptide synthesis and their neuroprotective activity against Aβ toxicity	Protein misfolding and aggregation are the fundamental causes of amyloid diseases. Deposits of proteins in the form of amyloid fibrils and plaques are the characteristic features of more than twenty degenerative conditions, including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and Huntington’s diseases. Synthetic cyclic D,L-α-peptide nanotubes can mimic the structural and biochemical properties of amyloid proteins. The introduction of aza-residues into cyclic D,L-α-peptides was studied to enhance intermolecular hydrogen bonding between stacked rings within the tube structures. The resulting cyclic aza-D,L-α-peptides were also expected to exhibit enhanced propensity to interact with the sheet structures of amyloid oligomers.  The lead peptide CP-2 features the sequence [l-J-w-H-s-K] in which lower and upper-case letters indicate D- and L-amino acids, respectively, square brackets designate a cyclic structure, and J denotes norleucine. There are no reports for introduction of aza-residues into cyclic D,L-α-peptides. Considering the potential for semicarbazides to enhance intermolecular hydrogen bonding, we performed an aza-glycine scan of the CP-2 sequence by preparing a focused library of azapeptides. All the cyclic aza-glycine peptides were tested for neuroprotective activity against amyloid using cell viability assay (MTT assay). The aza-glycine replacing D-serine i.e., [azaG2]-CP-2 (4) was found to be more potent than CP-2. This is the first example of introducing an aza-amino residue into a cyclic D, L-α-peptide, and these results could be extrapolated to other cyclic D, L-α-peptides of therapeutic interest.

139	The 3D-Transition study : objectives, methods, and implementation of an innovative planned missing data design	The prevalence of mental health problems represents a significant burden on school and community health resources as early as preschool. Reducing this burden requires a better understanding of the developmental mechanisms linking children’s early vulnerabilities with mental health after the transition to formal schooling. The 3D-Transition study (2017-2021; ClinicalTrials.org ID: NCT04873518) follows 939 participants from a pregnancy cohort in Québec (Canada) as they transition to kindergarten and first grade to examine these mechanisms. Biannual assessments include questionnaires from two parents as well as teachers, parent-child observations, anthropometric measurements, and age-sensitive cognitive assessments. Salivary cortisol is also collected on 11 days over a 16-month period in a subsample of 384 participants to examine possible changes in child salivary cortisol levels across the school transition, and their role in difficulties observed during the transition. A combination of planned missing data designs is implemented to reduce participant burden, where incomplete data is collected without introducing bias after the use of multiple imputation. The 3D-Transition study will contribute to an evidence-based developmental framework of child mental health from pregnancy to school age. In turn, this framework can help inform prevention programs delivered in health care settings during pregnancy, childcare centers, preschools, and schools.

141	Diagnosis and surgical management of cholecystolithiasis in two adult inland beardeddragons (pogona vitticeps)	Two male inland bearded dragons (Pogona vitticeps) of 5 and 6 yr of age were presented for anorexia with and without lethargy, respectively. In both cases, a firm, spherical, and mobile mass, measuring 2 cm in diameter, was palpated in the cranio-medial coelom. Radiographs were unremarkable. Ultrasonographic evaluation was highly suggestive of cholecystolithiasis. Coeliotomy confirmed the presence of a markedly enlarged gallbladder containing a cholecystolith in both cases, and cholecystectomies were performed. Both dragons resumed eating after 1–7 days and were doing well 3–6 months postoperatively. The gallbladder wall was unremarkable on histology, and the choleliths were composed of protein and calcium carbonate crystals. Cholecystolithiasis in bearded dragons has been the subject of very few case reports, probably due to its low occurrence. The lack of available data on the diagnosis and management may have led to this condition being underdiagnosed in this species. Ultrasonography was essential to the clinical diagnosis of cholecystolithiasis in our two cases and should be recommended as part of the diagnostic approach of bearded dragons with cranio-medial coelomic masses.

142	Posterior cortical atrophy : impact on daily living activities and exploration of a cognitive rehabilitation approach	Posterior cortical atrophy (PCA) is a neurodegenerative disease affecting the posterior region of the brain. Little is known about both the impact of PCA on functioning and how to support patients on a daily basis. The purpose of this study was to describe the functional profile of DD, a woman diagnosed with PCA, as well as to explore a pilot cognitive rehabilitation program designed to optimize functioning in daily living. The ADL Profile was used to assess the daily tasks that DD chose to undertake. Four operations, i.e. formulate a goal, plan, carry out and verify goal attainment, were scored for each task. Difficulties were observed during the execution of all tasks, as she struggled to find items or showed unsafe behaviors. Impairments were also seen in formulating a goal and planning, especially for less routine tasks. DD identified two tasks to be addressed in rehabilitation: setting the table and dealing cards. Learning was optimized using errorless learning and compensatory aids when setting the table, while dealing cards received no intervention. Only setting the table improved significantly with time. Further studies should be conducted to portray a wider functional profile of people living with PCA and develop effective rehabilitation programs.

143	More ‘Europe’, less Democracy? : European integration does not erode satisfaction with democracy	The process of European integration, through institutions such as the European Union, the Eurozone, or Schengen, implies a shift in political decision-making away from the national governments and towards international institutions. This gradual shift in the balance of power, furthermore, is increasingly debated by citizens. As a result, European integration might lead to an erosion of satisfaction with democracy in European countries. By means of a longitudinal analysis of the determinants of satisfaction with democracy in European countries, we test this expectation. We find no indication that the shift in the balance of power, and the trend towards more European integration indeed have eroded satisfaction with the functioning of (national) democracy.

144	Longitudinal associations between delinquency, depression and anxiety symptoms in adolescence : testing the moderating effect of sex and family socioeconomic status	Purpose To examine the cross-lagged associations between delinquency (nonviolent and violent), depression and anxiety symptoms in adolescence and to test the moderating effect of sex and family socioeconomic status (SES).  Methods Participants (n=1,515) were from a birth cohort in the Canadian province of Quebec. Autoregressive cross-lagged panel analyses were used to examine the associations between delinquency (nonviolent and violent), depression and anxiety symptoms from ages 15 to 17 years, while taking into account conduct and emotional problems at ages 10-12 years.  Results Findings suggest that delinquency (violent delinquency especially) and depression symptoms may develop according to a spiraling model, such that conduct problems in childhood give rise to depression symptoms in mid-adolescence, which in turn, contribute to more delinquent acts at the end of adolescence. Family SES, but not sex, had a moderating effect on the paths. We found that anxiety symptoms at age 15 years were associated with nonviolent delinquency at age 17 years when family SES was low, and that violent delinquency at age 15 years was associated with anxiety symptoms at age 17 years when family SES was high.  Conclusions Delinquency and emotional problems do not develop independently from each other; both dimensions should be examined simultaneously.

145	Inclusion of relatives in stroke rehabilitation : Perception of quality of services they received in the context of early supported discharged (ESD), in- and out-patient services	Background Relatives of stroke patients should be an integral part of the continuum of rehabilitation services.  Objective The objective was to describe their perception of the quality of the services they received in the context of early supported discharged (ESD), in- and out-patient rehabilitation services.  Methods Descriptive study using the Quality of Services Questionnaire for Relatives post-stroke (QSQR) completed online by relatives after the patient’s discharge. It consists of 22 statements with respect to three subscales: 1) the training/instructions, 2) the information provision and 3) the organizational process of the service offer. Space is allowed for free comments and two open-ended questions. Quantitative data were analyzed descriptively, and we used a content analysis for qualitative data.  Results One-third (30/90; 33.3%) of the sample are composed of relatives aged 55 and under, with a majority (81%) of women and 51.3% of spouses. The training/instructions and information provision were perceived positively with a mean % agreement at 85.0 ± 29.6 and 84.8 ± 22.4, respectively. The mean % agreement was 91.4 ± 17.8 for the organizational process subscale. A significantly higher score (p = 0,03; Kruskal Wallis test) was found for out-patient services (n = 20) as compared to ESD (n = 29) or in-patient rehabilitation (n = 41). Qualitatively, a lack of involvement of relatives was mentioned as well as a lack of personalized information about stroke and its consequences and provision of resources available. However, communication between professionals, their availability, and their professionalism were appreciated.  Conclusion Despite quantitative high scores, qualitative data allowed the identification of concrete avenues for improvement to truly and systematically include relatives in stroke rehabilitation.

146	Enhancing relationships between criminology and cybersecurity	‘Cybercrime’ is an umbrella concept used by criminologists to refer to traditional crimes that are enhanced via the use of networked technologies (i.e. cyber-enabled crimes) and newer forms of crime that would not exist without networked technologies (i.e. cyber-dependent crimes). Cybersecurity is similarly a very broad concept and diverse field of practice. For computer scientists, the term ‘cybersecurity’ typically refers to policies, processes and practices undertaken to protect data, networks and systems from unauthorised access. Cybersecurity is used in subnational, national and transnational contexts to capture an increasingly diverse array of threats. Increasingly, cybercrimes are presented as threats to cybersecurity, which explains why national security institutions are gradually becoming involved in cybercrime control and prevention activities. This paper argues that the fields of cyber-criminology and cybersecurity, which are segregated at the moment, are in much need of greater engagement and cross-fertilisation. We draw on concepts of ‘high’ and ‘low’ policing (Brodeur, 2010) to suggest it would be useful to consider ‘crime’ and ‘security’ on the same continuum. This continuum has cybercrime at one end and cybersecurity at the other, with crime being more the domain of ‘low’ policing while security, as conceptualised in the context of specific cybersecurity projects, falls under the responsibility of ‘high’ policing institutions. This unifying approach helps us to explore the fuzzy relationship between cyber-crime and cyber-security and to call for more fruitful alliances between cybercrime and cybersecurity researchers.

147	Assessment of library liaison programs	Session Format: Lighting talks by three librarians interspersed with facilitated small group breakout activities and discussion. Objective: This session aims to further the conversation about the evolving nature of liaison roles and duties. Through activities, attendees will explore differences in liaison roles and examine the evolution of the liaison librarian in health sciences libraries. Facilitated activities provide an opportunity to brainstorm and discuss what’s next for the role of the liaison librarian. Attendees will share information about ways to assess liaison duties and gain insights that further develop their familiarity with functional support models and other methods to support library users.Instructional  Methods: Lightning talks will present background information on three topics relevant to liaison models. The attendees will further explore these topics through inquiry-based learning activities. Using a participant-centered teaching approach, attendees will work collaboratively with information related to the lightning talk topic, summarize and categorize this information, arrive at questions based on their own experience that further elucidate the content, and then synthesize group findings by sharing back finding with all participants. Facilitators will float among the tables to provide guidance on all activities. Participant Engagement: Participants will be asked to respond to lightning talks through a combination of facilitated small group activities and discussion based on Liberating Structures activity plans. During the activities and discussion, participants will record notes and takeaways into a shared online document that will combine across all groups and will be shared with participants and broader MLA membership after the conference as a follow-up.

148	"Examining the impact of a social skills
training program on preschoolers’ social
behaviors : a cluster-randomized controlled
trial in child care centers"	Background Preschoolers regularly display disruptive behaviors in child care settings because they have not yet developed the social skills necessary to interact prosocially with others. Disruptive behaviors interfere with daily routines and can lead to conflict with peers and educators. We investigated the impact of a social skills training program led by childcare educators on children’s social behaviors and tested whether the impact varied according to the child’s sex and family socio-economic status.  Methods Nineteen public Child Care Centers (CCC, n = 361 children) located in low socio-economic neighborhoods of Montreal, Canada, were randomized into one of two conditions: 1) intervention (n = 10 CCC; 185 children) or 2) wait list control (n = 9 CCC; 176 children). Educators rated children’s behaviors (i.e., disruptive and prosocial behaviors) before and after the intervention. Hierarchical linear mixed models were used to account for the nested structure of the data.  Results At pre-intervention, no differences in disruptive and prosocial behaviors were observed between the experimental conditions. At post-intervention, we found a significant sex by intervention interaction (β intervention by sex = − 1.19, p = 0.04) indicating that girls in the intervention condition exhibited lower levels of disruptive behaviors compared to girls in the control condition (f2 effect size = − 0.15). There was no effect of the intervention for boys.  Conclusions Girls may benefit more than boys from social skills training offered in the child care context. Studies with larger sample sizes and greater intervention intensity are needed to confirm the results.

149	Identité et bien-être des adultes latino-américains en couple immigrants au Canada	During immigration, individuals are asked to come into contact with the new society and the relationship between the identity of the culture of origin and that of the host culture would be decisive for the well-being of the individual. Developing coherence between the two cultures, i.e. giving them equal importance, is associated with high well-being. However, despite the importance of the phenomenon of identity integration, research on this subject has considered it exclusively as a consequence of the relationship between the individual and the culture, without ever taking into account that individuals often immigrate as a couple. The present research aimed to assess the relationship between the integration of cultural identities, the integration of the identity of the partner in the self and well-being among 239 Latin American individuals in a couple relationship and who have immigrated to Canada. More specifically, this research aimed to determine whether the integration of the identity of the partner into the self can have an impact on the well-being of individuals in a couple when they integrate their cultural identities. The data obtained with two different scales of identity integration (MULTIIS and IOS) revealed that the more an individual integrates their cultural identities, the more they will integrate the identity of their partner in the self, which will lead them to feel more well-being. More specifically, this study demonstrated that the integration of cultural identities promotes the integration of the partner's identity into the self which, in turn, will have a positive impact on well-being.

150	La place du bonheur dans la doctrine de la vertu	The reader of the Critique of Practical Reason is often puzzled by Kant’s claim in the Analytic that happiness must not play any role in the motivation to act according to the moral law, whereas the Dialectic unexpectedly reintroduces the topic of happiness as a reasonable expectation from the part of the virtuous moral subject. In fact, both Fichte and Schopenhauer had reservations about this move. In this paper I argue that the three explanations usually provided in order to make sense of the hope for happiness are questionable: 1) the ontological dualism (intelligible/sensible), 2) Kant’s religious prejudice (F. Schroeter), and 3) a concession made by Kant to the weakness of human nature (L. W. Beck). I give another explanation, based on Kant’s conception of practical reason.

152	Contribution of a reflective debriefing to nursing students' clinical judgment in patient deterioration simulations : a mixed-methods study	Background While reflection is a hallmark of debriefing, there is little understanding of how it contributes to nursing students' clinical judgment.  Objectives The aim of this study was to describe how nursing students perceived that the Reflective dEbriefing after a PatieNt Deterioration simulation (REsPoND) fostered learning and how it contributed to their clinical judgment in patient deterioration simulations.  Design A sequential explanatory mixed-methods study.  Participants Nineteen students who showed the greatest clinical judgment score variation in a randomized controlled trial of the effectiveness of REsPoND.  Methods Students participated in interviews on their learning experience in REsPoND. Data were subjected to thematic analysis and themes were contrasted according to students' score variations.  Results Through guided exchanges with their peers, students configured a causes–observations–interventions framework that embodied their understanding of the patient's situation. They evaluated their own simulation performance based on that framework. The contribution of REsPoND to students' clinical judgment differed depending on (1) the value placed on the review of the simulation through a systematic assessment approach; (2) their focus on anticipating the situation or on performing in the simulation; and (3) their preference for who participated more in debriefing.  Conclusion Clinical judgment might be improved when a systematic assessment approach is used to structure debriefing. The relationship between reflection and self-assessment during debriefing remains to be disentangled.

153	Postoperative administration of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, donepezil, interferes with bone healing and implant osseointegration in a rat model	Donepezil is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor commonly used to treat mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease. Its use has been associated with increased bone mass in humans and animals. However, the effect of postoperative administration of donepezil on bone healing remains unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the impact of postoperative injection of donepezil on bone healing, titanium-implant osseointegration, and soft tissue healing. Twenty-two Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to receive a daily dose of either donepezil (0.6 mg/kg) or saline as a control. In each rat, a uni-cortical defect was created in the right tibia metaphysis and a custom-made titanium implant was placed in the left tibiae. After two weeks, rats were euthanized, and their bones were analysed by Micro-CT and histology. The healing of bone defect and implant osseointegration in the rats treated with donepezil were significantly reduced compared to the saline-treated rats. Histomorphometric analysis showed lower immune cell infiltration in bone defects treated with donepezil compared to the saline-treated defects. On the other hand, the healing time of soft tissue wounds was significantly shorter in donepezil-treated rats compared to the controls. In conclusion, short-term administration of donepezil hinders bone healing whereas enhancing soft tissue healing.

154	Culture, gender and development in Sub-Saharan Africa	This dissertation investigates the deep roots of differences in gender roles and development across societies in Sub-Saharan Africa. Chapter 1 examines the deep origins of differences in gender roles in Africa. I test empirically Engels (1884) hypothesis, that the origin of differences in gender roles in Africa was the historical domestication of cattle. To address potential endogeneity in historical cattle adoption, I adopt an instrumental variables approach that leverages geo-climatic factors affecting the suitability of lands for cattle-raising. I find empirical support for Engels (1884) hypothesis. Further, the results show that these differences in gender roles have persisted to present day. In chapter 2, which is co-authored with Raphael Godefroy and Joshua Lewis, we study the short- and long-run consequences of the 1890s African Rinderpest Epizoodic. We adopt a difference-in-differences strategy that combines differences across ethnic homelands in cattle-suitability with contemporaneous local drought conditions to identify ethnic groups that were more or less exposed to the outbreak. We find that the societies exposed to rinderpest experienced relative decreases in cattle-ownership in the decades after the outbreak. We uncover large relative long-run decreases in wealth among descendants of affected ethnic groups. These persistent economic losses appear to be partially driven by distressed migration. In chapter 3, I investigate how sibling gender composition affects women’s transition to first marriage in sub-Saharan Africa. To address potential endogeneity in the final sibling gender composition, I exploit the random assignment of the second child’s gender in household with at least two children. I find that female with a younger sister get married younger, with negative consequences for her education and literacy. The effects are stronger within countries that traditionally pay bride price at marriage.

155	Essays in empirical finance	"This thesis has three chapters in which I study transaction costs, anomalies and shadow banking activities.   In the first chapter (co-authored with René Garcia) a novel way of estimating transaction costs is proposed. Transaction costs have declined over time but they can increase considerably when funding liquidity becomes scarce, investors' fears spike or other frictions limit arbitrage. We estimate bid-ask spreads of thousands of firms at a daily frequency and put forward these large movements for several of these episodes in the last 30 years. The transaction cost of three-quarters of the firms is significantly impacted by funding liquidity and increases on average by 24%. While small firms and high volatility firms have larger transaction costs, the relative increase in transaction costs in crisis times is more pronounced in large firms and low-volatility firms. The gap between the respective transaction costs of these high- and low-quality groups also increases when financial conditions deteriorate, which provides evidence of flight to quality. We build anomaly-based long-short portfolios and estimate their alphas adjusted for rebalancing costs based on our security-level transaction cost estimates to show that all strategies are either unprofitable or lose money, except for price per share and industry momentum.  In the second chapter I study how the popularity of anomalies in peer-reviewed finance journals can influence the returns on these anomalies. I use the tone of the abstract of the publication in which an anomaly is discussed and the impact factor of the journal in which this publication appears to forecast the post-publication return of strategies based on the anomaly. The main finding is the following: when an anomaly is discussed in a positive tone publication that appears in a journal with an impact factor higher than 3 (Journal of Finance, Journal of Financial Economics, Review of Financial Studies), this anomaly is more likely to attract investors that are going to arbitrage away the mispricing.  The third chapter (co-authored with Vasia Panousi) proposes a measure of the shadow banking activity of firms operating in the financial industry in the United States. For this purpose we use textual data analysis by extracting information from annual and quarterly reports of firms. We find that the shadow banking activity was higher for the “Depository Institutions"", “Non depository Institutions"" and the “Real estate"" before 2008. But after 2008, the shadow banking activity dropped considerably for all the financial companies except for the “Non depository Institutions"". Our shadow banking index satisfies some economic facts about the shadow banking, especially the fact that contractionary monetary policies contribute to expand shadow banking. We also show with our index that, when the shadow banking activity of the 100 biggest banks increases, the delinquency rates on the loans that these banks give also increases. The opposite is observed with the traditional banking index: an increase of the traditional banking activity of the 100 biggest banks decreases the delinquency rate."

It contains a proline rich region (PRR) which allows it to bind the SH3 domain of endophilin and other SH3 domain-containing proteins involved in Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME). CME is an important regulatory mechanism for growth factor receptor activity. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is actively internalized in Clathrin-coated vesicles after activation. This endocytosis is facilitated by a protein complex formed by CBL, CIN85 and Endophilin. ITCH is known to ubiquitinate both CBL and endophilin, providing a potential functional link between the ligase and receptor internalization. In order to determine the role of ITCH in this process, several experiments were performed. First, the mapping of molecular binding sites between the ligase ITCH and SH3 domain proteins has been studied in detail. A series of mutations in the PRR region of ITCH helped us identify three arginine residues (R252, R255, R258) as necessary for its interaction with endophilin and all the tested SH3-domain containing proteins. Secondly, HeLa and Cos7 cell lines were genetically modified by CRISPR to prevent ITCH expression. These knockout cell lines were characterized for use in an EGFR endocytosis assay and for mass spectrometry analysis. EGFR internalization was monitored by confocal microscopy using fluorescent EGF ligand in both ITCH-/- cell types. In the absence of ITCH, a significant decrease in the level of internalized EGF compared to parental cells is visible. Overexpression of WT ITCH in the knockout cells restores normal internalization of EGF, confirming the involvement of ITCH in the process. Overexpression of Endophilin-binding defective or catalytically inactive ITCH does not restore the internalization of EGF in ITCH-/- cells. These results show that the ITCH- Endophilin interaction as well as the catalytic function of ITCH are necessary for the endocytosis of EGFR. In addition, ITCH-/- cells show a delay in the degradation of phosphorylated EGFR accompanied with an extended period of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation. In a last set of experiments, we explored the influence of the absence of ITCH on its substrates and molecular partners. We performed a proteomic comparison of ITCH-binding partners and potential substrates using the ITCH-/- and WT cell lysates. The results showed that the lack of ITCH expression alters the peptide count of proteins mainly related to EGFR signaling, theubiquitin-dependent proteolytic pathway and cell adhesion. This study shows for the first time that the protein ITCH is required for the clathrin-dependent endocytosis of EGFR.

157	Quand et comment exercer son autorité comme parent : le rôle socialisateur du lien problème-contrainte et du domaine social	Experimental studies focusing on the socialization role of parental authority exertion in persistent rule-breaking contexts involving non-personal issues have recently shown the advantages of using logical consequences over alternative strategies (mild punishments, reasoning and no-authority). Using an experimental vignette approach and a sample of 214 adolescents (Mage = 15.28 years), the present study extended these findings by comparing the same parental interventions in a hypothetical rule-breaking setting involving a multifaceted issue. Specifically, and based on research anchored in social domain theory, we evaluated how adolescents’ perceptions of the issue underlying the multifaceted transgression (personal vs. non-personal) moderated their beliefs regarding authority exertion strategies. When adolescents perceived the transgression as a non-personal issue, past results were replicated and enhanced. Adolescents perceived the logical consequence as at least as effective as the mild punishment to prevent future transgressions (i.e., more so than reasoning and no-authority) and as the most acceptable strategy. Furthermore, contrary to the mild punishment, they did not perceive the logical consequence as more autonomy-thwarting than reasoning. In contrast, adolescents who categorized the transgression as a personal matter rated the logical consequence less favorably, leaving reasoning as a preferred form of intervention. Implications for optimal parenting are discussed.	authority exertion , logical consequences , mild punishments , parenting , social domain theory	en	24825.0
158	Conduite automobile risquée et cannabis : rôle de la fréquence de consommation et effet du soutien parental de l'autonomie	Although driving a vehicle is one common activity, road accidents are one of the top ten causes of death in the world. In recent years, a decrease of on road deaths in Canada and Quebec have shown that road safety prevention campaigns can be effective. However, these advances are insufficient, and there is a need for better intervention and prevention strategies. A better knowledge of individuals likely to be involved in road accidents would allow the development of more targeted and relevant prevention campaigns. Thus, it is already known that men, individuals aged between 15 and 29, and users of alcohol or psychoactive substances before driving have an increased risk of being involved in a road accident. Therefore, one of the objectives of this thesis is to have a better understanding of the role of frequency of cannabis use in young males’ risky driving. Also, studies have already examined the role of parents in the road behaviors of their children. However, no study seems to have focused on the role of parental autonomy support in young drivers’ risky driving. The second objective of this thesis is to investigate the impact of parental autonomy support on risky driving among young cannabis users.  In this line of thinking, Article 1 investigates the association between frequency of cannabis use and self-reported risky driving among a sample of male drivers aged between 18 and 25 years old. In addition, it evaluates the role of parental autonomy support in self-reported risky driving. Results indicate that frequency of cannabis use is positively associated with risky driving (measured with self-reported measure of driving under the influence of cannabis), and is a predictor of this measure. However, results did not show that parental autonomy support is a predictor of self-reported risky driving.  Article 2 studies risky driving through behavioral measures. These behavioral measures are observed in a driving simulator. Results of this article reveal a contribution of frequency of cannabis use in predicting observed risky driving in a driving simulator. In addition, results indicate a significant effect of the frequency of use levels on risky driving behaviors observed in the simulated driving task. Finally, results show a contribution of parental autonomy support in observed risky driving in the simulator.  The theoretical contributions of this thesis to the scientific literature on road safety, as well as its practical implications for prevention and intervention are discussed.

159	Multi-player games in the era of machine learning	Among all the historical board games played by humans, the game of go was considered one of the most difficult to master by a computer program [Van Den Heriket al., 2002]; Until it was not [Silver et al., 2016]. This odds-breaking break-through [Müller, 2002, Van Den Herik et al., 2002] came from a sophisticated combination of Monte Carlo tree search and machine learning techniques to evaluate positions, shedding light upon the high potential of machine learning to solve games. Adversarial training, a special case of multiobjective optimization, is an increasingly useful tool in machine learning. For example, two-player zero-sum games are important for generative modeling (GANs) [Goodfellow et al., 2014] and mastering games like Go or Poker via self-play [Silver et al., 2017, Brown and Sandholm,2017]. A classic result in Game Theory states that convex-concave games always have an equilibrium [Neumann, 1928]. Surprisingly, machine learning practitioners successfully train a single pair of neural networks whose objective is a nonconvex-nonconcave minimax problem while for such a payoff function, the existence of a Nash equilibrium is not guaranteed in general. This work is an attempt to put learning in games on a firm theoretical foundation. The first contribution explores minimax theorems for a particular class of nonconvex-nonconcave games that encompasses generative adversarial networks. The proposed result is an approximate minimax theorem for two-player zero-sum games played with neural networks, including WGAN, StarCrat II, and Blotto game. Our findings rely on the fact that despite being nonconcave-nonconvex with respect to the neural networks parameters, the payoff of these games are concave-convex with respect to the actual functions (or distributions) parametrized by these neural networks. The second and third contributions study the optimization of minimax problems, and more generally, variational inequalities in the context of machine learning. While the standard gradient descent-ascent method fails to converge to the Nash equilibrium of simple convex-concave games, there exist ways to use gradients to obtain methods that converge. We investigate several techniques such as extrapolation, averaging and negative momentum. We explore these techniques experimentally by proposing a state-of-the-art (at the time of publication) optimizer for GANs called ExtraAdam. We also prove new convergence results for Extrapolation from the past, originally proposed by Popov [1980], as well as for gradient method with negative momentum. The fourth contribution provides an empirical study of the practical landscape of GANs. In the second and third contributions, we diagnose that the gradient method breaks when the game’s vector field is highly rotational. However, such a situation may describe a worst-case that does not occur in practice. We provide new visualization tools in order to exhibit rotations in practical GAN landscapes. In this contribution, we show empirically that the training of GANs exhibits significant rotations around Local Stable Stationary Points (LSSP), and we provide empirical evidence that GAN training converges to a stable stationary point, which is a saddle point for the generator loss, not a minimum, while still achieving excellent performance.

More specifically, through a close reading of selected texts, this thesis explores how Indigenous literatures are deeply embodied, situated, and relational places of knowledge and, as such, they convey the possibilities of language through their literary interventions. Thus, I argue that contemporary Indigenous literatures enable the creation of critical theories of language, in which body, language, and land (both physical and metaphysical) are intimately connected; language, and its conceptualization by women writers, enables a web of relations through writing that presents this interconnectedness between the sensible and spiritual worlds, and between human and other-than-human beings. Building on Indigenous epistemologies (Kovach, Wilson, Ermine, Bazile, Sioui, Simpson, Bacon, Vizenor), this thesis argues that through poetic and narrative imagination, which differs from a return to the linguistic structures of Indigenous languages, the creative writers explored in this dissertation are reclaiming epistemologies and creating theories of language by putting them at the forefront of their literary practices.

161	Conflit et complicité : la communauté des femmes chez Clarice Lispector	"If there are two words that still call us, summon us, make us dream and at the same time resist in many ways to deliver their ""truth"", they are community and woman. This thesis strives to bring them closer, to keep them in proximity in referring to the writings of Clarice Lispector. Since the work of the Brazilian writer, composed largely of female characters and narrators, often features women's face-to-face, we examine how these encounters reflect a possible community of women. However, as announced in the title of this study, the community of women in question in Lispector's work is one that exists sporadically oscillating between conflict and complicity. In an attempt to give form and vocabulary to such a community of women, we go through the main theories of the community, especially those developed by Jean-Luc Nancy, Maurice Blanchot, Jacques Derrida and Roland Barthes as well as some theories of feminism. Then we explore concepts that ""provoke"" the emergence of the community of women as repetition, rhythm, inspiration and gift. Ultimately, this summary could have had only one sentence, one sentence that sums up the whole thesis: the community of women without community or not a community like the others."

162	Application de la stratégie de séparation de phase à la synthèse de macrocycles complexes et développement d’une réaction de thioalcynylation pour la synthèse de macrocycles sulfurés	Macrocyclization reactions can be problematic due to poor selectivity of cyclization versus oligomerization. As such, difficult purification of complex mixtures and/or the use of complex and cumbersome experimental setups are often necessary. The drawbacks can complicate synthetic pathways and deter chemists from exploring the unique chemical space of macrocycles. Our group has developed a new macrocyclization strategy called phase separation strategy, a protocol enabling one-pot macrocyclization reactions at much higher concentration. In the present thesis, the challenges associated with macrocyclization reactions are tackled by the development and the application of new strategies. First, the phase separation strategy protocol was used to synthesize the backbone of complex macrocycles like the natural product ivorenolide A (Chapter 4) and the antiviral vaniprevir (Chapter 6). With the use of the phase separation strategy protocol, macrocyclization reactions were performed at concentrations 120 times higher than traditional protocols while maintaining a high level of macrocyclization selectivity. Second, the development of a new copper-catalyzed synthesis of alkynyl sulfides for the synthesis of a macrocyclic peptide library is described (Chapter 8). The macrocyclic peptides were also tagged with several biomarkers by diversification of the resulting alkynyl sulfide motif. Finally, the scope of the intermolecular copper-catalyzed reaction was explored (Chapter 9). Using the method, bis-heteroatom substituted alkynes were synthesized and modification of unprotected cysteine sidechains was possible. Furthermore, the mechanistic reaction pathway of the new alkynyl sulfide synthesis was studied experimentally and computationally.

163	Méthodes de synthèse de quinoléines et d’indoles polysubstitués : «la chimie traditionnelle modernisée»	The heterocycle chemistry is one of the most important fields in organic chemistry. Indeed, 65% of the literature in organic chemistry is about heterocycles. They are widely present in nature, essential to life and their applications are endless. Among them, the so-called privileged structures, attract particular attention. Privileged structures, of which quinolines and indoles are a part, play a crucial role in medicinal chemistry, for the production of libraries of therapeutic targets. Therefore, the development of new synthetic methods, simple, efficient and sensitive to environmental impact remains a challenge for chemists. Many synthetic methods require the use of o-acylated anilines, but these substrates are not easily available. The copper catalyzed addition reaction of a Grignard reagent on methyl anthranilate allows to form an o-acylated aniline, never reported before, with a quantitative yield. The latter will then serve as starting material for the synthesis of several privileged heterocycles including quinolines and indoles. The Friedlander reaction has been used for several centuries but suffers from the use of extreme reaction conditions which are harmful to the environment. It has therefore been modernized to give access to a series of eight trisubstituted quinolines, without solvent, strong acid or high temperatures. Furthermore, Heumann's process consists of the synthesis of indoles substituted in position by o-acylated anilines alkylation, followed by saponification and intramolecular cyclization steps. Patented by B.A.S.F. in 1895, this process quickly became obsolete due to low yields and difficult reaction conditions. Continuous flow chemistry has resurrected this process through the development of a more efficient and safer protocol. All in all, the work presented in this thesis contributes to the development of simple, effective methodologies, sensitive to environmental issues and leading to increasingly complex structures.

164	Comment raconter des histoires lithiques dans les labours de La Martre (Québec, Canada)	This thesis binds various lithic remains fragmented and scattered by decades of plowing at La Martre (Gaspé Peninsula, Quebec, Canada). Plowing creates a specific type of archaeological palimpsest. It erases units allowing for: the comparison of lithic practices contained within each biface and flake that make up a context; the chronological control of said units; and using various methods and theories according to an archaeological unit’s appropriate scale. A maximum chronological boundary following the deglaciation of the northern Gaspé Peninsula, the exposure of La Martre’s higher terraces by the receding sea, and the production of Plano projectile points (dated to between 11 600 and 9000 cal BP in northeastern America) provide archaeologists with some chronological control that floats within La Martre’s hundreds of thousands of lithic remains. Yet, it is argued that plowing cannot preclude archaeologists from telling lithic and other stories, provided that some practices and habits are changed. Indeed, plowing points to theoretical, epistemological and methodological problems that elsewhere may have remained invisible. These problems pertain to the bifurcation of reality inhibiting its development by laying down a ready- made and unchanging reality prior to any engagement with it. Plowing requires for this specific engagement with reality to be turned upside down, starting from a moving and dispersed reality that a consciousness perceives and thinks with. Telling lithic stories at La Martre requires that this turn be extended by following its movements: that of a conscience, of knapping and of plowing; thus telling new stories that a bifurcated relationship to reality had inhibited. It is suggested here that this turn be extended using description along fifteen dispersion surfaces: (i.) two plowed terraces, stations 15 and 16; (ii.) shaped blanks; (iii.) chaînes opératoires; (iv.) a sample of 447 shaped blanks; (v.) a reduction continuum; (vi.) shaped blank integrity; (vii.) skill; (viii.) raw material; (ix.) knapping objectives; (x.) technical groups; (xi.) lithic fluxes; (xii.) skill combinatorics; (xiii.) possible evolutions; (xiv.) places; (xv.) production sequences. Such surfaces allow for several things: first, for knapping diversification rather than refining; second, for changing the condition of use of the chaîne opératoire or the reduction sequence; third, for starting from movement and relationships rather than defined groups or individuals; fourth, for differentiating La Martre’s plowed terraces; fifth, for delimiting a place, 16-West, structured by the sociocultural dynamics of learning and distinction; sixth, for growing several production sequences; seventh, for reconnecting La Martre to the northeastern Paleoindian landscape and multiplying its lithic and archaeological stories; and eighth, for working within the “in between” places, landscapes and shapes that grow from such stories. Thus, telling lithic stories within La Martre’s plowed fields is a fourfold narrative: (i.) exploring how past people engaged with their landscape through knapping; (ii.) deconstructing conditions allowing for such an exploration; (iii.) creating new conditions allowing for new stories to be told; and (iv.) telling these new stories.

165	Program evaluation of a community organization offering supported employment services for adults with autism	Background Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have an employment rate well below the general population. One potential solution to address this issue is the implementation of supported employment services. The purpose of our study was to evaluate a Canadian community supported employment program designed for individuals with ASD without an intellectual disability.  Method Thirty-seven individuals with ASD, who were receiving services from a local community agency (Action main-d’oeuvre) providing supported employment services, participated in the study. The research team monitored the characteristics of the participants, the number of hours of services provided, and outcome measures related to employment. We then conducted descriptive analyses, t-tests, and Wilcoxon signed rank tests to compare anxiety about work and self-efficacy before services and after outcomes of the program.  Results Despite high levels of comorbid mental health issues, our results indicated that 62.1 % of individuals obtained paid employment within 12 months. Furthermore, participants with post-secondary education found jobs related to their degree or requiring specialized skills. Participants felt less anxious and more self-efficacious towards employment. Maintaining employment was a greater challenge and continuing support may be required.  Conclusions The study suggests that the employment services may have supported the participants in finding a job. However, collaboration is essential to address mental health issues in job seekers with ASD, which appeared to hinder job search and maintenance.

166	Entre respect de l’intégrité des sources et volonté de création : le cinéma de Péter Forgács	"This article intends to address the creative uses of visual archives in connection with the representation of the Holocaust. It’s based on a comparison between the use of one 1944 shot in two cinematic essay Meanwhile somewhere. 1940-1943 (Péter Forgács, 1994) and Respite (Harun Farocki, 2007). The author demonstrates the relevance to think about reuse in terms of ""dispositif"" created during the editing process. This is a way to deal with archives without addressing only the questions of archives misuses, archives refusal or archives fetishism. In this perspective, the creative gestures dealing with the materiality of the document are understood as mediating resources to deal with past, present and future of the visual archives."

167	Développement de méthodes bio-informatiques pour la découverte de variants codants et non codants dans le cadre des traits sanguins	Cardiovascular health, immune function, hemostasis and the response to other illnesses depend on the abundance and specific features of blood cells. Over the years, a considerable effort has been made to find which genetic variants, genes and regulatory mechanisms are involved in the creation of these cells.  The inactivation of an allele, called a loss-of-function (LoF), is a type of coding variant we would like to associate with blood phenotypes. For obvious ethical reasons, these mutations cannot be artificially induced in human, so we fall back on natural occurrences and hope that large cohorts will provide enough samples to find statistically significant associations.  The inactivation of both alleles, called a knockout (KO), may have stronger consequences than a simple loss-of-function. We also hope to find naturally occurring knockouts thanks to the size of a large cohort. The combination of two different LoF variants is called a compound heterozygote knockout.  We are also interested in non-coding variants that affect the expression of genes that are involved in hematopoiesis. Some of these variants create or disrupt the binding sites of transcription factors (TF), the proteins that bind to specific DNA sequences and regulate gene expression. Transcription factors binding sites (TFBS) are found in gene promoters and cell type specific enhancers.  While some of these mutations can be benign or even beneficial, the presence of a LoF or KO may be too detrimental for the individual to survive. The results of this study are limited by survival bias.  Compared to a genome-wide association study, this study focuses on a smaller number of genetic variants to increase statistical power and give an interpretation to the statistically significant findings.  The Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) program collects and ensures the quality of the 45,000 whole-genome sequences we used in this study, as well as the corresponding complete blood counts. Thanks to this raw data, we were able to find several known and novel associations between rare variants and blood phenotypes.

168	Analyzing KDM4A protein interaction network using proximity-dependent biotin identification assay	This study was designed to identify potential interacting proteins of Lysine-specific demethylase 4A (KDM4A) in the context of cancer using proximity-dependent biotin identification 2 (BioID2) assay. KDM4A is a lysine demethylase and an epigenetic regulator that plays a role in carcinogenesis by promoting proliferation. Herein, we sought out to identify the protein interactome of KDM4A in cervical cancer cell line HeLa. These protein interactions were characterized by their dependency on KDM4A’s catalytic activity and/or Tandem Tudor domain. It succeeded at detecting novel interactors of KDM4A as well as previously studied interactions, such as FBXO22. KDM4A seems to be interacting with some members of the pBAF chromatin remodeling complex, specifically, ARID2, BRD7, and SMARCA2. The pBAF complex facilitates or prevents accessibility to DNA by restructuring the nucleosome. Further analysis is required to validate whether the KDM4A-pBAF complex interaction is direct or indirect. This study also implied the importance of the Tandem Tudor domain in KDM4A’s role in the double stranded break repair. Finally, we also propose the potential involvement of KDM4A in mRNA splicing and organic anion transport. This study provides new insights into KDM4A’s role in cancer development.

169	Volumetric velopharyngeal space modifications in patients with and without cleft palate undergoing Le Fort 1 maxillary advancement	Background & Purpose: The effects of maxillary advancement (MA) on velopharyngeal anatomy have primarily been studied using lateral cephalometric radiographs. However, with recent advances in orthognathic surgery, there is an increased need for more detailed and precise imaging such as computerized tomographic (CT) scan reconstructions, to help in surgical planning and to measure outcomes. The purpose of this study is to compare the pre-and post-operative velopharyngeal space configuration modifications as measured on CT scans. The aim is also to assess differences in these airway measures between patients with and without history of prior repaired cleft palate (CP).   Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study of 44 patients with and without CP who were treated with MA for midface hypoplasia and secondary malocclusion at skeletal maturity. The pre-and post-operative CT scans were compared with respect to pre-established landmarks. Linear distances, cross-sectional areas, and volumes were measured using 3-dimensional (3D) CT scan reconstructions.   Results: For the linear distances measured, a statistically significant difference was found when comparing the pre-and post-operative measures of the narrowest part of the nasopharynx and the narrowest part of the retropalatal airway space (25.1 vs 28.5 mm p=0.001 and 6.5 vs 7.6 mm p=0.026, respectively). Retropalatal cross-sectional areas, nasopharyngeal cross-sectional areas and the volumetric assessment of the nasopharyngeal space showed no statistically significant differences when comparing pre-and post-operative scans (p>0.05). The main effect of palatal repair (CP vs. Non-CP) showed that there was only a statistically significant difference for the measures of the narrowest part of the nasopharynx and the nasopharyngeal cross-sectional area (p=0.045 and p=0.04, respectively). Mean changes in the measures did not differ over time (pre-and post-op) depending on whether there was prior history of CP repair.  Conclusion: Our results support the hypothesis that although structural modifications of the pharyngeal space are inherent to MA in patients with CP, its surface area and volume do not change significantly. These changes are also independent of history of previous CP repair.

170	Comparison of vitrification protocols in immature equine oocytes	Oocyte cryopreservation would facilitate the conservation of female genetic material and allow more flexibility in the application of assisted reproductive techniques in domestic animals and endangered species. The overall success rate of this technique in the horse is low compared with other species. Therefore, further research is required to elucidate the species-specific mechanisms responsible for poor survivability following vitrification. This study aimed to evaluate the effect on maturation rate, cleavage and blastocyst development of vitrified immature equine oocytes, using a three-step vitrification protocol with ethylene glycol (EG) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO); and comparing the effect of media without freezing. The vitrification protocol was designed based on the results of preliminary experiments. Oocytes were recovered from immature follicles of live mares. Oocytes were held overnight at room temperature (14-24 hrs) in a holding medium. Oocytes were then denuded and placed in a base solution (BS) composed of 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS) + M199/Hanks’ salts. Oocytes were randomly allotted to control, vitrification, and cryoprotectant agents (CPAs)-exposed groups. Control oocytes were cultured directly for in-vitro maturation (IVM). Three oocytes were exposed to a three-step vitrification protocol composed of a pre-vitrification solution (PVS) 1 (5% EG/ 5% DMSO); PVS 2 (10% EG/ 10% DMSO) during 40s each; and finally vitrification solution (VS) (17.5% EG/ 17.5% DMSO/ 3 M sucrose), during 10s. All media were diluted in M199/Hanks’ salts + 20% FBS. Oocytes were then transferred to a 75-μm sterile stainless steel mesh. The oocytes were warmed at 42 °C in the BS for 5 minutes. Oocytes from the vitrified group were plunged into liquid nitrogen, while oocytes from CPA-exposed groups were only exposed to cryoprotectants. Oocytes were then subjected to IVM, fertilization and embryo culture. Fisher's Exact Test analyzed differences in maturation, cleavage and blastocyst rates between groups. The maturation rate of vitrified and CPA-exposed groups did not differ significantly from control oocytes. However, no blastocysts were obtained from CPA-exposed and vitrified groups. Vitrification and control groups showed that immature equine oocytes could maintain viability and meiotic competence; moreover, cryoprotectant exposure did not show any blastocyst formation as compared to control. Further investigation is necessary to understand the overall physiology of equine oocytes in order to optimize the developmental capacity of embryos.

171	Le métier de chanteur lyrique au Québec (2000-2020) : médiation de la musique et nouvelles modalités du concert	This master thesis proposes to explore how the music mediation and the new modalities of the concert fit into the careers of lyric singers in Quebec. The corpus of my research is made up of a documentary analysis of mediation activities in North American lyrical institutions and the analysis of the singer’s training, as well as a qualitative survey of 12 Quebec singers. This study draws up a portrait of the mediation activities and the new modalities of the concert which are used to make opera accessible, then to highlight the contribution of the singers by the functions they occupy within the mediation of lyrical art. Even though all the singers we met have done mediation activities in their career, there are many factors that influence the continuation of mediation activities. There are social constraints which are linked to the notoriety of the singers influenced by the lower reputational value of the mediation activities compared to the performance as a soloist. But also economic constraints, which oblige the singers to have several activities to make a living from their art. It emerges from this study that music mediation is an additional tool for singers, as they become versatile if they mediate alongside a concert. It can also be a way to diversify their activities if the singers decide to create mediation workshops and concerts that are presented in new modalities. On the other hand, mediation can become an obligation in the career of singers, despite the fact that they were not trained for it during their studies.

172	Economic evaluation of a new genetic risk score to prevent nephropathies in type-2 diabetic patients	The current screening method for diabetic nephropathy (DN) is based upon the detection of urinary albumin and the decline of estimated glomerular filtration rate, which occurs relatively late in the course of the disease. A polygenic risk score (PRS) was developed for early prediction of the risk for type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients who experience DN. The aim of this study was to assess the economic impact of the implementation of the PRS for the prevention of DN in T2D patients, compared to usual screening methods in Canada. First, a systematic literature review was conducted to examine all published economic evaluations in T2D and DN. The main trends in modelling technics obtained from this review were used to conduct a cost-utility analysis using a Markov model. Health states include pre-end-stage renal disease (Pre-ESRD), ESRD and death. Model efficacy parameters were based on prediction of outcome data by polygenic-risk testing of the ADVANCE trial. Analyses were conducted from Canadian healthcare and societal perspectives. Over a lifetime horizon, the PRS was a dominant strategy compared to usual screening methods, from both a healthcare system and societal perspective. In other words, the PRS was less expensive and more effective in terms of quality-adjusted life years compared to usual screening technics. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed that results remained dominant in the majority of simulations. This economic evaluation demonstrates that the adoption of the PRS would not only be cost saving but would also help prevent ESRD and improve patients’ quality of life.

173	La détresse émotionnelle d'une cohorte de survivants d'une leucémie lymphoblastique aigüe pédiatrique: description, détection et facteurs explicatifs	Pediatric cancer is associated with different physical, neurological, and emotional short- and long-term adverse effects. Survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are vulnerable to emotional distress, which could persist or increase over time. Unfortunately, the existing routine screening tools of emotional distress, such as the Distress Thermometer (DT) generate high rates of errors. The aim of this thesis is to study emotional distress among childhood ALL survivors. We studied the description and the screening of emotional distress, and the identification of predictive factors of distress. This thesis is composed of four articles. The objective of the first article is to describe the characteristics of a high level of emotional distress measured by the DT, among 202 childhood ALL survivors. The results suggest that a high level of distress on the DT is associated with negative affectivity among children and adults, and with anxiety among adults. Also, a low level of distress is associated with positive affectivity among adults. After defining emotional distress’s characteristics among pediatric ALL survivors, we wanted to study emotional distress’ screening. The objective of the second article is to study the efficacy of a two-step strategy, combining the DT at step one, and one question on emotions (fear, sadness, concerns, anger, fatigue) at step two. The study is conducted among 255 childhood ALL survivors. The results show that a two-step strategy (DT combined with emotional question of sadness or concerns) is more effective than the DT used alone at the cut point 4, to screen mixed anxious-depressive distress (depression and/or anxiety). After responding to the objective of distress’ screening, we wanted to study the predictive factors associated to emotional distress. Based on the literature support, we desired to study the association between corticosteroids ALL treatments and emotional distress. The third article is a literature review. The aim of this review is to synthesize the literature results on the association between presence of elevated emotional distress among childhood ALL patients and survivors, and the cumulative doses of corticosteroids received during ALL treatments. The results do not suggest association between cumulative doses of corticosteroids and any domains of emotional distress (emotions, behaviours, neurocognitions, and fatigue/sleep). However, this review has allowed us to identify recommendations for future studies, to improve the synthesis of research results. Finally, we wanted to empirically study the different treatment related factors (radiotherapy, chemotherapy, corticotherapy) associated to emotional distress. The fourth study is an empirical study on predictive factors of emotional distress among 212 childhood ALL survivors. The results show that there is no association between treatment related variables (radiotherapy, chemotherapy and corticotherapy) and mixed anxious-depressive distress. This thesis has allowed to different contributions on the characterization and the screening of emotional distress among childhood ALL survivors. The results are promising. The efficacy of the screening two-step strategy for emotional distress. These results have significant and innovative clinical implications. Future researches are needed to improve the screening of emotional distress and the identification of predictive factors, both in patients and survivors of the different childhood cancer types. More experimental researches are needed to understand high level of emotional distress among patients and survivors of childhood cancer, and to prevent and treat this distress.	pediatric leukemia , survivors , emotional distress , anxiety , screening , corticosteroids , radiotherapy , chemotherapy	en	24669.0
174	Sourds et muets entre savoir et fiction au tournant des Lumières	At the intersection of the history of linguistic ideas and the history of representations, this thesis studies scholarly and fictional discourses on deafness between the final years of the Ancien Régime and the beginning of the Restoration (1776-1815). This period covers the years where the Abbé de L'Épée and the Abbé Sicard carried out their work. It matches the period of changes in the course of the history of the deaf people in France and how they were considered. The emergence of a specialist discourse on deafness, the setting up of institutions dedicated to the collective education of deaf people and the development of sign language and their literacy, mark the beginning of the integration of deaf people into society. Educators and philosophers are not the only ones to talk about deafness; the deaf people and their education also entrhal novelists and authors of short fiction. The sentimental novel seized the silent character and its sign language, sometimes separating him from deafness. Without doubt, the novelists have been interested much more by muteness than deafness, because the former enabled them to question the social function of speech. In their works, the novelists use contrast to reveal the malfunction of speech caused by the Revolution. The aim of this thesis is twofold. First, we put speech on deafness back in the scholarly context of the times and explain how it helps us understand the linguistic, anthropological and philosophical changes of this period. Secondly, through the history of the representations, we show how knowledge and fiction meet in the process of metaphorization of the idea of deafness of the end of the eighteenth century.

175	Biohacking and code convergence : a transductive ethnography	This dissertation examines creative practices and discourses intersecting computer and biotech cultures. It queries influential metaphors and analogies on both sides of the inter- section, and their positioning of biotech and information technologies as expression media. It follows mediations across their incarnations as codes, both computational and biological, and situates their analogical expressivity and programmability as a process of code conver- gence. Converging visions of technological freedom facilitated the entrance of computers in 1960’s Western hobbyist hacker circles, as well as in consumer markets. Almost fifty years later, the analogy drives claims to freedom of information —and freedom of innovation— from biohacker hobbyist groups to new biotech consumer markets. Such biohacking practices are understood as individuations: as ongoing attempts to resolve frictions, tensions working through claims to freedom and openness animating software and biotech cultures.  Tensions get modulated in many ways. One of them, otherwise known as “forking,” refers here to a critical bifurcation allowing for differing iterations of biotechnical and computa- tional configurations. Forking informs —that is, simultaneously affords and constrains— differing collective visions of openness. Forking also operates on the materiality and agency invested in biotechnical and computational practices. Taken as a significant process of co- constitution and differentiation in collective action, bifurcation invites the following three questions: 1) How does forking solve tensions working through claims to biotech freedom? 2) In this solving process, how can claims bifurcate and transform to the point of radically altering biotech practices? 3) what new problems do these solutions call into existence?  This research found these questions, and both scales of material action and agency, in- carnated in three extensive ethnographical journeys spanning three years (2012-2015): the first in a Brooklyn-based biotech community laboratory, the second in the early days of a biotech community group in Montreal, and the third in the world’s first synthetic biology startup accelerator in Cork, Ireland. The inquiry’s guiding empirical logic is neither solely deductive or inductive, but transductive. It borrows from Gilbert Simondon’s philosophy of communication and information to experience epistemology as an act of analogical creation involving the radical, irreversible transformation of knower and known. Transductive heuris- tics offer unconvential encounters with practices, metaphors and analogies of code. In the end, transductive methods acknowledge code convergence as a metastable writing games, and ethnographical research itself as a transductive process.

176	Effects of overground walking with a robotic exoskeleton on lower limb muscle synergies	Wearable robotic exoskeletons (WRE) represent a promising rehabilitation intervention for locomotor rehabilitation training that aligns with activity-based neuroplasticity principles in terms of optimal sensory input, massed repetition, and proper kinematics. Thus far, most studies that investigated the effects of WRE have used WRE that provide full robotic assistance and fixed trajectory guidance to the lower extremity (L/E) to generate close-to-normal walking kinematics, usually at very slow speeds.  Based on clinicians’ feedback, current commercially-available WRE have additional control options to be able to integrate these devices into the recovery process of individuals who have maintained some ability to walk after an injury to the central nervous system. In this context, WRE now offer additional degrees of movements for the L/E to move freely and different strategies to assist or resist movement, particularly during the gait cycle’s swing phase. However, the extent that these additional WRE control options affect L/E neuromuscular control during walking, typically characterized using muscle synergies (MSs), remains unknown. This thesis measures and compares MSs characteristics (i.e., number, temporal activation profile, and muscles contributing to a specific synergy [weightings]) during typical overground walking, with and without a WRE, in six different control modes, in abled-bodied individuals (Articles #1 and #2) and individuals with incomplete spinal cord injury (iSCI; Article #3). Surface EMG of key L/E muscles were recorded while walking and used to extract MSs using a non-negative matrix factorization algorithm. Cosine similarity and correlation coefficients characterized, grouped, and indicated similarities between MS characteristics. Results demonstrated that: 1) the number of MSs and MS temporal activation profiles in able-bodied individuals walking without WRE are modified by walking speed and that, as speed increased, specific MSs were fused or merged compared to MSs at slow speeds; 2) In able-bodied individuals walking with WRE, few WRE control modes maintained the typical MSs characteristics that were found during overground walking without WRE. Moreover, freeing the L/E swing trajectory imposed by the WRE best reproduced those MSs characteristics during overground walking without the WRE; and 3) After an iSCI, alterations to the number and the composition of MSs were observed during walking without WRE. However, of all WRE control modes that were investigated, only HASSIST (i.e., freeing WRE control over L/E swing trajectory while assisting the user’s self-selected trajectory) reproduced the number and composition of MSs found in abled-bodied individuals during overground walking without WRE. Altogether, the results of this thesis demonstrated that different walking-related biomechanical demands (i.e., walking speed) and most of the WRE control modes can alter some MSs, and their characteristics, in able-bodied individuals. This research also confirmed that impaired muscle coordination, assessed via MSs, can adapt when walking with a WRE set with specific control options (e.g., HASSIST). These MS adaptations mimicked typical MS characteristics extracted during overground walking. The evidence generated by this thesis will support the decision-making process when selecting specific L/E control options during WRE walking, allowing rehabilitation professionals to refine WRE locomotor training protocols.	gait , muscle coordination , rehabilitation , spinal cord injury , technology	en	24596.0
177	Stratégies d’optimisation d’utilisation d’un exosquelette pour la réadaptation locomotrice des patients avec des troubles neuromoteurs : stratégies d’optimisation d’utilisation d’un exosquelette pour la réadaptation locomotrice des patients avec des troubles neuromoteurs	Cerebral palsy is the leading cause of childhood gait limitations, affecting 2 to 3 children per 1000 births. It is defined as a movement and posture disorder that causes functional limitations due to the damage of the immature brain. Spasticity, excessive co-contraction, muscle weakness and bone deformities limit the autonomy of these children. Their walking is slower and more unstable compared to that of typically developing children. Recently, exoskeletons for gait rehabilitation (e.g., Lokomat®) have been shown to be effective in adults with neuromotor disorders. However, evidence supporting the effectiveness of such a training modality in children with cerebral palsy remains insufficient. In addition to its apparent relevance for gait rehabilitation, the Lokomat® offers the possibility of evaluating certain motor functions (i.e., muscle strength, spasticity). However, these tools are not used due to the lack of information on the reliability of its measurements.  The objective of this thesis was to assess the relevance of the use of robotic orthoses « Lokomat® » for the assessment of motor functions and for gait rehabilitation in patients with neuromotor disorders, such as cerebral palsy. To respond to our general objective, three specific objectives have been defined in order to: (1) provide information on the applicability and effectiveness of robotic locomotor rehabilitation for improving gait parameters in children with cerebral palsy; (2) evaluate the psychometric qualities of the Lokomat® integrated tools measuring spasticity and isometric force in order to determine their suitability for regular clinical use; and (3) propose a systematic approach based on electromyography to personalize Lokomat's settings to promote optimal training for hip extensor strength.  Carried out in a « Living Lab » context involving the patient, parents, clinicians and researchers, our 1st study established a realistic Lokomat® training protocol (2 sessions / weeks for 12 weeks) that can be easily transferred to the clinic. This intervention on 24-patients led to significant improvement in the lower limb isometric strength (25-74%) and walking capacities such as walking speed (+20%), step length (+14%) and endurance (+24%). Improvements in muscle strength and endurance had sustained when measured at a 6-month follow-up. In the same study, our results showed that robotic training had a positive effect on muscle strength and gait capacity whatever the level of severity (GMFCS levels II-IV). In the second and third studies, the reliability of the two integrated tools of the Lokomat® (L-FORCE and L-STIFF) assessing muscle strength and spasticity respectively was measured using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and standard error of measurement (SEM). The intra- and inter-tester reliability of the L-FORCE tool was good to excellent (ICC = 0,70 - 0,87 et SEM = 11,9 - 22,5%) for measuring isometric strength of hip and knee flexors and extensors in children with cerebral palsy. For the L-STIFF tool, the intra-tester reliability was moderate to excellent (ICC = 0.49 – 0.89, SEM = 7 – 16%) while the inter-tester reliability was acceptable to good (ICC = 0.32 – 0.70, SEM = 6 - 39%). These two tools have thus greater intra- and inter-tester reliability than conventional clinical tests for measuring isometric strength and spasticity in children with cerebral palsy. Finally, our fourth study is a proof of concept of a systematic approach based on electromyography to personalize and optimize the Lokomat® settings that aim to maximize muscle activity of hip extensors in two post-stroke patients. We were able to set personalized parameters for a targeted Lokomat® training using an easily implementable protocol. It only took two test sessions to determine these settings. The two cases presented in the study showed a significant increase in muscle strength of the hip extensors (+43 and 114 %) as well as improvement in endurance (+37% and +150%) and mobility (from 4 to 7 on the Modified Functional Ambulation Classification).  In conclusion, the results of our studies support the use of the Lokomat® robotic orthosis for gait rehabilitation in children with cerebral palsy. This approach provides a standardized training environment and allows an objective and mostly reliable assessment of changes in strength and spasticity of the lower limb. Finally, optimization of Lokomat® training appears to be feasible and easy to implement (i.e., based on electromyography and with only two additional Lokomat® training sessions).	cerebral palsy , robotic rehabilitation , gait analysis , kinematics , electromyography , intervention optimization , measurement reliability , isometric muscle strength , spasticity	en	24585.0
178	La Spirale, Le Zodiaque, and Mana : the convergences between Georges Migot and André Jolivet (1932-1937) = La Spirale, Le Zodiaque, et Mana : les convergences entre Georges Migot et André Jolivet (1932-1937)	This Master’s thesis explores the convergences between the French composers Georges Migot (1891-1976) and André Jolivet (1905-1974) during the 1930s, in terms of their respective musical aesthetics, compositional techniques, and involvement in the Parisian music scene. The aim is to provide a clearer picture of the relationship between Migot and Jolivet, to evaluate its influence upon their musical ideas and shared interest in the development of the concert society La Spirale, and to assess its significance in the wider sphere of French music. Currently, music history of this period is saturated with writings on Stravinsky, Ravel, and the Groupe des six. This study seeks to provide a better understanding of the other various musical manifestations in 1930s Paris.   The first chapter of this thesis consists of an examination of Migot and Jolivet’s respective aesthetics ideas and a discussion of their similarities. The second chapter explores a shared project of the two composers: the concert society La Spirale (1935-1937). While largely un-studied, this organization is known for having given rise to the group La Jeune France (1936-1942), an association formed by Olivier Messiaen, Daniel-Lesur, André Jolivet, and Yves Beaudrier, as the first three also took part in the executive of the former society. Through an exploration of La Spirale’s activities, this thesis not only provides a complete and revisited list of all works performed at its concerts, but also qualifies the involvement of Jolivet and Migot.   Finally, this research will conclude with a comparative analysis of select movements from solo piano collections by Migot and Jolivet, Le Zodiaque (1931-1932) and Mana (1935), respectively. While Migot uses a more modal language to convey his lyrism, Jolivet employs an emancipated post-tonal idiom. This analysis will take into consideration pitch and motivic structure (modal and serial practices) and temporal sequences. Moreover, it will provide an examination of the use of the Golden Mean and the Fibonacci series in some pieces.

179	Sentiment moral et contrainte légale Kant lecteur de Hutcheson	In this article, I would like to examine the evolution of the role of moral feeling in Kant’s philosophy from the Inquiry Concerning the Distinctness (1762) to the Doctrine of Virtue (1797). In 1762, moral obligation (Verbindlichkeit) is grounded both on a purely formal-rational component, inspired by Baumgarten and Crusius, and on a material component based on a moral feeling explicitly borrowed from Hutcheson. But by later adopting the legal model (Crusius) of a moral law conceived as a rational principle on which, from then on, the moral obligation is exclusively grounded, Kant is led to downplay the status of moral feeling by seeing in it a simple effect of the law on sensibility. Through this feeling the necessitation (Nötigung) implicit in moral obligation is literally felt. Accordingly, the feeling of respect will not be considered as the criterion of the good, but rather as the incentive (Triebfeder) of the moral action.

180	Effects of intermittent versus continuous access to nicotine self-administration in rats	Although cigarette smokers consume nicotine and other tobacco products found in cigarettes intermittently throughout each day, procedures to study nicotine effects in laboratory animals involve continuous nicotine access during self-administration sessions. Here, we compared the effects of intermittent versus continuous nicotine self-administration on behavioural features relevant to drug addiction, using an animal model.  Four groups of male rats self-administered different doses of nicotine (i.e., 0.015 or 0.03 mg/kg/infusion) during 14 sessions (7 h/session) either as continuous nicotine access (Long Access, or LgA) or intermittent access (IntA; 12 minutes of access to nicotine per hour). We assessed group differences in nicotine intake, as well as nicotine seeking under a progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement (a measure of incentive motivation for drugs). Following nicotine withdrawal, we also measured the susceptibility to cue (withdrawal days 15-30) as well as nicotine-primed (0.075–0.15–3 mg/kg, subcutaneous; withdrawal days 30–38) reinstatement of nicotine-seeking behaviour (measures of relapse). LgA-0.03 rats consumed the most nicotine across the 14 self-administration sessions; however, despite taking much less nicotine than LgA groups, IntA groups showed similar levels of responding for nicotine under a progressive ratio schedule. After nicotine withdrawal, all groups also showed equivalent levels of cue and nicotine induced reinstatement behaviour. IntA nicotine self-administration results in much less drug intake than LgA self-administration, yet the two procedures are equally effective in producing behavioural signs relevant to tobacco addiction. Also, IntA nicotine self-administration serves as a better model of the intermittency of cigarette smoking in humans. Our findings have important implications for preclinical studies investigating the behavioural, psychological, and neurobiological processes involved in tobacco addiction.

181	Limiter la production d’angiopoiétine-like 2 vasculaire prévient le développement de l’athérosclérose associé à la sénescence endothéliale	Aging is associated with progressive deterioration of the organism functions leading to death. Accumulated alterations in aging favor the appearance of age-related diseases including cardiovascular diseases. Senescence is the cellular process underlying aging and the cause of organism decline. Senescent cells lose their ability to proliferate but remain metabolically active by secreting a cocktail of molecules involved in chronic inflammation and progression of age-related diseases such as atherosclerosis. Angiopoietin-like 2 (Angptl2) is a pro-inflammatory and an anti-apoptotic protein involved in the development of atherosclerosis and secreted by senescent cells. In this light, we hypothesized that an inhibition of vascular Angpt12 would be conducive to an attenuation of atherogenesis associated to endothelial senescence. The aim of my project was to study the beneficial effects of an in vivo reduction of Angptl2 in the development of atherosclerosis and endothelial senescence in severely dyslipidemic mice (LDLr - / -; hApoB100 + / +). Using a serotype 1 adeno-associated virus containing a short hairpin ARN against Angptl2 (AAV1-shAngptl2), we showed that blocking the expression of vascular Angptl2 decreased plaque size by 58% in the thoracic aorta of mice. These results are explained by a decrease in senescence, recruitment of monocytes and lower inflammation in the endothelium as well as a decrease in inflammation and infiltration of macrophages in the media of arterial wall. In addition, few days after the administration of AAV1-shAngptl2, we showed that senescent endothelial cells are eliminated by apoptosis, which in turn promotes the recruitment of endothelial progenitor cells in order to renew the endothelium, collectively contributing to a reduction of atherogenesis. These results demonstrate a link between Angptl2 and senescence in atherosclerosis, and they were validated by clinical data showing that vascular expression levels of Angptl2 correlates with the expression of the senescence marker p21 in the mammary arteries of patients with coronary artery disease. In conclusion, our study suggests that inhibition of vascular Angptl2 could be a new senolytic pathway to reduce atherosclerosis.

182	Instrumentation et méthodes d’analyse appliquées à l’évaluation du développement rétinien chez le souriceau par tomographie par cohérence optique	This master thesis is including a manuscript submitted for publication and is divided into two sections. In particular, the document describes the development of optical instrumentation and methodological tools to study the retinal development in an animal model through optical coherence tomography (OCT). The first section is divided into two chapters. Chapter 1 describes the theoretical basis and the problem to solve. Chapter 2 describes the tools developed or adapted to enable the performance of the experiments. In particular, this chapter details the optical system designed to allow the optimal focalization of the light beam onto the retina, which maximizes the signal and minimizes the impact of spherical aberrations and light dispersion on image quality. Also, the processing algorithm used to segment retinal tissues from OCT tomography is discussed. The second section is divided into two chapters. Chapter 3 is a manuscript that was submitted for publication to Investigative Ophthalmology & Visual Science. This work describes the growth and maturation of specific retinal layers in the wild type mouse (129S1/SvImJ) between 7 and 21 days of life. The manuscript also describes the image processing and segmentation algorithm that allows the quantification of the thickness of the layers over time. Then, Chapter 4 describes specific research projects where these OCT imaging tools can be applied. Specifically, this chapter shows the potential to study retinal developmental diseases as well as perfusion methods.

183	Molecular characterization of XerS/difSL site-specific recombination system in Streptococcus suis	The circular state of the bacterial chromosome presents a specific problem during replication. An odd number of homologous recombination events results in concatenated dimer chromosomes that cannot be partitioned into daughter cells. To solve this problem, bacteria have developed a mechanism of dimer resolution based on site-specific recombination system. This is performed by the Xer/dif system. In this system, the Xer proteins perform a recombination reaction in the dif site at the cell septum immediately prior to cell division. In most bacteria this reaction is performed by two recombinases, XerC and XerD. However, an important zoonotic pathogen; Streptococcus suis harbors a different recombination system, composed by a single recombinase enzyme called XerS, that catalyzes the recombination reaction in an unconventional dif site; difSL. A region characterized by two imperfect inverted repeat regions that flank a central region of 11 bp.To characterize the mode of cleavage of XerS, EMSA experiments were performed by using HEX-labelled PCR fragments and “nicked suicide substrates”. Our data suggests that; 1.) XerS is able to bind the entire difSL sequence; 2.) XerS binds more efficiently the left half side on incomplete difSL mutants than the right half side; 3.) XerS cleaves both the top and bottom strands of the difSL site, with a more efficient reaction at the bottom strand; 4.) Nucleotides at the outermost region of a T rich region seem to be determinant for binding selectivity and modifications of the extra spacing between the inverted repeat arms as well as length modifications of the central region change cleavage preference. 5.) XerS did not show any specific activity on another unconventional dif site in Firmicutes, as tested on difH. 6.) XerS interacts with FtsK-y subunit. This research aims to understand how XerS recombination works in the single recombinase system of Streptococcus and how this recombination is regulated by host factors. Exploration of these recombinases will provide a better understanding of the mechanisms of DNA exchange and genome stability in bacteria. It can also increase our knowledge of the evolution and speciation of recombinogenic bacteria.	Site-specific recombination , XerS , Tyrosine recombinases , dif sites , Dimerization.	en	24509.0
184	Incidence, sévérité et impact à long terme des évènements hémorragiques et la qualité de vie après le remplacement de valve aortique mécanique chez les jeunes adultes	The aortic valve is a central component of the heart, experiencing high strain. The consequences of any dysfunctions are usually important, notably heart failure, which in itself is associated with many symptoms and lower quality of life. To prevent this complication, it is possible to replace the valve with a prosthesis. There are many options for the surgeon’s team and the patient to choose from. The latest American guidelines do not have clear recommendations for patients aged between 50 and 70 years. These patients aged 65 years and less, categorized as non-elderly adults, are receiving less and less mechanical prosthesis in profit of the biological ones. This trend seems to be based in part on some studies suggesting comparable survival between these alternatives. Moreover, the mechanical valve is frequently not recommended because it necessitates a lifelong anticoagulant treatment. However, few studies have reported a long-term follow-up of these younger patients analyzing the impact on the quality of life and the risk of major bleeding. The goal of our study was to analyze the incidence, severity and impact of major bleedings and the quality of life after aortic valve replacement in these patients. After a mean follow-up of 11 years, results show a linearized rate of 0.8% per patient-year and the associated mortality is low at 3.3%, consisting of 2 intracranial hemorrhages. Overall, 48 patients experienced a major bleeding (8.9%). On the other hand, the impact on the quality of life measured with a valve-specific questionnaire is low. Also, only 10.5% of the patients were using self-management or self-medication to monitor their anticoagulation, suggesting a lot of room for improvement in this regard. This study helps better define long-term outcomes in this patient population in order to better inform patients about surgical options.

185	Effet du 5-fluorouracile systémique sur la pharmacocinétique de la chimiothérapie hyperthermique intrapéritonéale à l'oxaliplatine : démonstration de concept chez l'animal	Background: Cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) with oxaliplatin (OX) is a standard of care for selected patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis of colorectal origin. Because 5-FU is mandatory to improve efficacy of OX when used by systemic route, several teams now empirically combine intravenous (IV) 5-FU with HIPEC OX, but this practice has yet to be supported by preclinical data. Using a murine model, we studied the impact of IV 5-FU on peritoneal concentration of  HIPEC OX. Methods: Under general anesthesia, 24 Sprague-Dawley rats were submitted to 4 different doses of IV 5-FU (0, 100, 400 and 800 mg/m²) and a fixed dose of HIPEC OX (460 mg/m²) perfused at 40°C during 25 minutes. At 25 minutes, samples in different compartments were harvested (peritoneum, portal vein and systemic blood) and the concentrations of 5-FU and OX were measured by high performance liquid chromatography.  Results: Peritoneal concentration of OX was significantly higher (17.0, 20.1, 34.9 and 38.1 nmol/g, p < 0.0001) with increasing doses of 5-FU (0, 100, 400 and 800 mg/m², respectively). Peritoneal concentration of OX reached a plateau between 400 and 800 mg/m² of IV 5-FU.  Conclusion: IV 5-FU enhances peritoneal concentration of HIPEC OX. The most efficient dose of IV 5-FU to be used in combination with HIPEC OX seems to be 400 mg/m².	5-FU , HIPEC , Experimental study , Pharmacokinetics , Oxaliplatin	en	24488.0
186	Accès à l’alimentation saine dans l’Est de Montréal : perspective des ménages à faible revenu et des acteurs en sécurité alimentaire	Context: Social inequalities in health related to diet are associated with a higher prevalence of chronic diseases among socioeconomically disadvantaged populations. Lack of physical and economic access to healthy and affordable food instigates these social inequalities, and could partly explain the observed gradient, as in the case of one of the poorest neighborhoods in Eastern Montréal. Objective: Understand the perspectives of low-income households (LIHs) and food security actors of the Montreal East Food Network (RAEM) on access to healthy food in the food environment of Eastern Montreal, bearing in mind the viability of local food initiatives. Methodology: This qualitative study followed an action-research approach in partnership with RAEM. Six focus groups with LIHs (n = 49) and one with RAEM members (n = 13) were carried out in 2018. Data analysis was guided by the five dimensions of food access (economic, spatio-temporal, service availability, social and personal), as described by Freedman et al. (2013). Results: LIHs perceive that limited access to affordable food of high quality in the food environment, transportation constraints, and travel distance to food stores as the main obstacles to healthy eating. Although food security actors described the economic and spatio-temporal dimensions as crucial, they also acknowledged important barriers related to the personal and social dimensions. Conclusion: The perspectives of LIHs and food security actors suggest that economic and geographic situations, as well as the personal and social preferences of LIHs are determinants in access to healthy food. Despite the divergence of perspectives, these must be taken into consideration when implementing food security strategies.

187	Changements d'habitudes de vie chez les adolescentes : évaluation de l'approche Fillactive	Adolescence is a crucial time in the development, maintenance and sometimes the decline of different lifestyle habits. During adolescence, physical activity typically decreases with age, particularly in girls. FitSpirit is an organizaton that offers services that help Canadian schools implement physical activity interventions for adolescent girls. The objectives of this study were to evaluate changes in participants’ physical activity levels and lifestyle habits (sedentary time, sleep duration and eating habits) and to assess whether these changes varied on adherence to the Canadian 24-Hour Movement Guidelines and Canada’s Food Guide recommendations at enrollment. At the time of FitSpirit registration and at the end of school year, 73 participants answered online questionnaire. The participants reported improvements, with an increase in the number of days with physical activity and a decrease in daily consumption of sweets. Subgroup analyzes revealed greatest changes in those who did not adhere to the Canadian recommendations at enrollment. These participants significantly increased their number of days with physical activity and their consumption of fruits and vegetables, and decreased their screen time. The results indicate that participation in FitSpirit has the potential to improve several health behaviors among adolescent girls.

188	Genetic analysis of cell size homeostasis in human cells	All organisms are essentially structured and fitness defined by cell number, type and size. Composed of around 30 trillion cells, humans have cells with remarkably varied functions and size, ranging from a neuron that can reach one meter in length to a lymphoid cell that is around 16 μm in diameter. At a fundamental level, size is determined by the balance between cell growth and cell division. The molecular networks that control and maintain optimal cell size are yet to be deciphered. The mTORC1 pathway is a major regulator of cell growth that plays a central role in integrating intra- and extra-cellular stimuli. This study addresses the investigation and characterization of the molecular players and processes that orchestrate cell size in human cells, as determined by chemical-genetic size screens and epistasis analysis. I undertook a CRISPR/Cas9 extended-knockout (EKO) genome-wide library screen in the NALM-6 pre-B lymphoma cell line, followed by cell size fractionation by counter flow elutriation in the presence of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin, and compared the screen data to a similar screen performed in the absence of rapamycin. The analysis indicates that upstream of mTOR, the loss of genes that are related to nutrient sensing, results in size changes in the presence of mTOR inhibition. Also, several gene knockouts in ribosome biogenesis and calcium homeostasis led to size alterations, suggesting a possible a pivotal role of these processes in cell size control in a mTOR-dependent fashion. This study provides insights into the genetic networks that regulate cell size in a mTOR-dependent fashion and establishes new hypotheses for future experimental tests.	mTOR , Cell size , Epistasis , Ribosome biogenesis , Calcium homeostasis	en	24461.0
189	Évaluation de l'effet inhibiteur de 33 espèces végétales sur la lipase pancréatique in vitro	Type 2 diabetes and obesity affect the global population and, disproportionately, the adult population of the Eeyou Istchee Cree. In order to contribute to the documentation of the antidiabetic activities of 17 medicinal plants of the boreal forest traditionally recommended for treating the symptoms of diabetes, this study evaluates the pancreatic lipase enzymatic activity of different plant species. In addition, an evaluation of the enzymatic activity of the pancreatic lipase is carried out with antidiabetic species of the urban pharmacopoeia of Niamey (Niger) as well as with Quebec berries. Finally, phenolic compounds are identified in these last two groups of plant species. Results of these studies demonstrate that the majority of the evaluated species have an inhibitory effect on pancreatic lipase in vitro. Species showing the strongest inhibitory activities towards pancreatic lipase are Kalmia angustifolia, Gaultheria hispidula and Acacia nilotica. Thus, this study supports the accuracy of traditionnal knowledge by adding the documentation of an antidiabetic activity of plant species to the scientific repertoire.

190	Moderation of parenting by inhibitory control in the prediction of the common and unique variance of hyperactivity-impulsivity and inattention	This study examined whether the interaction between parenting and inhibitory control predicts hyperactivity-impulsivity and inattention in 195 children. Observation data of positive parenting were collected at 4 years, and mother reports of coercive parenting at 5 years, inhibitory control at 6 years, and hyperactivity-impulsivity/inattention at 7 years were obtained. The common and unique variance of hyperactivity-impulsivity and inattention symptoms were examined as outcomes using a bifactor model. Results indicated that positive parenting practices predicted lower levels of hyperactivity-impulsivity/inattention behaviors at age 7 only when children's inhibitory control was high. These results support the vantage sensitivity model, which posits that some individuals show an increased sensitivity to positive experiences exclusively, and support the appropriateness of a targeted prevention approach in early childhood.

191	Shame displays : beneficial or not?	Our ancestors’ survival greatly depended on their social relationships. According to an evolutionary perspective, shame’s function is to reduce the likelihood of losing social value in the eyes of fellow group members; however, certain accounts hold that shame may not be functional: it is related to psychological maladjustment (ex., depression and aggression). It is hypothesized that the two views are not conflicting; they can be reunited under a functional account. In other words, being shameful is beneficial under certain conditions (when a transgression is known to others) and costly under other conditions (when no transgression has been committed). Participants (n = 294, Mage = 42, SD = 13.423) were randomly assigned to read a vignette describing a transgression (stealing money or insulting a colleague) or no transgression, then exposed to a photo of an actor displaying either shame or no emotion, and then they rated the actor on 17 items including desirable traits (ex., friendly) and undesirable traits (ex., selfish). Through an exploratory factorial analysis, items were grouped into two factors (benign evaluations and absence of undesirable traits) in order to simplify statistical analyses. The hypothesis was not supported: shameful actors received lower scores on benign evaluations and absence of undesirable traits regardless of the presence or absence of a transgression. However, further analyses indicate that the consequences of displaying shame are more complex. These results suggest more research is necessary to examine whether the shame display remains functional today.

how do experienced clinicians differentiate autism from psychiatric conditions in adult women?"	Introduction. Autistic women present with greater social motivation and more typical language abilities than their male counterparts, leaving them vulnerable to misdiagnosis or late diagnosis. Paradoxically, there is concern about potential overdiagnosis of autism in psychiatric populations presenting with social difficulties, as diagnostic criteria remain relatively vague and autism less stigmatizing than many psychiatric conditions. Little guidance exists to guide clinicians when deciding whether to attribute adaptative difficulties in adult women to (1) autism, (2) a psychiatric condition, or (3) both.  Research suggests that autism is best reliably identified by expert clinicians having been exposed to a high number of autism cases, who notice qualitative aspects of the condition not included in diagnostic manuals. Thus, we aimed to better characterize the difficulties faced by clinicians in assessing adult women for autism, and the traits, behaviors and tools used to differentiate between autism and psychiatric conditions.  Methods. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 psychiatrists and psychologists from 7 different countries, experienced in autism diagnosis of adult women. The Framework Method was used to reveal themes relevant to our research goals.  Results. According to participants, autistic women had learned certain social contingencies allowing them to appear more typical, which made differential diagnosis a frequent question. Clinicians recommended long, flexible assessments, and validating the information volunteered by the person. Many traits cited as indicative of autism reflected a clinical knowledge of autism. Trauma and Borderline Personality Disorder were cited as particularly difficult to differentiate from autism. Conclusion. Evaluating for autism in adult women presents with singular challenges which clinicians address using individual toolboxes. In this population, it may be crucial to have the capacity to offer alternative avenues for non-autistic people having self-identified with the spectrum.	autism , women , differential , diagnosis , adult , diagnostic	en	24392.0
193	Mechanical Study of Silicon Strip Detector Modules During Quality Control for the ATLAS Phase-II Detector Upgrade	Following the great achievement by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Col- lider (LHC) that is the detection of the long-awaited Higgs boson, an upgrade of the LHC is planned, requiring an upgrade of ATLAS. Planned for the High-Luminosity LHC, the ITk (Inner TracKer), an all-silicon charged particle tracker, is the upgrade of the current ATLAS Inner Detector. Testing of the detector modules comprised in the ITk is crucial because the detector will be inaccessible for approximately 10 years following the installation. In this thesis, the focus will be kept on a subset of the ITk detector, namely the ITk Strip detector. To detect premature failure in the 20 000 Strip modules that will be produced, a series of tests will be performed, one of which will be the thermal cycling, where modules are monitored while being thermally cycled to replicate 10 years of operating conditions. These tests will occur in a special enclosure known as a coldbox. The subject of this work is to study the induced mechanical stress in future ITk Strip detector modules due to thermal cycling using Finite Element Analysis. Our first result is that the stress created in the module is mostly due to the vacuum applied to hold the module. Moreover, the maximum stress felt during thermal cycling is highly dependent on the thickness of the vacuum seal used: A thinner seal causes a lower stress. Finally, the stress in the module in our thermal cycling setup is between ∼ 20 MPa and ∼ 100 MPa depend- ing on the selected seal thickness, which is consistent with the stress expected in the final detector design which is approximately 64.8MPa. We can then conclude that the proposed design for the coldbox is a good candidate to perform thermal cycling.

194	Recherche d'un âge cinématique de l'association β Pictoris	Young moving groups (YMGs) are associations of young stars, mainly M dwarfs, that share a common kinematics, located in the solar neighbourhood and formed at the same epoch by the collapse of a molecular cloud that is unique to every association. They are ideal laboratories for the study of the last steps of stellar formation and the direct imaging of exoplanets. The β Pictoris moving group (βPMG) is one of the youngest and closest YMGs, although its age remains uncertain: ages found using isochrones or the lithium depletion boundary (LDB; 21 − 24 Myr) are inconsistent with traceback ages (11 − 13 Myr), found by tracing back the trajectories of member stars up to the epoch when the size of the YMG was minimal, which coincides with the epoch of stellar formation. This study presents a new numerical method, called Traceback, capable of ﬁnding a kinematic age for a YMG by traceback with data from the Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2) catalog. Its maximal theoretical precision is calculated and two important biases are characterized: a bias due to measurement errors (∼ −4.5 Myr) and a ∆v_r, grav = 0.5 km/s bias on radial velocity (v_r ; vitesse radiale) measurements due to gravitational redshift (∼ −1.8 Myr). When this method is applied to a sample of 46 validated members of βPMG, a corrected kinematic age of 17 − 19 Myr, in agreement with isochrones and LDB ages, is found by minimizing the median absolute deviation (MAD), a measure of the size of the association that is robust against outliers in the data, and the X-U covariance between the X positions and the U velocities of member stars. Furthermore, the use of a minimum spanning tree (MST) is shown not to be advantageous.	Young moving groups , Stellar age , Kinematics , Traceback , β Pictoris moving group	en	24368.0
195	Le problème de la volonté dans le Soûtra de l’Entrée dans la dimension absolue, aussi connu comme le chapitre trente-neuf du Soûtra des Ornements du Bouddha	This dissertation considers representations of human will in chapter 39 of The Flower Ornament Scripture, entitled “Entering the Realm of Reality”. An exegesis of the narrative reveals that the dissatisfaction (duḥkha s.) that permeates existence is partly caused by thirst (tṛṣṇā s.). However, our analysis shows that by exercising their will – a source a priori of infinite freedom and possibility – beings systematically abandon themselves to their thirsty feelings and, in the long run, perpetuate the infernal cycle of existence. Unsurprisingly, will is considered a negative faculty, to be proscribed from practice by the spiritual masters of the sutra; this simple but essential teaching must be followed by the practitioner so that he can reach Enlightenment and participates in the common good. The problem, however, is that liberation necessarily implies the exercise of will, for example in taking vows or practicing compassion and perseverance. Though the exercise of will can have positive aspects, its negative potential remains, leading us to ask: how can the ethics of the sutra actually lead to positive effects if it is connected to will? To answer this question, we refer to the conception of the realm of reality, the final teaching of the sutra. In this realm, the will frees itself from all conditioning and a new way of apprehending the psychological posture of enlightened beings appears: the non-will.

196	Generalizations of monsky matrices for elliptic curves in legendre form	A positive integer n is said to be congruent if it is the area of a right triangle whose sides are all of rational length. The task of finding which integers are congruent is an old and famous yet still open question in arithmetic geometry called the congruent number problem. It is linked to the theory of elliptic curves as the integer n is congruent if and only if the elliptic curve y²=x³-n²x has a rational point of infinite order. The link between congruent numbers and elliptic curves enables the application of techniques from algebraic geometry to study the problem. One of these methods is the concept of Monsky matrices that can be used to calculate the size of the 2-Selmer group of the elliptic curve y²=x³-n²x. One can use these matrices in order to find new infinite families of non-congruent numbers. The connection to elliptic curves also introduces generalizations to the congruent number problem. For example, one may consider the θ-congruent number problem which studies triangles with a fixed angle of θ instead of only right triangles. This problem is also related to elliptic curves and the concept of Monsky matrices can be generalized to it. In fact, Monsky matrices can be generalized to any elliptic curve that has a Legendre form over the rationals. The goal of this thesis is to construct such a generalization and then to apply it to relevant problems in arithmetic geometry to efficiently reprove old results and find new ones.	2-descente , Elliptic curves , Monsky matrices , Congruent numbers , Theta-congruent numbers , 2-descent , 2-Selmer group , Number theory	en	24347.0
197	Polylogarithmes et mesure de Mahler	The main purpose of this thesis is to compute the logarithmic Mahler measure of the three variable polynomial family xn + 1 + (xn−1 + 1)y + (x − 1)z. In order to accomplish this, we integrate regulators defined on polylogarithmic motivic complexes. To understand these regulators, we explore the properties of polylogarithms and show some polylogarithmic identities. The regulators are then applied to simplify the integrand. Our result is a formula relating the Mahler measure of the family of polynomials to the Bloch–Wigner Dilogarithm and the Riemann zeta function.

198	Étude de métaphores conceptuelles anatomiques en espagnol : comparaison d’un corpus traduit et d’un corpus non traduit	In biomedicine, as in other fields, phraseology and terminology are essential elements for optimal communication. Yet, in a field where precision and objectivity are highly important, there is an apparent contradiction: the usual use of metaphor. However, we are not dealing here with the rhetorical device under which metaphor is usually envisioned. What we are dealing with is the conceptual metaphor, which makes it possible to express the modes of conceptualization specific to the field, particularly through phraseology. Since conceptual metaphorisation is closely related to languages-cultures, the question arises whether trans-lated works and works written directly in a language express different modes of metaphori-cal conceptualisation or not.  Our study examines the modes of metaphorical conceptualization (MMC) expressed in Span-ish in the field of topographical anatomy. It is part of a larger translation study research pro-gram, which focuses on MMCs in the biomedical field. Anatomy is a particularly rich area for the exploration of conceptual metaphor. We have identified and characterized metaphorical conceptualization indices (MCI) in in texts selected from reference books or teaching manu-als in the field of topographic anatomy, focusing on vascular structures (arteries and veins), nerves and some muscles, with the aim of comparing two sub-corpuses : one is composed of texts written directly in Spanish and the other, of texts translated into this language. We characterized the MCMs conveyed by these MCIs and compared the results obtained in the two sub-corpuses. Taking into account the limitations of our study, we show that the corpus written in Spanish presents a greater variability in the expression of conceptual metaphors than the translated corpus. We thus hope to contribute to a better understanding of the pro-cesses of specialized writing and translation.	biomedical translation , anatomy , conceptual metaphor , metaphorical conceptualisation indices , phraseology	en	24341.0
199	Tactical block planning for intermodal rail transportation	The thesis presents the tactical block-planning problem for intermodal railroads, which has been little studied so far. We propose a new block service network design model considering the specificity of intermodal rail. The research focuses on the North American context and follows a close collaboration with one of the major North American railroad companies. Blocking constitutes an important rail freight transport operation, by which cars with potentially different origins and destinations are grouped to be moved and handled as a single unit, yielding economies of scale. The literature is limited to works addressing the classical train blocking problem, where demand is given in terms of cars to be blocked among specific OD pairs. To the best of our knowledge, no prior work has been dedicated to an intermodal transportation context, where demand is expressed in terms of containers to be moved from a given origin terminal to a given destination terminal, hence introducing an additional consolidation process. We propose a blocking model that considers several types of containers and railcars, integrating the container-to-car assignment. We present a new continuous-time, three-layer service network design model formulated as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP), with the objective of minimizing the total transportation cost composed by block selection, operation costs, and handling demand cost. The model can be solved using commercial solver for realistic sizes. We illustrate the performance and interest of the proposed method through an extensive case study of a major North American railroad.

200	Look-ahead meta-learning for continual learning	The continual learning problem involves training models with limited capacity to perform well on a set of an unknown number of sequentially arriving tasks. This setup can of- ten see a learning system undergo catastrophic forgetting, when learning a newly seen task causes interference on the learning progress of old tasks. While recent work has shown that meta-learning has the potential to reduce interference between old and new tasks, the current training procedures tend to be either slow or offline, and sensitive to many hyper-parameters. In this work, we propose Look-ahead MAML (La-MAML), a fast optimisation-based meta- learning algorithm for online-continual learning, aided by a small episodic memory. This is achieved by realising the equivalence of a multi-step MAML objective to a time-aware con- tinual learning objective adopted in prior work. The equivalence leads to the formulation of an intuitive algorithm that we call Continual-MAML (C-MAML), employing continual meta- learning to optimise a model to perform well across a series of changing data distributions. By additionally incorporating the modulation of per-parameter learning rates in La-MAML, our approach provides a more flexible and efficient way to mitigate catastrophic forgetting compared to conventional prior-based methods. This modulation also has connections to prior work on meta-descent, which we identify as an important direction of research to de- velop better optimizers for continual learning. In experiments conducted on real-world visual classification benchmarks, La-MAML achieves performance superior to other replay-based, prior-based and meta-learning based approaches for continual learning. We also demonstrate that it is robust, and more scalable than many recent state-of-the-art approaches.

201	Tisser la résurgence à travers le wampum comme approche rhétorique décoloniale de certaines œuvres de Nadia Myre	Aboriginal artistic creation is inseparable from political struggles. In a colonial context, Aboriginal ways of being, acting and thinking are deeply affected. Art is a powerful weapon in this struggle for decolonization. This study will therefore focus on the transformative and decolonizing potential of Aboriginal artistic creation through the artistic practice of Algonquin artist Nadia Myre. Several of her works address the mixed identity and colonial violence suffered by Aboriginal people. Indian Act (fig.1) denounces, through a traditional and participatory beaded rewriting, a colonial law that has led to a profound epistemic injustice. To address these issues, we will focus on a specific object, the wampum. In this research, we will consider it as a vector of deep resurgence and decolonization. The essential ancient and contemporary socio-political position of wampum makes it a privileged didactic support of resurgence. Through the use of the wampum motif in Nadia Myre's artistic practice, we will be able to walk through these struggles and understand how Aboriginal artists engage them. Wampum will be presented as a discursive rhetoric, material and immaterial, a hypertext, a hyperlink (Haas 2007) between tradition and modernity, orality and writing, which will be supported by the theory of intermediality. Jacques Derrida and the Deconstruction will also be convened to examine the rewriting work done by Myre in Indian Act. It will also be a question of understanding how Nadia Myre's participatory proposal could enable an allochtonous engagement towards decolonial epistemic justice.

202	Les défis de la réinsertion sociale : regard éclairé sur la réalité vécue par la clientèle en maison de transition	Reintegration is a difficult process and individuals who have been affected by the justice system can benefit from interventions that help them to be autonomous, law-abiding, and integrated into their communities. Current research, however, seldom goes beyond identifying the difficulties in this process. Our qualitative study was an in-depth exploration of the challenges encountered by ex-convicts who had been provided with lodging in halfway houses as part of their reentry process. Six categories of challenges were identified following a content analysis of the interviews (n=16) : return to society, financial and occupational situation, social network, personal development, stigmatization, and living in halfway houses. Experiences specific to certain profiles (length of sentence, sexual delinquency) are noted. Results are discussed in relation to desistance theories. Among other things, the study highlights the ways in which legal conditions and the stigmatization of offenders can lead to counter-productive outcomes.

203	Étude des connaissances morphologiques dérivationnelles en modalité orale et en modalité écrite d'élèves dyslexiques du primaire	Reading is at the heart of school learning and likewise, at the heart of success in many school subjects. However, not all learners develop this skill with ease. In fact, some students will experience reading difficulties throughout their school years. It is particularly the case of students with dyslexia, a reading disability. Dyslexia would be associated to a phonological deficit which would hinder, in the learners that are affected, the achievement of graphemes-phonemes correspondences during word recognition. Since this is said to be specific to reading and strongly linked to text comprehension, dyslexic students experience significant difficulties to read. Word recognition involves the activation and use of various types of knowledge linked to phonological, morphological and visuo-orthographic properties of written words. This knowledge and the procedures which are associated to them are established during the first years of schooling for students whose reading development is typical. They enable them to create orthographic representations corresponding more and more to the standard. The quality of these representations stored in memory contribute to success in word recognition. However, for dyslexic students, word representations often lack precision, which leads to errors during reading. Since phonological knowledge and procedures are generally said to be deficient in dyslexic students, researchers have been trying for several years to identify other procedures that could be useful to them. For this reason, these researchers are interested in the morphological knowledge of dyslexic students during reading. Consequently, since words have some properties that are non-phonological, in particular morphological properties, it is possible to consider that these students use these other properties to recognize words. The current review of the scientific literature on this question does not provide a clear picture of the situation. A reason that could account for this observation concerns the great variability of the tasks selected in the different studies and the fact that some tasks were performed in oral modality and others, in written modality. These tasks also vary in terms of cognitive constraints. It is thus not surprising that they are associated with varying success rates. Furthermore, since oral knowledge is the first to develop and that it generally serves as the basis on which written knowledge is built, it is possible to think that those administered orally will have a better success rate than written tasks. However, studies have not attempted to hierarchize tasks to better understand the results of work carried out in the field and thus account for the potential role of morphological knowledge in reading. They also have not considered the modality in which the tasks are administered (oral or written). In this study, our objective is thus to assess et compare morphological knowledge, in oral and written modalities, of elementary school dyslexic students by using different tasks that are hierarchized from the start. The performances of these students were compared with those of two groups of normal readers: younger students, but with the same reading level as the dyslexic students (RC) and same age students (AC), in order to better understand reading behaviors of dyslexic students. To assess reading abilities, a word recognition test from the WIAT-II test battery, a reading comprehension test from the K-ABC test battery and a vocabulary test (EVIP) were used. For the evaluation of morphological knowledge, three tasks (morphological relation judgment, decomposition and plausibility judgment) with different cognitive constraints were selected following a literature review. These tasks were administered to all participants first orally then, several days later, in writing. The results from the analysis of variance conducted reveal that dyslexic students obtain success rates generally comparable to RC in morphological tasks. This corroborates the results of other studies and meets our expectations. However, for certain tasks, they are not significantly different from AC, which could indicate that the morphological knowledge of dyslexic students is more elaborate than what we have anticipated in relation to their reading abilities. We also observed an effect of the cognitive constraints attached to each of the morphological tasks. Furthermore, an effect of the task administration modality was observed, but only for the plausibility judgment task and only for dyslexic students. Hence, in general, contrary to our expectations, the modality does not seem to have had an impact on the performances of AC and RC groups. These results have theoretical and practical consequences which are discussed at the end of this thesis.	derivational morphology , word recognition , reading , reading disability , dyslexia , elementary school , French	en	24273.0
204	L’intégration des services buccodentaires et des services publics de soins primaires	Despite its importance, integrating oral health into primary care remains an emerging practice in the health care services. The general objective of this PhD project was to understand the concept of integration of oral health care with primary care, to contextualize it in Quebec public health organizations, and to identify its barriers and facilitators.  To this end, we conducted a synthetic case study, using a qualitative research approach with an interpretive description methodology. The study comprises two parts: i) a scoping study (Levac et al. 2010) and ii) a holistic multiple case study, guided by the conceptual framework of Valentijn et al. (2013) and including an environmental scan. The data were collected through the organizations' websites, operational documents, and observation notes taken during site visits, as well as via seventy-four semi-structured interviews and five focus groups with primary health care teams working in a rural and an urban health care organization. Data collection and thematic analysis were conducted simultaneously. The analysis was conducted manually and with Atlas-ti software.  Our results showed that the majority of policies related to the integration of oral health into primary care are derived from the common risk factor approach. In general, integrated oral health care programs rely on partnerships with government agencies and academic institutions. These programs adopt a variety of strategies: interdisciplinary networking, training of non-dental primary care providers, championing oral health, and the use of new technologies. So far, most studies of these programs have been descriptive in nature and few studies show long-term results. Lack of political leadership and health policies; implementation challenges; limited stakeholder training; lack of continuity of care; and the oral care needs of patients are the barriers to integration. On the other hand, support policies and resource allocation, interdisciplinary training, collaborative practices, the presence of local strategic leaders, and co-location could facilitate this integration.  Normative aspects, care trajectories, and integration initiatives shaped the delivery of primary oral care services in the two cases. The public dental health program coexisted with different integration strategies, mostly informal liaison and coordination mechanisms. The themes identified in the study aligned with the domains of the research project’s conceptual framework and included: the driver and the importance of integration; the role of professionals in integrated care; and the factors that promote or hinder this integration. Our analysis showed that most of the barriers were related to the organizational and systemic domains of integration, and few strategic institutional resources were allocated to oral health.  In Quebec, the integration of oral health into primary care is carried by the dental public health sector, and the sustainability of integration initiatives in other primary care sectors remains unclear. Better resource management, interprofessional collaboration, and partnership with academic institutions could contribute to this integration. Rigorous, evidence-based research is needed to evaluate the results of integrating the various strategies for improving oral health, performance, and costs incurred by oral health programs.

205	"Design and adaptation in contested urban spaces : 
the case of the Toi Market as a multi-level settlement in Nairobi, Kenya"	Nairobi has nearly 200 slums where 70% of its population live. Most slum dwellers lack tenure security and suffer the constant threat of eviction. Yet, we still know very little about how these slums form, grow, and consolidate in contested urban spaces, and how their residents adapt to uncertainty. Part of the reason lies in the gap between design and adaptation theories. Whereas design theory focuses mainly on professionals’ cognitive processes (largely ignoring adaptation mechanisms adopted by slum dwellers), spatial transformations in slums are often addressed by resilience theory, which usually overlooks design processes.  What is the role of design in adaptation processes in contested urban spaces? I answer this question by exploring the relationships between design and adaptive capacities in the Toi Market, the second largest informal market in Nairobi. I study the market’s tenure regimes and traders’ design practices through a case study that combines longitudinal and cross-section investigation. The research reasoning is abductive, made of iterative paths between conceptual frameworks and empirical results. It is largely based on a literature review on land tenure and design theory. The concepts of bounded rationality, uncertainty, and adaptive mechanisms constitute the basis of the theoretical framework used to analyse the empirical data. Methods include participant observation, 59 interviews with traders, meetings with market leaders, mapping techniques and the analysis of over 80 pertinent documents about the market. Results show that the Toi Market has three types of controversial tenure regimes and traders conduct design at three levels: development design, evolutionary design, and consolidation design.  Development design consists of collective adaptive initiatives prompted by survival mechanisms. It strengthens social capital, emerges in reaction to ordinary urban interventions, and seeks to improve functionality. Evolutionary design is conducted by community sub-groups in response to major external forces and events. It leads to social and morphological changes at the urban scale and depends on governance and control mechanisms. Consolidation design refers to individual and group-led adaptive initiatives conducted during times of relative stability. It reinforces economic development and networks and seeks to achieve land tenure security. It emerges mainly in vacant niches, as slum-dwellers take advantage of empty, underused spaces.  These three levels of design generate what I call here Multi-Level Settlements. I oppose this concept to “informal settlements” that fails to represent how slums and markets work and evolve. I thus reject the formal/informal dichotomy that persists in literature. The Multi-level concept recognises shifting alliances and multiple levels of governance as integral part of design processes. In it, design emerges as a connector of adaptive capacities. The concepts of Multi-Level Settlements, Vacant Niche and Design as a connector of adaptive capacities can help developing slum upgrading initiatives that meet the design approach naturally adopted by slum-dwellers. These initiatives can therefore acknowledge the presence of multiple alliances, which sometimes hinder—and others, foster—desired change. Community design practices can also be tailored to balance collective and individual objectives. By understanding these concepts, decision-makers can both optimize available space according to local practices and forecast how patterns will emerge in planned spaces. Finally, I encourage scholars and practitioners to further explore slum-dwellers’ design-thinking and practices to include them in mainstream design theory.

206	Monitoring de l’environnement atmosphérique en milieu urbain intégrant des images de télédétection : le cas des particules fines (PM2.5)	Epidemiological research around the world has shown that exposure of urban populations to fine microparticles (PM2.5) suspended in air from, among other things, car combustion, is responsible for many cases of lung and cardiovascular disease and even mortality. However, most of these studies examine urban centers as ensembles without considering that population exposure to microparticles is not homogeneous across an urban space. For example, individuals living near major arterial roads are much more exposed to microparticles than others living in low traffic neighborhoods. Unfortunately, ground stations measuring PM2.5 are few and far between to generate accurate microparticle concentration maps at fine scales. One way to spatialize information on microparticle concentrations is to introduce remotely sensed images that allows to calculate an optical parameter of aerosols, their optical depth. The use of medium-to-fine-resolution images is not common in this area. So, we wanted to look at their potential. Tests with hyperspectral and multispectral images at these resolutions have shown that optical depth can be estimated with enough accuracy. The AODFinder software developed for this purpose performs well. Unfortunately, the small sample of AOD values and PM2.5 concentration measurements did not allow us to conclude on the possibility of using AOD as a proxy for PM2.5 and thus on the possibility of refining microparticle monitoring at the local level.

207	Ethos d’une transfuge intellectuelle : présentation de soi dans L’écriture comme un couteau et Les années d’Annie Ernaux	"How can an author call himself an « intellectual », especially when one, such as Annie Ernaux, cumulates both the illegitimacy of a class-passer and a feminine subject? Yet, her vision of writing as a political activity and her positions in the media do assimilate her to the figure of the intellectual. This dissertation thereby aims to provide a definition of the intellectual woman, to which Annie Ernaux’s example contributes significantly. Studying the author interview L’écriture comme un couteau (2003) and her impersonal autobiography Les années (2008), I intend to show how Annie Ernaux displays the ethos of an intellectual and even moves beyond the model, while she embodies the figures of the autobiographer, the ethnologist, the ""involved"" writer, the class-passer, the head of family, and the aging woman. If she surpasses that model, isn’t it also because she primarily identifies herself as a class-passer? Driven by the class-passer’s sense of guilt and responsibility, Annie Ernaux uses the sensation of being in-between social classes to enable her writing. Therefore, her auto-socio-biographical works become a literary commitment to the dominated. The study of L’écriture comme un couteau will define the conceptual basis of Annie Ernaux’s ethos as an class-passer intellectual, while in Les années, the analysis of the narrative voices « on », « nous » and « elle » will explore how the intimate intricates itself to the social, the subjective experience to the collective memory. In other words, while studying the ethos in Annie Ernaux’s works, this dissertation examines how the author has shaped an image of herself as a legitimate class-passer intellectual within the public sphere of her time."

208	Bruit blanc ; suivi de Les dispositifs sonores dans la poésie de Marie Uguay et de Joséphine Bacon	This research-creation M.A. thesis explores the narrative avenues of the impacts of sound and its effects to control the body. The creative writing work will show the mechanisms, feelings, and the conscious or unconscious constraints that are facing different characters with the urban soundscape. Those mechanisms, whether they are interiorized or not by the characters, will open a reflexion on the dispositif, as imagined by Foucault and later interpreted by Agamben. The dispositif (or apparatus) creates, between the subjectivity on which it acts and all of the contents it holds hidden or unhidden, a « process of subjectification » or « desubjectification »: it organizes, it creates a network of forces upon the subject. Bruit blanc, the creative writing work of this thesis, places characters that are hunted by ideals of a liberation of the body by music, whether this liberation − or its failure − is spatial, temporal, social or psychic. This work will also give space to an analysis of two poetry booklets: Un thé dans la toundra/ Nipishapui nete mushuat (2013) by Joséphine Bacon and L'Outre-vie (1979) by Marie Uguay. Those authors create upon reading a sonic and vocal dimension, a sensibility − even a hypersensibility − to hearing, especially through the teueikan in Bacon's poems and through racines sonores (« sound roots ») for Uguay. Their books present many esthetical and philosophical considerations on hearing as a physical and physiological phenomenon: sound becomes a vector throughout which we can imagine subjectivity in unsettling spatial and temporal possibilities that the body seems to forbid. R.Murray Schafer names « schizophonia » the splitting between what makes the sound and what transmits it which comes with the proliferation of recording technologies. This delayed connection to music that can be produced far from the bodies of musicians (when concerning instrumental music) plays a role in this network of forces, in this apparatus that keeps our interest. How can we think those effects of decontextualisation? Bruit blanc embodies the modalities and the effects of an enunciative voice that lives with different representations of a body hearing as a receptor of delayed realities, allowing to imagine the body in unquieting ways;to think about the possibility of listening to others, and to the listening of otherness.

209	Association between timing of asthma diagnosis and medication use during pregnancy	Asthma medication use during pregnancy is recommended by international guidelines to maintain control of symptoms since poor control has been shown to increase the risk of adverse perinatal outcomes. To date, no studies have evaluated the association between the timing of new-onset asthma and the use of asthma medications during pregnancy. The objective of this study is to assess whether asthma medication use during pregnancy differs in women with asthma diagnosed during the first 19 weeks of pregnancy compared to those diagnosed 2 years before pregnancy.  We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the Quebec asthma and pregnancy database. The primary outcome was the use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), ICS/long-acting ß2-agonists (LABA) and short-acting ß2-agonists (SABA) during pregnancy defined as the number of filled prescriptions from 20 weeks of pregnancy (Cohort entry – CE –) until delivery. Oral corticosteroids (OCS) use during pregnancy was defined as the number of days of filled prescriptions from CE until delivery. Poisson regression models were used to compare the rates of asthma medication use between women diagnosed before and early in pregnancy, while adjusting for potential confounders. The secondary outcomes were the treatment dispensed at diagnosis defined as asthma medications filled at the pharmacy in the month prior and the month following the date of asthma diagnosis and adherence to ICS during follow-up estimated with the proportion of days covered (PDC).  The cohort included 1 731 women with asthma diagnosed before and 359 early in pregnancy. Women diagnosed early in pregnancy were more likely to use ICS [aRR 1.9, 95% CI 1.6–2.3] and SABA [aRR 2.0, 95% CI 1.7–2.4] than women diagnosed pre-pregnancy. No difference in the use ICS/LABA [aRR 0.9, 95% CI 0.7–1.3] and OCS [aRR 0.8, 95% CI 0.6–1.2]. The most common asthma controller and reliever dispensed in the month prior to diagnosis and the month after diagnosis were ICS and SABA, respectively, for both sub-cohorts. The mean PDC over the study follow-up among users of ICS-based controllers in women diagnosed pre-pregnancy was quite similar to those diagnosed early in pregnancy (27.7%; 95% CI 25.3–30.1 vs 24.5%; 95% CI 21.3–27.8). With respect to adherence, the linear regression model revealed that the adjusted difference in ICS adherence was not statistically significant (-3.6; 95% CI -7.9 to 0.6).  Asthma diagnosed early in pregnancy might suggest a more persistent asthma in nature due to hormonal changes requiring more use of ICS and SABA. Taking into consideration low asthma medication use and adherence during pregnancy, these results support a closer medical follow-up of asthmatic women newly diagnosed before or early in pregnancy by providing patients with educational resources about asthma management to maintain asthma under control and prevent serious perinatal outcomes.

210	La psychè sur la page : l’expérience du carnet chez Simone Weil	Self-writing has come to constitute a literary genre which is difficult to define yet is part of a long tradition offering writers various means and methods of approaching their own psyche and body of work. The publication of personal notebooks written by major authors indeed demonstrates the crucial role played by this intimate practice in the elaboration of intellectual systems. Literary studies have nevertheless tended to neglect the transformational impact of this specific form of writing. Simone Weil, a French mystic and philosopher of the 20th century, has particularly enriched the genre of self-writing. The numerous notebooks she wrote show the construction of a deep and vivid mind that associates intellectual creation with strong self-discipline. The present master’s thesis will aim at highlighting the fundamental role of the notebook within the creative process of this philosopher. Such a perspective should shed new light on certain aspects of the academic literature dedicated to Weil’s works. The Introduction of this thesis offers an overview of the Western tradition of personal notebooks, which exerted a vast influence on Weil’s writings. Since Greek antiquity, writing in the first person has been an important part of self-improvement exercises, aimed at spiritual perfection. This approach is particularly visible in the hypomnêmata – taking of notes – introduced by Greek and Roman philosophical schools and developed in early Christian monastic practices focused on self-sacrifice. Once this context has been established, the main body of the thesis will focus more specifically on Weil’s notebooks. A first chapter will present her life and works, which will then allow for a focus on certain themes present in her personal writing. I will begin by focusing on self- mastery through means of writing in the first person. Next, I will analyse the importance of subjectivity in this philosopher’s worldview, before dealing with the rich intertextuality of Weil’s notebooks. Finally, I will deal with the influence of Weil’s personal experience on her own concept of décréation. The importance of writing in the inspiration process will be of particular interest in this final chapter. The main objective of this thesis is to analyse Weil’s writings through the lens of self-writing. It additionally aims at broadening analytical perspectives on the importance of personal writing in the construction of self and insisting on the role of the notebook as a life companion for the writer.

211	Au-delà de l’arc-en-ciel : parcours, trajectoires et altérités dans le Village de Montréal	This Master’s thesis explores the diversity and heterogeneity of space within Montréal’s (gay) Village. It seeks to analyze this neighborhood beyond what its ‘commercial showcase’ might reveal at first sight. The Village’s bars and clubs, as well as its shops, community organizations and sociodemographic composition, are not thought as homogeneous, but rather mosaics of multiple people, groups and communities across space. These latter, depending on their trajectories and routes, often have different perceptions and experiences of a single place or of the Village as a whole. Based on a document analysis and interviews with six (6) LGBTQ activists, this thesis reveals multiple strategies and ways to engage space, as well as the networks and spaces within Montreal’s Village where this diversity can be experienced.

212	Les collections de littérature jeunesse à contenu LGBTQ dans les bibliothèques publiques québécoises : portrait et évaluation	The purpose of this study is to examine the stocks of young adult and children’s literature collections with LGBTQ content made available in Québec public libraries to determine whether the population is sufficiently provided for, regardless of the location and size of the city or town where they live. To carry out this research project, we used the checklist evaluation method. Collections from a sample of 41 municipal public libraries were thus examined, using a checklist of 38 young adult and children’s literature titles with LGBTQ content, published from 2003 to 2018. The collected data was subjected to statistical analysis. As with previous studies of Canadian and American public library collections, this research has shown that the level of presence of young adult and children’s literature with LGBTQ content varies considerably in all libraries, and that the size of populations, the size of collections and the budgets for printed books can’t explain all the fluctuations. Data analysis also revealed that novels with LGBTQ content for teenagers were much more likely to be held in collections than early readers’ novels and children’s picture books. The results have also shown that male homosexuality as a theme is well represented in the collections, while same sex parenthood is significantly underrepresented. However, according to the data, the picture books for children on the topic of same-sex parenthood are exactly the type of material which was the most borrowed in the sampled libraries at the time of the study. This exploratory study alone does not entirely support the conclusion that collections of young adult and children’s literature with LGBTQ content in Québec public libraries are sufficient and appropriate. However, comparing results from this research to those from other researches suggests that, overall, Quebec libraries seem to be doing well in this regard.

213	Étude des activités identifiables par les déchets reliés au jeu de balle maya au Classique terminal au site Ucanal, Guatemala	The archaeological site of Ucanal, located in the Petén region of Guatemala near the border with Belize, is a Maya site with a large population and active ceremonial centre during the Terminal Classic, a period in which other sites were wrought with political turmoil or were in the process of being abandoned. The ballcourts located in civic centers have often been researched from the perspective of formal ceremonial activities and the elite. This thesis proposes to study the debris from middens located on the outskirts of the Ucanal site ballcourt in order to study the activities practiced by spectators instead of focusing solely on the formal activities within the court itself. To do so, a holistic documentation of all the artifacts (lithic, ceramic and fauna) was conducted from excavations of ballcourt #1 of group A of Ucanal. Artifact distribution analyses between different zones of the ballcourt and between the ballcourt and other areas of the site were undertaken to identify the possible range of activities associated with Ucanal’s ballcourt. The results show that in addition to the ritual activities generally documented in the context of ball games, Ucanal's ballcourt was associated with feasting activities which involved freshwater shells and possibly the accompaniment of music and gambling.	roturiers , Ucanal , maya , ballgame , ballcourt , middens , dump , garbage , feasts , rituals , elites , commoners , Terminal Classic	en	24146.0
214	L’urbanisme tactique et ses acteurs : étude de deux cas montréalais : Viaduc 375 et le Champ des Possibles	Tactical urbanism is dedicated to the quick and flexible resolve of urban issues and allows to operate progressively and temporally on public spaces. Considering its recent developments and the notable interest from different types of actors, it seems relevant to apprehend tactical urbanism from the point of view of its main actors, active participants and instigators of projects related to this practice. This master's thesis proposes to adopt an approach based on tactical urbanism experiences in the Montreal context through a case study. The cases selected for this master's thesis are Viaduc 375 and le Champ des Possibles, which represent distinct approaches to this practice, thus making it possible to obtain a broad and pluralistic scope. This research made evident several observations of the current state of this practice, particularly on the positioning of its main actors, through a series of ten semi-structured interviews conducted with members of both projects and the use of scientific literature discussing tactical urbanism from different perspectives. The conclusions made within this master's thesis suggest that there are some important discrepancies between the visions upheld by researchers and actors of tactical urbanism. Finally, the definition of this concept is made increasingly difficult by the distorted recuperation mechanisms used by originally external actors, confirming a disunity of the concept.

215	Les enjeux de la marche en banlieue dans un contexte de vieillissement : proposition d’une stratégie pour rendre des environnements de faible densité plus favorables à la marche pour les personnes âgées	Enhancing walkability of public space for the elderly living in suburban areas often means intervening in environments that are of low density, where functions are highly segregated and where walking infrastructures are lacking in quality or simply don’t exist. While many studies have done the demonstration that high density, mix land use, and walking facilities tend to support the decision to walk among all ages, how can suburban public administrations plan fruitful interventions to support walking among the elderly? Based on available documentation, this study identifies the most relevant criteria to locate and shape interventions meant to enhance walkability of public spaces for the elderly living in existing suburbs. Based on these criteria, the study then proposes interventions for the specific suburban neighborhood of Cartier in Laval, Quebec, Canada.  This second phase of the study involves mixed methods with semi-directed interviews, walking interviews and participatory workshops to validate and bring precision to the process and criteria identified in the previous stage of study. To enhance the walkability of public space for elderly living in suburban areas, the results of this study suggest that urban intervention should at first focus on removing obstacles to walking. They also suggest that accessibility to leisure destinations as well as attractiveness of the path are part of the most relevant criteria to consider. According to those findings, interventions planned to enhance walkability of suburbs towards the elderly should take into primary account preferences related to leisure and path attractiveness. In line with the results of several recent studies on the subject, the study also concludes to the importance of involving older people in intervention processes to increase the walkability of the suburbs.

216	Entre complexité et mise en œuvre : l’interprétation de l’adaptation aux changements climatiques en contexte municipal québécois	For a long time, when facing the daunting challenge of climate changes, the emphasis has been put on the efforts to mitigate greenhouses gases emissions. Yet, when it became clear that our ecosystems were subjects to some deep transformations that were irreversible, the notion of “adaptation” slowly gain traction at the turn of the 21st century. Thus, while the municipalities, as government of proximity, are considered as increasingly important actors in this adaptation scheme, the program Climat-Municipalité offered the opportunity to four municipal entities in Quebec to produce a Climate Change Adaptation Plan (CCAP) between 2009 and 2016. The question is then raised: how is climate change adaptation interpreted at the local level in Quebec? And, to be more specific, how is the Adaptation interpreted as a process and how is Adaptation interpreted as an action? After all, one the greatest challenge of Adaptation is that difficult transition from awareness of climate issues to the operationalization of this realization, whether through concrete implementation or even through a simply better and complex understanding of the hardships faced by our society. Indeed, this global phenomenon of climate change, that can be felt throughout this planet where few ecosystems escape human influence, is at the same time a technical, psychological and sociopolitical challenge. As our analysis of the CCAP of Trois-Rivières, Sherbrooke and Laval shows, those plans represent great “first steps” in the right direction, but they are still insufficient. Their ambition, their inner mechanics and their reach are, at least for now, too limited to guarantee the stability and sustainability of territories and populations. Their mostly short-term and reactive vision helps prepare for today’s challenges but doesn’t ensure our societies the capacity to face tomorrow’s shocks.

217	L’expérience de l’eau à travers l’artefact urbain : le cas de Montréal	Like other cities, Montreal is facing global warming and increasing urbanization. As a result, heat waves intensify to the point of becoming a serious public health issue causing discomfort and death among city dwellers. Current measures to mitigate heat islands include greening and spraying water. The latter is particularly critical in the local context: Montreal has become an impervious island gradually disconnecting from its rivers and streams, losing a valuable heritage. The design of water features—like fountains, ponds, water games—could follow policies aimed at adapting to climate change and improving pedestrian environments. However, currently offered water features do not all meet the needs of users, notably in terms of universal accessibility criteria. This study will adopt a user-centred industrial design perspective to better understand how water features can foster positive and inclusive experiences among urban dwellers. We will set our ideas of design and experience by adopting a phenomenological and constructivist approach, using concepts of aesthetic experience and habitability. We will analyze our main subject according to the concept of the Human Scale City developed by architect Jan Gehl and adopted by the city of Montreal. This theoretical corpus will help us understand the contextual, social and sensory characteristics of urban water features.  First, a literature review will reveal how the historical evolution of functions and uses related to water features influences their design and popularity nowadays. Then, we will observe and compare two modern fountains to induce which qualities foster their success. In this aim, we will analyze the results of the observations on three scales: 1) the contextual and socio-cultural environment of the neighborhood, 2) the integration to the surrounding built environment, and 3) the users and their interactions with the water feature.  Our main goal is to study the urban experience of water and demonstrate the relevance of the design approach to tackle the modern city challenges. Thus, we hope to sensitize the various actors involved in the implementation of urban water features, and more broadly contribute to the corpus on the impact of the design on the public space.	artefact urbain , industrial design , user experience , urban artefact , water feature , human scale , water , city , fountain	en	24117.0
218	Design de jeux pour la santé : utilisation de jeux sérieux pour favoriser l’adhésion aux exercices thérapeutiques chez des jeunes patients atteints de fibrose kystique	At around the age of 7 years old, younger patients diagnosed with cystic fibrosis (CF) are usually prescribed a new therapy using positive expiratory pressure (PEP). For PEP therapy, patients are required to perform a series of repetitive and methodical breathing exercises to improve lung capacity among other health benefits. However, these exercises can be boring and demotivating for young children. As a result, daily adherence rate to PEP therapy is less than 50%. In turn, this affects the quality of life and long-term health of patients as well as directly impacting their families. In the education and health sectors, serious games are already used with children to help them with learning, therapy and even physical rehabilitation. Serious games leverage the fun and interactive aspects of video games to motivate and improve the commitment of the player to learn the targeted material or adhere to a specific health behaviour. This research-creation project seeks to validate the efficacy of using games specially designed to help patients adhere to PEP therapy exercises more regularly. The objective is to encourage them to get involved in their daily exercises and to facilitate the learning and application of the breathing techniques. This playful approach ultimately aims to improve the quality of life of CF children over time. Leveraging a multi and interdisciplinary collaboration between students from University of Montreal and specialists from the CF clinic at CHU Ste-Justine, three games prototypes and an electronic device prototype, used to control the games, were developed for the most popular PEP device in North America (PariPEP®). The games and electronic device prototypes were tested at the CF clinic, within the hospital for children, as part of a pilot study with 10 young patients, aged from 8 to 10 years old.

219	Development and inter-rater reliability of a tool assessing hypnotic communication behaviours adopted by nurses caring for children with cancer : The Sainte-Justine Hypnotic Communication Assessment Scale	Background Several studies in pediatric oncology have shown the successful effects of using hypnotic communication techniques (HCTech) during painful medical procedures. Since no studies assessed the precise use of these techniques with a validated tool, it is unsure that the observed relationships involve the use of HCTech.  Objectives To develop a scale evaluating healthcare professionals’ behaviours when using HCTech and to evaluate its inter-rater reliability.  Methods This study involved the preliminary steps of the Sainte-Justine Hypnotic Communication Assessment Scale (SJ-HCAS) development process. As part of a larger intervention study, the SJ-HCAS was developed in three steps by five experts and four lay raters using an iterative process applied to subsets of video-recorded nurse-patient interactions. The development aimed to maximize clarity and precision of items as well as minimize redundancy amongst items. Inter-rater reliability was assessed in a randomly selected sample of 1/3 of collected video-recorded interactions (n = 42).  Results The final version of the scale is composed of 11 items categorized in two domains pertaining to Relationship and Technique. We found excellent inter-rater reliability for both subscores and total score in two independent inter-rater comparisons (median ICC = 0.879), with most items showing very good to perfect inter-rater reliability (median Kappa = 0.847).  Conclusions The results support further work with the SJ-HCAS. The scale has the potential to help ensure the integrity of hypnotic communication training in children which could ultimately promote the dissemination of the practice of HCTech.

220	Waking EEG functional connectivity in middle-aged and older adults with obstructive sleep apnea	Objectives: The present study aimed at investigating changes in waking electroencephalography (EEG), most specifically regarding spectral power and functional connectivity, in middle-aged and older adults with OSA. We also explored whether changes in spectral power or functional connectivity are associated with polysomnographic characteristics and/or neuropsychological performance. Methods: 19 OSA subjects (apnea-hypopnea index ≥ 20, age: 63.6 ± 6.4) and 22 controls (apneahypopnea index ≤ 10, age: 63.6 ± 6.7) underwent a full night of in-laboratory polysomnography followed by a waking EEG and a neuropsychological assessment. Waking EEG spectral power and imaginary coherence were compared between groups for all EEG frequency bands and scalp regions. Correlation analyses were performed between selected waking EEG variables, polysomnographic parameters and neuropsychological performance. Results: No group difference was observed for EEG spectral power for any frequency band. Regarding the imaginary coherence, when compared to controls, OSA subjects showed decreased EEG connectivity between frontal and temporal regions in theta and alpha bands as well as increased connectivity between frontal and parietal regions in delta and beta 1 bands. In the OSA group, these changes in connectivity correlated with lower sleep efficiency, lower total sleep time and higher apnea-hypopnea index. No relationship was found with neuropsychological performance. Conclusions: Contrary to spectral power, imaginary coherence was sensitive enough to detect changes in brain function in middle-aged and older subjects with OSA when compared to controls. Whether these changes in cerebral connectivity predict cognitive decline needs to be investigated longitudinally.

221	Whole genome sequencing of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus 2 (PRRSV) from field clinical samples improves the genomic surveillance of the virus	Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is a major economic concern worldwide. There are currently large data sets available about the ORF5 gene of the virus, with thousands of sequences available, but little data are currently available on the full-length genome of PRRSV. We hypothesized that whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of the PRRSV genome would allow better epidemiological monitoring than ORF5 gene sequencing. PRRSV PCR-positive serum, oral fluid, and tissue clinical samples submitted to the diagnostic laboratory for routine surveillance or diagnosis of PRRSV infection in Québec, Canada, swine herds were used. The PRRSV reverse transcription-quantitative PCR Cq values of the processed samples varied between 11.5 and 34.34. PRRSV strain genomes were isolated using a poly (A)-tail method and were sequenced with a MiSeq Illumina sequencer. Ninetytwo full-length PRRSV genomes were obtained from 88 clinical samples out of 132 tested samples, resulting in a PRRSV WGS success rate of 66.67%. Three important deletions in ORF1a were found in most wild-type (i.e., not vaccine-like) strains. The importance of these deletions remains undetermined. Two different full-length PRRSV genomes were found in four different samples (three serum samples and one pool of tissues), suggesting a 4.55% PRRSV strain coinfection prevalence in swine. Moreover, six PRRSV whole genomes (6.52% of PRRSV strains) were found to cluster differently than they did under the ORF5 classification method. Overall, WGS of PRRSV enables better strain classification and/or interpretation of results in 9.10% of clinical samples than ORF5 sequencing, as well as allowing interesting research avenues.

222	Analysis of whole-genome sequences of infectious laryngotracheitis virus isolates from poultry flocks in Canada : evidence of recombination	Infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV) is a herpes virus that causes an acute respiratory disease of poultry known as infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT). Chicken embryo origin (CEO) and tissue culture origin (TCO) live attenuated vaccines are routinely used for the control of ILT. However, vaccine virus is known to revert to virulence, and it has been recently shown that ILT field viral strains can undergo recombination with vaccinal ILTV and such recombinant ILT viruses possess greater transmission and pathogenicity potential. Based on complete or partial genes of the ILTV genome, few studies genotyped ILTV strains circulating in Canada, and so far, information is scarce on whole-genome sequencing or the presence of recombination in Canadian ILTV isolates. The objective of this study was to genetically characterize the 14 ILTV isolates that originated from three provinces in Canada (Alberta, British Columbia and Quebec). To this end, a phylogenetic analysis of 50 ILTV complete genome sequences, including 14 sequences of Canadian origin, was carried out. Additional phylogenetic analysis of the unique long, unique short and inverted repeat regions of the ILTV genome was also performed. We observed that 71%, 21% and 7% of the ILTV isolates were categorized as CEO revertant, wild-type and TCO vaccine-related, respectively. The sequences were also analyzed for potential recombination events, which included evidence in the British Columbia ILTV isolate. This event involved two ILTV vaccine (CEO) strains as parental strains. Recombination analysis also identified that one ILTV isolate from Alberta as a potential parental strain for a United States origin ILTV isolate. The positions of the possible recombination breakpoints were identified. These results indicate that the ILTV wild-type strains can recombine with vaccinal strains complicating vaccine-mediated control of ILT. Further studies on the pathogenicity of these ILTV strains, including the recombinant ILTV isolate are currently ongoing.

223	Validity of actigraphy for nighttime sleep monitoring in hospitalized patients with traumatic injuries	Study objectives: Sleep-wake disturbances are frequent among patients hospitalized for traumatic injuries but remain poorly documented due to the lack of tools validated for hospitalized patients. This study aimed to validate actigraphy for nighttime sleep monitoring of hospitalized patients with severe traumatic injuries, using ambulatory polysomnography (PSG).  Methods: We tested 17 patients (30.4 ± 14.7 years, 16.6 ± 8.2 days post-injury) who suffered severe orthopedic injuries and/or spinal cord injury, with or without traumatic brain injury. When medically stable, patients wore an actigraph on a non-paralyzed arm and underwent ambulatory PSG at the bedside. Data were converted to one-minute epochs. The following parameters were calculated for the nighttime period: total sleep time, total wake time, sleep efficiency and number of awakenings. Epoch-by-epoch concordance between actigraphy and PSG was analyzed to derive sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. PSG sleep parameters were compared to those obtained from four actigraphy scoring algorithms by Bland-Altman plotting. Results: Sensitivity to detect sleep was ≥92% and accuracy was >85% for all four actigraphy algorithms used, while specificity varied from 48-60%. The low-activity wake threshold (20 activity counts per epoch) was most closely associated with PSG on all sleep parameters. This scoring algorithm also had the highest specificity (59.9%) and strong sensitivity (92.8%).  Conclusions: Actigraphy is valid for monitoring nighttime sleep and wakefulness in patients hospitalized with traumatic injuries, with sensitivity, specificity and accuracy comparable to actigraphic recordings in healthy subjects. A scoring algorithm using a low wake threshold is best suited for this population and setting.	Actigraphy , Sleep , Acute care , Polysomnography , Traumatic brain injury	en	24054.0
224	Glycine and hyperammonemia : potential target for the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy	Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a neuropsychiatric disorder caused by hepatic dysfunction. Numerous studies dictate that ammonia plays an important role in the pathogenesis of HE, and hyperammonemia can lead to alterations in amino acid homeostasis. Glutamine and glycine are both ammoniagenic amino acids that are increased in liver failure. Modulating the levels of glutamine and glycine has shown to reduce ammonia concentration in hyperammonemia. Ornithine Phenylacetate (OP) has consistently been shown to reduce arterial ammonia levels in liver failure by modulating glutamine levels. In addition to this, OP has also been found to modulate glycine concentration providing an additional ammonia removing effect. Data support that glycine also serves an important role in N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor mediated neurotransmission in HE. This potential important role for glycine in the pathogenesis of HE merits further investigations.	Ammonia , Glutamine , Glycine , L-ornithine-phenylacetate (OP) , Phenylacetylglycine	en	24042.0
225	Eugenol and other vanilloids hamper caenorhabditis elegans response to noxious heat	Eugenol, a known vanilloid, was frequently used in dentistry as a local analgesic in addition, antibacterial and neuroprotective effects were also reported. Eugenol, capsaicin and many vanilloids are interacting with the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) in mammals and the TRPV1 is activated by noxious heat. The pharmacological manipulation of the TRPV1 has been shown to have therapeutic value. Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) express TRPV orthologs (e.g. OCR-2, OSM-9) and it is a commonly used animal model system to study nociception as it displays a well-defined and reproducible nocifensive behavior. After exposure to vanilloid solutions, C. elegans wild type (N2) and mutants were placed on petri dishes divided in quadrants for heat stimulation. Thermal avoidance index was used to phenotype each tested C. elegans experimental groups. The results showed that eugenol, vanillin and zingerone can hamper nocifensive response of C. elegans to noxious heat (32-35 °C) following a sustained exposition. Also, the effect was reversed 6 h post exposition. Furthermore, eugenol and vanillin did not target specifically the OCR-2 or OSM-9 but zingerone did specifically target the OCR-2 similarly to capsaicin. Further structural and physicochemical analyses were performed. Key parameters for quantitative structure-property relationships (QSPR), quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) and frontier orbital analyses suggest similarities and dissimilarities amongst the tested vanilloids and capsaicin in accordance with the relative anti-nociceptive effects observed.

226	Elevated serum liver-type fatty acid binding protein levels in non-acetaminophen acute liver failure patients with organ dysfunction.	Liver-type fatty acid binding protein (FABP1) has previously been        demonstrated to improve prognostic discrimination in acetaminophen (APAP)-induced        ALF but has not been investigated in other etiologies of ALF. AIM: To determine        whether FABP1 levels (early: admission or late: days 3-5) are associated with 21-day        transplant-free survival in non-APAP ALF. METHODS: FABP1 was measured in serum        samples from 384 ALF patients (n = 88 transplant-free survivors (TFS), n = 296        died/LT-NTFS) using solid-phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and analyzed with        US ALFSG registry data. RESULTS: Of 384 ALF patients (autoimmune hepatitis n = 125,        drug-induced liver injury n = 141, Hepatitis B n = 118), 177 (46%) patients received        LT. Early FABP1 levels were significantly higher in ALF patients requiring        vasopressor support (203.4 vs. 76.3 ng/mL) and renal replacement therapy (203.4 vs.        78.8 ng/mL; p < 0.001 for both). Late FABP1 levels were significantly higher in        patients requiring mechanical ventilation (77.5 vs. 53.3 ng/mL), vasopressor support        (116.4 vs. 53.3 ng/mL) and in patients with grade 3/4 hepatic encephalopathy (71.4        vs. 51.4 ng/mL; p = 0.03 for all). Late FABP1 levels were significantly lower in TFS        patients (TFS 54 vs. NTFS 66 ng/mL; p = 0.049) but not admission (TFS 96 vs. NTFS        87 ng/mL; p = 0.67). After adjusting for significant covariates, serum FABP1 did not        discriminate significantly between TFS and patients who died/received LT at day 21        either on admission (p = 0.29) or late (days 3-5, p = 0.087) time points.        CONCLUSION: In this first report of FABP1 in non-APAP ALF, FABP1 levels at late time        points (days 3-5) were significantly lower in ALF patients who were alive without        transplant at day 21 but not after adjusting for covariates reflecting severity of        illness. Higher FABP1 levels were associated with the presence of increased organ        failure.

228	Evolution and integration of the Greek community of Greater Montreal : a perspective across three generations	The research aims to explore the experiences in the city of three generations of Greek-Canadians over a period of roughly 60 years. By tracing the evolution of Montreal’s Greek community, this project aims to identify how a city goes from having ethnic neighbourhoods to having ethnicities living fluidly in its urban neighbourhoods. Previously, ethnic neighbourhoods existed as a physical space within the city. With new mobilities, ethnicities continue to live within the physical space of the city, but now also exist beyond it, moving through it, and changing how each subsequent generation identifies with its heritage and community of belonging. To achieve this goal and gain a better understanding, a series of semi-directed interviews were conducted. On the one hand, these interviews allowed for the mapping of different places in which daily life is based in at different key moments of immigration (arrival and subsequent settlements) and, on the other hand, explored the experiences and meanings associated with these places, where identities, attachments, and feelings of familiarity are discussed. The qualitative analysis of these allowed to construct a larger picture to see how each generation shapes and takes shape from the city. Three experiences in the city are brought to light: for the first generation, home and community take place in a foreign city; for the second generation, they live in a community firmly established within the metropolitan area, and for the third generation, they live in a community that has dispersed into socio-spatial hubs. This research allowed to confirm the existing literature of spatial assimilation among the Greek-Canadian diaspora, while also opening avenues to new ways of looking at this kind of assimilation through the lens of mobility.

229	Un modèle cognitif de l’apprentissage de la compétence « agir avec humanisme » d’un programme de formation en sciences infirmières basé sur une approche par compétences	"Several papers illustrate the outcomes of humanization and dehumanization of care for patients. Educators and researchers are testing many promising educational strategies aimed at promoting humanization of care. However, little is known about the development of the “humanistic caring” competency.  This thesis presents a phenomenological study aimed at elaborating a cognitive learning model (CLM) of the “humanistic caring” competency, from the lived experiences of nursing students and graduates of a competency-based program, and to identify related developmental indicators. A conceptual perspective combining nursing, the Humanistic Model of Nursing Care – UdeM (HMNC-UdeM) developed by Cara et al. (2016), and education, a conception about competency development (Tardif, 2006), oriented the study. The humanistic philosophy at the roots of the HMNC-UdeM was scrutinized and analyzed in the context of five conceptual models. An analysis of the HMNC-UdeM, based on Chinn and Kramer’s method (2018), was also carried out.  Benner’s (1994) interpretive phenomenology, grounded in the philosophical foundations of Heidegger (1927/2008), was used as the study methodology. The participants (n = 26), students and nurses, were recruited into six groups based on their progression in the education program and their clinical experience. Individual interviews were conducted, and the stories collected were transcribed and analyzed according to an operationalization of Benner’s (1994) phenomenological perspective.  The CLM of the “humanistic caring” competency comprised five developmental stages: 1) conscientization to humanization of care, 2) assimilation of communication skills integrated in a humanistic approach, 3) reconciliation of an ideal of humanistic practice with the responsibilities of a nurse, 4) integration of a humanistic approach in nursing care, and 5) mastery of a humanistic approach in the work environment. Other results showed that a development of ""humanistic caring"" began before studying nursing and that it was different from one student to another.  The results also highlighted facilitators and constraints to the development of ""humanistic caring"" residing in both educational institutions and healthcare facilities. These included the presence of humanistic role models and environments that promote humanization of care, and the work overload, that impedes it. The participants also suggested recommendations aimed at optimizing the development of ""humanistic caring"", and these were highly consistent with the aforementioned facilitators and constraints.  Implications for the five domains of practice emerge from this study and offer some avenues that could promote the development of ""humanistic caring"". One of them is to facilitate the entry into the nursing profession after graduation, a turning point where the development of ""humanistic caring"" has proven to be the most vulnerable."

230	Étude et réappropriation du geste volontaire du musicien improvisateur dans le cadre d'une composition électroacoustique	This thesis looks at improvised music and its relationship to the stage through my experience and that of thirteen personalities from the arts world with whom I have had privileged interviews. The essence of this approach is to observe how creators use improvisation in concert situations or simply as a research method using digital or analog tools. This panorama allows me to put my composition and research work in perspective at a time when, as a creator, I have turned towards digital music after many years of writing and stage performance in the field of jazz and improvisational music. In passing, the causality of the gesture during performance with digital tools is problematic. The thesis first retraces a brief journey through improvised music - more particularly what is called musique actuelle or free improvisation. Through this overview, a few questions of nomenclature and aesthetics will be raised in order to better understand the issues specific to this music. The reflection continues with interviews through which I explore comprovisation, DJing, digital musical instruments, dance and composition. The reflection culminates around five of my works written in collaboration with the improvised music and dance communities.	improvisation , comprovisation , réappropriation , DJing , indétermination , Digital music , Dance , Reappropriation , Gesture , Indeterminacy	en	23965.0
231	Discursivités de l'islamisme dans les littératures francophones des pays à majorité musulmane	"The twenty-first century is only just beginning and we can already see what the future conflicts will be like. In the United States, Canada or Europe, debates are more and more insistent on the questions of identity and the need to define itself in relation to the ""Other"". The need to define itself, but also more and more the need to protect ""who we are"" in the face of a world where everything is changing. In this thesis, I propose to read some of the most committed writers of their time within the Francophonie. Chahdortt Djavann, Amin Maalouf, Boualem Sansal and Atiq Rahimi are all from predominantly Muslim countries. Their literature is unquestionably an opened window on the cultures of their regions. But their literature is also an important material for the academic world for a better understanding of the times we live. I would like to use this corpus to understand an issue that has been at the center of the news for almost twenty years: Islamism. What is it about ? A culture ? A religion ? And in particular, what are the relations that the literary text has with this phenomenon? Asking the right questions and answering them in the most objective way is certainly the first step towards a better mutual understanding between two regions that must necessarily coexist in harmony: East and West."	postcolonialisme , Islamism , East , West , postcolonialism , interdiscursivity	en	23945.0
232	Coût-efficacité en vie réelle du ticagrélor : double thérapie antiplaquettaire pour l'infarctus du myocarde au Québec, Canada	In Canada, there are approximately 21,000 deaths and 84,069 hospitalizations related to myocardial infarction (MI) per year, representing approximately Can$1.27 billion in direct costs related to acute and chronic care. Despite the demonstrated health benefits of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after an MI, observed real-world persistence to treatment with ticagrelor-based DAPT in Québec is lower than that observed with other P2Y12 receptor inhibitors. The objective of this project was to develop a decision-making model to evaluate the cost-utility ratio of ticagrelor-DAPT under conditions of imperfect persistence in Quebec patients suffering from MI, and thus to determine whether a province-wide intervention to increase persistence would be justifiable. A decision tree describing the patient course in the first year following an MI was developed in order to compare four different durations of persistence with perfect adherence with ticagrelor-DAPT (3, 6, 9 and 12 months) to perfect adherence with a 12-month regimen clopidogrel-DAPT (reference treatment). Three clinical events were modeled: recurrent MI, cardiovascular death and major bleeding. The probabilities of these events were extracted from relevant randomized clinical trials using published Kaplan-Meier survival curves. The utilities needed to calculate the QALYs were derived from the literature. The costs were estimated from the Canadian literature and the list of medications from the Régie de l'assurance maladie du Québec and were expressed in Can$ 2018. The reference case analysis consisted of a probabilistic Monte Carlo simulation. At a mean cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained of Can$43,398, the results of the base case analysis showed that 3 months of ticagrelor-DAPT had a 59.31% likelihood of being considered cost-effective using a willingness-to-pay threshold of Can$50,000/QALY. Moreover, the sensitivity analyses showed that the cost-effectiveness of ticagrelor-DAPT was sensitive to the cost of cardiovascular death and the cost of ticagrelor. Assuming a cost of ticagrelor compatible with a generic drug, the 4 durations of persistence with ticagrelor-DAPT are almost guaranteed to be profitable. When a generic cost of ticagrelor was assumed, 3 months, 6 months and 9 months of ticagrelor-DAPT were dominant and 12 months of ticagrelor-DAPT were highly likely to be cost-effective (98.8%). This analysis also conclude that as little as 3 months of ticagrelor-DAPT is likely to be cost-effective compared to 12 months of clopidogrel-DAPT. With a moderate to strong level of evidence, we therefore conclude that no specific intervention is warranted at the provincial policy level to improve persistence rate with ticagrelor treatment after MI.

234	Predicting early post-stroke aphasia outcome from initial aphasia severity	Background: The greatest degree of language recovery in post-stroke aphasia takes place within the first weeks. Aphasia severity and lesion measures have been shown to be good predictors of long-term outcomes. However, little is known about their implications in early spontaneous recovery. The present study sought to determine which factors better predict early language outcomes in individuals with post-stroke aphasia. Methods: Twenty individuals with post-stroke aphasia were assessed <72 h (acute) and 10–14 days (subacute) after stroke onset. We developed a composite score (CS) consisting of several linguistic sub-tests: repetition, oral comprehension and naming. Lesion volume, lesion load and diffusion measures [fractional anisotropy (FA) and axial diffusivity (AD)] from both arcuate fasciculi (AF) were also extracted using MRI scans performed at the same time points. A series of regression analyses were performed to predict the CS at the second assessment. Results: Among the diffusion measures, only FA from right AF was found to be a significant predictor of early subacute aphasia outcome. However, when combined in two hierarchical models with FA, age and either lesion load or lesion size, the initial aphasia severity was found to account for most of the variance (R 2 = 0.678), similarly to the complete models (R 2 = 0.703 and R 2 = 0.73, respectively). Conclusions: Initial aphasia severity was the best predictor of early post-stroke aphasia outcome, whereas lesion measures, though highly correlated, show less influence on the prediction model. We suggest that factors predicting early recovery may differ from those involved in long-term recovery.

235	A narrative inquiry into a female athlete’s experiences with protracted concussion symptoms	This article explores a female university volleyball student-athlete’s experience with protracted concussion symptoms. Through the methodology of narrative inquiry, four salient themes became apparent related to Daphnée’s experiences: (a) “I felt so alone,” (b) “I had to make one of the hardest decisions of my life,” (c) “I feel like I’m in prison,” and (d) “There’s no light at the end of the tunnel.” Overall, this study offers a rare look into the impact of concussion on an individual’s athletic and academic identities, career progression, and in turn, her imagined stories of who she was and who she was becoming.

236	Concussion education : is it making a difference?	In response to the growing concern about concussions, experts have stated a need to educate athletes and members of the sport environment about the injury. Although the type of information that should be included in concussion education has generally been agreed upon (e.g., signs and symptoms, management strategies, long-term sequelae), it is not clear at this point the best way to disseminate this information. Most initiatives have used printed educational materials and web-based platforms such as websites and social networking sites to deliver concussion education. Evidence about the effectiveness of these modalities is currently either inconclusive or has suggested that they are not effective when used as a standalone strategy. There have also been some concussion education interventions published in the literature. Results of the interventions suggests there are short-term improvements in knowledge, but limited effect on knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors beyond three months. This chapter provides an overview of contemporary concussion education efforts and discusses implications for future research and practice.

237	A tutorial on dealing with time‐varying eligibility for treatment: Comparing the risk of major bleeding with direct‐acting oral anticoagulants vs warfarin	In this tutorial, we focus on the problem of how to define and estimate treatment effects when some patients develop a contraindication and are thus ineligible to receive a treatment of interest during follow-up. We first describe the concept of positivity, which is the requirement that all subjects in an analysis be eligible for all treatments of interest conditional on their baseline covariates, and the extension of this concept in the longitudinal treatment setting. We demonstrate using simulated datasets and regression analysis that under violations of longitudinal positivity, typical associational estimates between treatment over time and the outcome of interest may be misleading depending on the data-generating structure. Finally, we explain how one may define “treatment strategies,” such as “treat with medication unless contraindicated,” to overcome the problems linked to time-varying eligibility. Finally, we show how contrasts between the expected potential outcomes under these strategies may be consistently estimated with inverse probability weighting methods. We provide R code for all the analyses described.

238	Have we reproduced Rat Park? Conceptual but not direct replication of the protective effects of social and environmental enrichment in addiction	The Rat Park studies are classic experiments in addiction neuroscience, yet they have not been successfully replicated directly and several serious methodological criticisms have been raised. However, the conceptual reproducibility of the Rat Park studies is supported by both contemporaneous and subsequent research. Contemporaneous research on social and environmental enrichment frequently found social isolation rendered rats less sensitive to the effects of drugs of abuse. The Rat Park studies therefore confirmed the importance of social and environmental enrichment and extended this literature to suggest that enrichment reduced opioid consumption. Subsequent studies have also demonstrated social and environmental enrichment reduces drug consumption. However, there are also several papers reporting no effects of enrichment (or ‘negative’ results) and caveats from studies that show genes, age, sex and drug of abuse are all important parameters. While the Rat Park studies did not use methods that are reliable by current standards, enrichment has been shown to reliably reduce opioid consumption and this effect can generalise to other drugs of abuse.

239	Carrière criminelle lucrative et désistement assisté	Research on assisted desistance focuses on how formal or informal interventions support the cessation of criminal activity. As interest in this subject is relatively recent, knowledge in the area is still in the early stages and there is little empirical work on how the characteristics of criminal involvement influence receptiveness to intervention. For example, although the majority of crimes are motivated by monetary gain, there is little information about the desistance of persons involved in lucrative crimes. This study, which is based on the narratives of 27 people who had committed such crimes, examines perceptions of assistance received. We looked first at the nature of the assistance in the desistance process and then determined when and how this assistance was related to the life course of respondents. Our findings show the importance of understanding the process that leads to the end of the criminal career, as assisted desistance facilitated the abandonment of criminal behavior in the majority of the individual trajectories studied. Results also show that assistance can take different forms, that it acts in two distinct ways, and that it can take place at different times in the desistance process.

241	La couverture de la crise soudanaise dans la presse montréalaise, 1885-1904.	This master’s thesis focuses on the Sudanese crisis coverage within Montreal popular press at the end of the 19th century. This comparative study of the narrations of the Anglo-French rivalry produced by La Presse and the Montreal Daily Star shows that, in the Quebec context, two main political cultures coexist: imperialism and nationalism. This thesis coverts a period starting in 1885 with the first report, by La Presse, about British interventions in the Soudan, leading toward the Fashoda crisis in 1898. The study period ends with the signature of the Entente cordiale in 1904, which bring an end to the main colonial rivalries between the United Kingdom and France. This research concludes that, first, the Montreal Daily Star shows an Anglophone political culture tied to Canadian imperialism; the newspaper preserves and even reinforces this perspective during all the study period. Then, on the other hand, La Presse tends to draw away from this ideology and reveal Canadian nationalism.	Popular press , 19th century , Fashoda , Nationalism , Imperialism	en	23840.0
242	Using virtual reality to treat subclinical health anxiety : a pilot study comparing physiological reactions between younger and older adults to determine its usefulness	Problem: Traditional exposure strategies (in vivo and imaginal) commonly used to treat health anxiety are not always applicable to seniors with mobility loss or cognitive difficulties. Virtual reality (VR) immersion may be an alternative solution, but no studies have tested its usefulness with seniors who are concerned about their health. Objective and hypotheses: To determine whether a virtual hospital waiting room generates anxiety (measured by two physiological reactions: heart rate and skin conductance) in elderly people suffering from subclinical health anxiety. H1: Anxious participants (regardless of age) will have higher physiological reactions (vs. baseline or T1) than non-anxious participants during immersion in the waiting room. H2: Compared to anxious elderly individuals, anxious young people will have significantly greater physiological reactions (vs T1) during immersion in the waiting room. Method: The physiological reactions of four groups (n = 30) of young adults (18-35 years of age) and seniors (65 years of age and older) with or without subclinical health anxiety were compared before (T1) and during (T3) an immersion session in a virtual hospital waiting room. To ensure that physiological reactions were not caused simply by being exposed to a virtual environment, participants were exposed to a neutral virtual environment (T2) between these two measurement times. Multi-level analyses were carried out to test both hypotheses. Results: Anxious participants experienced a significantly higher increase in heart rate (vs. non-anxious group) during immersion (T2: β = 8.77, p=0.045; T3: β = 9.73, p=0.03), but no significant difference between the two groups was observed on the skin conductance measure (T2: β = 0.30, p = 0.70; T3: β = 0.47, p = 0.55). In addition, the heart rate of anxious participants did not increase significantly between T2 (neutral environment) and T3 (waiting room) (β = -0.04, p = 0.97). Finally, compared to anxious elderly participants, anxious young individuals did not experience a significantly greater increase in their heart rate (T2: β = 1.92, p = 0.83; T3: β = -1.51, p = 0.87) and skin conductance (T2: β = -0.65, p = 0.65; T3: β = -0.79, p = 0.58) during immersion. Conclusion: The virtual waiting room does not generate more physiological reactivity in older individuals with health concerns than the neutral virtual environment. Since this pilot study was conducted with participants with subclinical health anxiety, further research is needed to test the usefulness of the virtual waiting room with clinical populations.

243	Étude électrophysiologique du balayage de la mémoire à court terme acoustique : décours temporel et effet de force de la trace mnésique	We aimed to understand better the processes involved in acoustic short-term memory retrieval using electrophysiology. We used a modified Sternberg task in which participants had to encode two, four, or six pure non-musical tones (out of the well-tempered musical scale) that cannot be readily recoded verbally. After a silent retention interval, we presented them with a probe tone and they had to report its presence or absence in the memory set. By using multiple load conditions, and by controlling for stimulation duration, we compared the serial position effects, as well as the load effects, on behavioral and electrophysiological data during memory scanning. In particular, we found a recency effect, similar across loads, where shorter response times, near perfect accuracy, and an increased P3 amplitude in the event-related potential (ERP) data were observed. Serial position data for all other positions were similar regardless of the memory load and showed lower performances (response times and accuracy), as well as smaller P3 components. We also performed a signal decomposition analysis, the independent component analysis (ICA), which allowed us to observe and describe better the time courses of the electrophysiological data for the retrieval of a perfectly memorised tone (the last one), and a lesser memorised one (any other serial position). Our results suggest the existence of two subtypes of sensory memory.

244	Dynamique épistémologique de la science : défense d'une gestion pragmatique des problèmes complexes	"This thesis proposes an analysis of the epistemological role of complex scientific problems. Starting from the epistemological holism inherited from the philosophical positions of Pierre Duhem and Willard Van Orman Quine, and from the thesis that scientific practice is always based on a recognized theoretical and conceptual field, we develop a management model that proposes that researchers adopt a pragmatic attitude to react to complex problems. We explain in this research that these problems affect the applicability of theories and concepts that form scientific knowledge. To solve them, we must initiate research that will follow the steps of a pragmatic process to progressively assess the situation and gain a better understanding. During this period, the negative consequences of the complex problem are tolerated in order to ensure the maintenance of the scientific activities that it directly targets, or not, the achievement of a solution. The thesis defended in this study is that the management of the complex problems that it proposes is concluded by the rational elaboration, framed by pragmatic decisions and a favorable conjuncture, of an ad hoc hypothesis offering a solution to the problem. If the scientific community recognizes the epistemological value of this hypothesis, it will be integrated into the theoretical and conceptual field which will have the effect of enriching scientific knowledge and giving back to science its ""normal"" status."

245	Prediction of the transaction confirmation time in Ethereum Blockchain	Blockchain offers a decentralized, immutable, transparent system of records. It offers a peer-to-peer network of nodes with no centralised governing entity making it ‘unhackable’ and therefore, more secure than the traditional paper based or centralised system of records like banks etc. While there are certain advantages to the paper based recording approach, it does not work well with digital relationships where the data is in constant flux. Unlike traditional channels, governed by centralized entities, blockchain offers its users a certain level of anonymity by providing capabilities to interact without disclosing their personal identities and allows them to build trust without a third-party governing entity.  Due to the aforementioned characteristics of blockchain, more and more users around the globe are inclined towards making a digital transaction via blockchain than via rudimentary channels. Therefore, there is a dire need for us to gain insight on how these transactions are processed by the blockchain and how much time it may take for a peer to confirm a transaction and add it to the blockchain network.      In this thesis, we aim to introduce a novel approach that would allow one to estimate the time (in block time or otherwise) it would take for Ethereum Blockchain to accept and confirm a transaction to a block using machine learning. We explore two of the most fundamental machine learning approaches, i.e., Classification and Regression in order to determine which of the two would be more accurate to make confirmation time prediction in the Ethereum blockchain. More specifically, we explore Naïve Bayes classifier, Random Forest classifier and Multilayer Perceptron classifier for the classification approach. Since most transactions in the network are confirmed well within the average confirmation time of two block confirmations or 15 seconds, we also discuss ways to tackle the skewed dataset problem encountered in case of the classification approach. We also aim to compare the predictive accuracy of two machine learning regression models- Random Forest Regressor and Multilayer Perceptron against previously proposed statistical regression models under a set evaluation criterion; the objective is to determine whether machine learning offers a more accurate predictive model than conventional statistical models.

246	Hierarchical Bayesian optimization of targeted motor outputs with spatiotemporal neurostimulation	The idea for this thesis by article sprung from the following question: can we use neural prostheses to stimulate specific muscles in order to help recovery of motor control after stroke or cervical injury? This question is of crucial importance to 15 million people each year around the globe, and is at the heart of Numa Dancause and Marco Bonizzato’s research, our collaborators in the Neuroscience department at the University of Montreal. It is now possible to implant large capacity electrodes for electrical stimulation in cortex, but still difficult to predict their effect on the brain and the rest of the body. Nevertheless, preliminary but promising results on rats and monkeys have shown that a non-negligible motor recovery is obtained after stimulation of regions of motor cortex that are still functional. The difficulties related to optimal microcortical stimulation hence consist in finding both one of these regions, and a stimulation protocol with optimal recovery efficacy. This search has up to present day been performed by hand, but recent and upcoming large scale stimulation technologies permitting delivery of spatio-temporal signals are making such exhaustive searches impossible.A promising approach to automating and optimizing this discovery is the use of Bayesian optimization. My work has consisted in developing and refining such techniques with two scientific questions in mind: (1) how can we evoke complex movements by chaining cortical microstimulations?, and (2) can these outperform single channel stimulations in terms of recovery efficacy? We present in the main article of this thesis our hierarchical Bayesian optimization approach which uses gaussian processes to exploit known properties of the brain to speed up the search, as well as first results answering question 1. We leave to future work a definitive answer to the second question.	BCI , Stimulation Corticale , Cortical Stimulation , Gaussian Processes , Bayesian Optimization	en	23785.0
247	Recentrement de masculinités ridicules dans les comédies québécoises : un mémoire proféministe	In Quebec, the most popular and successful film genre is without a doubt comedy. These movies are the most successful at the national Box Office and are usually appreciated by both critics and audiences alike. From a “profeminist” perspective, this thesis aims to demonstrate how representations of masculinity, or masculinities, become a means to provoke laughter in six Quebec comedies: Les Boys (Saia 1997), Québec-Montréal (Trogi 2002), Horloge biologique (Trogi 2005), Les 3’ptits cochons (Huard 2007), De père en flic (Gaudreault 2009) and De père en flic 2 (Gaudreault 2017). In these movies, men are portrayed as being self-centered, horny, competitive, immature, dumb or even “unmanly”. These masculine “flaws” are precisely what make these male characters funny, despite how problematic their behavior can become. These comedies also tend to categorize individuals based on their biological sex, which seems to be linked to their capacity to provoke laughter. On the one hand, men are flawed but still funny and thus entertaining, while women, on the other hand, represent stability and more accepted social norms, which makes them boring and less funny in comparison. The “comical” appears to be exclusive to men in these comedies. In that regard, genders get an uneven time of screen, often making women the “Others” to the male protagonists. This greater attention on men allows them to be targeted by ridicule, an inherently disciplinary state of being. Despite being constantly ridiculed for their actions, male characters are still funny, thanks to a ridicule that affects them more than it does for women. This ridicule also seems to act as a “gender police”, suggesting a male-male gaze. Men gaze upon one another to make sure male characters act in accordance with traditional masculine norms. Therefore, they try to avoid being ridiculed under the gaze of other men. The ones who can’t act accordingly see themselves becoming the target of ridicule, which becomes a means for men to reach normative configurations of masculinity. What seems paradoxical is how men are usually able to reach a “non-ridicule” masculinity. We consider this to be part of a “decentralization” followed by “recentralization” of their masculinity. Their questionable behavior, typical of traditional and normative masculinities, is thus trivialized and serves comical purposes. By doing so, these six Quebec comedies reassert traditional representations of genders without questioning them, which mostly benefits men.

248	The predictive validity of clinical ratings of the Short-Term Assessment of Risk and Treatability (START)	With the increased need to assess and manage risk in inpatient settings, the Short-Term Assessment of Risk and Treatability (START) was implemented on a civil psychiatric unit. The goal of the present study was to examine the tool’s predictive validity when completed by clinical teams as part of routine practice. Data were collected for 34 patients hospitalized for a minimum of 30 days prior to and after a START evaluation. Several challenging behaviors, such as aggression towards others, self-harm, and substance abuse were assessed using the START Outcomes Scale (Nicholls et al., 2007). Results from multilevel logistic regression and Receiver Operating Characteristics analyses lend partial support for the predictive validity of the START. A limited set of START items combined was significantly better at predicting the challenging behaviors than the original total Strength and Vulnerability scales. Results are discussed in terms of the clinical use of risk assessment.	START , Risk assessment , Risk management , Protective factors , Civil psychiatric setting	en	23763.0
249	El gran apagón : techno-politiques, crises et infrastructures dans le secteur de l’énergie électrique en Colombie (1940-2000)	In Colombia, the predominance of hydropower over other sources of energy have generally been explained by the notion of water abundance in the territory and therefore because of the rentability of its production. Nevertheless, this research aims to question these given ideas. I argue that it is necessary to explore the political and relational nature of this resource to understand its importance in the national electric sector. To do so, I explore the causes and effects of the 1992 energetic crisis, well-know as El gran apagón (The Great Blackout). I put into evidence how this crisis happened to be instrumentalized to negotiate the techno-politics and infrastructures that shape the electric sector system. More precisely, in the processes of implementation of neoliberal politics and in the legitimization of the construction of new dams. In this case, Porce II dam situated in the department of Antioquia. The main goal of this study is to reveal how crisis and scarcity discourses (as much as abundance discourses) of hydroelectricity allowed its proliferation, and thus, massive transformations of several territories in the country. Discussing at the same time how these discourses aren’t neutral nor static through space and time. From political ecology and Science and technology studies perspectives, I pay attention on the effects of expert discourses and representations of hydropower and water to see how they have shaped the electric sector in the period between 1940 and 2000. The crisis of El grand Apagón proves to be interesting as it allows to put into light how these representations, but also practices and the governance are contested and negotiated in this context. In the historical trajectory of hydropower in Colombia, this research seeks to explore how infrastructures are not only legitimated by contradictory promises of development and progress, but also by crisis discourses.

250	Étude de la thermo-sensibilité mitochondriale des espèces de moules d'eau douce indigènes et invasives	Climate change is impacting many, if not all, forms of life. Increases in extreme temperature fluctuations and average temperatures can cause stress, particularly in aquatic sessile ectotherms such as freshwater mussels. However, some species seem to thrive more than others in face of temperature-related stressors. Thermal tolerance may for example explain invasive species success. It is also known that mitochondria can play a key role in setting an ectothermic species’ thermal tolerance. In this study, we aimed to characterize the mitochondrial thermo-tolerance in invasive and endemic freshwater mussels. With the use of high-resolution respirometry, we analyzed the mitochondrial respiration of two freshwater bivalve species exposed to a broad range of temperatures. We noticed that the invasive dreissenid Dreissena bugensis displayed a less thermo-tolerant mitochondrial metabolism than the endemic unionid Elliptio complanata. This lack of tolerance was linked with a more noticeable depression of aerobic metabolism at elevated temperatures. These findings may be associated with the life history traits of both species, as D. bugensis is more adapted to unstable habitats, where selection pressures for resistance adaptations are reduced. Our findings add to the growing body of literature characterizing the mitochondrial metabolism of many aquatic ectotherms in the context of climate change.

251	Mobilisation et transformations du mercure et du carbone dans les réservoirs hydroélectriques de la rivière Romaine	Following the flooding of soil during the construction of hydroelectric reservoirs, terrestrial inorganic mercury (Hg) and organic matter typically increase in concentrations in the aquatic environment. The anoxia developed due to the deepening of the water column and the degradation of organic matter due to aquatic microbial communities create new conditions in the system that are prone to the methylation of mercury into its neurotoxic and bioaccumulative form : methylmercury (MeHg). Results from this study, led in the hydroelectric complex of reservoirs of the Romaine River, showed that the percentage of total mercury which is methylmercury in the flooded area is on average 10 times higher than in surrounding natural systems from the watershed and in the upstream section of the river. MeHg concentrations in the Romaine River, however, remain relatively low when compared to other reservoirs in Quebec and worldwide. Upstream to downstream patterns have been observed, where MeHg increases along with carbon dioxide (CO2) throughout the series of reservoirs and where both showed higher values in June than in August, following the snowmelt and the melting of the ice cover. Concentrations were lower in the summer campaign, suggesting there was under-ice production due to the development of partial anoxia before the water column is mixed and oxygenated in spring. Moreover, the distribution of total mercury concentrations, dissolved organic carbon and dissolved organic matter components remained stable between flooded and natural sites. This suggests that hydroelectric reservoirs act as reactors for the transformation of terrestrial inorganic Hg in MeHg rather than as mobilizers of newly imported Hg and that processes occurring several kilometers upstream and months prior to sampling affect the carbon and Hg dynamics of this inter-connected system.

252	Le personnage « en devenir » ; dialogue avec le récepteur dans la dramaturgie d'Étienne Lepage	"This master’s thesis addresses the notion of character in three works by Quebec playwright Étienne Lepage.  First, it aims to identify how this form of the theater character differs from the existing theories on the subject, in particular, Jean-Pierre Sarrazac’s ""impersonnage"" theory. The aim is to identify the characteristics specific to this ""evolving"" character, driven by the movement that negotiates its construction in a dialogue with the receiver. This study, which focuses on the analysis of the theater text, draws its foundations from the observations of the theater theorists (Szondi, Lehmann, Abirached, Sarrazac) on this crisis experienced by the character. The second part focuses on the role of the receiver in the dramatic text. The integrations of the receiver give him an active role; he becomes co-creator. The analysis of Lepage’s treatment of immediate time and open space shows how these elements contribute to the arrangement of this space for the receiver. Finally, the monologue as the only possible mode of expression occupies a significant part of this reflection on the character of Étienne Lepage’s dramaturgy. At the confluence of character studies, reception theories and identity construction, this study seeks to identify the character ""in the making""."

253	2012, suivi de l’imaginaire du survivant dans l’œuvre de Christian Guay-Poliquin	2012 is a novel narrated by a survivor in a post-apocalyptic universe of zombies in Montreal. Books, movies and tv series will help him to stay alive. The text demonstrates that the knowledge acquired through different cultural objects allows survival. Intertextuality and intermediality become central tools in the survivor's imaginary. The essay in this thesis focuses on Christian Guay-Poliquin's Le fil des kilomètres (2013) and Le poids de la neige (2016), two texts which present the idea that cultural knowledge allows the narrator’s survival. Renée Bourassa's reflections on hypermedia fictions will demonstrate that the different cultural productions present in the imaginary of the surviving narrator form a knowledge network. This network enables the narrator to make decisions by interacting with the knowledge acquired in cultural items. This remembrance acts like a Wikipedia guide and a hypertextual labyrinth.

254	A Hauntology of Sheila Watson's The Double Hook	This thesis consists of a study of haunting, both at the textual and fictional level, in Sheila Watson’s The Double Hook. In this hauntology of the novel, I explore the texts and cultural archetypes that haunt Watson’s novel as well as the ghosts, spectral figures, and haunting spaces and places represented in the novel. The theoretical movement of hauntology introduced by Jacques Derrida in Specters of Marx is a fundamental work in contemporary studies of the tropes of the Gothic and of a more generalized haunting that threatens notions of stability in our understanding of existence. Moreover, the haunting figures and texts in Watson’s novel subvert the heterogenous conception of a national discourse in Canada. The insights provided by scholars such as Marlene Goldman, Margaret Turner, and Cynthia Sugars, who are concerned with what Watson’s use of spectral figures in her narrative accomplishes in relation to writing the settler-colonizer nation of Canada, contribute to informing my argument about the place Watson’s novel occupies in the Canadian collective imaginary. In the first chapter of this thesis, I focus on the textual hauntings in the pages of Watson’s novel. Indigenous myths, Christian rituals, conventions of the western and regional novel, and modernist texts haunt the novel’s structure, content, and the language that constitutes it. In the second chapter of this thesis, I direct my attention towards the haunting and haunted figures that exist in the world created by Watson. In both chapters, my goal is to converse with the specters I see in the novel, to give a voice to what is not explicitly said and to find what lies between the fragments of Watson’s experimental prose.

255	Les facteurs de risque dynamiques associés à l’agression sexuelle chez les cyberdélinquants	The governments will to fight against child sexual exploitation has contributed to put in place strategies to improve the detection of online offenders and to apply laws that more severely condemn these kind of behaviors (Department of Justice of Canada, 2018). The effective management of these individuals by the criminal justice system involve the evaluation of their risk to reoffend. However, sexual abuse appears to be under detected among internet offenders, with 12 % of all internet offenders officially detected for a contact offense whereas about 50 % of them disclose having engaged in a contact sexual offense when self-report data are examined (Seto, Hanson & Babchishin, 2011). The justice system needs to better detect internet offenders at risk of sexual abuse for prevention purposes and to help these individuals not escalate to contact offending. The aim of this study is to investigate the association between the presence of dynamic risk factors and contact sexual offending among online offenders. The sample included 124 offenders who had committed an internet sexual offense and were subsequently classified based on whether or not they self-reported sexual offense (s) not detected by the law enforcement. The sample was comprised of 41 detected online-only offenders, 26 detected mixed offenders (both online and contact offenses), 15 undetected online-only offenders and 42 undetected mixed offenders. Comparisons between online-only and mixed offenders were examined on sexual interest in children, sexual preoccupation, sexual coping, cognitions supporting sexual abuse against children and cognitions supporting online sexual offenses. Results show that the cognitions supporting sexual abuse against children was predictive of a contact offense among online offenders. These results provide support to theoretical models suggesting that antisocial orientation is associated with contact sexual offending.

256	Étude sur le discours des intervenants de la protection de la jeunesse quant à leur pratique d’accompagnement d’enfants vivant des visites supervisées avec leur(s) parent(s)	Background: Supervised visits represent a complex practice for caseworkers who have to deal with the suffering of the child, the parents and the foster parents, as well as dealing with the challenges associated with the context of supervised visits and the broader conditions of practice in the child protection services. To date, studies have mainly focused on the subjective experience of parents, foster parents and children. They have identified certain limits in the services offered to young people and their families, as well as challenges in the work of those who accompany children in this context. On the other hand, we know little about the professional practice of caseworkers during supervised visits and the strategies they use to support children in that setting. Objective: The objective of this Master's thesis is to document, from their discourse, the professional practice of caseworkers who support children experiencing supervised visits with their parent(s) in the context of child protection services. More specifically, it aims to better understand how they prepare and support children at different moments of supervised visits, as well as explore what concrete actions are taken in order to achieve those tasks. The outcomes of using a tool designed to support children in foster care experiencing supervised visits with their parent(s) was also discussed. Method: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 10 caseworkers from the CIUSSS CSSMTL. The interviews were subjected to a thematic analysis. Results: Results reveal that the practice of accompaniment of the child in the context of supervised visits is built from an interaction between different factors such as the nature of the support offered, the caseworker’s attitude and their understanding of the child's experience (in terms of general experience and needs). Overall, caseworkers reported using a diversified practice in order to respond to the particularities of the situations encountered and the needs identified in the children they support. The data analysis also brought out the theme of the place occupied by children in the youth protection system, in a context where practice tends to overshadow them. Elements related to the personal characteristics of the caseworkers and to the clinical and organizational aspects of the profession emerged from interviews.  Discussion: This research provides a better understanding of the professional practice of caseworkers who accompany children in their supervised visits with their parent(s). It offers food for thought in order to develop a professional practice and clinical tools that better meet the needs of young people in a way that makes sense for them. It also supports the relevance of taking more interest in the place of children in the youth protection services and in giving them a voice in future research.

257	Le travail de l’Intelligence artificielle : rapport au travail et coup d’œil sociodémographique	In Montreal, with an abundance of public subsidies and private investment, Artificial intelligence is on everyone's lips. Emerging in Quebec's metropolis is an ecosystem conducive to the development of smart technologies, giving birth to new types of businesses. After illustrating the socio-demographic qualities of the professionals drawn towards this field, this dissertation aims to trace the work-specific relationship developed by young workers who choose to work in this promising sector. Through a qualitative study, the author examines what employment conditions look like in this emerging sector of the tech industry. The findings in this paper highlight the changing culture of work and how it has increasingly become a way of expressing oneself as an individual. It captures in action the construction of meaning that these young and highly qualified workers attribute to their professional sphere in order to escape the flexibility and precariousness responsible for the erosion of the so-called wage society.

259	Perspectives parentales concernant la santé et le développement des enfants prématurés : contrastes entre la vision parentale et l’évaluation des professionnels de la santé	Objective: Measuring outcomes of premature birth is essential for quality control, research, patient care and information. At 18 months corrected age, children are classified into categories of severe, mild-moderate or no neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI). Outcomes of interest have been chosen by physicians and researchers, never including parental perspectives.  The aim of this thesis was to explore parental perspectives regarding their preterm child. Hypothesis: The hypothesis was that parents’ perspectives and concerns would differ from those assessed by professionals.  Method: This survey included 190 infants born <29 weeks of gestational age in one tertiary university health center. Infants underwent detailed developmental assessment and were classified according to NDI. Parents were asked two open-ended questions: “What concerns you most about your child?” and “Please describe the best things about your child”. Open-ended questions were analyzed using qualitative methodology, then correlated with level of NDI. Results: In this cohort, 49%, 43% and 8% had no, mild to moderate, and severe NDI. The main positive themes invoked by parents included their child’s personality (61%), happiness (40%), developmental outcome/progress (40%) and physical health (11%). Main themes regarding parental concerns included: neurodevelopment (56%) and physical health (24%). There was no association between positive themes and categories of NDI, but parents of children with mild-moderate NDI reported more concerns about development. Conclusions: Parents of preterm infants have a balanced perspective of their children, mostly positive. Neonatal outcome research would benefit from incorporating parental perspectives regarding their child, balancing prognostic information about preterm birth. This thesis project has led to the creation of a qualitative questionnaire which is now deployed through a CIHR Child-Bright initiative considering parent-important outcomes.	handicaps , perceptions parentales , very preterm infants , outcomes , development , neurodevelopmental impairment , parental perceptions , parental perspectives , parent-important outcomes	en	23664.0
260	Optimisation de la récupération fonctionnelle lors de l’hospitalisation aigüe suite à une lésion traumatique de la moelle épinière	Introduction and objectives: Traumatic Spinal cord injuries (TSCI) have devastating consequences. To minimise the deficits incurred, patients undertake a rehabilitation process consisting of four phases: acute care hospitalization, intensive functional rehabilitation, community reintegration and maintenance of gains. The acute care hospitalization represents an important part of the clinical pathway as many important decisions about the subsequent rehabilitation plan are taken. It also represents a unique period to minimize medical complications and optimize functional recovery early in the rehabilitation process. Thus, the clinical evolution during the acute care shouldn’t be neglected as it has been shown to influence medium to long term outcome. In particular, pressure injuries (PI) prevention is essential as the acute hospitalization represents the period with the highest PI risk and its occurrence adversely affects long-term functional recovery.Yet, the impact of multiple factors on the occurrence of PI during acute care specifically as well as the goals that must be prioritized by the acute rehabilitation team to optimize the functional outcome at discharge from acute care remain imprecise. Thus, the main objective of this work is to identify how the acute rehabilitation team may optimize functional recovery during acute care and decrease the occurrence of PI following a TSCI.  Methods and results: A prospective cohort study of sixty-one patients and the review of a prospective database of 301 patients with acute TSCI admitted to a SCI-specialized level-1 trauma center were completed. The mean total spinal cord independence measure (SCIM) score at discharge was 42.1 ±25.2 after a mean acute care length of stay (LOS) of 22.7 ±14.4 days. Hierarchical multivariate linear regression analyses showed that when controlled for the severity of the TSCI, longer LOS was significantly associated with poorer functional outcome at discharge from acute care. Hierarchical multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that when controlling for the level and severity of the TSCI, the occurrence of pneumonia (OR=2.1, CI= 1.1-4.1) was significantly associated with the occurrence of PI. Greater admission delay to our SCI-specialised level-1 trauma center, the occurrence of medical complications (PI, pneumonia and urinary tract infection) and lesser total daily therapy (physiotherapy and occupational therapy) resulted in significantly longer acute care LOS when controlled for possible non-modifiable cofounding factors.  Conclusions: In order to optimize functional outcome at discharge from acute care, the rehabilitation team must address factors that influence acute care LOS, particularly early transfer to SCI-specialized trauma centers, medical complications prevention (PI, pneumonia, urinary tract infection) and the optimization of therapy time, in order to decrease acute care length of stay and thus optimize the patient’s clinical evolution. As patients with higher and more severe TSCI, as well as those developing a pneumonia during acute care are at higher risk of developing PI, we believe they should be prioritized to receive a larger volume of therapy and more aggressive prevention protocols. Finally, functional gains during the acute care hospitalisation may be underestimated by the SCIM, which do not measure interventions during acute rehabilitation that are aimed towards ensuring strong foundations (e.g. trunk balance) to undertake efficient IFR.	spinal cord injury , traumatic , acute care , functional outcome , pressure injury , spinal cord	en	23663.0
261	14-3-3ζ overexpression improves tolerance to acute and chronic cold exposure in male mice	Adaptive thermogenesis is a mechanism of heat production primarily mediated by brown fat. In some instances, cold exposure or adrenergic stimuli can convert white adipocytes into brown-like or beige adipocytes during a process termed “beiging”. Both beige and brown adipocytes express higher levels of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and can release energy in the form of heat following lipid oxidation. The activation of these thermogenic adipocytes increases energy expenditure to reduce body weight in rodents, and it has been postulated to be a promising therapy for the treatment of obesity and diabetes. We previously identified an essential role of the molecular scaffold, 14-3-3ζ, in adipogenesis, but its roles in other adipocyte processes is uncertain. An early identified function of 14-3-3 was its ability to regulate the enzymatic activity of tyrosine hydroxylase, which is indispensable in the production of norepinephrine for thermogenesis. Thus, our study aims to investigate whether 14-3-3ζ influences the development and function of beige and brown adipocytes. We report here that one allele deletion of the gene of 14-3-3ζ did not affect acute cold tolerance. On the other hand, transgenic overexpression of 14-3-3ζ in male mice (TAP) improves cold tolerance due to enhanced beiging with a remarkable increase in Ucp1 mRNA and protein in inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT). Interestingly, beiging is increased in the TAP mice without any changes in sensitivity to beta-adrenergic stimuli, sympathetic innervation, or norepinephrine content being detected between WT and TAP mice. TAP mice also displayed significantly lower thermal conductance decreasing heat loss during the chronic cold challenge. Collectively, our results point to a novel role of 14-3-3ζ in beiging and increases our understanding of how adaptive thermogenesis is regulated.	14-3-3ζ , Beiging , Browning , Adaptive thermogenesis , Brown adipocytes , Beige adipocytes , 14-3-3 proteins	en	23660.0
262	Les effets de la règle de la mise en échec sur les fonctions exécutives et l’état psychoaffectif de jeunes hockeyeurs au cours d’une saison	Athletes from contact sports are introduced to repetitive subconcussive impacts at a young age. Although concussions represent a major concern in public health as they can alter cognitive functions, little is known about subconcussive impacts and the role they might have in the hypothetical neurodegenerescence of the brain. Subconcussive impacts are registered at a smaller velocity than concussive impacts and therefore are not associated with concussion-related sign or symptoms. However, these impacts occur at a higher frequency as they are part of contact sports like hockey, American football and soccer. The brain receives multiple subconcussive impacts during a season or an entire career. Adolescent hockey players are introduced to body checking at the age of 13-14 years old and brain functions like executive functions are not completely developed until the end of adolescence. Also, executive functions are responsible for task planning, inhibition and working memory. Moreover, these functions seem to be afflicted in the long term after one or multiple concussions. The purpose of this project was to explore the effects of subconcussive impacts on executive functions and the psycho-affective state of adolescent hockey players competing with different types of body checking rules. Thirty-eight participants were recruited from the age of 12 to 17 years. They were grouped according to the type of body checking rules they played with during the season, which were physical contact (PC), restrictive body checking (RBC) and full body checking (FBC). Executive functions were assessed using a colour-shape paradigm of the switch task. Psycho-affective state was assessed with self-reported questionnaires. Participants completed this protocol at the beginning and the end of their hockey season. A 3 × 2 × 2 ANCOVA did not reveal any interaction, nor main effect of the type of body checking (PC; RBC; FBC), history of concussion (HOC; no HOC) and time of the season (Pre; Post) on the results of the switch task and the self-reported questionnaires. Therefore, this suggests that the rule of body checking is not sufficient to cause any alteration of executive functions or any change in the psycho-affective state of adolescent hockey players.

263	Anomalies oculaires chez le modèle murin C57Bl/6Toupee : implications sur la variabilité phénotypique du syndrome CHARGE et sur le rôle de FAM172A dans le développement oculaire	CHARGE syndrome is a rare genetic disease for which the acronym stands for the main characteristics initially identified to describe the syndrome: coloboma, heart problems, choanal atresia, retarded growth and development, genital anomalies and ear defects. Patients present highly variable combinations of anomalies, even between members of the same family. The main cause of this syndrome is a mutation in the CHD7 gene, but new genes whose mutation can also give rise to this syndrome, such as FAM172A, were recently identified. The Fam172a gene is mutated in the Toupee mouse model, which presents the main characteristics of CHARGE syndrome. Interestingly, while FVBToupee animals present coloboma in a strong proportion, 55% of B6ToupeeTg/Tg individuals and 16% of B6ToupeeTg/+ individuals present microphthalmia and anophthalmia.  First, detailed characterization of these ocular anomalies revealed that microphthalmia and anophthalmia are much more frequent in the right eye of B6Toupee mice, with varying degrees of severity.  Then, comparative analysis of ToupeeTg/Tg and Chd7Gt/+models in FVB and C57Bl/6 genetic backgrounds further revealed significant differences in penetrance and phenotypic presentation, suggesting that the identity of the causative gene and the genetic background both modulate phenotypic outcome of CHARGE syndrome.  Finally, characterization of FVBToupeeTg/+;Chd7Gt/+ double heterozygotes confirmed a moderate genetic interaction between Fam172a and Chd7 while investigations of Chd7Gt/+ neonatal mortality allowed to suspect feeding problems.

264	Pathways to recovery among homeless people with mental illness: Is impulsiveness getting in the way?	Objective: This study investigates the association between impulsiveness and six dimensions of recovery among homeless people with mental illness.  Method: The sample was composed of 418 participants of a randomized controlled trial of Housing First, a recovery-oriented program that provides immediate access to permanent housing. The reliable change index method was used to provide an estimate of the statistical and clinical significance of the change from baseline to 24 months (i.e., clinically meaningful improvement), on outcomes that pertain to recovery dimensions: psychiatric symptoms (clinical), physical health and substance use problems (physical), residential stability (functional), arrests (criminological), community integration (social), and hope and personal confidence (existential). We tested for the effect of impulsiveness, assessed with the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale–11, on clinically meaningful improvement on each specific outcome, adjusting for age, gender and intervention assignment, as both intervention arms were included in the analysis.  Results: For every increase in total impulsiveness score by one standard deviation, the odds of experiencing clinically meaningful improvement decreased by 29% (OR = 0.71, 95% CI, 0.55 to 0.91) on the clinical dimension and by 53% (OR = 0.47, 95% CI, 0.32 to 0.68) on the existential dimension. However, changes in outcomes pertaining to physical, functional, criminological, and social dimensions were not significantly influenced by impulsiveness.  Conclusions: Findings highlight the importance of addressing impulsiveness in the context of recovery-oriented interventions for homeless people with mental illness. Further research may be required to improve interventions that are responsive to unique needs of impulsive individuals to support clinical and existential recovery.

265	Research and Industry Practices in Designing Clothes for Optimal Participation of Persons with a Physical Disability	Background: Clothing is important in human societies and could play a central role in optimizing participation of persons with physical disabilities. It is unclear whether the fashion industry understands the clothing needs of these individuals. Objectives: 1) Examine the role of clothing on participation of persons with physical disabilities, 2) Explore perspectives of representatives of the fashion industry vis à vis the literature and factors influencing uptake of this knowledge. Methodology: 1) A scoping review including six research databases, Google, and multiple expert consultations was performed. 2) Semi-structured interviews with fashion industry representatives were conducted. Results: 1) Fifty-seven articles and 88 websites were retrieved. Clothing-related issues impacting Mobility and Self-Care were frequently reported as were various personal factors. Forty-nine percent of articles reported essential clothing design features. 2) Five interviews found that acquiring knowledge for designing adapted clothing is important and time-, manufacturing-, marketing-, and purchasing-related barriers exist in the industry. Increased resources, exposure, guidance, and engagement within the fashion industry may help advance the field of adapted clothing. Conclusion: Clothing has a multidimensional influence on participation. Solidifying collaborations between researchers, clinicians, persons with disabilities, and the fashion industry may add credibility to future clothing designs.

266	Connectivité fonctionnelle entre le noyau sensoriel principal du trijumeau et le noyau moteur du trijumeau	Masticatory movements are generated by a brainstem neuronal network known as the central pattern generator (CPG). Increasing evidence associate the trigeminal main sensory nucleus (NVsnpr) to the rhythmogenic heart of the masticatory CPG, despite the fact that it is conventionally seen as a sensory relay to the thalamus. The present study provides new evidence of a functional connectivity between NVsnpr and the trigeminal motor nucleus (NVmt), known to contain all the motoneurons (MNs) innervating jaw muscles. Our results indicate that neurons projecting to NVmt are located in the dorsal ¾ region of NVsnpr. Electrical stimulation of the dorsal NVsnpr induced multiphasic excitatory synaptic responses in trigeminal MNs while BAPTA application, which causes NVsnpr neurons to fire rhythmically, also induced rhythmic firing in some MNs, further emphasizing the functional relationship between these two nuclei in terms of rhythm transmission. In our calcium imaging experiments, electrical stimulation of NVsnpr evoked calcium responses in MNs located mainly in the jaw-closing region of NVmt and revealed a specific pattern of connectivity between the two nuclei. The organization of the projections seemed to depend critically on the dorsoventral location of the stimulation site within NVsnpr. The dorsolateral region of NVmt received mainly inputs from the dorsal NVsnpr (R1 and R2), whereas the ventromedial region of NVmt was found to receive inputs from R2 and R3 which account for the major part of the intermediate division of the NVsnpr. This study confirms and develops earlier experiments by exploring the physiological nature and functional topography of the connectivity between NVsnpr and NVmt that was demonstrated in the past with neuroanatomical techniques.

267	Differential effect of deletions and duplications on general intelligence and social responsiveness	Deleterious deletions and duplications (copy number variations, CNVs) are identified in up to 11% of individuals referred to neurodevelopmental pediatric clinics. However, only few recurrent CNVs have been formally associated with neurodevelopmental disorders because the majority are too rare to perform individual association studies. We recently developed a new framework to estimate the effect size of undocumented CNVs on non-verbal intelligence quotient (NVIQ) and sought to extend this approach to another score measuring autistic traits.  We identified CNVs in an autism sample from the Simons Simplex Collection (SSC) and MSSNG, in their first-degree relatives, in a neurodevelopmental cohort and in individuals from an unselected population. Statistical models integrating scores of the genes encompassed in the CNVs were used to explain their effect on general intelligence and on social responsiveness.  Deletions and duplications decreased NVIQ and the effect of duplications was three-fold smaller than deletions. There was also a differential effect on social responsiveness: the ratio of the impairment conferred by deletions and duplications was 2:1 and this effect was mainly driven by NVIQ. Models estimates for general intelligence and social responsiveness were consistent with previously published observations. Our models, trained on CNVs encompassing >4,500 genes, suggest highly polygenic properties of CNVs with respect to cognition and social responsiveness. These models will help interpreting CNVs identified in the clinic.

268	Le pollen, de la protohistoire à l'ère industrielle : paysage végétal et société à la pointe à Callière, Montréal, vers 1590 à 1879	This thesis describes the vegetal landscape at the Pointe à Callière (BjFj-101) in Montreal from about 1590 to 1879, drawing on pollinic data associated with archaeological and historical data to construct time graphs representing the variation of pollen through different layers dated archaeologically. This project covers the initial proto-historic and historic occupations until the industrial age: it aims to describe the conversion of the wooded glades landscape shaped by Indian occupation into the commercial backlot vegetation of the 19th century. The pollinic analysis of a horticultural area and a fireplace dated from 1615-1640 radiocarbon specifies the sequence of occupation from the late 16th century to the early 17th century, highlighting a proto-gardening phase. New data on the Callière gardens helps to better understand the organization of 18th century crops, and the urbanization of landscape at the dawn of the 19th century. The study of pollinic and chemical traces left in the soil by subsequent commercial occupations allows us a glimpse into the commercial and industrial vegetation of the Montreal port area. Spanning almost 300 years, the pollinic sequence of these events highlights the changing socio-environmental relations and offers a referential chronology on a prominent colonial and urban site in North America.	archaeopalynology , pollen , landscape archaeology , colonization , environmental archaeology , urban archaeology , pointe à Callière	en	23614.0
269	Social identities and isotopic analyses of the burials from the archaeological site of Ucanal, Petén, Guatemala	With the advances in isotopic analyses over the last two decades, scholars working in the Maya area have come to realize that Pre-Columbian people were much more mobile than previously considered, even though many were sedentary agriculturalists with large urban centers. Isotopic analysis of strontium and oxygen of human teeth enables us to identify the presence of migrants since they reflect geochemical and climatic variability of where a person lived as a child. Twelve burials from the archaeological site of Ucanal, in the Petén region of Guatemala, were analyzed for strontium and oxygen isotopes. In addition, a strontium baseline study of faunal remains was undertaken to identify typical values for the Ucanal region. Out of the twelve burials, three individuals were identified as likely foreign-born. Interestingly, they underscore two different ways in which foreigners were implicated in their newly founded homelands. Together with analyses of the human remains and burial contexts, the isotopic results highlight potentially hostile treatment in the form of human sacrifice or potentially reverential treatments in the form of a cult of the ancestors in which foreign peoples were remembered as important founding ancestors.

270	La experiencia de mujeres jóvenes en el espacio público en Zapopan (México) : análisis de género y perspectivas urbanísticas	Starting from the premise of the right to the city, of spatial (in)justice and the context of gender inequality, the problem of access to the city’s resources by young women has become evident. In particular, it translates into limited mobility and restrictions on youths’ ability to occupy and participate in the public space, which is essential for their socialization, well-being and development.  Faced with an unfavorable urban context to the fulfillment of their right to the city, this research questions the experience in public spaces of young women from disadvantaged environments, particularly through their mobilities. The research focuses on the experience of young women living in the peripheral and marginalized Miramar neighborhood, situated in Zapopan, a municipality in the Metropolitan Area of Guadalajara in Jalisco, Mexico.  The research was carried out from a feminist methodological framework, with a qualitative and participatory approach, including data collection methods based on action-research and popular education processes with 10 young women 15 and 19 years old. In addition, complementary information was collected through documentation and semi-directed interviews with 12 key actors in the local urban environment in order to deepen understanding of the situation of young women and the possibilities for intervention.  Two results should be highlighted. Firstly, we observed that young women live a double exclusion in the public space and consequently see their right to the city unfulfilled. The first exclusion is related to gender inequality and the violence they experience as young women. The second is associated with the adult-centric paradigm and the social perception that young women are vulnerable beings. Secondly, we show that participatory processes in urban planning are useful both for the production of knowledge and for the fulfillment of the right to the city.

271	The impact of Housing First on criminal justice outcomes among homeless people with mental illness : a  systematic review.	Objective: Housing First is increasingly put forward as an important component of a pragmatic plan to end homelessness. The literature evaluating the impact of Housing First on criminal justice involvement has not yet been systematically examined. The objective of this systematic review is to examine the impact of Housing First on criminal justice outcomes among homeless people with mental illness.  Method: Five electronic databases (PsycINFO, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science) were searched up until July 2018 for randomised and nonrandomised studies of Housing First among homeless people with a serious mental disorder.  Results: Five studies were included for a total of 7128 participants. Two studies from a randomised controlled trial found no effect of Housing First on arrests compared to treatment as usual. Other studies compared Housing First to other programs or compared configurations of HF and found reductions in criminal justice involvement among Housing First participants.  Conclusions: This systematic review suggests that Housing First, on average, has little impact on criminal justice involvement. Community services such as Housing First are potentially an important setting to put in place strategies to reduce criminal justice involvement. However, forensic mental health approaches such as risk assessment and management strategies and interventions may need to be integrated into existing services to better address potential underlying individual criminogenic risk factors. Further outcome assessment studies would be necessary.	Homeless persons , Housing , Mentally ill persons , Criminal behaviour , Justice involvement	en	23601.0
272	Étude descriptive qualitative de l'exercice du leadership stratégique de directions des soins infirmiers visant la qualité des soins des établissements de santé en réforme au Québec	In spite of the significant impact of nursing on the performance of health care organizations, the practice of chief nursing offices’ strategic leadership oriented towards high quality of nursing care remains poorly documented. This type of leadership refers to the ability of the chief nursing officer and her team, positioned in the health care organization’s higher levels, to work strategically with other executives so as to provide effective and efficient health care to patients and their relatives. Aim of the study: To describe the strategic leadership practice of chief nursing offices regarding the quality of nursing care in the health care organizations of Quebec. This is done using a frame of reference based on elements from two models: An Integrative Model of Strategic Leadership (Boal et Hooijberg, 2000) and Fitting Strategic Leadership Into the Strategic Framework (Hambrick, 1989). Method: A qualitative descriptive research was conducted among senior and middle managers of Quebec’s chief nursing offices. The sample consisted of thirty-five (N=35) participants from 18 chief nursing offices out of the 34 health care organizations, corresponding to a participation of 53% of Quebec’s chief nursing offices. Three focus groups as well as 31 semi-structured interviews were conducted. Findings: It appears that in order to practice strategic leadership, chief nursing offices should: 1) take ownership of their strategic positioning to influence the quality of nursing care, 2) develop and communicate a clear vision of quality nursing care, 3) make strategic, systematic and measured, choices focused on the quality of nursing care to guide the contribution, 4) reframe the roles to increase the influence regarding the quality of nursing care, 5) be involved in strategic decision-making process, 6) develop political capacity to influence the quality of nursing care and 7) establish strategic and collaborative alliances focussed on the quality of nursing care. Moreover, the clinical credibility and a team comprising an adequate number of educated (graduate-level) people, promotes the strategic leadership practice of chief nursing offices. The culture and size of the organization are the organizational components that constrain the practice of chief nursing offices’ strategic leadership. Finally, the efficiency of the strategic leadership practiced by the chief nursing offices depends on their ability to strike the right balance between hierarchical and transversal governance for an optimal contribution to the quality of nursing care. Conclusion: Results indicate that the practice of strategic leadership generates influential areas, allowing not only the improvement of the chief nursing offices’ contribution to the quality of nursing care, but also to the overall quality of the organizations. Chief nursing offices can refer to these results in order to continue the development of strategies aimed at improving the quality of nursing care in constantly evolving organizations of increasing complexity.

This process, consisting of transposing electronic models into instrumental music, appeared shortly after the creation of the Westdeutscher Rundfunk (WDR) and Groupe de Recherche Musicale (GRM) studios. This dissertation addresses the origin and evolution of this approach, its possible forms and examples of its dissemination in contemporary music. Four new pieces, created during this master's degree, further explore the idea of hauntological instrumental music, inspired by audio artifacts from the defective analog and digital recording media.

274	L’oxymétrie du nerf optique, un biomarqueur potentiel pour le glaucome	Glaucoma is a progressive optic neuropathy characterized by loss of the retinal nerve fibers layer. This disease causes a decrease in the visual field that can lead to blindness. The main risk factor for glaucoma is the increase of intraocular pressure. However, not all glaucoma patients have an elevated intraocular pressure and many patients continue to progress despite good intraocular pressure control with current therapies. Several authors have focused on the hemodynamic components of the eye. They obtained significant differences in these factors between normal and glaucoma patients. Ocular oximetry is technology that can non-invasively measure oxygen saturation of eye tissues. Several studies have verified the association between ocular oximetry and glaucoma. The Zilia device uses diffuse spectroscopic reflectance to measure oxygen saturation at a specific point. The objective of this study was to verify the repeatability of the oximetry measurements on the head of the optic nerve obtained with the Zilia device and to study the acquisition in order to determine the characteristics necessary to obtain it optimally. Also, we measured the oxygen saturation (SaO2) on the optic nerve of normal subjects and compared it with patients with glaucoma. Additionally, the SaO2 was correlated with different variables affected by glaucoma. This is a prospective repeated-measures and case-cohort study. Participants were recruited at the Laurentian Eye Institute (IOL). They completed a complete eye exam under pupil dilation including a blood pressure measurement with an automated device and the pulse oximetry was obtained by a pulse oximeter (SpO2). The ocular oximetry measures was acquired by the Zilia imaging system on the temporal side of the optic nerve. No statistically significant differences were observed between the average of three SaO2 measurements at the optic nerve. For the duration of the acquisition, the data analysis showed a statistically significant difference between the 5 seconds acquisition compared to the other acquisition duration. There was no statistically significant difference between the average of the first measurement obtained before and after the use of the data optimization technique. The result showed a significant difference in the SaO2 values between glaucomatous participants and normal. We also see a correlation statistically significantly between the SaO2 values and the global RNFL. This study is one of the first one done with the Zilia device. The average value of SaO2 obtained at a specific point of the optic nerve acquired by the Zilia device are repeatable and a 10-second acquisition could provide a precise value. Also, the SaO2 measured with the Zilia imaging system on the optic nerve is significantly lower in glaucoma patients compared to normal patients. More studies are needed to really establish the role of that device in the diagnostic and fully up of patients with glaucoma.	Ocular oximetry , Glaucoma , Oxygen saturation , Oxyhemoglobin	en	23589.0
275	L'enseignement individualisé à la formation générale des adultes	"In Québec, many young adults and adults decide at some point in their lives to enroll in the adult education sector in order to obtain their high school diploma or to go further in their studies. The general objective of this research is to understand the teaching practice most used in this sector -individualized teaching and education- and to allow the people who live it on a daily basis to be able to express themselves on its dimensions. This particular pedagogy has not been the subject of attention by research in adult education. As part of this qualitative ethnographic study, twenty informants were interviewed (ten learners and ten teachers) and two questionnaires, consisting of four blocks each, were intended for them. To achieve the first specific objective of this research, namely to identify the actors (teacher-learner) of the pedagogical triangle and to describe how they live their relationship in individualized teaching, at adult education, the components of the educational triangle of Houssaye were, at first, used and this in order to know the intrinsic characteristics of the trainers and learners as well as all existing relationships between them. Then, to reach the second specific objective of this research, namely to link the ""perceptions"" of the actors of the pedagogical triangle, in FGA, of the individualized teaching with regard to the self-training, all the components of the theory of the self-training in Carré were included in the informant questionnaires. The results reveal that individualized teaching is a great complement to the definition of educational self-training."

276	Les effets d’une séquence d’enseignement-apprentissage de l’oral inspirée des approches de la philosophie pour enfants et des approches plurilingues sur la compétence discursive d’élèves du 3e cycle du primaire en classe d’accueil	This research presents the effects of an oral teaching-learning sequence inspired by approaches to children's philosophy and plurilingual approaches to discourse competence (the justification and reformulation) of second language learners in school. Thoses students are 3rd cycle of primary school. This is an exploratory type case study with six students cases. During the philosophical discussions, which is the oral genre set up to practice justification and reformulation, the data collected through video recordings have found that the teaching of the two discursive competence allows students to talk more in thoses discussions. The teaching-learning sequence helped the students to produce more elaborate justifications and to use reformulations to overcome communication breakdowns during the interactions. Finally, the learning of the two discursive behaviors permits to know that the interactions are more related to each other and the scaffolding is done more between the students.	reformulation , justification , oral teaching , teaching-learning sequence , immigrant students in welcoming classes , discursive competence , philosophical discussion	en	23570.0
277	WISP1 and EMT-associated response and resistance to immune checkpoint blockade	Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has revolutionized therapeutic approaches in the field of medical oncology and has largely contributed to the fact that immunotherapy is now being regarded as the fourth pillar of cancer treatment alongside surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Despite encouraging results from clinical trials using ICB, most patients ultimately relapse or succumb to their disease. Therefore, the field of immunotherapeutic resistance research is rapidly expanding. Many strategies to improve ICB responses have been undertaken, including: 1) the search for novel, actionable targets in the immune tumor microenvironment (TME) and; 2) therapeutic combination studies where an ICB backbone is combined with different, synergistic treatment modalities. Each of the studies presented in this research thesis embraces one of these strategies.  In our first study, we show that WISP1 represents a promising TME target in multiple solid tumor types by demonstrating its association with prognostic and pro-inflammatory variables, as well as to a complex epigenetic program termed Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT). Furthermore, we show that increased WISP1 expression is associated to primary resistance to ICB, particularly when EMT-related signatures are found concomitantly. In our second study, we used in vivo mouse models of KRAS-mutant Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) to test different therapeutic combinations of targeted therapies (i.e., MEK inhibitor) and ICB. We found that the addition of anti-CTLA-4 ICB to MEK inhibitor AZD6244 (selumetinib) and anti-PD-L1 ICB increases survival, and that these benefits are associated with the downregulation of EMT-related markers.  Therefore, there exists a common link between these studies, which relies on the significance of EMT as a detrimental factor within the TME and its association with ICB resistance. Moreover, we show for the first time that the benefits of ICB combination therapy can be associated to the downregulation of EMT markers in vivo. Consequently, we discuss how our results may constitute the basis for future work aiming at reducing EMT-mediated therapeutic resistance, as well as the translational relevance of our pre-clinical results through the development of a clinical trial.

278	Impacts des cannabinoïdes sur la vision: étude anatomique et fonctionnelle	The endocannabinoid (eCB) system is a great therapeutic target for the treatment of many diseases, ranging from immune system modulation to pain management. This system is implicated in developmental processes as indicated by neurofunctional afflictions following developmental exposition to cannabinoids. Since eCBs are lipophilic, they are not stored in vesicles but rather synthesized and degraded on demand by specific enzymes. Thus, the expression pattern of these enzymes could help to better understand the expression of eCBs, and their role during central nervous system maturation. The CB1 receptor is strongly distributed in the nervous system, while the CB2 receptor is traditionally associated with the immune system. The recent finding of the CB2 receptor expression and function in some neurons, especially in the retina, changes the dogma associated with cannabinoids. A study from our laboratory found that deletion of the CB2 receptor in transgenic mice (cnr2-/-) enhances the a-wave amplitude in electroretinography, this wave reflecting photoreceptor activity. This report highlighted the importance of the CB2 receptor in vision, at least in the retina. Until now, no study aimed at the impact of cannabinoids on visual acuity. We characterized the retinal distribution of diacylglycerol lipase alpha (DAGLα) and monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) enzymes, responsible for the synthesis and degradation of the eCB ligand 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG) during postnatal development. The enzyme DAGLα is expressed since birth and is greatly distributed across the retina such as in photoreceptors, horizontal, amacrine and ganglion cells. The enzyme MAGL is expressed later during development and is present only in amacrine and Müller cells. Our functional results show that the visual acuity of cnr2-/- mice is enhanced in adults and during postnatal development. The repeated administration of a CB2 receptor antagonist yielded a better visual acuity, and inversely a CB2 receptor agonist decreased the visual acuity. Furthermore, the administration of a MAGL inhibitor, the enzyme in charge of 2-AG degradation, induced a strong decrease in visual acuity, similar to that obtained with a CB2 receptor agonist. Inversely, a DAGL inhibitor, the enzyme responsible for 2-AG synthesis, caused an increase in visual acuity. These results suggest that 2-AG is strongly expressed early during retinal development and could be implicated in structural and functional maturation of the retina. Furthermore, we demonstrated that cannabinoids do not only affect retinal function, but also visual acuity. These results confirm that cannabinoids modulate their visual effects exclusively via the CB2 receptor. Finally, in recent years, many countries legalized cannabis for recreational and therapeutic use. The findings from this thesis increase the understanding of cannabinoids since they highlight the great impact of cannabinoids on the visual acuity.

279	Développement de modèles précliniques humanisés autologues en immuno-oncologie	Identification of the human’s immune system implication in cancer has guided the biotech industry towards the development of numerous and promising cancer immunotherapies. However, in the era of immuno-oncology, a distinct lack preclinical models can simulate the interactions between a patient’s tumor and immune cells.  To tackle this issue, we developed humanized mouse models combining immune reconstitution of immunodeficient mice and injection of tumor cells lines from the same human donor. The use of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) allowed the generation of multiple tumorigenic cell lines from a single donor, facilitating access to autologous immune cells necessary for mouse immune humanization. The transformation of primary or iPSC-derived cell lines was done using lentiviral transduction of proto-oncogenes telomerase (hTERT), oncogenic Ras (HRASV12) and simian virus 40 early region (SV40ER) encoding large and small T antigens (LgT and SmT).  This approach allowed to generate high grade, aggressive and undifferentiated tumors from primary fibroblasts and iPSC-derived hepatic cells, neural stem cells and astrocytes. In all cases, such tumors were efficiently recognized, infiltrated and often rejected by the implanted autologous immune system. However, partial rejection of most tumors allows for preclinical evaluation of targeted immunotherapies relying on the hosts’ pre-existing immune response. For instance, we could study the impact of PD-1 checkpoint blockade inhibition on tumor growth in fibroblastic tumors where a significant increase in tumor infiltration was observed, but without an associated decrease in tumor burden. We could also produce autologous chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-expressing T lymphocytes against GD2 ganglioside, a previously described tumor antigen detected on our neural stem cell-derived tumor cells. Cytotoxic efficiency of these autologous CAR T cells could thus be validated in vitro. Finally, we used our fibroblast-derived tumor models in autologous and allogeneic settings to determine if mesenchymal stem cells’ (MSC) immunomodulatory potential could impact tumor growth. Our results showed that MSC had no effect neither on tumor emergence and growth nor on immune infiltration, suggesting therapeutic use of these cells should be safe regarding such tumors already harboring a strongly immunodeficient microenvironment. Overall, the novel models described in this thesis aim at improving the predictive capacity of mouse pre-clinical models in immuno-oncology by recapitulating some immune interactions between a patient and its tumor. The great flexibility of this approach will allow for easy adaptation to many research problematics both preclinical and fundamental.

280	Caractérisation de vortex intraventriculaires par échographie Doppler ultrarapide	Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death in the world (first cause in North America [192]), and causes high health care costs for society. The prevalence of heart failure increases dramatically with age and, due to the ageing of the population, will remain a major concern in the future, not only for developed countries, but also for developing countries. It is therefore crucial to have a good understanding of its mechanism to obtain an early diagnosis and a better prognosis for patients. Diastolic dysfunction is one of the variations of heart failure and leads to insufficient filling of the ventricle. To better understand the dysfunction, several studies have examined the blood motion in the ventricle. It is known that at the beginning of diastole, the filling flow creates a vortex pattern known as a vortex ring. This development of the ring by blood flow after passage through a valve was first described in 1513 by Leonardo Da Vinci (Fig. 0.1). After molding a glass phantom in an aorta and adding seeds to visually observe the flow through the phantom, he could describe the vortex ring development of the blood coming out of the aortic valve. His work was confirmed 500 years later with the emergence of MRI [66]. The same pattern can be observed in the left ventricle when the flow emerges from the mitral valve, referred to as the diastolic vortex. The flow motion (in our case the blood) is directly related to its environment : shape of the ventricle, shape of the valve, stiffness of the walls... There is therefore a growing interest in further studies on this diastolic vortex that could lead to valuable information on diastolic function. The imaging modalities which can be used to visualize the vortex are MRI and ultrasound. This thesis presents the work carried out to allow a better characterization of the diastolic vortex in the left ventricle by Doppler ultrasound imaging. For temporal monitoring of vortex dynamics, a high temporal resolution is required, since the ventricular diastole is about 0.5 s on average for a resting human heart. The quality of Doppler signals is also of utmost importance to get an accurate estimate of the blood flow velocity in the ventricle. To study this vortex, we focused on evaluating the core vorticity evaluation and especially on its evolution in time. The work is divided in three parts, and for each of them an article has been written : 1. Ultrafast Doppler sequence : The sequence is based on diverging waves, which resulted in a high frame rate. In combination with vortography, a method to locate the vortex core and derive its vorticity, the vortex dynamics could be tracked over time. This ix sequence could establish a proof of concept based on in vitro and in vivo acquisitions on healthy human volunteers. 2. Triplex sequence : Based on the ultrafast sequence, we were interested in adding information on the wall motion. The triplex sequence is able to recover not only the blood motion with a high framerate but also tissue Doppler. In the end, we could derive color, tissue, and spectral Doppler, along with a high quality Bmode by using motion compensation. The interdependence between vortex and walls dynamics could be highlighted by acquiring all the required parameters over a single cardiac cycle. 3. Automatic clutter filter : Vorticity quantification depends directly on the estimation of Doppler velocity. However, due to their low amplitude, blood signals must be filtered. Indeed, acquired signals are actually an addition of tissue and blood signals. Filtering is a critical step for an unbiased and accurate velocity estimation. The last part of this doctoral thesis has focused on the design of an efficient filter that takes advantage of the temporal and spatial dimensions of the acquisitions. Thus the tissue alongside the noise is removed. Particular care was taken to automatize the filter by applying information criteria based on information theory.

281	Les interactions entre l’interleukine-15, l’haplotype HLA-DQ8 et le gluten conduisent au développement de la maladie cœliaque chez la souris	Coeliac disease is a chronic inflammatory enteropathy characterized by autoimmune features. This disease occurs in genetically predisposed individuals expressing HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 haplotypes and is triggered following gluten consumption. The disease is characterized by the development of intestinal villous atrophy leading to malabsorption. The only current therapy is the adherence to a gluten-free diet, but the diet is not always effective and is heavy in concessions. Therefore, the development of alternative therapies is urgent but is a slowly evolving pipeline, mainly due to the absence of a physiologically relevant animal model. The aim of this thesis is to answer this unmet need by developing an animal model capable of recapitulating the main characteristics of the disease. Chapter 1 depicts a portrait of the disease in four points, gradually leading the reader into the details of its pathogenesis. This introduction begins with a review of the physiology and intestinal immunity and then draws a clinical portrait of the disease. Third, the reader evolves in a more detailed part of the pathogenesis helping him to discern its cellular and molecular actors. Finally, the introduction ends with a review of the literature on current animal models. Chapter 2 outlines the thesis objectives based on key data from the literature, in particular, patients present at least one copy of the HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 haplotype and more than two-thirds over-express the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-15 at the level of their intestinal mucosa. It is therefore reasonable to hypothesize that gluten, HLA haplotype and interleukin-15 together contribute to the pathogenesis. Although suspected, their roles and interactions still require the provision of tangible evidence in vivo. Chapter 3 details these interactions based on the proposed new mouse model. This model is characterized by the overexpression of interleukin-15 in the intestinal epithelium and lamina propria and by the expression of the HLA-DQ8 haplotype. This work demonstrates that the exposure of this mouse to gluten is accompanied by villous atrophy and the complete serological, cellular and transcriptional signature of the disease. We also demonstrate that simultaneous overexpression of interleukin-15 in both mucosal compartments is a prerequisite for the development of atrophy. This study also highlights the need for CD4+ T cells and interferon-gamma in the activation of intraepithelial lymphocytes and the development of villous atrophy. Finally, this research establishes the central role played by the HLA-DQ8 haplotype and the enzyme tissue transglutaminase II in the occurrence of these lesions. In general, the results from this model presented in Chapter 3 reflects the complexity of the interactions between gluten, genetics and IL-15 in the development of coeliac disease. Finally, chapter 4 concludes this work and chapter 5 discusses future directions for this powerful preclinical model that will undoubtedly contribute to a better understanding of coeliac disease and will allow the identification of new potential therapeutic targets.	gluten , HLA-DQ8 , transglutaminase-2 , autoimmunity , coeliac disease , mouse model , gluten , HLA-DQ8 , transglutaminase-2 , interleukin-15 , cytotoxic CD8+ T cells , CD4+ T cells	en	23533.0
282	Rôle des lymphocytes TH17 dans la fragilisation de la barrière hémo-encéphalique et la formation des lésions de sclérose en plaques	The blood-brain barrier (BBB) plays a crucial role in protecting the central nervous system (CNS) by restricting entry of cells and molecules into the brain. In the CNS disorder multiple sclerosis (MS), breakdown of the BBB allows activated leukocytes to infiltrate the brain parenchyma, leading to the formation of the characteristic demyelinated lesions. For decades, MS was viewed as a TH1-mediated disease, a notion that was largely supported by studies in its animal model and by the abundance of prototypical TH1-associated cytokines within active MS lesions. However, over the years, accumulating evidence has highlighted the involvement of another subset of CD4⁺ T cells that express IL-17, therefore named TH17 lymphocytes, in the pathology of the disease. The goal of the work presented herein was to characterize the human TH17 lymphocyte population and define their contribution to the disruption of the BBB and leukocyte infiltration into the CNS, both important early events in the formation of MS lesions. To do so, we developed and optimized a method to successfully generate human TH17 lines in vitro from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy donors. We demonstrate that in response to IL-23, human memory CD4⁺CD45RO⁺ but not naïve CD4⁺CD45RA⁺ T lymphocytes produce IL-17, IL-22, and granzyme B, with a subset of cells simultaneously expressing IL-17 and IFN-γ. Interestingly, we measure a significant increase in the percentage of T CD4⁺ IL17⁺, of IL-22⁺, and of IL-17⁺IFN-γ⁺ dual producers in TH17 cell lines expanded from the peripheral blood of acutely relapsing MS women as compared to those generated from healthy controls and remitting MS patients. We show that both IL-17 and IL-22 receptors are upregulated on BBB endothelial cells in situ during inflammation and that IL-17 enhances BBB permeability by disrupting the integrity of tight junction proteins occludin and ZO-1. Finally, we provide evidence that TH17 lymphocytes transmigrate efficiently across human brain endothelial cells via the adhesion molecule ICAM-1 and show that IL-17⁺IFN-γ⁺ double producers have an increased propensity to do so. Accordingly, we detect lymphocytes that display immunoreactivity against both the TH1- and TH17-associated transcription factors T-bet and RORC within perivascular infiltrates of active MS lesions. The work presented in this thesis has refined our understanding of the mechanisms that drive TH17 lymphocyte recruitment into the CNS and shed light on the deleterious effect of TH17-secreted cytokines, specifically in the activation and breakdown of the BBB.

283	La greffe de thymus humain lors de l'humanisation des souris NOD/SCID/IL2Rγcnull: optimisation du modèle pour l’étude de la fonction des lymphocytes T humains in vivo	Immunodeficient mice engrafted with human immune system provide an exciting in vivo model for a better understanding of its functioning and for development of new therapies.  Today, one of the most robust humanized mouse model is achieved by injecting human hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) from fetal liver along with an implantation of autologous fetal thymic tissue. This model, called BLT, was shown to be able to support an optimal T cell reconstitution, maturation and selection. BLT mice are extensively used for many studies such as understanding HIV biology or in regenerative medicine. Indeed, our work used BLT mice on one hand to study the role of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) during the HIV infection and on the other hand to better understand the formation of teratomes from iPSCs in vivo. However, one of the biggest limitations of this technique is the procurement of the fetal tissue. Here we describe a new protocol to do humanized mice engrafted with human thymus pieces by using more accessible materials: human thymus obtained during cardiac surgery and cord blood HSC. Indeed, thymus is spontaneously removed during cardiac surgery in neonates and young children, thus it is an easy and ethical way to obtain this tissue. Those thymuses pieces were implanted in the quadriceps of a immunodeficient mice, after being put in culture. CCST mice (Cord blood and Cardiac Surgery Thymus) exhibited a significant engraftment of T-cells, compared to humanized mice without thymus. T-cells from both CCST and BLT mice showed a similar function as evaluated by proliferation assays upon PHA stimulation ex vivo and rejection of allogeneic leukemic cells lines in vivo. CCST mice were susceptible to HIV-1 infection via mucosal or intraperitoneal route, as shown by detectable viral load, HIV DNA and p24+ cells, at similar levels to those of BLT mice. Importantly, CCST mice displayed more effective ex vivo HIV-1-specific T-cell responses compared to BLT. Upon antiretroviral treatment, CCST mice, like BLT, were able to diminish the viral load. Our data suggest that CCST mice represent an alternative to the regular BLT mouse model. Those easy-to-access thymuses can be used to generate a large number of mice compared to fetal thymuses.	thymus , BLT , tissue fœtal , humanized mice , hematopoietic stem cell , immunodeficient mouse , fetal tissue , immune reconstitution , HIV , antiretroviral therapy	en	23529.0
284	Systèmes d’intelligence artificielle et santé : les enjeux d’une innovation responsable.	"The use of artificial intelligence (AI) systems in health is part of the advent of a new ""high definition"" medicine that is predictive, preventive and personalized, benefiting from the unprecedented amount of data that is today available. At the heart of digital health innovation, the development of AI systems promises to lead to an interconnected and self-learning healthcare system. AI systems could thus help to redefine the classification of diseases, generate new medical knowledge, or predict the health trajectories of individuals for prevention purposes. Today, various applications in healthcare are being considered, ranging from assistance to medical decision-making through expert systems to precision medicine (e.g. pharmacological targeting), as well as individualized prevention through health trajectories developed on the basis of biological markers.  However, urgent ethical concerns emerge with the increasing use of algorithms to analyze a growing number of data related to health (often personal and sensitive) as well as the reduction of human intervention in many automated processes. From the limitations of big data analysis, the need for data sharing and the algorithmic decision ‘opacity’ stems various ethical concerns relating to the protection of privacy and intimacy, free and informed consent, social justice, dehumanization of care and patients, and/or security. To address these challenges, many initiatives have focused on defining and applying principles for an ethical governance of AI. However, the operationalization of these principles faces various difficulties inherent to applied ethics, which originate either from the scope (universal or plural) of these principles or the way these principles are put into practice (inductive or deductive methods).  These issues can be addressed with context-specific or bottom-up approaches of applied ethics. However, people who embrace these approaches still face several challenges. From an analysis of citizens' fears and expectations emerging from the discussions that took place during the coconstruction of the Montreal Declaration for a Responsible Development of AI, it is possible to get a sense of what these difficulties look like. From this analysis, three main challenges emerge: the incapacitation of health professionals and patients, the many hands problem, and artificial agency. These challenges call for AI systems that empower people and that allow to maintain human agency, in order to foster the development of (pragmatic) shared responsibility among the various stakeholders involved in the development of healthcare AI systems. Meeting these challenges is essential in order to adapt existing governance mechanisms and enable the development of a responsible digital innovation in healthcare and research that allows human beings to remain at the center of its development."	artificial intelligence , big data , responsible innovation , digital innovation , ethics , bioethics , digital health , agency , algorithmic governance	en	23526.0
285	"Rôle de HCaRG/COMMD5 dans le carcinome à cellules rénales : 
une histoire de transition."	In the 2000s, Dr. Johanne Tremblay and her team identified a gene that was negatively regulated by extracellular calcium in hypertensive rat parathyroid glands. Originally named Hypertension-related calcium regulated gene (HCaRG) and renamed COMM Domaincontaining 5 (COMMD5), this gene encoding a small protein of 24.67 kDa is part of a family of 10 proteins sharing a homologous structure in the carboxy-terminal position named COMM domain. Many roles have been associated and expressional analysis of different types of cancer shows a modulation suggesting that they have an oncogenic or tumor suppressor roles. Studies have shown that COMMD5 induces maturation of the cell junctions, decreased cell proliferation and promotes migration. The overexpression of COMMD5 in the renal proximal tubules accelerates repair by promoting cell proliferation and ultimately induces cell migration and redifferentiation after acute injury. Based on these observations, we focused on the development of renal cell carcinoma, a disease affecting 300,000 people each year worldwide. Our hypothesis is that COMMD5 plays a tumor suppressor role in kidney cancer by controlling cell proliferation and differentiation. To test our hypothesis, we investigated the role of COMMD5 in maintaining the epithelial integrity of cells through the regulation of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the control of epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR). The results showed that COMMD5 is decreased in kidney carcinomas resulting of a great negative indicator of the survival prognostic. The presence of hypoxia-inducible factor 1a (HIF1α), expressed in the majority of solid tumors, leads to a decrease of COMMD5 in the proximal tubule cells (HK-2). Inhibition of COMMD5 promotes dedifferentiation and tumorigenicity of cells mediated by epithelial to mesenchymal transition. The loss of COMMD5 induces a reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton resulting in endosomal dysregulation of the EGFR receptor and promoting its activation. In renal cell carcinoma, COMMD5 overexpression decreases cell proliferation and induces their redifferentiation by two mechanisms: firstly, COMMD5 induces an inhibition of the HIF1α protein expression resulting in a mesenchymal to epithelial transition and sequesters the SNAIL transcription factor in the cytoplasm; secondly, COMMD5 negatively regulates the transcriptional expression of the ErbB receptors. Taken together, these results of this thesis show that COMMD5 is a gene showing tumor suppressor characteristics by controlling cellular differentiation and by regulating the expression of ErbB receptors.

286	Études de conditions favorisant la prévention de la contrainte et des maladies cardiovasculaires chez les pompiers	"Accounting for 43% of deaths reported in the past decade, sudden cardiac death is the most common cause of on-duty deaths among US firefighters. Studies show that the risk of on-duty cardiac events in firefighters is accentuated by two main causes: the first is the presence of coronary heart disease, cardiomegaly/left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and/or damage caused previously by a myocardial infarction, the second being the important cardiovascular strain suffered at work. No studies have been conducted to assess the cardiovascular health status of Québec firefighters. Such a study would allow us to know more about their risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and on-duty cardiac events. Futhermore, the prevalence of CVD risk factors was shown to be high among US firefighters, consistent with the high number of on-duty cardiac events. The first objective of this thesis was thus to assess the cardiovascular health profile of Québec male and female firefighters. Second, in order to reduce the risk of on-duty cardiac events, it was relevant to pore over the prevention of CVD in firefighters. The risk of developing coronary heart disease and/or cardiomegaly/LVH could be reduced by engaging in and maintaining healthy lifestyle behavior including regular physical activity. Several fire departments in Québec allow firefighters to do on-duty physical training in fire stations. This could help increase their weekly physical activity level and improve their cardiovascular health. The second objective of this thesis was to compare the weekly physical activity level and various cardiovascular health indicators in firefighters who physically train on duty in the fire station and those who do not. Lastly, in order to reduce the risk of on-duty cardiac events, it was also relevant to look at the prevention of cardiovascular strain suffered by firefighters, considering that it acts as a ""trigger"". This could be reduced by avoiding shortened recovery periods between periods of work during interventions. The third objective of this thesis was to compare and characterize the cardiac strain generated by two firefighting simulations consisting of two identical work bouts intercalated with a short vs. extended passive recovery period. iv The main results of this thesis show that a high proportion of Québec male and female firefighters are at moderate to high risk of CVD. They also show that firefighters who physically train on duty in fire stations have a higher weekly physical activity level and have better cardiovascular health indicators compared to firefighters who do not. Finally, the results show that a passive recovery period of 5 minutes between two 25-minute work bouts during a firefighting simulation results in a greater cardiac strain than a 20-minute recovery period and that this difference seems to be mainly due to a greater thermal strain and dehydration. These projects were funded by Fonds de recherche du Québec – Santé in the form of a doctoral research scholarship."

287	Les difficultés de financement en droit international de l’environnement : quelles perspectives pour les instruments juridiques relatifs aux produits chimiques et déchets dangereux ?	The international scene is marked by different types of interstate relationships. However, upon close consideration, this collaboration takes on a non-linear appearance from a financial point of view. In fact, funding has become the common denominator that shapes interstate relationships. International environmental law, as well as the chemical industry - particularly the hazardous waste sector - do not escape this paradigm. The exploitation of natural resources and trade constitute the foundation of this vital area of international exchanges. Since the second and third industrial revolutions, man has learned to extract and transform minerals and synthesize new molecules in order to manufacture of all sorts of products.   The overexploitation of natural resources has by the same token led to undesirable environmental impacts in the form of transboundary contamination and severe damage to human health. This state of affairs has gradually led to the adoption of international legal instruments with a view to limiting or eradicating the aforementioned effects. It was within this context that the Basel, Rotterdam, Stockholm and, most recently, the Minamata Convention on Mercury were adopted. These four legal instruments form the legal structure in the chemicals and hazardous waste sector. However, the effectiveness of this arsenal involves the implementation of these conventions. But this is not as easy in practice. The main stumbling block is often the question of financing the additional costs that their implementation entails in developing countries. Who should pay? The answer to this question lies in the explanation and interpretation of the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and the analysis of the effectiveness of the financing mechanisms set up under each convention.  In the face of these funding concerns, the question that can be asked is whether the legal regime is not the source of the problem. Moreover, what is the impact of the restructuring attempts initiated in recent years? What improvements can be proposed? It is to this set of concerns that this thesis provides answers.

288	Bioremédiation de sols en milieu nordique : des ressources locales pour traiter une variété d’hydrocarbures pétroliers et autres contaminants avec la phytoremédiation, la mycoremédiation et l’aide de matières résiduelles fertilisantes	"Petroleum hydrocarbons are shipped and used in virtually all parts of the world and have become one of the most common and widespread contaminants in soils. Trace elements are sometimes associated with them, and they can increase the toxicity of a site, complicate remediation, and increase the costs of traditional treatments. In northern areas where spills occur at multiple sites, the clean-up time and cost of traditional remediation methods can be significantly higher than in temperate regions. Alternative research aimed at faster and cheaper remediation adapted to subarctic climates is needed and the use of native plants and fungi integrated into the local ecosystem are promising approaches. Concurrently, governments in multiple countries aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, namely through the reduction of putrescible waste destined for landfills. By using locally-sourced residual fertilizing materials for decontamination processes, an opportunity arises to valorize these materials while restoring soils. This doctoral research aims to develop locally-adapted bioremediation methods, with indigenous plant and fungal inputs, to treat petroleum hydrocarbon contaminated soils in three large-scale field research projects, including one also contaminated with trace elements. Two projects were carried out in a subarctic climate at the 60 ° parallel (Whitehorse, Yukon), using an innovative approach of phytoremediation assisted by mushrooms and municipal compost; we call this integrated technique the ""ecological microsystem"" approach. Because soil volume has significant impacts on the efficiency of bioremediation methods, considerable volumes of 0.15 m3 and 1 m3 were used (at the first and second sites, respectively) to maximize the relevance of results in the event of a scale-up operation. At the first site, the effectiveness of the various components of the microsystem were evaluated in four different combinations, as well as compared to the usual basic treatment (fertilizer) in soil contaminated by an accidental diesel spill. The plant species chosen was Salix planifolia and Pleurotus ostreatus was selected for the fungus. Results indicate that after one treatment season, the microsystem was the treatment with the fastest diesel removal rates. After three seasons, treatments containing one or more elements of the microsystem were below standards for agricultural soils and were more effective than fertilizer treatment or natural attenuation. The second northern site was a waste oil pit located on top of a mine waste rock pile, at the heart of an old landfill. The microsystem was implanted into ground-level cells with a contaminant-proof leachate liner. The plant species Salix alaxensis and Salix planifolia were used in combination with the fungus Trametes versicolor. This approach in a highly contaminated soil was able to significantly reduce petroleum hydrocarbons (65 to 75%). The potential for metal accumulation in aerial plant tissues was also measured. Both willow species demonstrated distinct trace element accumulation patterns and different rooting strategies. A fungus of the Psathyrellaceae family was observed for the first time at a site so highly contaminated and was recurrent on the cells of the microsystem for 4 years. The first two sites contribute to the development of efficient and passive bioremediation methods applicable in subarctic climates. The third research site focused on the use of two residual fertilizing materials (fragmented rameal wood and brewer’s spent grain) and manure for the degradation of motor oil in a humid continental climate at a medium latitude (Neuville, Quebec). Mesocosms of 0.76 m3 with controlled aeration were used. Innovative aspects of this project include the use of rameal wood and spent grain at this scale, as well as the acquisition of residual materials in a very close radius of the treatment center to explore how a circular economy approach could apply in such a context. Results indicate that the addition of manure is more effective than the usual fertilizer treatment alone. Brewer’s spent grain and fragmented rameal wood were useful for maintaining soil moisture (an important bioremediation parameter) but did not increase degradation. This study, conducted in close collaboration with an industrial partner, falls under the objectives set by Canadian and Quebec policy on greenhouse gas reductions and circular economy approaches by working on the valorization of local residual organic matter. This thesis has demonstrated that combining strategies with local biological components is an effective bioremediation method in a subarctic climate. Two new willow species (Salix planifolia and Salix alaxensis) have been successfully used for the bioremediation of petroleum hydrocarbons and for the accumulation of certain trace elements. In collaboration with an industrial partner, it has been possible to demonstrate the applicability of certain circular economy concepts and the ecosystemic approach to bioremediation."

289	Marais de saules à effluent nul pour le traitement d'eau contaminée	During the last decades, a type of constructed wetlands, usually planted with willows, was developed to operate a water treatment system with zero effluent, by evapotranspiration. These zero liquid discharge wetlands are typically used for domestic wastewater treatment, but could also be an attractive alternative for other applications, such as contaminated leachate treatment. However, the design guidelines currently available do not allow for the design of a flexible system that would manage the large variations of volume to be treated related to the very nature of leachates (i.e. produced entirely from precipitation) and do not take into account inter and intra-annual variation of willows evapotranspiration (ET). This thesis first presents a literature review of ET for the genus Salix and its most important driving factors. It appears that growing conditions are more important than species identity and that water availability, fertilization and contamination are the main factors dictating ET in willow. The effect of age, experimental context, planting density, and soil type could not be clearly demonstrated by this review. Then, a study on the potential ET of S. miyabeana 'SX67' is presented. It is shown that a model based on foliar parameters and on the water vapor pressure deficit in the air makes it possible to predict the ET of S. miyabeana under wetland conditions. This study will, among other things, improve the design plans for a potential zero effluent willow wetland. To continue, the response of S. miyabeana 'SX67' to different leachate concentrations and different types of substrates was studied. This cultivar has been tolerant of raw leachate concentrations found at a treated wood pole storage site. The type of substrate influenced the willow response and ecophysiological performance, and affected the dynamics of the contaminants. Finally, the hydrological modelling of a system with zero effluent by willow bed makes it possible to propose a method of dimensioning for the different compartments of the system in order to reach a zero effluent objective over a period of 20 years, as well as to propose solutions for optimal design and operation. The application of the model to the specific case of a treated wood pole storage site made it possible to assess the hydrological feasibility of this technology in the climate context of southern Quebec. On the basis of this study, the main limit for the application of zero effluent willow bed in Quebec is the wetland area and the storage volume required. In the case where an effective pre-treatment step precedes the willow bed, the life of the wetland should not be limiting and will depend mainly on the lifespan of the plants. However, the fate of the contaminants in the system, be it the disposition of the accumulated contaminants at the pre-treatment stage or a possible translocation of contaminants into the aerial parts of the plants, should be considered before establishing a system with zero effluent. The results of this research make it possible, among other things, to propose zero-effluent willow wetlands as an interesting alternative for the treatment of contaminated water in Quebec.

290	Analyse phénoménologique interprétative de dyades d’adolescents transplantés rénaux et de leurs parents : un regard sur le développement identitaire, l’attachement et l’expérience parentale durant l’adolescence	The central objective of this thesis is to better understand the experience of adolescents with a kidney transplant and the experience of their donor and non-donor parents. Inspired by a developmental perspective, and using a qualitative design, the thesis evaluates the identity development and the relationships between adolescents and their parents. It is in fact during adolescence that identity development becomes significant and youth living with a chronic kidney disease have to take up challenges related to their condition and its treatment as well as those of normal development. In context of a kidney transplant, additional challenges like the relationship to the donor and the impacts on body image makes the adolescence a more complex period. Adolescence brings significant challenges for the parent-child relationship, like growing needs of becoming more autonomous and independent and the investment and necessity of the proximity with attachment figures. Adolescents with a kidney transplant express their impression of being overprotected from their parents, and parents also consider themselves overprotective. Unique to the field of organ transplants, parents can be the donor for their child, but it is unclear whether this ability to give life for a second time has an impact the adolescent’s development and the experience of parents. One of the central elements of this thesis is the evaluation of diagnosis resolution for parents of adolescents with a kidney transplant, a process that has been recognized as a precursor of accepting the disease and is associated with proactive parental attitudes in other populations of parents with sick children. It is necessary to understand how parents of adolescent kidney recipients resolved the diagnosis and their parental practices according to the type of resolution they portray. Parents who still deal with unresolved emotions may feel overwhelmed when their adolescent is not compliant with the medical regiment or when he engages in risky behaviours for the survival of the graft. A qualitative design was chosen, using semi-structured interviews with each member of the dyads. Participants were 10 adolescents and 9 parents. Analyses were conducted according to the interpretative phenomenological analysis method (IPA). For the article with parents, results show that early reactions to the diagnosis suggest parents experienced trauma. Donor status seems to help resolve the negative aspects of the experience but does not fully explain diagnostic resolution status. For all parents, concerns over adherence are central to their relationship with their youth. Results call for attention to the support needs of all parents and particularly those with an unresolved status. For the article on identity development, results suggest identity development is influenced by similar concerns for all adolescents whether they received from a donor parent or not: body image, social relationships and anxiety for the future. For those who received from a parent donor, feelings toward the parent can be a challenge when building a unique identity. The evaluation of attachment representations informed us on the high presence of insecure attachments types among this specific sample of adolescents and on the presence of traumatic symptoms in the attachment relationship for some.	adolescence , don vivant parental , Renal transplant , Adolescence , Development , Parental practices , Parental living donation , Cadaveric donation , Resolution of diagnosis , Attachment , Interpretative phenomenological analysis	en	23489.0
291	Identification de marqueurs neuropsychologiques précoces dans la maladie d’Alzheimer : trajectoires des changements cognitifs et fonctionnels	The main objective of this thesis was to characterize the trajectories of cognitive and functional decline in the preclinical and early stages of Alzheimer's disease, using two methodological approaches: the study of mild cognitive impairment in sporadic Alzheimer's disease and the study of the cognitive phenotype of individuals with autosomal dominant mutations in familial Alzheimer's disease. The thesis comprises 6 articles, 4 of which are empirical. The first article (Chapter II) aimed to review the literature on mild cognitive impairment, its historical context, its diagnostic criteria and current knowledge in the cognitive, genetic and neuroimaging fields. The objective of the second study (Chapter III) was to characterize the different cognitive domains (episodic memory, executive functions, working memory, visuospatial processing and language) and their trajectories over time, in individuals with mild cognitive impairment, by distinguishing those who progressed to dementia, or progressors, and those that did not progress to dementia, or non-progressors. The results indicate that, in the case of progressors, the trajectories of decline are distinguished according to the cognitive domain: a quadratic function (a plateau followed by an accelerated decline) characterizes the delayed recall in episodic memory and working memory/processing speed and a linear function characterizes immediate recall, executive functions and visuospatial abilities. The objective of the third study (Chapter IV) was to characterize the trajectories of decline in the ability to perform instrumental activities of daily living in these same individuals with mild cognitive impairment who progressed to dementia and to compare these trajectories with those found in individuals with mild cognitive impairment who did not progress. The results show that the self-reported abilities to perform activities of daily living follow a quadratic trajectory in the progressors (met the dementia criteria during the study), a linear trajectory in the declinors (presented a cognitive decline without meeting the dementia criteria during the course of the study) and did not change over time in the stable (remained cognitively stable during the study). The results indicate that these patterns can be mainly explained by a category of activities, the complex activities (e.g. managing the budget), which follow the same trajectories. The objective of the fourth article (Chapter V) was to present the different components (genetics, imaging and cognition) of a collaborative project initiated in 2012 between Canada and China, aimed at studying the preclinical phases of familial Alzheimer’s disease. The objective of the fifth study (Chapter VI) was to examine the onset and course of cognitive impairment in familial Alzheimer's disease, by distinguishing individuals with PSEN1 mutations leading to a diagnosis of dementia from those not carrying these mutations. The results show that, in mutation carriers, the time to the estimated age of onset follows a quadratic trajectory for delayed recall and recognition in episodic memory and a linear trajectory for immediate recall, semantic/categorical verbal fluency and visuospatial abilities. Finally, the objective of the sixth study (Chapter VII) was to present preliminary imaging data for the Canadian cohort with PSEN1 mutations, using a case series. In mutation carriers, amyloid is an early marker, with a significant deposition, even in non-symptomatic individuals. The tau marker is significant only near the estimated age of onset in mutation carriers and appears to be more associated with cognitive deficits.

292	Le rôle de l’activité physique et la sédentarité en âge préscolaire sur les habitudes de vie, le rendement scolaire et le développement psychosocial au début de l’adolescence	Due to advances in technology, sedentary behaviors (which typically involve screens) have become the preferred leisure activity for many children, instead of engaging in active play, sports, or other activities requiring physical effort. Due to urban sprawl, the use of active transportation is also in decline and most children travel to school by car or other passive means of transportation. However, physical inactivity and sedentariness are both risk factors for multiple physical and mental health problems.  As described in the first chapter, the protective benefits of physical activity on well-being are well documented and the risks associated with sedentary behaviors are increasingly being studied. Nevertheless, most studies look at these two aspects separately and focus solely on the immediate impact on a specific sphere of well-being. The aim of this doctoral thesis was therefore to study, during two important transition periods in development, the links between physical activity and sedentary behavior in kindergarten and physical, cognitive, and psychosocial well-being while children transition out of elementary school.   The first article (Chapter II) examined the prospective associations between participation in leisure-time physical activity at age 6 and academic performance at age 12. The results suggest that children who participate more in sports and other structured and unstructured physical activities perform better in school and present a higher classroom engagement six years later, than children who are less involved in these activities.  The second article (Chapter III) examined the prospective links between a lifestyle that takes into account, at the same time, participation in leisure-time physical activity, use of active transportation, and time spent on sedentary behaviors (computer, television, and video games) at age 6, and several indicators related to academic performance and physical and psychosocial well-being at age 12. The results reveal that children who lead a more active/less sedentary lifestyle before starting school present healthier lifestyles (more physical activity and less screen time), fewer emotional disorders and less victimization later in life, compared to children leading a less active/more sedentary lifestyle.  In both articles, gender-specific associations were also explored. The results of the gender-based analyses suggest that even if both girls and boys benefit from being more active/less sedentary, each gender experiences these benefits differently.  A discussion of the main findings and implications is presented in the last chapter. In summary, this thesis highlights the importance of promoting an active lifestyle from an early age and the need of developing communities that provide children with multiple opportunities to stay physically active. This will help prevent the many risks associated with inactivity and sedentariness among youth and thus contribute to their well-being, both in the short and long term.	sports , academic performance , active transportation , childhood and adolescence , gender , leisure-time , physical activity , screen time , sedentary behavior , well-being	en	23478.0
293	The art of living together : on political engagement and the ethics of companionship	This dissertation proposes that popular movements or uprisings can unite ethics and politics in a direct, practical manner and constitute an illuminating domain from which to advance normative theory that responds to the challenges of injustice in our world today. Any study of these movements ought to engage with a specific event and its context and renounce the position of ‘observer.’ Accordingly, I have chosen to examine the revolutions sparked in the Arab world over the past decade, particularly focusing on the account of Tahrir Square. In order to appreciate the novelty these revolutions offer, it is necessary to first dismantle the deeply entrenched epistemic grounds of Western political theory which consider revolutions only on the basis of their end results, particularly whether or not they effect regime change. These popular movements not only defy democratization studies and its prescription for change from above, they also fundamentally challenge the domain of politics and some of its basic tenets. This confrontation occurs the moment the people gain their agency and use their political power demonstrably and concretely. The domain of politics is further challenged when the people create, as they did in Tahrir Square, a public sphere that is receptive to individual desires and interests as well as collective solidarity and responsibility.  The conditions under which these movements organize their collective political action – horizontally, non-hierarchically, and unmediated by representative and leaders – resist the threat of their power being instrumentalized to obtain middling results pertaining to state power. This form of organization also reconfigures the crowd’s ethical interactions, unmistakeably on display in Tahrir Square, producing what I call “ethics of companionship.” These ethics can be reformulated and practiced in manner attuned to both self and other, and adapted to the specific needs and injustices of the world around us. An ethics of companionship is responsive and open for negotiation and persuasion, and above all, it makes an art out of our living together.

294	Analysis of 3D human gait reconstructed with a depth camera and mirrors	The problem of assessing human gaits has received a great attention in the literature since gait analysis is one of key components in healthcare. Marker-based and multi-camera systems are widely employed to deal with this problem. However, such systems usually require specific equipments with high price and/or high computational cost. In order to reduce the cost of devices, we focus on a system of gait analysis which employs only one depth sensor. The principle of our work is similar to multi-camera systems, but the collection of cameras is replaced by one depth sensor and mirrors. Each mirror in our setup plays the role of a camera which captures the scene at a different viewpoint. Since we use only one camera, the step of synchronization can thus be avoided and the cost of devices is also reduced.  Our studies can be separated into two categories: 3D reconstruction and gait analysis. The result of the former category is used as the input of the latter one. Our system for 3D reconstruction is built with a depth camera and two mirrors. Two types of depth sensor, which are distinguished based on the scheme of depth estimation, have been employed in our works. With the structured light (SL) technique integrated into the Kinect 1, we perform the 3D reconstruction based on geometrical optics. In order to increase the level of details of the 3D reconstructed model, the Kinect 2 with time-of-flight (ToF) depth measurement is used for image acquisition instead of the previous generation. However, due to multiple reflections on the mirrors, depth distortion occurs in our setup. We thus propose a simple approach for reducing such distortion before applying geometrical optics to reconstruct a point cloud of the 3D object.  For the task of gait analysis, we propose various alternative approaches focusing on the problem of gait normality/symmetry measurement. They are expected to be useful for clinical treatments such as monitoring patient's recovery after surgery. These methods consist of model-free and model-based approaches that have different cons and pros. In this dissertation, we present 3 methods that directly process point clouds reconstructed from the previous work. The first one uses cross-correlation of left and right half-bodies to assess gait symmetry while the other ones employ deep auto-encoders to measure gait normality.

295	Accurate and efficient strategies for the appearance filtering of complex materials	Realistic computer generated images and simulations require physically-based models to properly capture and reproduce light-material interactions. The underlying mathematical formulations are complex and mandate the use of efficient numerical methods, since analytic solutions are not available. Monte Carlo integration is one such commonly used numerical method, although, alternative approaches leveraging, e.g., basis expansions, may be suitable to solve these challenging problems. In this thesis by articles, we present two works where we efficiently devise numerical integration strategies for the rendering of complex materials. First, we propose a method to compute a spatial-angular multi-dimensional integration problem present when rendering materials with high-frequency normal variation under large, angularly varying illumination. By computing and manipulating a novel spherical histogram data representation, we are able to use spherical harmonics to efficiently solve the integral, outperforming the state-of-the-art by a factor of roughly 30×. Our second work describes a high-performance Monte Carlo integration strategy for rendering layered materials. By identifying the best path sampling strategies in the micro-scale light transport context, we are able to tailor an unbiased and efficient path construction method to evaluate high throughput, low variance paths through an arbitrary number of layers.

296	L'exposition revisitée par le sonore : l'émergence de nouveaux régimes d'écoute au musée d'art	Sound art and music have appeared in art museum programming with increasing regularity since the turn of the 21st Century and have caused major shifts in the exhibitory practices. However, no exhibition model has so far been able to properly account for the multifarious issues raised by sound in the museum space. There has been a failure to adequately address both the technological and audible opportunities of sound and, concomitantly, an inability to re-evaluate the intrinsic limits of oculocentric models that have guided the discourses and practices of museum institutions. This thesis revisits the exhibition practices of the art museum—the set of discursive and physical spaces that interact within these locations. It demonstrates the limits of a logic built on codes reminiscent of the white cube and the black box, proposing instead the idea of the sound studio and the music concert as new exhibition models, which are related to the production and distribution models of the music industry. To do so, this research initially argues that the development of sound in an exhibition context depends on the recorded sounds of reproduction and distribution technologies as well as the practices—individual and collective—of listening in everyday. The study is based on a series of exhibitions that reveal variations in the relation between the museum discourse mapped out above and the organization of the exhibition spaces according to sound-specific pieces: the exhibition of sound art Soundings: A Contemporary Score (2013) at the Museum of Modern Art; Ragnar Kjartansson (2015) and Anri Sala (2011) at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Montreal; the electronic music of Sonic Process (2002) at the Center Pompidou; and finally, popular music in the David Bowie Is exhibition (2013) developed by the Victoria & Albert Museum. From here, the thesis will demonstrate—based on the theories derived from both sound studies and listening phenomenology—the ways in which the sound within the exhibition space raises specific issues, how mixing encourages regimes of listening in the art museum and how the visitor's posture is transformed by the possibilities of wandering through the museum space. Beyond the sensory dimension, sound in the art museum context brings about a shift in theoretical and disciplinary models; abolishing hierarchies and reconfiguring how we understand the idea of the museum from the concept of resonance.	sound studies , exhibition , art museum , sound art , music , sound studies , space , sound technology	en	23433.0
297	Age, period, and cohort effects on adult mortality due to extrinsic causes of death	After decades of improvement, life expectancy momentarily declined during 2014-15 in several high income countries, with subsequent reversals in some cases. The main sources of this stagnation have been increases in mortality from influenza and drug overdoses, mainly for the baby-boomer generation. This trend is unexpected because it has long been assumed that extrinsic mortality, which is due to causes originating outside the body – in opposition to intrinsic mortality from degenerative diseases at old ages –, plays a negligible role in life expectancy changes. For this reason, the temporal patterns of extrinsic mortality have received little attention in demographic research. Period crises such as influenza epidemics and the opioid crisis are considered the main determinants of variations of extrinsic mortality. However, despite recent evidence suggesting that cohort effects have an important role in modulating extrinsic mortality, little is known about this relationship.  The main objective of this dissertation is to help fill this gap by examining cohort influences on extrinsic mortality change, with a particular emphasis on influenza and behavioral causes. More specifically, we aim (1) to quantify cohort differences in mortality from influenza and the influence of early life exposures to the virus on subsequent influenza mortality; (2) to analyze the baby boomers’ disadvantage in mortality in Canada and the United States, while identifying the contributions of behavioral causes to this disadvantage; and (3) to develop a methodological tool that can be used to both conduct visual analysis of the temporal dynamics of nonlinear Age-Period-Cohort (APC) effects, and compare these dynamics across various phenomena or populations. To achieve these goals, we use micro-level mortality data from vital statistics in Canada and the United States. We also employ death and fertility rates from various countries to generalize the visual analysis of nonlinear effects to other demographic phenomena. The analyses were conducted by applying Serfling models for the estimation of influenza mortality, demographic measures for the decomposition of cause-specific mortality changes, smoothing techniques for the identification of trends, and statistical and visual approaches on the Lexis configuration for the analysis of APC effects.  The results, in the form of three scientific articles, show that despite marked fluctuations over calendar years (periods), birth cohorts have an independent and sustained influence on influenza and mortality from behavioral causes. The main results from the first paper suggest that two mechanisms modulated influenza mortality over cohorts. For the young and adult population, the mortality risks over cohorts depend of the contrast between the first virus to which individuals were exposed (the virus producing an antigenic imprinting) and the virus encountered in adulthood during the observed epidemic. For this age segment, significant changes in risk were found during influenza epidemics among cohorts born during important antigenic shifts (e.g., a decrease in risk for cohorts born between 1957 and 1968). For older ages, we did not identify such “punctual” cohort effects but rather a smooth and monotonic change in cohort effects that might have driven a progressive decline in influenza mortality between 1959 and 2016. Inspired by so-called cohort morbidity phenotype and technophysio evolution theories, we attributed this decline to changes produced earlier, i.e., to the sharp sanitary improvements occurred between 1900 and 1930, when the concerned cohorts were born and when they could have benefited. Findings from the second paper revealed that most of the baby boomers’ excess mortality in Canada and the United States is driven by behavioral causes of death. The “boomer disadvantage” resulted from multiple cohort effects on behavioral-related mortality, and not from punctual period effects affecting the same cohort at different ages. Among the baby boomers, the risk of dying from hepatitis C was almost three times higher, and the risk of dying from drug-related causes was almost two times higher, than among the adjacent cohorts. These results were obtained using an innovative methodology developed in the third paper, which allowed us to analyze the dynamics of nonlinear effects over time through APC curvature plots. This technique provides greater flexibility than statistical models or other Lexis plots, and it has been shown to be applicable to other demographic phenomena, such as fertility. The findings presented in this dissertation offer evidence of the importance of analyzing cohort effects on extrinsic mortality. Our results indicate that even in the presence of substantial period disturbances affecting extrinsic mortality at most ages, cohort effects were sustained over time. These findings also suggest that public policies can significantly improve the health of the population by formulating policies that take into account the differential sensitivity of cohorts to risk factors and by providing social support to the most vulnerable cohorts.	mortality , age-period-cohort effects , extrinsic causes , influenza mortality , baby boomers , behavioral mortality , drug overdoses , birth cohort effects , generational identity , Lexis surfaces	en	23411.0
298	I : Synthèse de carbazole en débit continu. II : Transfert de proton couplé à l’électron photocatalysé au cuivre	Photochemistry and photocatalysis have had a significant impact in organic synthesis, often offering low-energy alternatives to traditional thermal chemistry, or even affording complementary reactivity. The thesis is divided into two sections describing photochemical methods for the synthesis of carbazoles and 1,2-diols. The first section described the conception of a flow chemistry apparatus and a comparison of two photochemical methods, one using visible light and another using UV-light for carbazole synthesis via flow chemistry. While UV irradiation affords better yields, it does not tolerate sensitive functionals groups that are accessible when irradiated in the visible range. The chemoselectivity of the carbazoles synthesis is also examined with both methods. The second section explores the development of copper(I) photocatalysts for promoting a reductive proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET). General guidelines and structure/activity relationships were established for the PCET process through evaluation of a 50-member library of heteroleptic copper complexes bearing one diamine and one bisphosphine. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that a copper photocatalyst could be designed a priori to incorporate a hydrogen-bond donor within its framework to promote PCET reactions. The newly designed catalyst was applied in a photochemical pinacol coupling and was capable of transforming substrates that were unreactive using existing technology, even with a hydrogen bond donor that was orders of magnitude less acidic than common additives. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that the copper catalyst functioned via reductive quenching before PCET, which could not have been easily predicted given the literature precedent. The thesis describes the preparation of molecules such as pinacols and heterocycles that are of high value. Importantly, the new photochemical methods developed lower the energy requirements for synthesis, decrease reaction times and use continuous flow technology that would facilitate and intensify scale-up. In sum, the research herein contributes to efforts to promote sustainable and greener methods of synthesis for fine chemicals.

299	L'art de la rencontre inuite/non-inuite dans le milieu de la santé à Montréal	More and more Inuit from Nunavik are being transferred to Montreal for health care and face a regular system that is often described as unsafe and inadequate in the northern context. Several macro systemic conditions such as colonial history, prejudice, racism and discrimination compromise Aboriginal cultural safety. However, each encounter has the potential to transform this experience from a relational and systemic point of view. How can we support the emergence of this transformative potential and what are the conditions that hinder it? Several suggested that art could challenge habits and foster emotional mobilizing power. Considering the complexity and sensitivity of the Inuit/non-Inuit encounter in this context, this research project aims to document the process of this encounter based on an auto-ethnographic creative practice. The specific objectives are: 1) to identify the phases and transformations experienced during my encounters with Inuit at the Northern Quebec Module (NQM, now called Ullivik), based on artistic practice and 2) to explore the systemic, relational and personal conditions that took part in these encounters based on artistic practice. For six months I facilitated non-directed drawing, painting, printmaking and crochet workshops at the NQM which houses Inuit from Nunavik during their care in Montreal. I also developed a participatory installation over a year and a half at the NQM and the university to identify systemic cultural habits in the encounters. The installation took the form of two suspended steel panels, on which fabrics and strings were magnetized. The field notes and works produced during the doctoral project were used as analytical material. Inspired by the non-representational approach, I reflect on the processes of the encounter, as well as on the potential for transformation in interactions. Two moves were particularly striking in my process, giving me the impression of losing face at the scientific and artistic level, in a new and anxious terrain: the recognition of silence in my artistic practice, but also in my family surrounding the two World Wars in Europe, then a move of the work on the floor, destabilizing my representations of the hierarchy by moving from two to three dimensions. These moves were analyzed in their implication on my encounters at the MNQ. The notion of losing face led to a Goffmanian analysis of encounters, then making links between microsociology, micropolitics, and macro systemic contexts in a relational field, through affect. The analysis of the process and the analysis of interactions made it possible to reflect on the back and forth between non-representations and representations, i.e. moments of openness to creative possibilities in the encounter, and moments of closure or tendency to stereotypes and generalizations. These reflections are brought back into the context of health care to rethink health intervention with Inuit.

300	Two-stage majoritarian choice	We propose a class of decisive collective choice rules that rely on an exogenous linear ordering to partition the majority relation into two acyclic relations. The first relation is used to obtain a shortlist of the feasible alternatives while the second is used to make a final choice. In combination with faithfulness to the underlying majority relation, rules in this class are characterized by two desirable rationality properties: Sen’s expansion consistency and a version of Manzini and Mariotti’s weak WARP. The rules also satisfy natural adaptations of Arrow’s independence of irrelevant alternatives and May’s positive responsiveness.

301	Walking into the sunset : how criminal achievement shapes the desistance process	According to the criminal career paradigm, the link between past and future criminal activities is important and the desistance process may vary for individuals whose criminal trajectories were punctuated by failure compared to those who achieved a certain level of success. This study, based on the life narratives of 27 individuals who maintained a state of non-offending for more than a year, examines how criminal achievement modulates the desistance process. The aim is to understand whether criminal achievement acts as a barrier or a facilitator in the desistance process. A short questionnaire based on the life-history calendar method was used to classify individuals according to the parameters of their criminal careers. Narrative life stories were then used to look at the obstacles and frustrations encountered during desistance. The results show the relation between criminal achievement and desistance is complex: success in criminal activities is not always hindering desistance.

302	The dementia-associated APOE ε4 allele is not associated with REM sleep behavior disorder	The present study aimed to examine whether the APOE ε4 allele, associated with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and possibly with dementia in Parkinson's disease (PD), is also associated with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD). Two single nucleotide polymorphisms, rs429358 and rs7412, were genotyped in RBD patients (n = 480) and in controls (n = 823). APOE ε4 allele frequency was 0.14 among RBD patients and 0.13 among controls (OR = 1.11, 95% CI: 0.88–1.40, p = 0.41). APOE ε4 allele frequencies were similar in those who converted to DLB (0.14) and those who converted to Parkinson's disease (0.12) or multiple system atrophy (0.14, p = 1.0). The APOE ε4 allele is neither a risk factor for RBD nor it is associated with conversion from RBD to DLB or other synucleinopathies.

303	Identifying at-risk profiles and protective factors for problem gambling : a longitudinal study across adolescence and early adulthood	Past studies have identified various risk and protective factors for problem gambling (PG). However, no study has examined the interplay between these factors using a combination of person-centered and variable-centered approaches embedded within a longitudinal design. The present study aimed to (a) identify distinct profiles in early adolescence based on a set of risk factors commonly associated with PG (impulsivity, depression, anxiety, drug−alcohol use, aggressiveness, and antisociality), (b) explore the difference in reported gambling problems between these profiles during midadolescence and early adulthood, and (c) identify family- and peer-related variables that could operate as protective or compensatory factors in this context. Two samples were used: (a) a population sample (N = 1,033) living in low socioeconomic-status neighborhoods and (b) a population sample (N = 3,017) representative of students attending Quebec schools. Latent profile analyses were conducted to identify at-risk profiles based on individual risk factors measured at age 12 years. Negative binomial regression models were estimated to compare profiles in terms of their reported gambling problems at ages 16 and 23. Finally, family- and peer-related variables measured at age 14 were included to test their protective or compensatory role with respect to the link between at-risk profiles and gambling problems. Four profiles were identified: well-adjusted, internalizing, externalizing, and comorbid. Compared to the well-adjusted profile, the externalizing and comorbid profiles reported more gambling problems at ages 16 and 23, but the internalizing profile did not differ significantly. Various protective and compensatory factors emerged for each profile at both time points.	Gambling , Latent profile analysis , Protective factor , Adolescence , Longitudinal design	en	23334.0
304	Les variations temporelles de la fréquence des violences physiques en contexte conjugal	Intimate partner violence (IPV) against women is a dynamic phenomenon that evolves over time. However, despite our recognition of this situation, few studies have been devoted to the phenomenon. In particular, little is known about the factors behind changes in the intensity of violence or how it varies over time. This study addresses these gaps by focusing on the individual trajectories of women who have been victims of IPV. More specifically, the goal is to analyze how the frequency of physical violence evolves over time. The research is based on retrospective data from 53 women who experienced IPV over a period of 36 months. The individual trajectory of these women was reconstructed using the life history calendar method. Results suggest that the frequency of physical violence not only varies greatly from one victim to another but the trajectory also varies for each woman. They also demonstrate that in order to understand how violence evolves, it is imperative to consider the characteristics of the victim, the spouse, and their relationship, as well as changes in life circumstances. Another result is the effect of time: we found that the frequency of violence tended to increase over the period being studied. Studying the trajectory of women victims of IPV is an important way to better understand the phenomenon as well as to find ways for more effective intervention with victims.

305	Inattention and reaction time variability are linked to ventromedial prefrontal volume in adolescents	Background Neuroimaging studies of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have most commonly reported volumetric abnormalities in the basal ganglia, cerebellum, and prefrontal cortices. Few studies have examined the relationship between ADHD symptomatology and brain structure in population-based samples. We investigated the relationship between dimensional measures of ADHD symptomatology, brain structure, and reaction time variability—an index of lapses in attention. We also tested for associations between brain structural correlates of ADHD symptomatology and maps of dopaminergic gene expression. Methods Psychopathology and imaging data were available for 1538 youths. Parent ratings of ADHD symptoms were obtained using the Development and Well-Being Assessment and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Self-reports of ADHD symptoms were assessed using the youth version of the SDQ. Reaction time variability was available in a subset of participants. For each measure, whole-brain voxelwise regressions with gray matter volume were calculated. Results Parent ratings of ADHD symptoms (Development and Well-Being Assessment and SDQ), adolescent self-reports of ADHD symptoms on the SDQ, and reaction time variability were each negatively associated with gray matter volume in an overlapping region of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Maps of DRD1 and DRD2 gene expression were associated with brain structural correlates of ADHD symptomatology. Conclusions This is the first study to reveal relationships between ventromedial prefrontal cortex structure and multi-informant measures of ADHD symptoms in a large population-based sample of adolescents. Our results indicate that ventromedial prefrontal cortex structure is a biomarker for ADHD symptomatology. These findings extend previous research implicating the default mode network and dopaminergic dysfunction in ADHD.

307	Contributorship and division of labor in knowledge production	Scientific authorship has been increasingly complemented with contributorship statements. While such statements are said to ensure more equitable credit and responsibility attribution, they also provide an opportunity to examine the roles and functions that authors play in the construction of knowledge and the relationship between these roles and authorship order. Drawing on a comprehensive and multidisciplinary dataset of 87,002 documents in which contributorship statements are found, this article examines the forms that division of labor takes across disciplines, the relationships between various types of contributions, as well as the relationships between the contribution types and various indicators of authors’ seniority. It shows that scientific work is more highly divided in medical disciplines than in mathematics, physics, and disciplines of the social sciences, and that, with the exception of medicine, the writing of the paper is the task most often associated with authorship. The results suggest a clear distinction between contributions that could be labeled as ‘technical’ and those that could be considered ‘conceptual’: While conceptual tasks are typically associated with authors with higher seniority, technical tasks are more often performed by younger scholars. Finally, results provide evidence of a U-shaped relationship between extent of contribution and author order: In all disciplines, first and last authors typically contribute to more tasks than middle authors. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of the results for the reward system of science.	Authorship , Bibliometrics , Collaboration , Contributorship	en	23289.0
308	Estimating open access Mandate effectiveness : the MELIBEA score	MELIBEA is a directory of institutional open‐access policies for research output that uses a composite formula with eight weighted conditions to estimate the “strength” of open access (OA) mandates (registered in ROARMAP). We analyzed total Web of Science‐(WoS)‐indexed publication output in years 2011–2013 for 67 institutions in which OA was mandated to estimate the mandates' effectiveness: How well did the MELIBEA score and its individual conditions predict what percentage of the WoS‐indexed articles is actually deposited in each institution's OA repository, and when? We found a small but significant positive correlation (0.18) between the MELIBEA “strength” score and deposit percentage. For three of the eight MELIBEA conditions (deposit timing, internal use, and opt‐outs), one value of each was strongly associated with deposit percentage or latency ([a] immediate deposit required; [b] deposit required for performance evaluation; [c] unconditional opt‐out allowed for the OA requirement but no opt‐out for deposit requirement). When we updated the initial values and weights of the MELIBEA formula to reflect the empirical association we had found, the score's predictive power for mandate effectiveness doubled (0.36). There are not yet enough OA mandates to test further mandate conditions that might contribute to mandate effectiveness, but the present findings already suggest that it would be productive for existing and future mandates to adopt the three identified conditions so as to maximize their effectiveness, and thereby the growth of OA.

309	Knowledge sharing in global health research : the impact, uptake and cost of open access to scholarly literature	Background: In 1982, the Annals of Virology published a paper showing how Liberia has a highly endemic potential of Ebola warning health authorities of the risk for potential outbreaks; this journal is only available by subscription. Limiting the accessibility of such knowledge may have reduced information propagation toward public health actors who were indeed surprised by and unprepared for the 2014 epidemic. Open access (OA) publication can allow for increased access to global health research (GHR). Our study aims to assess the use, cost and impact of OA diffusion in the context of GHR. Method: A total of 3366 research articles indexed under the Medical Heading Subject Heading “Global Health” published between 2010 and 2014 were retrieved using PubMed to (1) quantify the uptake of various types of OA, (2) estimate the article processing charges (APCs) of OA, and (3) analyse the relationship between different types of OA, their scholarly impact and gross national income per capita of citing countries. Results: Most GHR publications are not available directly on the journal’s website (69%). Further, 60.8% of researchers do not self-archive their work even when it is free and in keeping with journal policy. The total amount paid for APCs was estimated at US$1.7 million for 627 papers, with authors paying on average US$2732 per publication; 94% of APCs were paid to journals owned by the ten most prominent publication houses from high-income countries. Researchers from low- and middle-income countries are generally citing less expensive types of OA, while researchers in high-income countries are citing the most expensive OA. Conclusions: Although OA may help in building global research capacity in GHR, the majority of publications remain subscription only. It is logical and cost-efficient for institutions and researchers to promote OA by selfarchiving publications of restricted access, as it not only allows research to be cited by a broader audience, it also augments citation rates. Although OA does not ensure full knowledge transfer from research to practice, limiting public access can negatively impact implementation and outcomes of health policy and reduce public understanding of health issues.

310	Costly collaborations : the impact of scientific fraud on co-authors’ careers	Over the last few years, several major scientific fraud cases have shocked the scientific community. The number of retractions each year has also increased tremendously, especially in the biomedical field, and scientific misconduct accounts for approximately more than half of those retractions. It is assumed that co-authors of retracted papers are affected by their colleagues’ misconduct, and the aim of this study is to provide empirical evidence of the effect of retractions in biomedical research on co-authors’ research careers. Using data from the Web of Science (WOS), we measured the productivity, impact and collaboration of 1,123 co-authors of 293 retracted articles for a period of five years before and after the retraction. We found clear evidence that collaborators do suffer consequences of their colleagues’ misconduct, and that a retraction for fraud has higher consequences than a retraction for error. Our results also suggest that the extent of these consequences is closely linked with the ranking of co-authors on the retracted paper, being felt most strongly by first authors, followed by the last authors, while the impact is less important for middle authors.

312	arXiv E‐prints and the journal of record : an analysis of roles and relationships	Since its creation in 1991, arXiv has become central to the diffusion of research in a number of fields. Combining data from the entirety of arXiv and the Web of Science (WoS), this article investigates (a) the proportion of papers across all disciplines that are on arXiv and the proportion of arXiv papers that are in the WoS, (b) the elapsed time between arXiv submission and journal publication, and (c) the aging characteristics and scientific impact of arXiv e‐prints and their published version. It shows that the proportion of WoS papers found on arXiv varies across the specialties of physics and mathematics, and that only a few specialties make extensive use of the repository. Elapsed time between arXiv submission and journal publication has shortened but remains longer in mathematics than in physics. In physics, mathematics, as well as in astronomy and astrophysics, arXiv versions are cited more promptly and decay faster than WoS papers. The arXiv versions of papers—both published and unpublished—have lower citation rates than published papers, although there is almost no difference in the impact of the arXiv versions of published and unpublished papers.

316	Environmental drivers of rare earth element bioaccumulation in freshwater zooplankton	Human activities have resulted in significant release of rare earth elements (REEs) into the environment. However, the pathways of REEs from waters and soils into freshwater food webs remain poorly understood. Recent studies suggest that aquatic invertebrates may be good biomonitors for REEs, yet there is little information on factors that control REE bioaccumulation in these organisms. Our goal was to study the environmental drivers of REE levels in zooplankton, a key component in plankton food webs, across lakes from geographic areas with different bedrock geology. From 2011 to 2014, bulk zooplankton samples were collected for REE analysis from 39 lakes in eastern Canada. We observed a more than 200 fold variation in surface water REE concentrations and a 10-fold variation in sediment REE concentrations. These concentration gradients were associated with a range of more than an order of magnitude in zooplankton REE concentrations (∑REEY 3.2−210 nmol g−1 ). We found higher REE bioaccumulation in zooplankton from lakes with lower pH and higher REE to dissolved organic carbon ratios. Bioaccumulation was also strongly linked to the free ion concentrations of REEs (REE3+) in surface waters. Our study suggests that zooplankton REE bioaccumulation is an excellent predictor of bioavailable REEs in freshwaters.

320	The partnership in social and solidarity economy : from contract to alliance : a case study	Among development policies, social and solidarity economy (SSE) practices are taking on increasing importance. These practices are characterised by the development of ‘relational wealth’ in addition to material and financial wealth and in particular the relationship of reciprocity (Polanyi 1944; Servet 2007). In this context, the notion of alliance becomes highly significant. This refers to various forms of partnerships forged by the parties involved. Nonetheless, very different, and sometimes even opposite, relational logics underlying these partnerships can be observed. We suggest comparing two different partnership logics: the contract logic and the alliance logic. The analysis is made in relation to the study of a large French SSE organisation operating in the field of sport.

321	A short-term assessment of nascent HIV-1 transmission clusters among newly diagnosed individuals using envelope sequence-based phylogenetic analyses	The identification of transmission clusters (TCs) of HIV-1 using phylogenetic analyses can provide insights into viral transmission network and help improve prevention strategies. We compared the use of partial HIV-1 envelope fragment of 1,070 bp with its loop 3 (108 bp) to determine its utility in inferring HIV-1 transmission clustering. Serum samples of recently (n = 106) and chronically (n = 156) HIV-1-infected patients with status confirmed were sequenced. HIV-1 envelope nucleotide-based phylogenetic analyses were used to infer HIV-1 TCs. Those were constructed using ClusterPickerGUI_1.2.3 considering a pairwise genetic distance of £10% threshold. Logistic regression analyses were used to examine the relationship between the demographic factors that were likely associated with HIV-1 clustering. Ninety-eight distinct consensus envelope sequences were subjected to phylogenetic analyses. Using a partial envelope fragment sequence, 42 sequences were grouped into 15 distinct small TCs while the V3 loop reproduces 10 clusters. The agreement between the partial envelope and the V3 loop fragments was significantly moderate with a Cohen’s kappa (j) coefficient of 0.59, p < .00001. The mean age (<38.8 years) and HIV-1 B subtype are two factors identified that were significantly associated with HIV-1 transmission clustering in the cohort, odds ratio (OR) = 0.25, 95% confidence interval (CI, 0.04–0.66), p = .002 and OR: 0.17, 95% CI (0.10–0.61), p = .011, respectively. The present study confirms that a partial fragment of the HIV-1 envelope sequence is a better predictor of transmission clustering. However, the loop 3 segment may be useful in screening purposes and may be more amenable to integration in surveillance programs.

322	Influence des symptômes dépressifs sur le participation sociale et la satisfaction de vie suite à un traumatisme craniocérébral léger	Purpose : There is much evidence regarding the impact of moderate and severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) on social participation (leisure and community integration), but little is known about social participation in the first months following mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). However, it is well known that social participation is an integral part of a satisfying life. The aim of the study is to assess the impact of mood and post-concussive symptoms on social participation and life satisfaction early after mTBI. Method: The sample includes 85 participants aged between 18 and 61 years old who sustained mTBI. In the first months following mTBI, participants answered questionnaires measuring practice of leisure activities (pre and post-mTBI), community integration, anxiety and depression symptoms, fatigue, post-concussive symptoms and life satisfaction. Results: Total scores of interest, frequency of practice and leisure satisfaction are significantly lower after mTBI. Depressive symptoms are negatively associated with interest and satisfaction with leisure and with community integration. Finally, depressive symptoms is a moderator of interest and satisfaction with leisure, community integration and life satisfaction. Conclusion : These results suggest that mTBI negatively affects the practice of leisure activities, that symptoms of depression are associated with lower social participation and that they moderate the relationship between social participation and life satisfaction. Early post-mTBI intervention specifically targeting depressed mood is therefore recommended.	Mild traumatic brain injury , Leisure , Community integration , Depression , Life satisfaction	en	22973.0
323	Rationing hepatitis C treatment in the context of austerity policies in France and Cameroon : a transnational perspective on thepharmaceuticalization of healthcare systems	New powerful drugs against hepatitis C can cure the disease, but they are not widely distributed because their exorbitant prices are destabilizing healthcare systems in both African and European countries. This article takes access to hepatitis C treatments since 2013 in France and in Cameroon as a lens to analyze the rationing of pharmaceutical treatments in relation to recent transformations of health systems. Access to these treatments is analyzed thanks to ethnographic observation and interviews lead in Paris and Yaoundé, with patients, associations, health professionals and public health experts. In Cameroon, rationing takes place through various layers of socio-economic restrictions, and no patient organization advocates for hepatitis treatment. In France, access to hepatitis C treatments has become politicized, and collective mobilizations have denounced rationing as a threat to the promise of universal social security. In this study, we examine Africa's long experience with rationing in the context of structural adjustment, and we bring together experiences in France and Cameroon. This article analyses the phenomenon of the pharmaceuticalization of healthcare systems, that is to say the growing use of pharmaceuticals in healthcare systems, by documenting the social and political construction of scarcity. Indeed, whereas pharmaceuticalization is a concept that has often been used in situations of drugs abundance, a parallel analysis of rationing highlights a political economy of pharmaceuticals that shapes public health debates and policies according to an economy of scarcity, especially in times of austerity.

324	Modèle attentionnel à deux étapes de la planification des mouvements de portée du bras et des saccades	Planning saccades or reach movements to a specific location in the environment relies on attentional mechanisms to select a relevant location and on motor systems to correctly guide the movements to their destination. However, the interaction between attention and action are still far from being completely understood. We wished to determine whether planning of eye and arm movements is based on shared or independent representations. In our first article, we investigated how exogenous attentional modulation through the use of behaviorally irrelevant cues influenced the temporal and spatial characteristics of the eye and the arm during single or combined movements. We found both similar and differential effects of eye and arm reaction times, which we suggest is based on two stages of motor planning; one effector-independent and one effector-dependent. In our second article, we investigated the influence of exogenous cueing on arm movements during visuomotor adaptation to identify whether attentional mechanisms facilitate motor planning or visual target detection. Our findings demonstrated that motor planning during a visuomotor adaptation task relied more on the visual target than on arm motor planning, contrastingly to saccades, as has been shown in a previous study. Taken together, our papers provide better understanding of the operating mechanisms of attention on eye and arm movements and the interaction between sensory and motor systems. We propose a dual-stage attentional model to bring together a number of divergent findings in the field with respect to eye and arm planning processes.

nalyse de séries temporelles selon les modèles SARIMA et SARIMAX"	At the global level, climate indicators are increasingly described as factors related to zoonosis. The main objective of this study was to verify the relationship between changes in monthly maximum ambient temperature and monthly total precipitation level (including snow and rain) and the cumulative monthly incidence of human campylobacteriosis in three health regions of Quebec with different climatic conditions: Montréal, Mauricie-et-Centre-du-Québec and Capitale-Nationale. A double time series analysis, SARIMA (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) and SARIMAX (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with Exogenous variables) was carried out over the period 2000-2015. For the three health regions, the campylobacteriosis cumulative monthly incidence followed a seasonal pattern with a peak between July and August. The SARIMAX models were the best models for assessing the association between the cumulative monthly incidence of human campylobacteriosis and the two climatic variables. A positive correlation between monthly maximum temperature and cumulative monthly incidence of human campylobacteriosis was observed for Montréal (p < 0.0001) and Mauricie-et-Centre-du-Québec (p = 0.0079) health regions. On the other hand, for total precipitation, the correlation was negative and significant only for Montréal (p = 0.0004). It remains to explore the link with several other climatic variables, such as rainfall, relative humidity and the length of the plant-growing season, as well as to develop SARIMAX models for campylobacteriosis incidence prediction.

326	Grunge, genre et style : analyse d'un phénomène du rock américain des années 1990	The world discovered grunge in 1991 thanks to the popularity of Nirvana’s « Smells Like Teen Spirit». During almost half of a decade, the American popular music changed profoundly and grunge appeared to be the standard bearer of an entire generation. With heavy guitars and an alleged nihilism, grunge was embodied through strong imagery and around the city of Seattle, Washington. Soundgarden, Pearl Jam and Alice in Chains joined the success of grunge, but is it really possible to define what appears to be a « genre » trough stylistic considerations ? This work suggests, at first, reconsidering grunge in its aspects of « genre », to try then to decode its possible stylistic unit. Grunge popularizing, at the beggining of the 1990’s, in a era of great call into question about music consumption and production because of democratization of audio digital technologies. Do these changes were able to influence, and even to condition the emergence and the popularization of that new style ?	grunge , punk , Seattle , Pearl Jam , Nirvana , Soundgarden , Moore , Genre , Style , Popular music , Alternative music , Recorded music , Analysis , Digital audio , Alice In Chains	en	22867.0
327	Équité et efficacité en éducation : regards croisés France/Québec	Our study aims at comparing French and English education systems regarding equity and efficiency. This research is based on an empirical literature review of studies conducted in France and Quebec. We focused on equality of treatment for students whatever their socioeconomic and cultural background. The study reveals that there is more inequity in the French education system than in the Quebec one. However, the results of the study show similarities on both systems with regard to hidden processes of discrimination (unequal treatment of the pupils, unequal access to the different programs) witch benefit students from upper social classes, notwithstanding the official discourse which pretends to fight against inequalities. Indeed, the achievement gap between the pupils is not only related to their socioeconomic background or their skills: the educational system itself produces inequalities. Moreover, the unequal treatment of the pupils reinforces the achievement gap between those from lower social classes and the others. Finally, the study reveals the importance of school mix for the academic achievement. Indeed, the fact that school inequalities are higher in France than in Quebec, could be due to the higher level of social and ethnic segregation in French schools.

This provision creates the obligation for State Parties to eliminate gender stereotypes that are wrong and unjustified. Moreover, this thesis wishes to address the impact of gender theories on the definition of the terms ""sex"" and ""women"" within the application and scope of article 5. Finally, this thesis will also aim to give meaning to a beneficial and justified gender stereotype, while keeping in mind the substantive equality objective of feminist movements."

329	L'usage du droit comparé dans le raisonnement du juge : analyse en matière de droits fondamentaux au Canada et en Afrique du Sud	Establishing fundamental rights texts over a broad diversity of countries offers the national constitutional judge a full field of study to interpret these rights. To give life to the text itself, it is common that national judges focus a lot on the methods applied in other states. This study will primarily be centered around how these judges use the comparative technique. Therefore, the use of this method in the judge's reasoning can often be seen as useful in order to be inspired by the work of others that came before him. Two states that stand out by the way they use the comparative method in their fundamental rights interpretation are Canada and South Africa. These two countries higher courts judges are using this method in a recurrent way, and thus providing a fertile ground for the analysis of the pros and cons, utilities and limits of this technique as a whole. The use of comparative law in the judge's reasoning is thus often useful, but is it always legitimate? Over the course of this study, we will dig deeper to take a closer look at the way judges are using the comparative method. Thus, we will note the utility as well as the dangers of resorting to foreign law in the practice of interpretating national fundamental texts.

330	Identification des partenaires de gM du virus VHS-1 par BioID couplée à la spectrométrie de masse	Among the glycoproteins of HSV-1, glycoprotein M (gM) regulates the fusion between the envelope of the virus and the plasma membrane. gM is the first one of the viral glycoproteins to be detected in the nuclear membrane early in the viral cycle at 4 h post infection. However, the mechanism by which it’s targeted to the nuclear membrane, as well as for the host’s proteins, is still unknown. The knowns partners of gM that have been previously described by yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation do not appear to be involved in this targeting. Herein, we hypothesize that other viral and/or cellular proteins are involved. To investigate the likelihood of new gM partners, a BioID approach was used. Cell lines expressing gM coupled to BirA* and other control cell lines have been used and infected for 4 or 12 h with the ∆gM-2 HSV-1. The purified samples were then analyzed by mass spectrometry where 177 hits were identified. Among them, the proteins SNX1, SNX2, SCAMP3, VPS33B, MTMR6, TMEM43 and XPO6, all implicated in intracellular transport or in the integrity of the intern nuclear membrane, were chosen to validate their putative role in the delocalization of gM by siRNA. The target knockdowns were validated by RT-qPCR and further confirmed using immunofluorescence. Eventually, these targets will be further studied to assess their role in viral egress using plaque assay. In the future, this study will deepen our understanding of the mechanism of viral egress and eventually might provide a new model that could explain how gM and host proteins are being targeted to the nuclear membranes.	herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) , glycoprotein M (gM) , nuclear membranes , Biotin-Identification (BioID) , mass spectrometry , nuclear transport	en	22813.0
331	Prise de décision quant au devenir d’une grossesse compliquée par une anomalie fœtale sévère : facteurs impliqués, impacts et considérations éthiques	In case of life-threatening fetal anomaly, women are confronted with the decision to terminate or to continue the pregnancy and have their child affected by a disease that could impact on his quality of life or life expectancy.  The purpose of this thesis is to have a better understanding of their decision-making process and offer tools so that clinicians can offer an appropriate decisional support.    In a qualitative study using grounded theory, ten interviews were conducted with women whose pregnancy was complicated be life-threatening fetal anomaly.  Results shows that women are at different states of their maternity process (posture) at the time of decision-making: assumed maternity and maternity project.  The decision in itself is not determined by the posture, but the posture will influence the reasons why the woman would choose to continue or terminate her pregnancy.  Different levels of clinician’s implication in the decision-making process are expected by women.  All women express the importance of receiving complete medical information, but only some women expect a clinician's active implication in their decision-making process.   Decision-making process for pregnancies complicated by life-threatening fetal anomaly is a complex phenomenon influenced by many non-medical factors.  The establishment of a therapeutic relationship consistent with the woman’s expectations might help her to take a decision in accordance with her wills and values.

332	Les épreuves du travail musical : la persévérance des musiciens et musiciennes au Québec	In this thesis, the musical practice of Quebec musicians is approached from the angle of work and its troubles. It is based on the analysis of work experiences of musicians and journalistic representations of success. This research is in the current of artistic work, that is to say the sociology of work which takes as object the artists and their practice. The originality of the subject lies in a change of focus where the work of musicians is no longer only understood in terms of precariousness, but perseverance. If all studies on artists describe particularly precarious employment conditions, how can their perseverance be explained? Perseverance as the guiding thread of the dissertation is operationalized by the notion of troubles. Beyond a vision of the pathways dotted with scattered troubles, the problematized notion becomes a convincing analytical operator. A first moment of the process describes the journalistic representations of musical work by the union magazine Entracte. This first look is then deepened by an analysis of interviews with musicians in Quebec. Freelance and the original project are the two main forms of musical work and are crossed by several troubles. From a synchronic point of view, the general feeling of lack of time is the manifestation of the typical trouble that comes to structure all these events, and which is characterized by a tension between making a « living » in music and « playing » music. Musicians must both pursue their artistic vision and consider it in terms of retribution. In a diachronic perspective, a more fundamental self-study comes to structure the experience of the musicians. They must find a way for them to « find their place » in a profession where the ways of exercising and the universes are multiple, facing identity troubles that act as contradictory injunctions.

333	Chiennes de vies : la relation anthropozoologique, un angle mort de l'intervention en itinérance?	As loyal companions, friends and confidants, nonhuman animals can become irreplaceable allies for homeless people. Yet this hybrid relationship does not seem to be addressed in social work issues. Despite the emergence of animal assisted care, it is not uncommon for the homeless animals to be excluded from those practices, and their presence to be marginalized, considered by social workers to fall outside their mandate. This paradoxical situation leads at the same time to the exclusion of people who, refusing separation from their animal mate, can not benefit from available resources: the homeless human-animal partners then become deviant among the deviants. Is it possible to give a legitimate place back to nonhuman animals in this context? Can they be both beneficial to social work, and at the same time benefit from it? Finally, in what way(s) can the human-animal relation (HAR) be considered in social work practices with homeless people? As part of this sociological study of deviance and HAR, we focus on the case of dogs in contemporary times, and more specifically their presence and participation in the community services welcoming homeless people in Montreal. After having identified the issues and the obstacles of taking HAR into account, we present and analyze two pilot initiatives illustrating the conditions and possible modalities of the hybridization of social work practices.

334	L'expérience et les perceptions des personnes adoptées à l’international à la suite d’un contact virtuel avec leur famille biologique	International adoptees’ search for their origins is not an easy journey. Their search can be filled with difficulties associated with the reality of international adoption. These difficulties can be eased by the use of new communication technology. Studies show that while these virtual tools can be helpful, they can also complicate the lives of adopted people and their families. The present study’s aim is to explore internationally adopted adults’ experience and perceptions of virtual contact with their birth families. Individual semi-directed interviews were carried out with eight adopted adults who experienced the studied reality. Two focus groups were also conducted with internationally adopted adults who had not lived a virtual contact with their birth families in order to explore their views on the subject. A thematic analysis of the material gathered through these two procedures was done. Results reveal that virtual contact with their birth families can be destabilizing on different levels for adopted people. This contact is part of the search for origins journey, which is part of the search for self-journey. The knowledge produced by this study will enable professionals who work with international adopted people who are experiencing search and reunion difficulties to better orient their support in order to offer services that better take into consideration the different aspects of a virtually-initiated contact with biological families.	international adoption , adult adoptees , search for origins , new communication technology , contact with the birth family	en	22762.0
335	Réduction du risque des invalidités liées à la consommation de l’alcool : l’effet à long terme de l’introduction de la loi zéro tolérance	From 1990 to 1998, all fifty-one US states implemented the Zero Tolerance Law in order to reduce both traffic accidents and youth drinking rates. By 1998, young American drivers aged between 16 and 21 are prohibited from driving if a minimal amount of alcohol exists in their blood, while the law concerning people aged over 22 remains unchanged. This paper examines the long-run effects of the law on one’s health. Using the difference-in-difference method, we find a reduction in ambulatory and visual or hearing disabilities at the age of 37 to 40 years. These results are robust to the inclusion of year of birth linear trend. Interestingly, we find that the effects are mainly concentrated on white men. There are virtually no effects for non-white men or even women of any race.	Youth Alcohol Policies	en	22746.0
336	The systematics and evolution of Cambrian graptolites from the Burgess Shale of Canada	Pterobranchs originated in the basal Cambrian (Fortunian) and are mostly known by their tubes preserved in the fossil record. The earliest forms represent bushy erect growing colonies that are not widely studied due to preservation quality and species misidentification. For this reason, basal phylogenetic relationships within the group are not clearly established. Middle Cambrian Burgess Shale graptolites were poorly known from the presence of Chaunograptus scandens, some debatable species of the genus Yuknessia, and other undetermined fragmented material. This study represents a complete description of C. scandens, a consensus for Yuknessia simplex and Y. stephenensis, and the new report of Protohalecium hallianum and Mastigograptus sp. from the locality, which have also been found in Burgess Shaletype localities in Utah and Australia. Phylogenetic analyses of 34 discrete morphological traits from these Burgess Shale genera and some known benthic and planktic taxa (n=22), place these Cambrian species as basal forms between the pseudocolonial pterobranch Cephalodiscus and the living graptolite Rhabdopleura.

337	Différenciation biotique de la flore des tourbières ombrotrophes du sud du Québec : une étude historique de 1982 à 2017	This thesis aims at determining whether ombrotrophic peatlands from the St. Lawrence lowlands, which are isolated in a highly disturbed environmental matrix, have suffered a loss of floristic diversity in the last three decades. In order to achieve this objective, a historic floristic study was conducted, by comparing old and recent inventories. More precisely, 76 plots inside 16 bogs were surveyed in 1982, and resurveyed in 2017 using the same methodology. For this study, only the vascular flora was analyzed. More specifically, I compared species richness as well as species abundance and frequency, while considering their shade tolerance and preferential habitat (wetland, facultative or upland). Finally, beta diversity changes were analyzed, and a beta diversity decomposition was performed in order to identify the principal component of the changes. My results show a significant increase in alpha diversity and beta diversity in the last 35 years, indicating a taxonomic differentiation and a floristic community change. The increase in alpha diversity was associated with a change in abundance and frequency of shade tolerant species and facultative wetland species. Moreover, species replacement was the main factor linked to the beta diversity increase. At last, I observed an increase in shrub and tree species cover over the past 35 years. Although the exact causes of the observed changes were not studied, our results suggest a regional drying of the peatlands likely linked to agricultural drainage in the area, and potentially enhanced by climatic changes. Our results let me suppose that these changes will continue with time, which could lead to future loss of biodiversity in these ecosystems due to the replacement of bog species by facultative species.	bog , Beta diversity , Biotic differentiation , Vascular flora , Species richness , Diversity	en	22744.0
338	Complémentarité fonctionnelle en phytoremédiation dans un sol à contamination mixte	Mixed contaminated soils with both organic and inorganic compounds represent about 40% of all contaminated sites. Phytoremediation is a promising green technology to decontaminate and restore mixed contaminated sites. The objective of the study was to evaluation the phytoremediation potential of a co-planting system between a shrub and an herbaceous species compared to the species in monocultures. A pot experiment with a woody specie, Salix interior, and one herbaceous species, Achillea millefolium, Trifolium pratense or Festuca arundinacea, and an unplanted control was conducted in a mixed CCA- and PCP-contaminated soil and non-contaminated soil for 120 days. Native and naturalized species with distinct functional traits were chosen for their possibly different and complementary phytoremediation abilities. Plant aboveground and belowground dry weights in all pots, trace element concentrations in plant tissues, and soil trace element and PCP concentrations in contaminated soil were recorded at the end of the cultivation period. Soil contamination and co-planting did not affect species biomass production, except in the S. interior + F. arundinacea treatment (SF) where roots yield was higher in the contaminated soil. The polyculture SF led to increased Cr and Cu total uptake in the roots of F. arundinacea. Furthermore, species in polycultures all had equal or superior trace element concentrations in their tissues compared to their monocultures. Death of S. interior in co-cropping with F. arundinacea was observed with no distinction of soil contamination and lead to mitigated conclusions. Treatments effects on PCP dissipation are inconclusive given the low soil concentrations found at the beginning and at the end of the experiment and because of the variability between the pots. We can therefore suggest that the co-planting of a shrub species and a species with different traits seems to lead to higher phytoremediation potential, but further investigation is required.	co-plantation , Phytoremediation , Functional complementarity , Co-planting , Mixed contamination	en	22743.0
339	La reconnaissance d’émotions faciales et musicales dans le processus de vieillissement normal	A growing number of studies report differences between older and younger adults in emotion recognition. However, there are still conflicting results regarding the extent of the changes and how they may vary depending on the expressed emotion and the medium used. The present study aims at supplementing our understanding of the global phenomenon by focusing on cognitively normal older adults’ capacity to recognize both facial and musical emotions. A group of 34 older adults, aged between 65 and 87, and a control group of 31 younger adults, aged between 18 and 50, completed two separate tasks evaluating emotion recognition of faces and music. The facial emotion categorization task includes faces expressing happiness, sadness, fear, anger and surprise. The musical emotion categorization task includes music excerpts expressing happiness, sadness and fear. Results indicate differences in emotion recognition between age groups. Indeed, older adults are less accurate than younger adults in the recognition of all five emotions as expressed by faces, but only of fear and sadness as expressed by musical excerpts. Both groups categorize happiness, as expressed by music, in a similar manner. Lastly, for both groups, fear is the less accurately recognized emotion, whether it is expressed by faces or music. In this regard, as normal aging involves many physiological and psychological changes that may be related to those observations, it has been proposed that the results may be partially explained by both the socioemotional and the neurological theories.

340	Détection de naines brunes et planètes géantes gazeuses à grande séparationutilisant des images d’archive	Decades of astronomical data collection provided by dedicated instruments have led to a large amount of images taken at different wavelengths, resolutions and depths of field that remain, for the most part, unexploited (eg 2MASS , WISE, SPITZER, SDSS). Developments of new data processing algorithms gives a new value to these images taken years earlier. This project aims at discovering new low-mass companions with large separations around young low-mass stars (M-type) using archive images. 2MASS J, H and Ks band images were used to identify the candidates. Seven candidates were identified using a combination of two algorithms that were applied on a judicious selection of 2 812 stars. The method combined a point spread function substraction algorithm based on a linear combination of reference stars and an algorithm inspired by differential imaging. Five of them had already been identified by other teams. One was probably an M9 star from the field and the other an L3—, potentially a member of the young association AB Doradus. This research confirms, like others before, the low occurence rate of planetary mass and brown dwarf companions at large separations (Á 100 AU) around young low mass stars. This conclusion led us to develop of an alternative detection method sensitive to companions on short orbits (< 40 AU). This second project, partially completed, aims to demonstrate that it is possible to detect objects with planetary masses orbiting young sun-like stars (G–F–A) regardless of their separation. This is possible thanks to the new generation of high dispersion infrared spectrographs. Spectral processing applied on synthetic observations has confirmed that one can detect objects with an object/star brightness ratio down to 10´5. Only 1h exposure time with an instrument like SPIROU is enough to detect companions with an atmosphere mainly composed of molecules. The spectral processing consists of cross-correlation and spectral subtraction algorithms inspired by methods used in differential imaging.

341	Sur la réappropriation hégélienne du scepticisme dans les oeuvres de Iéna (1801-1807) : le laboratoire de Hegel	This study is an attempt to reconstruct the conceptual genesis of the Hegelian conception of skepticism in his early Jena writings, between 1801 and 1807 when Hegel first started his academic career as a Privatdozent. In the Introduction of the Phenomenology of Spirit, Hegel puts forward a direct correlation between the phenomenological pathway and a certain kind of skepticism. However, the German thinker does not go any further in the description of this link between skepticism and his idealist philosophy, which at first glance does not seem to be self-obvious, especially considering the strong reputation of Hegel as a dogmatic thinker. To better understand the reasons that led Hegel to claim that his philosophy inherits, at least partially, from the skeptical tradition, we consider that the Hegelian use of skepticism must be recontextualized inside the theoretical debates of his first published texts where the term “skepticism” appears for the first time in his work. By examining the intellectual development of the young Hegel, we aim to show that the Hegelian appropriation of skepticism, even if it originates from polemical motivations, is the strongest expression of what the idealist thinker calls “the logic of understanding”. In that sense, skepticism is not only of crucial importance for the understanding of Hegel’s concept of “negativity”, but it also betrays on many regards the sprout of a genuine thought of anxiety or unrest (Unruhe).

342	Explications mécanistes et téléologiques de l'évolution de la forme	This dissertation of philosophy of biology deals with current evolutionary explanations in developmental evolutionary biology (Evo-Devo). We will seek to answer the following question: Can the evolutionary explanation be an exclusively mechanistic explanation or must it maintain teleological elements? In order to answer this question we will analyze current philosophical debates that attempt to solve the problem posed by the introduction of the study of development in the evolutionary explanation. We will adopt an epistemological approach. Then, we will expose the two sides of this problem, the mechanistic explanation and the teleological explanation. In the first chapter, we will identify the philosophical presuppositions of evolutionary biology and situate the current debate on the evolution of form in the continuity of philosophical debates raised by theories that have encountered similar obstacles like the theories of evolution of Ernst Haeckel and Kart Ernst von Baer. We will also briefly examine the debates between mechanistic conceptions and teleology in physiology in the 18th century and Kant's teleomechanist research program. The second chapter sets out the philosophical assumptions of the mechanistic explanation of the evolution of form as it is exposed by the contemporary biologist Sean B. Carroll. In the third chapter we will distinguish Platonic teleology and Aristotelian teleology, identify the peculiarity of organisms as an object of studies of biology and expose the teleological evolutionary explanation as it currently stands in the philosophy of biology.

343	Are predatory mites efficient dispersal agents of entomopathogenic fungi? : understanding the process of disease transmission from predators to prey for biological control	In biological control programs, predatory mites and entomopathogenic fungi are commonly used against western flower thrips, one of the most challenging pests in food and ornamental crops. Predatory mites can locate thrips even when thrips hide in plant crevices, but they only consume first instar larval thrips. Entomopathogenic fungi can infect all other stages, but their dispersal is passive and host encounter is therefore random. This thesis examines the potential role of predatory mites as dispersal agents of entomopathogenic fungi to thrips colonies. The experimental work has been divided into three sections. In the first section, we evaluated the pathogenicity of the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana strain ANT-03 to all stages of the western flower thrips and to three species of predatory mites: Amblyseius swirskii and Neoseiulus cucumeris that are active on plants and Stratiolaelaps scimitus that is active in soil. We established that B. bassiana ANT-03, predatory mites and thrips form appropriate pathogen-vector-host associations. We also developed a commercially applicable method for predatory mites to collect B. bassiana spores directly from the rearing substrates and transport them to the environment. We demonstrated that spores did accumulate on predatory mites over time in the substrates. In the second section, using video recordings, we described how predatory mites dislodged spores by linking the number of spores remaining on a mite to the time spent grooming and walking. We compared behaviors of the predatory mites with and without spores following their release from rearing substrates. Using low-temperature scanning electronic microscopy, we visualized the spore distribution on mites. We showed that walking primarily contributed to predatory mites dislodging spores in our experimental arena, whereas grooming was insufficient. When bearing conidia, all three species of predatory mites extended their walking periods. The duration of grooming behavior was not affected for A. swirskii and N. cucumeris, and was even reduced for S. scimitus. For the third section, we determined the capacity of predatory mites to deliver spores to thrips colonies. Amblyseius swirskii and N. cucumeris were loaded with spores and released on plants that had been previously infested with first instar thrips clustered on leaves. We carefully characterized the spatial distribution of each organism on plants, calculated the spatial co-occurrence index of spores and thrips, and estimated the proportion of thrips with spores. Both mites dispersed similar amounts of spores per plant, but A. swirskii delivered more spores to thrips infested leaves and thereby played a significant role in spreading the fungal disease to thrips populations. The observed differences between predatory mite species resulted from different foraging activity patterns. By understanding how the pathogens can be transferred from foraging predatory mites to prey, we provided a theoretical basis for identifying candidate predators as efficient fungal dispersal agents. These methods, if validated in commercially representative settings, could increase the capacity of predatory mites to suppress thrips populations by combining predation and dispersion of entomopathogens for biological control.	fungal dispersal , grooming behavior , spatial co-occurrence , tritrophic interactions , Beauveria bassiana , Amblyseius swirskii , Neoseiulus cucumeris , Stratiolaelaps scimitus	en	22696.0
344	Santé mentale des cadres : travail, identité et pratiques de gestion des ressources humaines	ABSTRACT  This thesis is interested in studying managers’ mental health in the workplace.  It attempts to establish the specific direct and indirect contribution of mangers’ identity verification in explaining mental health issues among managers in the workplace. In this case, the focus is on two dimensions of mental health: 1) symptomatic dimensions, which refer to psychological distress, depression and burnout. 2) behavioral dimensions that refer to alcohol consumption and psychotropic drugs consumption. This thesis was inspired by the limitations noted after a review of the literature. It tries to answer the call of certain authors, on the one hand to study the population of managers which seems to be little studied compared to the non-manager staff (Björklund et al., 2013; Byrne et al., 2014; Gadinger et al., 2010; Hentrich, Zimber, Sosnowsky-Waschek, Gregersen, et al., 2016; Mohr et Wolfram, 2010; Rodham et Bell, 2002; Salmela-Aro et al., 2011). And on the other hand, to integrate the theory of identity into research on mental health problems in the workplace (Arnett et al., 2003; Burke et Harrod, 2005; Haines III et Saba, 2012; Marcussen, 2006; Stets et Burke, 2005; Thoits, 1991, 2013), whereas it may lead to the discovery of new factors that may explain these problems (Haines III et Saba, 2012). We propose, in this thesis, an integrating theoretical framework that encompasses both the dominant theoretical models of occupational stress (Demerouti et al., 2001; Karasek et Theorell, 1990; Karasek, 1979; Siegrist, 1996) and the theory of identity borrowed from sociology. In this case, we have mobilized two approaches of this theory: the structural approach of identity (Stets, 2005, 2006; Stets et Serpe, 2013) and the theory of perceptual control of identity.     From this model emerge four major hypotheses. The first hypothesis postulates that the verification of manager’s identity contributes directly to the explanation of mental health problems among managers. The second argues that the effect of the verification of manager’s identity on mental health is mediated by self-esteem. The third posits that identity salience, hierarchical level, human resource management practices, and gender play a moderating role in the link between the verification of manager’s identity and managers’ mental health in the workplace. Finally, the fourth hypothesis assumes that identity salience, hierarchical level, human resource management practices and gender play a moderating role in the link between the verification of manager’s identity and self-esteem. These hypotheses were tested using cross-sectional data obtained from SALVEO study, conducted by the University of Montreal's research team on Work and Mental Health (ERTSM). Multilevel regression models and causality path analyzes were performed on a sample of 317 Canadian managers from this study (SALVEO). The results obtained, in this thesis, revealed that the verification of manager’s identity regarding recognition is significantly associated with psychological distress, depression and burnout. In addition, the verification of manager’s identity regarding decision control and supervisor’s support is significantly associated with alcohol consumption. Thus, the verification of manager’s identity regarding job demands and peer support is not significantly related to the dimensions of mental health. In addition, these results show that there is no direct effect of the verification of manager’s identity on the consumption of psychotropic drugs. In addition, this thesis reveals that the link between the verification of manager’s identity and psychological distress is completely mediated by self-esteem only at the level of decision control. The mediating effect of self-esteem is also complete in the link between the verification of manager’s identity and depression regarding decision control and the supervisor’s support. On the other hand, the mediating effect of self-esteem is partial in the link between the verification of manager’s identity regarding recognition and depression. Moreover, the results obtained in this thesis reveal that identity salience plays a moderating role in the link between the verification of manager’s identity regarding work demands; supervisor’s support; recognition and emotional exhaustion. Finally, the results of this thesis do not allow us to conclude that identity salience, hierarchical level, human resources management practices and gender do not play a moderating role in the verification of executive role identity and self-esteem. This thesis concludes on the benefits of these results for executives and organizations.

345	Déterminants dyadiques et évolution dans le temps de la douleur génito-pelvienne	Provoked vestibulodynia (PVD) is the most common form of genito-pelvic pain and is associated with negative psychosexual consequences for women and their partners. The objective of the thesis was to examine the role of perceived injustice, anxiety, and depression in the adjustment of couples coping with PVD. The first study examined the associations between perceived injustice and pain intensity, sexual satisfaction, sexual distress, and depression among 50 women with PVD and their partners via self-report questionnaires. Women’s higher level of perceived injustice was associated with their own greater sexual distress and depression. Partners’ higher level of perceived injustice was associated with their own greater sexual distress and depression and with their own lower sexual satisfaction. Perceived injustice was not associated with women’s pain intensity. Using a daily dyadic methodology over a period of two months, the second study focused on the associations between anxiety and depressive symptoms, and sexual function, sexual distress and pain among 127 couples coping with PVD. On days of sexual activity, when women reported feeling more anxious or depressed, they reported greater pain and lower sexual function. On days of sexual activity, when women reported feeling more depressed, they reported greater levels of sexual distress, and when partners reported feeling more anxious or depressed, women as well as partners reported greater levels of sexual distress. Using three separate measurement time points over a seven-year period, the third study aimed to identify pain trajectories and their predictors in women with PVD. Two pain trajectories were identified, one where pain persisted and one where pain decreased over time, both associated with different predictors. The clinical, theoretical and methodological implications of the thesis are discussed.

346	Identifier, mesurer et évaluer l’efficacité des techniques de rétroaction dans un contexte d’évaluation de potentiel	With the massive retirement of baby boomers, the Conference Board of Canada (2014) points to the urgent need for companies to ensure the proper selection and development of candidates to fill upcoming openings. To this end, companies are referring more and more candidates to specialized firms in potential assessment, as they have the mandate to evaluate and accelerate their development (Pease, 2010).  The meta-analysis by Morris, Daisley, Wheeler and Boyer (2015) also reveals that these potential assessments predict the subsequent success of the job candidate. This is why the feedback session that usually takes place after the potential assessment is so important; it allows the candidate and the consultant to meet to discuss the professional skills that the candidate can develop based on the results of this potential assessment (Moses, 2011). The objective of this thesis is to understand how consultants can foster candidates' interest in taking actions that allow them to develop professionally after feedback. More specifically, this thesis focuses on the feedback techniques used by consultants in a potential assessment context. The first objective is to identify for the first time all the feedback techniques used in a potential assessment context. The second and third objectives will be to develop a classification of these techniques and to measure it in order to verify that this classification captures what is happening in practice. Finally, the final objective will be to verify the effectiveness of these techniques, by assessing the extent to which they predict certain reactions in the candidate. The first article was written with the intention of meeting the three first objectives of the thesis. The project was therefore carried out in three phases.  First, a literature review on intervention techniques that promote change in a professional or therapeutic context was conducted. This made possible the identification of such techniques and a proposed classification. Then, potential assessment consultants reviewed the list of techniques identified to ensure that they covered their whole practice when providing feedback. Finally, a questionnaire was developed to measure the techniques used by the consultants during the feedback and to verify the proposed classification. An exploratory factor analysis revealed the existence of six categories of feedback techniques, slightly different from those initially anticipated. These techniques are: interventions aimed to explain the evaluation results, interventions focusing on positive emotions, interventions focusing on relationships, interventions focusing on gaps, interventions focusing on the development plan and interventions focusing on concrete examples. The article concludes by proposing a final definition of each category of feedback techniques and presenting the items of the measurement instrument. The second article attempts to address the fourth objective by examining the relationship between feedback techniques and the candidate's different reactions. To this end, the feedback appropriation model of Boudrias, Bernaud and Plunier (2014) was used, stating that the acceptance of the feedback message, the awareness gained and the intention to develop professionally are good predictors of the candidate's subsequent actions. The results of this study show that interventions designed to bring positive emotions to the candidate and those designed to identify future development avenues are the most promising techniques for the candidate to react well to the feedback. The thesis ends with a discussion of its contribution, its methodological limitations and their impacts, on future research avenues, and then opens a new perspective by addressing the literature on the transfer of learning.	potential assessment , feedback appropriation , skill development , change , feedback techniques	en	22685.0
347	Les adolescents auteurs d’agression sexuelle pris en charge par le système judiciaire québécois entre 2005 et 2010 : lien entre la délinquance et la victimisation	Several questions remain unanswered and debates persist with regard to adolescent sexual offenders (ASO). Their similarities to other juvenile offenders and the relevance of a victim’s age-based typology are among them. Furthermore, although it is recognized that many ASO were victims of maltreatment as children, the proportion has to be clarified. Current literature has methodological limitations such as insufficient sample size and lack of control groups. To overcome these constraints, this thesis evaluates 1,429 ASO who have committed one or more sexual offenses between 2005 and 2010. This cohort was extracted from research funded by the FRQSC entitled “The Implementation of the Youth Criminal Justice Act, Seven Years Later”. The data comes from the “Centre jeunesse” database.  The first study aims to describe the ASO’s official delinquency and childhood experience of maltreatment. Results show the heterogeneity of the ASO population and identify three main profiles of delinquency. The parameters of delinquency studied (intensity, variety, persistence, frequency) are distributed very asymmetrically. For example, 30,4% of ASO have committed only one offense (or more than one, but during the same event), while 10% have committed more than eleven. In addition, 81.6% of ASO were reported to the Direction of Youth Protection for a variety of reasons. Their profile of maltreatment during childhood is also heterogeneous.  The second study aims to compare the ASO to 1,429 adolescents who have committed non-sexual offenses using various forms of abuse. Results indicate ASO are distinct from other juvenile offenders, their history of maltreatment being more severe. Secondly, ASO were divided into two sub-groups: those who committed only sexual offenses (ASO-O) and those who also committed non-sexual offenses (ASO+). These groups were compared to non-sexual offenders on the basis of the same variables of maltreatment. ASO-O were similar to the comparison group, while ASO + differed with a more severe history of abuse than non-sexual offenders. This study also identified the history of sexual abuse as the most predictive factor for the inclusion of an adolescent to the ASO group.  The third study aims to develop a typology based on maltreatment variables for all ASO, ASO-O and ASO+, who have committed at least two sexual offenses (regardless of non-sexual offenses). In all cases, two classes were identified: ASO-maltreated and ASO-non-maltreated. In fact, the presence of maltreatment itself is more important than its nature, regardless of the group of ASO studied. The ASO-maltreated and ASO-non-maltreated have been compared on the different delinquency parameters. The ones who had antecedents of maltreatment before committing their first offense have a tendency to have an earlier, more varied, intense and persistent delinquency than the ASO-non-maltreated.  The overall results of the thesis bring additional information on the abused-abusive model and the degree of specialization of ASO.

348	Étude de l’évolution spectrale des étoiles naines blanches riches en hélium et le problème de l’origine de l’hydrogène dans les hybrides de type DBA	White dwarf stars represent the end point of stellar evolution for 97% of the stars in the Galaxy. The strong gravitational field present at the surface of these stars leads to an important chemical stratification. This gravitational settling process is responsible, namely, for the extreme purity of their outer layers, and leads to optical spectra generally dominated by a single species, most often hydrogen or helium. Nearly 40 years ago, however, the discovery of significant variations of the observed spectral types as a function of effective temperature revealed the existence of several physical mechanisms that could compete with gravitational settling along the cooling sequence.  The main goal of this thesis is to provide an explanation for the origin of helium-atmosphere white dwarfs below Teff = 30; 000 K. To this end, we study in detail the convective dilution process (for Teff > 15; 000 K) associated with the gradual erosion of a thin radiative hydrogen layer by the underlying helium convection zone. We also examine the convective mixing mechanism (for Teff < 12; 000 K) described by the complete homogenization of the outer layers arising when the superficial hydrogen convection zone reaches the deeper convective helium envelope. Particular attention is given to the problem of the origin of hydrogen detected in some helium-atmosphere white dwarfs.  We first present an analysis of 115 DB (helium-line) white dwarfs and 28 cool, helium-rich DA (hydrogen-line) stars. The atmospheric parameters of each star — effective temperature, surface gravity, and chemical composition—are obtained using the so-called spectroscopic and photometric techniques. Our spectroscopic observations reveal the presence of hydrogen in 63% of our DB sample, thus revealing their DBA hybrid nature. We also confirm the persistence of white dwarfs without any detectable traces of hydrogen at low effective temperature.  Using detailed stellar envelope models, we show that the photospheric hydrogen abundances predicted by the convective dilution scenario are much smaller than those measured in DBA white dwarfs. We also demonstrate that the amount of hydrogen observed in DBA stars, as well as in cool, helium-rich DA white dwarfs, cannot be explained by accretion from external sources, since accretion will build a hydrogen layer that is sufficiently thick to resist the erosion caused by convection. Instead, we show that cool, helium-rich DA white dwarfs most likely represent the end product of the convective mixing of DA white dwarfs with sufficiently thin hydrogen layers.  In order to solve the problem of hydrogen in DBA white dwarfs, we invoke the possibility that significant amounts of hydrogen can be hidden within the deep stellar interior. On the basis of this hypothesis, deduced from realistic models, we construct a physical mechanism where some of this hydrogen located deep in the star is being dredged-up to the surface by the growing convective envelope. The resulting simulations reproduce the H/He abundance ratio observed in the majority of DBA white dwarfs. This convective dredge-up scenario provides for the first time a satisfactory explanation for the origin of hydrogen in these objects, thus potentially solving a long-standing problem in white dwarf spectral evolution.

349	Searching for dark matter with superheated liquid detectors	One of the most prominent questions in the fields of particle physics and cosmology is the nature of dark matter which comprises 85% of the total mass of the universe. The PICASSO and PICO experiments are both direct detection experiments situated at SNOLAB that use the superheated liquid or bubble chamber technique to search for dark matter. The PICASSO collaboration pioneered the use of this technique for dark matter searches, and moreover, discovered an important background suppression feature: the acoustic alpha-neutron discrimination. The last PICASSO result was published in 2017 and still holds to this day the best spin-dependent cross-section limit of 7 x 10-2 pb (90% C.L.) for weakly interacting dark matter candidates (WIMPs) with a mass of 4 GeV/c2 [1]. Since the merger of PICASSO and COUPP into PICO, PICO holds the world best limit on WIMP cross sections with the most stringent spin-dependent limit of 2.5 x 10-5 pb (90% C.L) at 25 GeV/c2 set by the recent PICO60 detector result [2]. The PICO collaboration is currently building a new detector called PICO40L with a significantly improved design which will allow to substantially decrease the neutron background by a factor of  50, and pave the way forward for the next stage, PICO500, which will contain approximately 500L of superheated liquid. The present work presents first the observational and theoretical framework of dark matter searches, i.e., its proof of existence (Chap. 2), the most probable particle candidates (Chap. 3), as well as its expected recoil spectra and count rates in typical dark matter detectors (Chap. 4). It will be followed by a description of the superheated liquid technique (Chap. 5), by the description of the PICASSO and PICO detectors (Chap. 6 & 7), of their calibrations and common backgrounds (Chap. 8). In Chap. 9 & 10, the final PICASSO result are presented together with the most recent PICO dark matter limits. A GEANT4 simulation of the PICO40L neutron background will then be described in detail (Chap. 11), along with a discussion of the physic reach of PICO within the context of the effective field theory description of dark matter (Chap. 12). Finally, this thesis concludes with the current and future research and development program of the PICO collaboration, such as the future PICO500 detector, and the exciting possibility of using C2H2F4 as an active target (Chap. 13).

350	Étude Monte Carlo de l’impact de la tomodensitométrie multiénergie sur la précision du calcul de dose en protonthérapie	Proton therapy is a cancer treatment modality that has the potential to target tumours more accurately than conventional radiotherapy. However, current clinical practice intro- duces an uncertainty on proton beam ranges that impairs the benefits of proton therapy over traditional methods. Indeed, the lack of accuracy on the prediction of protons’ path inside patients forces the application of safety margins around target volumes, and this at the cost of a larger volume of healthy tissues being irradiated. The purpose of this work is to study the potential of multi-energy computed tomography (MECT) to reduce proton beam range uncertainties. First, a novel method to characterize human tissues with MECT is developed. The method, called eigentissue decomposition (ETD) aims to extract the el- emental composition and density of human tissues in order to accurately calculate proton beams transport with Monte Carlo simulations. The ETD method is further adapted to the context of noise in CT images using a Bayesian estimator. Then, a clustering approach based on the k-means algorithm is developed in order to allow the implementation of the ETD method in a Monte Carlo algorithm. Finally, these methods are used to evaluate the impact of MECT on proton range uncertainties in a ground truth humanoid geometry. Dose distributions are compared to quantify the performance of MECT over conventional meth- ods. Results indicate that MECT used with the ETD method allows to reduce proton range uncertainties from 1.51% to 0.86%. The study suggests that MECT has the potential to improve the accuracy of proton therapy and therefore its benefits over conventional radio- therapy. Indeed, improved accuracy in dose calculation is associated with an increase in treatments’ success rate, a decrease in secondary effects as well as a diminution of cancer recurrence.

351	Analyse visuelle et cérébrale de l’état cognitif d’un apprenant	A cognitive state can be defined as a set of inferior (e.g. perception and attention) and superior (e.g. perception and attention) cognitive processes, requiring the human being to have all of his  mental abilities in an effort to use existing knowledge to solve a given problem or to establish new knowledge. In this context, a particular attention is paid by computer-based learning environments to monitor and assess learner’s emotional reactions during a learning activity. In fact, emotions govern the learner’s mental state that has in turn a direct impact on his cognitive abilities such as reasoning, decision-making, memory, etc. In this context, the objective is to improve the cognitive abilities of the learner by identifying and redressing the mental states that are unfavorable to learning in order to optimize the learners’ performances. In this thesis, we aim in particular to examine the reasoning as a high-level cognitive process. Our goal is two-fold: first, we seek to evaluate the reasoning process of novice medical students through their visual behavior and second, we seek to analyze learners’ mental states when reasoning to detect visual and cerebral indicators that can improve learning outcomes. More specifically, our first objective was to use the learner’s eye movements to assess his reasoning process while interacting with educational serious games. For this purpose, we have analyzed two types of ocular metrics namely, static metrics and dynamic metrics. First of all, we have studied the feasibility of using static metrics to automatically identify two groups of learners through the training of machine learning algorithms. Then, we have assessed the logical visual sequence followed by the learner when reasoning using dynamic metrics and a sequence alignment method from bio-informatics to see if he/she performed the correct reasoning process or not.  Our second objective was to analyze the evolution of the learner’s engagement mental state from his brain activity and to assess the relationship between engagement and learning performance. An experimental study was conducted where we analyzed the distribution of the learner engagement index through first, the different phases of the problem-solving task and second, through the different regions of the environment interface. The cerebral activity of each participant was recorded during the whole game interaction. Then, from the obtained signals, an engagement index was computed based on the three frequency bands α, β et θ. Finally, our third objective was to propose a multimodal approach based on two physiological sensors to provide a joint analysis of the learner’s visual and cerebral behaviors. To this end, we recorded eye movements and brain activity of the learner to assess his reasoning process during the resolution of different cognitive tasks. More precisely, we aimed to identify key indicators of reasoning performance in order to use them to improve the cognitive abilities of novice learners in particular, and the learning experience in general.

352	Un rendez-vous manqué. Journaux illustrés et films comiques dans la France d'avant 1915	"The links between the cinema and the illustrated press were perceived very early by the observers. Now, if historians seem to agree on an ""influence"" of the illustrated press on the comic production of French cinema, humorous newspapers are not very interested in cinema in general and completely, or almost completely, ignore comic films. How to explain this phenomenon ? This thesis proposes to develop three lines of thought. First, we try to understand the way in which the illustrated press saw the emergence and growth of the film show at the turn of the 19th century until the mid-1910s. For most chroniclers the cinema appears as an intruder among the Parisian stage shows, deporting in a way the rivalry between theater and cinema in the illustrated press. Then, by looking at the proximity between films and newspapers, it appears that cinema borrows from newspapers as much as it recycles their comic stories, modernizes them. This leads us finally to consider the two media from the angle of their differences, both ideological and political, preventing a meeting that seemed at first sight inevitable."	burlesque , caricature , Illustrated press , Comic films , Intermediality , Pre-cinema	en	22655.0
353	Photographie d'art et culture visuelle contemporaines : vers des pratiques photographiques technologiques	This thesis explores the moving, mobile and fluid nature of contemporary photography by clarifying current uses and values of photographic practices in artistic and socio-cultural circles. We posit the interpenetration of artistic and amateur photography in a contemporary regime by way of the concept of technology (tekhnè) as deployed in the writings of German philosopher Martin Heidegger. This analysis builds on works by modern (Yves Klein, Shunk/Kender) and contemporary artists (Taryn Simon, Penelope Umbrico, Li Wei, Wendy McMurdo), as well as different types of professional and non-professional practices (photojournalism, official documentation, images taken on blogs or social media). A comparative study of these images will allow us to reflect on recent photography in continuity with imaging practices of the 19th and 20th centuries, defining an atopic relationship to space and a metamodern relationship to time.	art contemporain , photography studies , contemporary art , visual culture , digital culture , philosophy of technology , atopia , metamodernism	en	22654.0
354	Le personnage vu de dos au cinéma et dans les autres arts : esthétique, migrations et imaginaires d’une histoire à revers	"This thesis is part of the movement of studies that have developed in recent years in different disciplines (visual studies, art history, film studies, and aesthetics) around the phenomena of image migration. The research topic addressed in this paper is a visual motif circulating widely among the arts: the figure seen from behind. The occurrences of the figure seen from behind being innumerable and extraordinarily varied in cinema, the thesis aims to develop three expressive arrangements carried out by the figure seen from behind and repeated alternately in cinema and in other arts.  The bias does not consist of a careful study of the symbolic games or topos that the figures from behind would carry. Through notions that I have been led to further or develop throughout my research – appearance, inevidence, dorsality, it is a question of examining how this posture depicts a way of inhabiting the image and its world. In making important detours through the history of art, I sought to survey the intermedial imagery underlying the modes of appearance of the figure seen from behind, to account for its implications in artistic practices as well as in the philosophical and social field.  In order to carry out this intermedial survey on the migration of my object, I was inspired greatly by a gesture of Aby Warburg, the creation of atlases of images. By collecting images of figures from behind who constantly echo each other or contrast one another, atlas making allowed me to reveal three expressive modalities of the back running through the history of art and cinema, and which are also found, on a smaller scale, within my boards. I address these questions in the first chapter of the thesis.   The second chapter, titled ""Repli (s)"", focuses on my first picture board, devoted to figures from behind who avoid and sneak away, conveying a withdrawal of expressive meaning.  The third chapter addresses my second picture board, in which I sought to depict a form of absorption led by the figure from behind. Absorption refers here to a relationship to the world that weaves itself between the dorsal silhouette and the wild landscape, which has been migrating into artistic representations since the Romantic Age. The fourth and last chapter, entitled ""Exclusion (s)"", will examine a mode of appearance relating to an act of violence committed upon the subject. By focusing specifically on the portrayal of African-Americans in American plantation films and by making important connections in art history, I try to show how a form of aesthetic, social, and political exclusion has been created by the representation from behind.  What are withdrawn, absorbed or excluded characters telling us in view of the frontality of the representations that still prevail today? The figures seen from behind, as presented in my thesis, are introducing another era: that of a reverse tale, of a dorsality of representations and of existence."	motif , atlas , back , figure , motive , cinema , the history of art , intermediality , inevidence , dorsality , appearance	en	22653.0
355	Entre aspiration documentaire et nécessité littéraire : la mise en récit de l’expérience des camps dans des témoignages français et italiens de l’immédiat après-guerre (1945-1947)	Upon their return, Nazi camp survivors who resolved to put the testimony of their experience into writing were faced with the incommensurable difficulty of the task – what is also referred to as the “unspeakable,” not in its narrower sense associated with the “impossibility of saying,” but rather in its meaning related to the double barrier existing between writer and language, as well as between the witness and the capacity of his interlocutor to understand. This thesis looks at testimonies – canonical as well as lesser known – published in French and in Italian during the immediate post-war years (1945-1947). It explores the linguistic and literary devices used by author-survivors in their attempt to convey their experience to their reader, despite its unspeakability. Suspended in a precarious balance between History and literature, witnesses give greater emphasis to the veracity of their words than to the literary nature of their account; in fact, author-survivors generally tend, in their foreword, to immediately dissociate themselves from literature, as it is often associated with fiction. The extreme experience of the Nazi camps, and subsequently the process of putting it into writing, necessarily forces survivors to rethink their relationship with language: accordingly, testimonies contain many “non-coincidences” in their words that show how aware the authors are of the “non-transparency” of language, as well as metalinguistic considerations that reflect their will to remake the meaning of words and to convey something of their real-life experience in spite of the inadequacies of language. In fact, author-survivors have to translate the world of the camps for their reader, a world where the language was a mixture of jargon, slang and sabir: the Lagerszpracha. Highly dialogic, testimonies reuse certain Lagerszpracha mechanisms – to show violence – and reverse them through discursive techniques that Bakhtin calls hybridization. In order to accurately convey their experience, the author-survivors must resort to their reader’s imagination by using literary techniques such as intertextuality and intermediality, even though most of them have prefaced their testimony with a denial of literary intent. Resorting to works of fiction enables them to evoke a universe that would otherwise be inconceivable to any “civilized” mind – though such parallels might result in the reader misunderstanding the reality of the camps. By including photographs and referring to theater, the authors draw on other media in their written testimonies, deeming that a single medium cannot suffice to express the concentration camp experience. This thesis reflects on the ethical and literary choices made by the author-survivors who, despite their desire to write an “accurate documentary” in a neutral and straightforward style, are confronted with the insufficient nature of language and must resort to literary techniques to impart to their reader an otherwise unimaginable reality.

356	Subversion et répétition : représentation de la mère dans la littérature chinoise féminine du 20e siècle	The mother’s representation has undergone a literary development and a profound transformation in 20th century Chinese history and thought. The literature of the May 4 Movement is characterized by the ideal of great nationalist salvation and revolutionary discourse. From her participation in the Chinese Communist Party, the writer Ding Ling sought to associate feminist writing with the socialist struggle. Sisterhood has marked her representation of the mother: the mother becomes a comrade with whom one advances neck and neck. By idealizing the mother-daughter relationship, the writer, having continued the May 4 patricide, projects an embellished future: the hierarchical society is fundamentally transformed into a world of perfect equality.  Xiao Hong considers motherhood not as a natural “gift” but as a severe punishment that over-exploits the female body. Animalized, the mother is reduced to an object of sacrifice normalized by a patriarchal society. In her latest novels, the author adopts a transcendental approach that no longer opposes the feminine to the masculine, the animal to the human, the inanimate to the animate. By describing “male” motherhood, she expresses a compassionate affinity of all colonized people, without distinction, to transgress social normativity.  Modernist writers, for their part, free themselves from the political framework in their representation of the mother. Zhang Ailing’s family story focuses on personal and everyday details and reveals an involuntary but fatalistic reproduction of motherhood between generations. Her coolness, which contrasts with the strong fury or ardor of the May 4 writers, is deepened in the avant-garde literature.  However, the latter is more subversive in representing the mother. In support of an absurd writing on tokophobia and infanticide, Jiang Zidan describes a maternal rage that deconstructs some cruel and obscure truth about the failure of the nuclear family in solidarity, heterosexual marriage and conventions that reinforce phallocentrism.  Neo-realism pushes women writers to return to a traditional description of the mother and her role by accentuating its banality. Without embellishing or sanctifying, Chi Li remains faithful to the neo-realistic principle and describes the ambivalence of the ordinary mother in her fictional works. In her prose, she shows her confusion about the insurmountable gap between mother and child.  The intergenerational gap remains problematic in the literature of the Chinese diaspora. Hong Ying and her writing on the possibility of repairing the relationship with the mother reflects a deeper nostalgia for her country and at the same time, a strong desire to overcome her perpetual orphan complex.

357	Déterminants des migrations de l’Afrique vers l’Europe : du court séjour à la migration durable et / ou irrégulière	"International migration is often seen as a single, one-way movement from a country of origin to a host country. In contrast to this unidirectional view of migration, this thesis focuses on the articulation between temporary and long-term migration in the context of migration between Africa and Europe. More specifically, it focuses on the individual and contextual factors that explain why movements supposedly limited in time (called temporary) are transformed into long stays. In this research, temporary travel is approached from two perspectives: duration and law. In one case [1st empirical article], the aim is to study to what extent and for what reasons occasional stays (lasting less than one year) become the precursors of a sustainable settlement in Europe (for a period of at least one year). In the other case [2nd and 3rd empirical articles], the aim is to study how and why stays designed as temporary from a legal point of view (cases where migrants have a non-permanent right of residence) are transformed into irregular long-term stays. The thesis adopts a comparative approach that focuses on contextual effects in both three African countries of origin (Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana and Senegal) and six European countries of destination (Belgium, United Kingdom, Netherlands, France, Italy and Spain), with a particular focus on migration policy changes. It draws on three international databases: on the one hand, the individual biographical data of the MAFE project (Migrations between Africa and Europe) and, on the other hand, two contextual databases containing a coded description of migration policy changes of the ""Immigration Policy"" and ""Temporary vs permanent migration"" projects, and the ""Determinants of International Migration: A Theoretical and Empirical Assessment of Policy, Origin and Destination Effects"" (DEMIG) project. The statistical methods used are, on the one hand, descriptive statistics, in particular Kaplan-Meier curves and bivariate analysis methods and, on the other hand, explanatory models, in particular discrete time risk and duration models and the logit model. In the first article, it appears that short-term stay has a positive effect on long-term migration for the three sub-Saharan flows considered, although this effect is much greater for Congolese than for Ghanaians and Senegalese. The effect of short stay migration also depends on the period for Congolese migrants, while this interaction is not significant for Senegalese migrants and Ghanaian migrants, which indicates not only the context of the country of origin modulates the effect of the short stay on sustainable migration, but also the variation of the context over time within the same country of origin can modify the relationship between short stay and long term migration. In addition, it is noted that the level of education, land and house ownership, unemployment in the country of origin, social networks and studies in Europe seem to favour the relationship between short and long stays, but economic activity and employment in the countries of origin seem to have the opposite effect. The second article revealed that the risk of being in an irregular situation was increased in periods when migration policies were becoming increasingly strict. The influence of the entry period is very clear for Ghanaian and Senegalese migrants, but the risk of being in an irregular situation decreased in the 1990s and 2000s among Congolese migrants, suggesting that migrants from a country in conflict benefit from some protection against irregularity. The risk of being in an irregular situation is higher in recent immigration countries (Italy and Spain) than in traditional immigration countries (France and the United Kingdom). The irregularity also depends on the individual characteristics and circumstances of departure for Europe. The third article unexpectedly revealed that only policies aimed at limiting entry appear to have a significant effect on the transition to irregularity of Senegalese migrants already legally entering France, Italy and Spain. This result suggests that when policies to control entry become more stringent, migrants no longer dare to leave for fear of not being able to return. Other contextual elements also influence the irregularity of migrants: a negative effect of Senegal's annual GDP growth on the transition to irregularity (immigrants would choose to return to the country to work, thus avoiding irregularity), but a positive effect of the host country's annual GDP growth on the transition to irregularity (they would remain there to benefit from growth despite irregularity)."	transition , short stay , temporary movement , sustainable migration , long stay , irregularity , migration policies , irregular migration , irregular stay	en	22633.0
358	Education as a moderator of the relationship between episodic memory and amyloid load in normal aging	The current study explored whether education, a proxy of cognitive reserve, modifies the association between episodic memory (EM) performance and βeta-amyloid load (Aβ), a biomarker of Alzheimer’s disease, in a cohort of cognitively normal older adults. One hundred and four participants (mean age 73.3 years) evenly spread out in three bands of education were recruited. Participants underwent neuropsychological assessment, structural MRI as well as PET imaging to quantify Aβ load. Moderation analyses and the Johnson–Neyman technique were carried out to examine the interaction of education with Aβ load to predict EM performance. Linear regressions were then performed within each group of education to better illustrate the interaction effect (all analyses were controlled for age and sex). The interaction between education and Aβ load was significant (p < .05) for years of education, reaching a cutoff point of 13.5 years, above which the relationship between Aβ load and EM was no longer significant. Similarly, significant associations were found between Aβ and EM among participants with secondary (p < .01) and preuniversity education (p < .01), but not with a university degree (p = .253). EM performance is associated with Aβ load in cognitively normal older individuals, and this relationship is moderated by educational attainment.

359	Étude de la composition de la bile chez le chat en santé et le chat atteint de cholangite	Hepatobiliary disease is common in cats and neutrophilic cholangitis is the most common type. There are 3 types of cholangitis but only neutrophilic cholangitis requires antibiotic treatment. However, antibiotics are sometimes incorrectly prescribed in patients, especially while pending results of a culture of bile or liver tissue, which is problematic in the context of current antimicrobial resistance.  Little is known about bile composition in healthy or diseased cats.   The aims of this study were to evaluate several analytes from the bile of healthy cats and to investigate the usefulness of measuring these variables to predict bacterial cholangitis.   Cats were prospectively enrolled and divided into 3 groups: 21 healthy cats (group 1); and 14 cats with suspected hepatobiliary disease: 9 without bacterial biliary infection (group 2) and 5 with bacterial biliary infection (group 3). Percutaneous ultrasound-guided cholecystocentesis was performed in each cat. Bile cytology and culture, as well as analysis of bile including pH, lactate, and glucose levels using several point-of-care devices, were performed.   Reference values for several bile analytes in healthy cats were calculated and are presented in this study. The pH was not significantly different between the 3 groups (p=0.88) nor was the lactate concentration (p=0.85). Sodium concentration was significantly higher in group 3 compared to group 2 (p<0.05). Bile pH, lactate, and glucose levels did not predict the presence of a bacterial infection in the bile.

360	Détection et validation de marqueurs épigénétiques d’atteinte nociceptive dans l’arthrose sur modèle expérimental murin	Osteoarthritis (OA) is considered the most common cause of chronic joint pain in humans, but also in companion animal patients. Nociceptive sensitization has been extensively associated with the disease. However, the pathological mechanisms leading to the development of this degenerative joint disease remain only partially understood. In the past few years, surgical induction of OA in rats allowed us to characterize some modifications in functional pain behaviors and to quantify neurophysiological changes. Hence, it has now been suggested that epigenetic mechanisms could also take part in OA physiopathology. The goal of this project was to validate a panel of different pain evaluation methods in a surgically-induced OA rat model with the objective of a better understanding of OA pain. To achieve this, previously validated structural and functional pain assessments were conducted, as well as neuropeptidomic analysis. To test the contribution of epigenetic modification in OA, differential expression of spinal miRNAs was validated by RT-qPCR. The surgical intervention led to the progression of significant structural damages. Moreover, this model confirmed the central nociceptive sensitization development in the OA rats. Indeed, changes in functional behaviors and in neuropeptidomic expression were identified. These findings were interestingly accompanied by an enhanced expression of miR-181b, a micro-RNA previously linked to endogenous control of pain. Multiple pain determinants were taken into account in this surgically-induced OA model; therefore, this study contributed to the advancement of knowledge in chronic pain translational research. This project highlights the relevance of neuro-epigenetics in OA pain studies.

361	Modulation de l’action antimicrobienne in vitro d’extraits de plantes en condition de compétition par un dérivé de microbiote d’origine fécale porcine	The incorporation of non-antibiotic antimicrobials compounds to animal feed is extensively used to control the prevalence of pathogens and enhance general gut health. Few plant extracts (PEs) and essential oils (EOs) have a strong antimicrobial effect in vitro which does not concur with the results obtained when the experiment is translated in vivo. This study evaluated the antimicrobial potential of several compounds by agar diffusion assay, tube dilution and by a novel tube dilution method incorporating a pig intestinal microbiota derivative. Results of this study showed that carvacrol, cinnamaldehyde, eugenol and white camphor oil have the same efficiency in the absence or presence of a complex microbiota, thus making these compounds the most relevant for the development of food additives. Metagenomics analyzes were performed to measure the (qualitative) evolution of the microbiota considered under these conditions. Eos concentrations that are higher than the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) had a significant impact on both alpha diversity (increase in richness and Eveness) and beta diversity. Furthermore, every EOs, used at high concentration, had a significantly different impact on the microbial structure and composition. Also, qPCR analyses were used to quantify indicators of the intestinal microbiota in the presence of increasing concentrations of EOs; a (significant) decrease of Escherichia coli, stability of Lactobacilli for almost all of the concentrations and a (significant) increase of Lachnospiraceae were observed. Therefore, this study led us to develop an in vitro model which can be used to analyze the efficacy of different organic compounds in the presence of an intestinal microbiota derivative. This suggests that some EOs could have a significantly different impact on the gut microbiota when used at a specific concentration. This feature could be exploited to develop effective food additives with targeted effects.

362	Mise au point d’une technique de sinusoscopie peu invasive chez le cheval	Paranasal sinus disease is the most common cause of unilateral nasal discharge in horses. However, achieving a definitive diagnosis using radiology and endoscopy is difficult due to the complex anatomy of the sinuses, and the use of computed tomography (gold standard) is often limited due to its cost and low availability. Consequently, sinoscopy is often the available diagnostic technique with the highest diagnostic rate (70%) but it remains invasive (10 to 15 mm trepanation) and unpractical in some cases. Our hypothesis is that the development of a minimally invasive sinoscopic technique (MIST), performed through a mini-trepanation with a 14G needle (2 mm trephination) and combined with the use of a novel flexible 2mm diameter endoscope, can allow an exhaustive evaluation of the paranasal sinuses.   During the first two cadaveric phases of the project, we determined the exact anatomic landmarks to perform the mini-trepanation in the different sinuses, and the visualization of the different sinus compartments was assessed by attributing a score to each sinusal structure. In the last phase of the study, the MIST was performed on standing sedated horses to determine the feasibility and possible complications associated to the technique.  The landmarks determined in the first phase allowed a thorough evaluation of the sinuses in the following phases. The horses tolerated well the procedure and no serious complications were reported. The technique developed during this study is easy to perform and could facilitate the diagnosis of paranasal sinus diseases for all veterinarians specialized or not.	sinus , horse , equine , sinoscopy , Minimally invasive surgery	en	22609.0
363	Caractérisation des fonctions immunomodulatrices de la Cardiotrophin-Like Cytokine	Cardiotrophin-Like Cytokine (CLCF1) is a cytokine of the IL-6 family recognized primarily for its neurotrophic functions mediated by CNTF receptor activation (CNTFR). In contrast to its counterpart CNTF, CLCF1 is efficiently secreted as a composite cytokine with the soluble receptor CRLF1. Mutations in the genes encoding for CLCF1 or its secretion partner CRLF1 lead to the development of CISS and Crisponi syndromes, two severe conditions associated with complex overlapping phenotypes. Studying patients’ phenotypes led us to hypothesize important, non-redundant CLCF1 functions in the development and regulation of the immune system.  To characterize the immunomodulatory properties of this cytokine, we first studied the roles of CLCF1 in hematopoiesis. We observed that CLCF1 stimulates the proliferation of multipotent hematopoietic cells and induces their expansion in absence of other growth factors. In vivo, administration of the cytokine accelerated myeloid cell reconstitution in a model of congenic bone marrow transplantation. These results therefore suggest yet-unidentified roles for CLCF1 in myelopoiesis regulation. In a subsequent study, we assessed the ability of CLCF1 to modulate myeloid cell activation. Assessing the impact of CLCF1 on macrophages functions and differentiation, we determined that CLCF1 1) activates JAK/STAT signaling pathways in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM), 2) induces the upregulation of scavenger receptor SR-A1 expression and 3) promotes the formation of pro-atherogenic foam cells. Altogether, these results indicate that CLCF1 may constitute a novel and attractive therapeutic target to be investigated in preclinical models of atherosclerosis. While CLCF1 has previously been recognized as a B-cell stimulating factor, the results presented in the first two articles of this thesis indicate biological functions for CLCF1 in the formation and regulation of myeloid cells.  In parallel, we defined new biochemical interactions between CLCF1 and plasma lipoproteins. In particular, we have demonstrated the existence of complexes between CLCF1, apolipoprotein E, low- and very low-density lipoproteins. Furthermore, we observed that CLCF1 biological activities are modulated by very low-density lipoproteins. These results provide evidence of direct interactions between lipoproteins and cytokines and suggest that certain metabolic components modulate the immune functions of type I cytokines.  In conclusion, the results summarized in this thesis have improved our understanding of CLCF1 immunomodulatory properties and of its potential therapeutic applications.

364	The role of ThPOK and T cell receptor signaling in CD4+ versus CD8+ T-cell lineage fate	T lymphocytes are at the core of the adaptive immune system and their dysfunction is associated with several disorders and pathologies, which are at times fatal. The two main types of T-cells in mice and man are: the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class-II-restricted CD4+ helper T-cells, and the MHC-I-restricted CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells. Developmental stages of the two types of T-cells occurs in the thymus in multiple sequential maturation stages that are identified by cell-surface CD4+/CD8+ co-receptor expression. Differentiation of the two types of T-cells in the thymus from a common precursor is influenced by the intensity and duration of signals derived from the T-cell receptor (TCR) and cytokines secreted by the thymic stromal cells. These signals lead to the activation of ThPOK or Runx/CBF transcription factors, which control the transcriptional network regulating CD4+ and CD8+ lineage fate, respectively. Studies have demonstrated that ThPOK is both necessary and sufficient for CD4+ T-cell development as gain- and loss-of-ThPOK function redirects positively selected MHC-I- and MHC-II-restricted thymocytes into CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell lineage fate, respectively. However, the role of TCR signaling and the extent to which ThPOK expression influences CD4+ lineage choice remains to be investigated. My thesis aims to elucidate the fundamental basis the CD4+/CD8+ lineage choice by exploring the molecular mechanism of action of ThPOK and TCR signaling in CD4+ lineage fate of MHC-I- and MHC-II-specific thymocytes. In this study, we have characterized gain-of-function of ThPOK in three independent transgenic mouse lines expressing varying amounts of ThPOK. Extensive analysis of the three ThPOK transgenic lines expressing MHC-I- and MHC-II-specific monoclonal TCR indicated that MHC-I-restricted, compared to MHC-II-restricted, thymocytes required significantly more ThPOK for efficient differentiation into the CD4+ lineage. Interestingly, the founder line with the lowest transgene expression, despite expressing significantly higher amounts of ThPOK compared to the endogenous levels in WT CD4+ T cells, induced a partial CD8+ to CD4+ redirection of MHC-I-restricted cells, leading to the generation of mature CD4+, DN and CD8+ T-cells in the same mouse. Lineage specific gene expression analysis, specifically in DN mature T cells from ThPOK transgenic mice expressing MHC-I-specific TCR, showed that, compared to induction of helper program, suppression of cytotoxic program required lower amount of ThPOK. Further investigation showed that TCR signal strength and MHC specificity of 4 developing thymocytes played a critical role in determining ThPOK-induced CD4+ lineage fate. While increase in TCR signal strength augmented the efficiency of ThPOK-induced CD4+ lineage choice of MHC-I-restricted thymocytes in part via endogenous ThPOK induction, it appeared to have ThPOK independent function as well as judged by significantly different CD4+ T-cell frequencies in OTI mice expressing the same amount of ThPOK but transduced quantitatively different TCR signal. Importantly, the efficiency of CD4+ lineage choice of MHC-I-specific thymocytes with augmented TCR signal strength was still significantly lower compared to the efficiency of CD4+ lineage choice of MHC-II-restricted thymocytes expressing only the transgene-encoded ThPOK suggesting a qualitative role for TCR signaling as well in CD4+ lineage choice. We then evaluated CD4+ lineage fate decision in the absence of ThPOK induction in physiologically relevant alteration in TCR signaling versus loss of ThPOK function. While we observed CD4+ to CD8+ lineage redirection of MHC-II-specific thymocytes due to Thpok-deficiency as well as lack of ThPOK induction due to disruption of TCR signaling, the two modes of lineage redirection appeared to be due to different mechanisms. Our investigation demonstrates that TCR signaling in MHC-II-restricted thymocytes induces the expression of select genes in loss-of-function of ThPOK model suggesting potential role for these genes in establishing the CD4+ helper program. These results also suggest that the contribution of MHC-II-specific TCR signaling in driving CD4+ lineage choice is not limited to Thpok induction. Interestingly, only a limited synergistic effect was observed when both Gata3, which is also induced in MHC-II-signaled thymocytes, and ThPOK were overexpressed in MHC-I-restricted thymocytes suggesting a limited functional overlap between the two transcription factors. Collectively, these data indicate that ThPOK and TCR signaling work synergistically to promote the development of CD4+ T-cells with some ThPOK independent function for TCR signaling.

365	Les perceptions des enseignants sur l’égalité scolaire et les facteurs d’inégalité entre les filles et les garçons dans le système éducatif sénégalais	"Since the 1990s, with the launch of the global Education for All policy, school equality between girls and boys has become a major issue for developing countries, especially those in sub-Saharan Africa. In Senegal, progress in girls' schooling has overthrown the parity index at primary level in favor of girls. However, many of them do not reach or complete secondary school. Paradoxically, girls' schooling situation seems to inspire great satisfaction in the educational sector. On one hand, our research aims to understand the factors that influence school equality between girls and boys, and on the other hand, to explain the contrast between the girls’ mitigated progress and the optimism linked to their situation, based on teachers' perceptions. The research seeks to answer the following general question: What do Senegalese teachers think about school equality between girls and boys? And more specifically: 1) What perceptions do Senegalese teachers have of the situation of school equality between girls and boys? 2) According to them, what factors influence school gender equality in Senegal? 3) What do teachers propose for the perceived situation? 4) How do Senegalese teachers conceive school equality? Firstly, we did a literature review, defined the key concepts of the study, and established a framework for analysis. Secondly, we collected audio recordings from 107 teachers (including 41 women and 66 men), gathered in nine focus groups, in three rural high schools and two urban high schools. The verbatim obtained from the transcription of the recordings were analyzed with the QDA Miner software. The software allowed us to carry out coding operations of units of meaning and to generate results according to a thematic grid structured in four sections: a) the characteristics of the situation as perceived by teachers on school equality between girls and boys; b) their perception of the factors behind this situation; c) solutions as proposed by teachers to improve the situation and/or correct the factors deemed detrimental; and d) school equality as conceived by teachers through its definition and the conditions of its realization. The examination of the results of the research has led to three conclusions. Firstly, girls' academic disadvantage is not unanimously perceived by respondents and this is reflected across all sections. Hence, we find explanatory factors and suggestions for improvement of the situation that refer to the academic disadvantage of girls, boys, or both. The second conclusion concerns the influence of our two variables, that of the urban or rural environment of the school, and that of the gender of the participants. More than the environment, it is the gender of participants that influences their perceptions of the situation of school equality and the way they conceive the latter. Indeed, through the analysis of the concept of school equality, there appears to be a kind of dichotomy between women and men. A second level of interpretation of the results, taking into account the distribution of majority or minority points of view; style in the extracts of the verbatim presented; the degree of commitment of the statements in favor or against academic equality; the divergent points of view, the tensions and the motives of these perceptible tensions in these remarks within the same group; etc. has led to quite eloquent trends. This led to the third conclusion that the conception of school equality seems to follow other postures corresponding to four trends according to the gender sensitivity of the respondents: as feminist, pessimist or macho / traditionalist. Other statements, more difficult to be classified in these three tendencies because of a rather neutral style led us to identify a fourth trend that we call ""scientific"". The feminist statements of women and men are strongly in favor of school equality, reveal a belief in the cause, and their authors are very fond of it. The words ""pessimistic"" tendency can be as committed to the equality of schooling or not, but consider that the idea of a realization of this one is utopian. The rhetoric of ""machist / traditionist"" tendency is also highly engaged, but is particularly characterized by a total rejection of equality between girls and boys, up to and including aggressiveness. Thus, the conception of school equality and the school situation of girls and boys would be perceived according to these four tendencies whose contours remain diffuse and influenced by the gender sensitivity of respondents."

366	Addressing gaps in colorectal cancer screening in Canada : multilevel determinants of screening, pathways to screening inequalities, and program evaluation	Background: Colorectal cancer is the second most diagnosed cancer in Canada and the third most common cause of cancer mortality. Despite the known benefits of early and regular use of preventive screening tests, only 20% to 30% of Canadian adults aged 50 to 74 years participate in regular screening, and social disparities in screening participation exist.  Purpose: The overall aims of the proposed thesis are to contribute to a better understanding of the social determinants of colorectal cancer screening in Canada and to explore potential pathways for intervention—both by identifying mechanisms that explain existing social disparities and by evaluating whether or not current population-level intervention strategies affect screening uptake overall and among vulnerable populations.  The specific objectives of the thesis are as follows: 1) To assess the association between area-level socioeconomic deprivation and colorectal cancer screening participation;  2) To assess whether or not access to primary care physician mediates differences in screening uptake between recent immigrants and non-immigrants in Canada; 3) To evaluate the impact of two types of colorectal cancer screening programs (“systematic mail-based programs” that deliver and collect screening kits via-mail to all residents aged 50 to 74 years, and “patient-reliant programs” that rely on individuals to access test kits via a designed phone-line, website, or their physician, and return kits in-person) on screening participation, and screening disparities.   Methods: Analyses were conducted utilizing data from 50 to 75-year-old respondents from the population-based Canadian Community Health Study (CCHS) who had no known familial or medical risk factors of colorectal cancer (i.e., those at ‘average risk’). CCHS data provided information on respondents’ age, sex, marital status, educational attainment, income, immigration status, visible minority status, access to a primary care physician, area and province of residence, and both lifetime (i.e., ever vs. never) and non-recent colorectal cancer screening (i.e., no stool-based screening in the previous two years or no endoscopic-based screening in the previous five years). Data from the 2006 Canadian Census provided information on respondents’ local area-level income. Different types of analyses were used, including generalized estimating equations (Objective 1), regression- and inverse probability weighting-based mediation analyses (Objective 2), and regression-based difference-in-differences analyses for program evaluation (Objective 3).   Results: First, findings suggest that colorectal cancer screening is determined by both individual- and local area-level or region-wide factors. This thesis observed a gradient in lifetime colorectal cancer screening according to local area-income in Canada independent of individual-level social and economic factors. This finding highlights the potential influence of social and environmental contexts on colorectal cancer screening uptake. Second, access to primary care physicians was not found to mediate the association between recent immigration and colorectal cancer screening. This finding suggests that alternative interventions to reduce immigration-based disparities should be explored. Lastly, both systematic and patient-reliant programs were observed to improve overall screening participation. However, both types of programs did not appear to reduce known social and economic screening inequalities. In fact, the patient-reliant program studied was observed to increase the screening disparity between those with and without a primary care physician. These results indicate that reductions in social inequalities related to colorectal cancer screening may require more targeted strategies.   Conclusions: This thesis contributes to the literature on the social determinants of colorectal cancer screening in Canada by exploring area-level determinants of screening as well as mechanisms that explain screening inequalities and by evaluating the effectiveness of various colorectal cancer screening programs at improving screening uptake and reducing screening inequalities. Findings support the notion that the role of socioeconomic contexts, above and beyond individual-level factors, merit attention both in future research on and surveillance of colorectal cancer screening. It also indicates that modifiable pathways to known screening disparities require continued exploration, and that future work should assess the acceptability, feasibility, and effectiveness of complimentary targeted interventions to promote screening both overall and among those most vulnerable.

This negative comparison's silencesbetween France and Canada gave birth to this question of how one is being excluded and othered based on the identity of constitutional law. This critique, that focuses on identities, is shifting those three dialectics supporting the aforementioned negative comparison: positivism v. pluralism; universalism v. differentialism; republicanism v. liberal pluralism. France and Canada share this issue of how reality is oriented towards specific identities. This research is, then, a critique of constitutional identities. Exclusion is defined as the gap between the orientation of law's identitiesnd the bodily  reality of its subjects.The analytical tool developed here to tackle exclusionin law has three steps:shedding lighton the orientations of constitutionalism, its identity structure, and its constitutional Others.The research purports on turning shcolars' critical gazetowards this phenomenology of constitutional exclusion, its ""constitutive outside,"" by deciphering a typologyof constitutional Others.

368	The principle of compensation in the practice of the Iran-United States claims tribunal and the transnational rules : shared values?	This study examines how the Iran--United States Claims Tribunal (IUSCT), established 1981, applies compensation rules in its practice and the relationship of those rules to the UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial Contracts (UPICC). Academics point out that the framers designed UPICC to settle private international commercial disputes, not international disputes between states and investors, which relate usually to expropriation. A crucial question emerges: can general principles of law serve as substantive law in investor--state or interstate arbitrations? IUSCT practice, involving about 880 awards and decisions in investor--state disputes over more than 35 years, contains substantial jurisprudence in this field. This study proceeds through case studies and comparison of the tribunal’s jurisprudence with UPICC’s principle of compensation and related rules in the Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG), 1980. It explores the tribunal’s interpretation and application of the principle of compensation and the extent of UPICC’s influence on the reasoning in its awards The tribunal’s implicit – and more recently explicit – adoption and/or adaptation of UPICC principles not only bolsters UPICC’s authority but also brings predictability and certainty to the application of UPICC rules and provides a useful model for other international tribunals. This study of the IUSCT awards strongly suggests the conclusion that UPICC, as a widespread and influential codification of general principles of international commercial contract law, is superbly suited for application as substantive law in arbitrating international investment disputes.

369	Sur les modèles non-linéaires autorégressifs à transition lisse et le calcul de leurs prévisions	This master’s thesis focuses on the study of dependent data. Classical literature has been widely focused on models described as linear. These models find great use when applied to macroeconomics data that are measured with relatively long time span (months, years, etc). When the data are measured using a shorter time span, and when the data are plentiful, it is then possible to describe the underlying stochastic process using more sophisticated models, which allows for proper modelling of the data’s nonlinear characteristics. It is in that contemporary setting that this master’s thesis takes place. It focuses on smooth transition autoregressive models, introduced and popularized by many authors including Teräsvirta (1994). We focus our study on modelling and forecasting for these models. As they are characterized by multiple regimes and a specific transition between those regimes, the smooth transition autoregressive models may allow for a more adequate modelling of a stochastic process using time series models that show nonlinear components. Our goal is to compare these models with the linear autoregressive models, and to study if they allow for more accurate forecasts. Thus, a main focus of this thesis is the elaboration of a forecasting system for these models.  Although the use of smooth transition autoregressive models may seem enticing, applying the models to data brings its own share of complications, especially regarding parameters estimation. The estimation of the model sometimes has trouble converging due to a nonlinear component in the model, therefore requiring non-linear optimisation which is more complex. Of course, this is also true for the class of autoregressive moving average models (ARMA), which rely on the choice of autoregressive order p and moving average q. When q > 0, it is well-known that optimisation is nonlinear as well. However, empirical evidence suggests that numerical problems are less difficult than for smooth transition autoregressive models. The estimation of standard deviations of the parameters may also be difficult to obtain since the calculation of the variance-covariance matrix may be affected by computing issues.  Forecasting for time series also poses issues for nonlinear time series. Classic linear theory is not applicable due to the nonlinear component in the model, and therefore point forecasting for smooth transition autoregressive models requires the use of other methods that vary in complexity, some which cause a bias for forecasts of lead times strictly larger than one which increase drastically in difficulty for longer lead times. For prediction intervals, because the linear theory is not applicable, they must be obtained using resampling methods. In fact, it can be asserted that an original contribution from this thesis is an elaborate and detailed study of point forecasting and forecast intervals for the models.  In the first chapter, we introduce time series and classic linear models that are used to model time series. We elaborate nonlinear models and the univariate smooth transition autoregressive models, as well as the main characteristics and stationarity conditions for these models. In the second chapter, we develop estimation methods for smooth transition autoregressive models. The modelling process includes specification, estimation and evaluation of the model. Specification includes linearity tests for the data, which is required and justifies the use of nonlinear time series models. Estimation is done by nonlinear optimisation, and by finding its starting values using a grid search. In the third chapter, we present forecasting methods for classic linear autoregressive models and smooth transition autoregressive models. We elaborate the problems encountered when applying conventional theory to nonlinear models, and the methods to overcome these issues. We also define prediction intervals and how to obtain them. In the fourth chapter, we apply the theory of prior chapters to empirical simulations, with the goal of comparing linear autoregressive models to smooth transition autoregressive ones, focusing on modelling and both point and interval forecasting. We discuss our results. In the fifth chapter, we apply the theory to a time series representing daily returns of the SPDR S&P 500 stock market index (SPY ). We compare our results with those available in the literature, for both estimation of the smooth transition autoregressive models and point forecasting and prediction intervals performance. We then conclude the thesis.	Time series , Smooth transition autoregressive models , Forecasting , Prediction intervals	en	22550.0

Diplomacy is a 7-player negotiation game where each player tries to conquer the majority of the supply centers in Europe at the beginning of the 20th century.  The article first presents a novel dataset of more than 150 000 human games. This dataset was compiled following the signing of a partnership with an external site. The games, which were played on this platform, were all converted into a new standardized format and then replayed to ensure their quality. The article also presents a game engine, with a web interface, allowing humans to play against the models that have been trained.  Moreover, the article presents a supervised learning model where an agent learns to reproduce the behavior of all players in the dataset by maximum likelihood. An agent that learns by reinforcement (by playing games against itself) has also been trained. The article concludes by doing an analysis of these models and comparing their performance against complex rule-based agents."

371	Structure-fonction des transporteurs transmembranaires de la famille MmpL3 de Mycobacterium tuberculosis	The emergence of resistance to a multitude of antimicrobial agents in pathogenic bacteria is considered a major threat to public health (2). These strains are recognized as multidrug resistant organisms (MDR) (4). Research is progressing in Gram positive, Gram positive high GC and Gram negative bacteria, and given the scale of the public health threat, these MDR have become potential targets for this research. The objectives of the present study consist of the structural and functional characterization of various transmembrane transporters of the still enigmatic RND (Resistance-Nodulation-Division) family, namely: MmpL3 in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) via the study of its ortholog CmpL1 in Corynebacterium glutamicum (Cgl) and TriAxBC in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa).  The first component of this project, presented in Chapter 2, studies the structure of the transporter MmpL3 Mtb (a TMM mycolic acid transporter essential for the viability of Mtb (5) and that of its CmpL1 Cgl orthologue, which have been predicted via the I- Tasser Pack (6-8). These structures were subsequently validated by comparing to the electronic map generated for CmpL1 (18 Å) by negative staining transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Characterization of the purified CmpL1 transporter by size exclusion chromatography confirmed the trimeric complex size around 315 KDa (including the detergent crown) corroborated by SDS-PAGE gel analyses. Collaborative genetic and biochemical studies have also identified residues involved in the transport of TMM in MmpL3 as well as those residues conferring antibiotic resistance. This data highlighted the location of the essential residues of transport and resistance in the central channel of the trimeric Mmpl3 model. The MmpL3 region activating proto-motor transport has been located at a central cavity, which is an intrinsic feature of the RND family. The low-resolution electronic maps obtained for the protein CmpL1 may serve as the foundation of future studies.     In Chapter 3 we explore the therapeutic potential of the targeting of the transmembrane transporter MmpL3 in different Mycobacterium strains. Our collaborators studied the therapeutic effect of the most promising inhibitors of the MmpL3 Mtb transporter on certain multi-resistant mycobacterial non-tuberculous (NTB) strains. Based on our comparative structural modeling obtained by I-TASSER (6-8), we supplemented the biochemical data by highlighting the structural similarities and differences between the TB and NTB strains as well as their functional impacts. This chapter highlights the interest of direct or indirect targeting of MmpL3 in NTB species. Indeed, the efficacy of certain selected MmpL3 Mtb inhibitors on the treatment of NTB pulmonary infection have potential as generalizable treatment options for other NTB multi-resistant strains, or even to help address the problem of resistance to antibiotics and simplify current combination approaches.                                                                                Other collaborative studies undertaking the same structural approaches were carried out for TriAxBC tripartite carriers (P. aeruginosa), efflux pumps belonging to the RND family. The purpose of Chapter 4 was to generate a structure of the complex and decipher its mode of assembly and expulsion of antibiotics from the intracellular environment. A quaternary structure model of TriAxBC was predicted by I-TASSER (6-8) and validated against its 4.3 Å electronic map generated by Cryo-EM. The TriAxBC complex was also characterized by gel filtration confirming an approximate size of 620 KDa and its trimer composition by SDS-PAGE.  In conclusion, this study is combining different biochemical, genetic and structural approaches to highlight the need for a multidisciplinary approach to characterizing the structure function of RND transporters. The latter remain enigmatic; however, our contribution and the progress of others will allow the generation of new specific drugs targeting multiresistant strains.

372	Deep active localization	Mobile robots have made significant advances in recent decades and are now able to perform tasks that were once thought to be impossible. One critical factor that has enabled robots to perform these various challenging tasks is their ability to determine where they are located in a given environment (localization). Further automation is achieved by letting the robot choose its own actions instead of a human teleoperating it. However, determining its pose (position + orientation) precisely and scaling this capability to larger environments has been a long-standing challenge in the field of mobile robotics. Traditional approaches to this task of active localization use an information-theoretic criterion for action selection and hand-crafted perceptual models. With a steady rise in available computation in the last three decades, the back-propagation algorithm found its use in much deeper neural networks and in numerous applications. When labelled data is not available, the paradigm of reinforcement learning (RL) is used, where it learns by interacting with the environment. However, it is impractical for most RL algorithms to learn reasonably well from just the limited real world experience. Hence, it is common practice to train the RL based models in a simulator and efficiently transfer (without any significant loss of performance) these trained models into real robots. In this thesis, we propose an end-to-end differentiable method for learning to take in- formative actions for robot localization that is trainable entirely in simulation and then transferable onto real robot hardware with zero refinement. This is achieved by leveraging recent advancements in deep learning and reinforcement learning combined with domain randomization techniques. The system is composed of two learned modules: a convolu- tional neural network for perception, and a deep reinforcement learned planning module. We leverage a multi-scale approach in the perceptual model since the accuracy needed to take actions using reinforcement learning is much less than the accuracy needed for robot control. We demonstrate that the resulting system outperforms traditional approaches for either perception or planning. We also demonstrate our approach’s robustness to different map configurations and other nuisance parameters through the use of domain randomization in training. The code has been released: https://github.com/montrealrobotics/dal and is compatible with the OpenAI gym framework, as well as the Gazebo simulator.

373	La voix du territoire : représentations territoriales plurielles dans l’œuvre d’Eruoma Awashish	In the indigenous way of thinking, territory (Nitaskinan) is an important and multidimensional notion; it includes the historical, geographical and political territory, which is reclaimed, as well as the cosmological territory inscribed into rituals and ancestral beliefs. This thesis will present how the atikamekw artist Eruoma Awashish articulates and harmonizes this multiformal territory. It aims to address the way in which the artist represents this territory, both with the will to anchor it into traditions, and to contemporarily re-actualize it under a diachronic perspective. The artist displays a frank and colored aesthetic. She is working to shift colonial codes and to develop strategies in order to contribute to current claims and territorial affirmations of the First Nations. Through a politicized artistic production, Eruoma Awashish applies a decolonising lens: she reinvents colonial history by offering indigenous symbols and narrations a central and active place in her work. This thesis puts subsequent emphasis on the capacity of indigenous nations to adapt, self-define and self-represent. The artists are the witness and vectors of this affirmation and search for sovereignty which, for Awashish, is visual, cultural and territorial. This study deploys an interdisciplinary approach, faithful to the production of the artist. It is also based on the writing of indigenous thinkers in order to present the artistic process and production of an artist rooted into a complex contemporary context, exposed to political, cultural and territorial challenges. If the art of Awashish transmits and spreads territorial claims, it is because they are, before all else, the reflection of the territorial Atikamekw history and beliefs.

We show how Ling Long magazine participated in this phenomenon, not only by introducing its readership to the principles and concepts underlying scientific nutrition, but especially by adapting these new food standards and practices to both the local Chinese context and the concerns of its female readers.

375	Le mythe de Volta chez Pline l’Ancien et l’iconographie d’urnes étrusques du IIe siècle av. J.-C.	A series of Etruscan funerary urns from the Hellenistic period shows a particular scene where a werewolf comes out of a well and attacks a group of warriors. One of them is offering up a libation near the monster and the well. A few centuries later, the Roman author Pliny the Elder referred to an old Etruscan legend about the king of Volsinii named Porsenna who invoked a lightning strike to get rid of the monster called Volta, which had previously devastated the city’s countryside.  This research paper tries to establish relationships between the images of the different urns and the myth from the second book of the Natural History which are still being debated amongst etruscologists. Moreover, this paper will set my own position in the debate and, grounded on previous works about the subject, will cover the complete history of the urns originating from Perugia and Volterra in most cases presented. The first chapter of this paper will provide an updated historiography concerning the core subject, the interpretation of the mythical scene, and a short review relating to Etruscan funerary urns from the Hellenistic period. The second chapter will address the symbolism of the wolf and the werewolf from an anthropological view. This section will also look for any archaeological and literary evidence concerning the wolf and the werewolf during ancient times (Greece, Rome and Italic populations, Etruria) concluding that they belong to the underworld. The chapter will end with the link between the werewolf of the urns and the monster depicted in Pliny the Elder’s story. The last chapter will provide additional insights about the urns and the Plinian sources that deserve further investigation; for instance, Etruscan beliefs about the invocation of lightning, the well as a symbolic passage to the afterworld and the reference to the mythical king Porsenna. This thesis, centred on cultural history, provides an updated view of a debate that is a century old. This paper also brings new evidence to bear that the Etruscan urns could actually represent the same myth as the one from Pliny’s text. This research document also reinforces the hypothesis that this Etruscan legend had survived many centuries of exterior influences up to its spread through the Roman world during the Flavian dynasty.

376	Les relations diplomatiques franco-autochtones à Montréal, 1701-1713	The Great Peace of Montreal (1701) is a manifestation of the success of French-Amerindian diplomacy, highlighting the many cultural adjustments that allowed for a global alliance and peace between New France and the nations of the Pays d’en Haut. This study looks at the following decade, and the ways in which diplomatic relations between French and Natives developed in Montreal at the beginning of the 18th century. Examining the colonial correspondence that was sent back and forth from Versailles to Montreal, it analyses colonial discourses to better understand how diplomatic practices evolved, and how Montreal played a key role as the urban setting for these pluricultural negotiations. Although these letters present a Eurocentric point of view, a particular consideration was given to Native speeches given during peace negotiations that are transcribed in the correspondence, but also to everything left unsaid by the official correspondents. This study analyses first how diplomacy took place in Montreal, taking an interest in the actors, the urban setting and the practices that surround it. Then it observes the development brought to diplomatic practices by new political stakes in the early 18th century. Ending the analysis at the end of the War of the Spanish Succession (Utrecht, 1713), the thesis concludes that this decade contributed to the continuous strengthening of a pluricultural diplomatic tradition that was ingrained in the urban setting of Montreal.

377	Stabilisation du paysage périglaciaire suite à un épisode de ravinement par thermo-érosion : implication pour la structure et la stabilité thermique du pergélisol de surface	Thermo-erosion gullies dissect the ice-wedge polygonal terrace in Qarlikturvik valley, Bylot Island (Nunavut), and gullies stay in the landscape as stabilized features following their catastrophic formation. After such disturbances, long-term transitions of the landscape in the continuous permafrost zone needs to be studied thoroughly to understand the recovery processes and new permafrost structure that results, and how it contrasts from pre-disturbance conditions. In this master’s thesis, we investigated how permafrost first formed and then went through a disturbance-stabilization transition. We also examined the processes that contributed to the recovery of surficial permafrost. Special attention was paid to the cryostratigraphic patterns of surficial permafrost due to landscape recovery. The thermo-erosion gully results from the partial erosion of an ice-wedge network, that previously developed in glaciofluvial sands and gravels, alluvial sediments and an organic matrix mixed with eolian silts. An area of 226 ± 22 m2 per linear meter of eroded permafrost was impacted by degradation and stabilization. Aggradational ice and rejuvenated ice wedges (found in the gully slopes) are two features indicative of permafrost stabilization lead by negative feedbacks acting on permafrost. On a one-meter deep profile, we learned that globally, drained polygons and slopes’ permafrost from both sides of the gully channel reached thermal conditions comparable to pre-degradation permafrost state. Regarding the drained polygons only, its surficial permafrost now has 1.2 time more latent heat than intact polygons, meaning more energy is necessary to induce its thawing. This modification in the permafrost structure suggests these stabilized drained polygons are in a better posture to face future climate warming compared with pre-disturbance permafrost. This study confirms the importance of long-term investigations of thermokarst terrain to understand landscape evolution in the context of climate change and puts to light permafrost resiliency.	cryostructures , Permafrost , Stabilization , Aggradational ice , Thermo-erosion gully , Ice-wedge	en	22507.0
378	Impacts des Water operators partnerships « WOPs » sur la prestation des services d’eau dans la ville de Quito, Équateur	"To improve access to water and sanitation the United Nations created in 2006 a cooperation program among water operators, the Water Operator's Partnerships (WOP). This program was born in response to the general problems to achieve the UN's goals for water and sanitation.  There are still problems in the world, most especially in the South, to access drinking water. These problems will increase with the contamination of water sources, caused by lack of sanitation and lack of wastewater treatment. Urbanization, which concentrates more and more people, worsens this situation and brings together the most pressing problems in the cities. Latin America is the most urbanized region of the South. Marginal areas, not served by municipal services, are growing, and the absence of ownership of the lands of its areas makes it difficult for people to claim their right to be served by the services provided by the city. As defended by the urban political ecologies (UPE), urban water will organize the city, and social power will produce unequal urban environments. These changes must be understood in a global context of néolibéralisation of economies, and adoption of ""private ethics"" by the public sector. It seems that public companies that market water have become the most common model of water operator.  In this global context, the WOPs will be presented as a solution to strengthen local water services, which will improve access to water and sanitation. Since 2010 the UN to create a WOP database set up around the world. Subsequently, in 2013, they began to follow up on these partnerships, with the intention of highlighting a collection of WOP good practices. We were fortunate to be able to participate in one of its evaluations on a WOP conducted in Latin America between the water operators of the cities of Quito (Ecuador) and Medellin (Colombia)"	Water Operator’s Partnerships , Access to water , Latin America	en	22505.0
379	Le chant du mycélium ; suivi de Le monologue polyphonique dans la pièce Éden Matin Midi et Soir de Chloé Delaume	This master’s thesis is divided into two parts: creation and research. The first part is a fiction designed to be transposed into podcasts. The thirteen monads it is made of could be read and listened to in a random order (except the first one and the last one). The proliferation of textual forms (different voices and enunciative instances, pieces in verse and prose...) echoes the gradual transformation of the character's perception of the world. The hybridization processes aim to blur its sensitive and mental boundaries and to allow the emergence of a double that constantly disrupts their mental health and its bodily integrity. In the second part, that is devoted to research, the essay focuses on Éden Matin Midi et Soir (2009) by Chloé Delaume, writer and literary performer. The form of the discourse reveals its hybrid nature, in-between theatrical monologue, fictional monologue, polyphonic narrative and autofiction. The relationship to an unstable, multiple and polymorphic self-awareness is deeply embedded in a fragmented writing, always on the verge of psychosis and enunciative schizophrenia. This analysis explores the issues related to the fragmentation of the Self of the narrator-character, which is broken down into several autonomous voices that respond to each other, invective and scream. The essay, through the study of enunciative dynamics, aims to demonstrate how the text manages to bring about an open yet structuring polyphony from a monological framework.

380	L’écueil des mondes, suivi de Érotisme interethnique : éthique du voyage chez Houellebecq, Le Clézio et Mauvignier	Written during a journey around the world, L’écueil des mondes is a collection of seven short stories that take place in different places on the planet. The narratives show erotic relationships between travellers and the natives of the countries they visit. The connections are, however, upset by natural disasters or mysterious events, as if to underline the difficulties, even the inability of the tourist to fully understand “the other.” Thanks to the internal focus, depending on the viewpoint of the traveller characters, the reader should better perceive the displacement experienced by these tourists in search of exoticism.  Is it possible to give an implicit discourse on cultural diversity, starting from the representation of attraction for the other? Érotisme interethnique : éthique du voyage chez Houellebecq, Le Clézio et Mauvignier is an essay that looks at how these three authors use interethnic eroticism to represent an attraction among peoples that seems to derive from the cultural mix caused by travel and tourism. From lustful exchanges in the novels La quarantaine of J. M. G. Le Clézio, Lanzarote of Michel Houellebecq and Autour du monde from Laurent Mauvignier, it would be possible to identify an ethical discourse of these authors on the intermingling, but especially on the prioritization of cultural relations between the peoples.

381	Réjean Ducharme, un écrivain de la « résistance à la disparition de soi »	In this master’s thesis, I approach Rejean Ducharme’s novels through the concept of « resistance to the disappearance of the self ». This theme is derived from the literary essays of Milan Kundera, in which he contends that the novel is a special place of resistance to « the forgetting of being » (Heidegger), and works against the unfortunate tendency of modern thought to reduce being to a purely scientific understanding and leave aside what Husserl called the « Lifeworld » (« die Lebenswelt »). In the works of Ducharme, protagonist/narrators exist in a state of tension, and engage in a sort of resistance against a vast and abstract enemy who can barely be perceived. This gives rise to one of the principal hypotheses of this thesis : this enemy generates « the forgetting of being ». This particular approach also has the effect of placing Ducharme in the context of « world literature » rather than in Quebec’s national/cultural context. While I perform a close reading of Ducharme’s novels, this memoir also serves as a reflection on the novel as a form of art – a reflection guided by Kundera’s essays, and by a few other writers/thinkers (Duras, Deleuze).

382	Memorias sobre la guerra interna en el Perú : los jóvenes del Movadef y el colectivo Hijos de Perú	"This study analyzes some aspects of the memory of the internal war in Peru of two groups: the youth of the Movement for Amnesty and Fundamental Rights (MOVADEF) and the Hijos de Peru. Between 1980 and 2000, Peru suffered one of the most violent conflicts in its history that pitted the State against the subversive groups Shining Path and the Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA). After the conflict and after the work of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (2001-2003) that investigated its causes and consequences, numerous academic and nongovernmental studies emerged about the memories of different actors, victims, survivors, perpetrators and bystanders. Among the different memory groups, there are also young people who did not necessarily ""live"" through those years but have a memory about it. How have they formed that memory of events? In the case of young partisans the Movadef, the political wing of the Shining Path, this thesis analyzes the intergenerational transmission of the memory about the armed conflict. In the case of the Hijos de Peru, formed by children of MRTA subversives, we analyze the characteristics of their memories based on their life experience."

383	Gender, globalization and beyond in Karen Tei Yamashita's Tropic of Orange and Jhumpa Lahiri's The Interpreter of Maladies	This thesis explores two major concepts: globalization and diaspora and their impact on the literary representation of women in Jhumpa Lahiri’s collection of short stories The Interpreter of Maladies and Karen Tei Yamashita’s novel Tropic of Orange. In the first chapter, using Vijay Mishra’s theory on the Literature of the Indian Diaspora: Theorizing the Diasporic Imaginary, the thesis examines the diasporic state of Mrs. Sen through Mishra’s notion of “impossible mourning”. I juxtapose Mrs. Sen’s character to two other female characters to argue that mobility and crossing borders do not affect all women equally, especially if they come from different social class and caste backgrounds. In addition, I compare Mrs. Sen’s diasporic condition to her husband’s to contend that the impact of immigration is more beneficial to him than her. This thesis, hence, rethinks some of the reasons why people migrate across the world and its various impacts on individuals, especially women whose displacement often curtails rather than expands their mobility, freedom and independence. In the second chapter, therefore, I use Chandra Talpade Mohanty’s Feminism without Borders to highlight the difference between Western women and so-called Third World women. Furthermore, using Mohanty’s essay “‘Under Western Eyes’ Revisited,” which condemns the detrimental effects of capitalism and globalization and promotes an anti-capitalist and anti-global project based on solidarity, I study the characterization of Emi and Rafaela, two central characters of Yamashita’s novel, within the context of globalization and its deviant operations. Referring to the criminal and criminalizing operative modes of global capitalism, including organ and sex trafficking, deviant globalization is a critical concept in this thesis through which I read Yamashita’s novel and its female characters’ complicity with and resistance to global capitalism.

384	Étude de la mortalité aux grands âges à l’aide du Registre des décès d’Antananarivo (Madagascar)	For 60 years now, mortality has been declining sharply in Madagascar, mainly at young ages. Fertility has also decreased significantly in the last two decades. Individuals aged 65 and over, which currently accounts for 3% of the total population, are to represent an increasing share of the population in future years. Given that around 60% of the workforce labors in the informal economy and as a consequence will not have access to a pension system, it becomes crucial to better understand old age mortality in order to determine the extent of the coming phenomenon. In this context, this research examines the evolution of the modal (i.e. most frequent) age at death (M), a suitable indicator for monitoring improvements in old-age survival. Our paper focuses on Antananarivo, the capital and a city for which detailed and virtually complete data on deaths since 1976 are available. From a nonparametric P-spline smoothing approach, and estimates of the population exposed to the risk of death for each year, we obtain relatively accurate estimates of M and the standard deviation of ages at death above the mode for both sexes. Our results show that great progress in longevity has been made in Antananarivo since the mid-1980’s, especially for men. This increase in modal age at death came with a mortality compression above the mode. In other words, inequalities in old age mortality noticeably narrowed. These positive developments are due primarily to a continued strong reduction in infectious-related mortality. However, further progress will now require efficient measures aimed at fighting circulatory system diseases (cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases).

385	La fécondité des immigrantes établies au Canada entre 2000 et 2014 : une analyse longitudinale par catégorie d’admission	The Longitudinal Administrative Databank (LAD) allows us to analyze the link between the immigration category and the fertility trajectory after admission. This analysis focuses exclusively on the fertility of immigrant women admitted as permanent residents between the ages of 15 and 44 in Canada. Cox’s non-parametric models enable us to observe how women’s pre-migration characteristics and the socioeconomic integration affect the relative risks related to having a first and a second child after the attainment of permanent resident status in Canada. We use Kaplan-Meier curves and mean calculations to show the pace of post-migratory fertility. In general, we assessed the link between the fertility of immigrant women and the shift to economic immigration in Canada with the adoption of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. The results show that the admission category is a very good predictor of fertility. Immigrant women in the economic class are less likely to give birth in Canada than family immigrants or refugees (those who are not admitted through an economic integration potential assessment). Other individual characteristics, such as age, cohort of admission and region of origin, also affect the probability of an immigrant giving birth in Canada.

386	La mortalité différentielle aux âges adultes et avancés selon le groupe linguistique au Québec : une étude de suivi sur la période 1991-2011	Quebec’s unique linguistic situation in North America leads us to question the effect of belonging to a linguistic group on observed inequalities in mortality. The new 1991 Canadian Census Health and Environment Cohorts (CanCHEC) database, which is derived from the pairing of the 1991 census, vital statistics and administrative files from 1991 to 2011, provides an unparalleled opportunity to study mortality differentials by language in Quebec with more accuracy. The main objective of this work is to compare the distributions of deaths by age and language most often spoken at home (i.e. French, English or another language). We begin by smoothing the age-specific mortality rate curves by sex, language and region using the P-splines approach. From the smoothed density functions, we derive four indicators of adult mortality and old-age mortality which are the life expectancy at age 25, at age 65, and the modal age (i.e. most common age) at death as well as the dispersion measure associated to the mode. Our results show that in Quebec, there are indeed significant differences between linguistic groups in adult mortality, except for Francophone and Anglophone women. However, mortality gaps for the life expectancy at age 25 are less important than stated in the literature. Although these observed differences in adult mortality persist among those 65 years of age and older, they do not carry on among those who reach the modal age at death, with the exception of Allophone men who retain their mortality advantage in very old age. In addition, the dispersion of deaths beyond the modal age is not significantly different between linguistic groups. We also find different levels of mortality between the Island of Montreal and the rest of Quebec, for Francophones and Allophones. These results shed new light on the subject given the greater reliability of the linguistic variable from the 1991 Census in CanCHEC, and the improvements made in terms of data processing and analysis, which include the consideration of emigration and the indigenous population, and region-based analyses.

387	Profils d’adolescentes : liens entre les traits d’insensibilité émotionnelle, l’historique de victimisation et la santé mentale	Callous-unemotional traits, such as a lack of consideration and empathy for others, are important to consider in identifying subgroups of youth at risk of serious and persistent antisocial behavior (Frick & Dickens, 2006; Frick & White, 2008). Two variants (primary and secondary) of youth who manifest callous-unemotional traits have been identified. Specifically, adolescents with secondary callous-unemotional traits have been found to differ from those associated with the primary variant by their higher levels of anxiety and depression (Fanti et al., 2013; Kahn et al., 2013) as well as their history of adversity (Meehan et al., 2017) and self-destructive behaviors, such as substances use (Cecil et al., 2018). Studies that focused on the differences between the profiles of youth were mainly based on male samples who are notably more likely than females to display conduct problems combined with callous-unemotional traits (Fontaine et al., 2011). Based on a sample of adolescent females, the first aim of this study was to identify youth profiles based on callous-unemotional traits (CU), conduct problems (CP) and internalized symptoms (i.e. anxiety and depression). The second aim was to identify the differences in youth profiles in terms of their self-destructive behaviors, such as alcohol and drug use (Baumeister & Scher, 1988) and eating disorders (Van der Kolk & Herman, 1991), as well as their history of family and social victimization, such as abuse, neglect and bullying by peers. A sample of 200 adolescent girls was recruited from high schools located in Montreal and from the Institute for Youth in difficulty (n = 200; M = 15.10 years old; S-D = 1.62). Latent profile analyses performed using Mplus 8 software provided an optimal four-class solution: normative, anxious, conduct problems (CP), conduct problems–callous unemotional traits (CP–CUT). In addition to reporting more anxiety and depression than the normative group, girls with the highest rates of iv callous-unemotional traits and conduct problems (CP-CUT) also reported the highest levels of exposure to family and social victimization and self-destructive behaviors, such as substances abuse. This profile shows several features associated with the secondary variant of callous-unemotional traits. Thus, the results of this study confirm the importance of considering the heterogeneity of behaviors as well as the history of victimization among groups of high-risk girls. In particular, the identification of these adolescent profiles is important to prevent other adjustment difficulties and to tailor interventions to the individual characteristics and experiences of victimization.

388	Accompagnement d’enseignants par le conseiller pédagogique dans le contexte de l’école : interrelation entre d’une part son processus d’accompagnement et d’autre part ses caractéristiques individuelles et les caractéristiques du contexte de l’école	"To ensure quality education for students, several teaching systems, including the Quebec system, promote the professional development of teachers. For example, the Public Education Act requires teachers ""to take appropriate measures that enable [them] to achieve and maintain a high degree of professional competence"" (Éditeur officiel du Québec, 2018, août, art. 22.6). The professionals who can coach teachers in this process are the coaches who replace the inspectors since the abolition of these positions in 1964 (Lessard & Des Ruisseaux, 2004). However, during the coaching of teachers by the coaches in a school, the coaching process, which is related to the individual characteristics of the coach and the characteristics of the school context, is difficult to achieve in certain cases (Boutet & Villemain, 2014; Cartier & Bélanger, 2012; CSÉ, 2014; LeBlanc, Dumoulin, Garant & Larouche, 2013; Mané & Lessard, 2007). This problem manifests itself, inter alia, through the implementation of intuitive coaching practices (Mané & Lessard, 2007) and its extent can be justified by the low rate of teachers who benefit from coaching (CSÉ, 2006). Among the factors that can influence the emergence of this problem, there is the lack of definition of the role of the coach, their limited number in school boards and the lack of training recognized for them (CSÉ, 2014). From this problematic, a question arose: during the coaching in a school, how the process of teacher’s coaching by the coach is related to its individual characteristics and to the characteristics of the school context? To address this issue, a conceptual framework based on theoretical models and empirical researches in the field has been developed. It presents the coaching as a complex and dynamic process of thoughts and practices oriented towards the achievement of specific goals, favouring the agency of teachers and related to the individual characteristics of the coach and to the characteristics of the school context. Examination of literature in the field shows that little knowledge exists on this interrelation that can lead to better understand how coaching works in its context. Based on the conceptual framework of the study, the research goals were: during a coaching in a school, 1) describe the coach’s coaching process; 2) describe the interrelation between the coaching process and the individual characteristics of the coach; 3) describe the interrelation between the coaching process and the characteristics of the school context. To that end, an embedded multiple case study (Yin, 2003) was conducted with two coaches who each coached a team of female teachers in a school. Data collected through interviews, observations, and literature were analyzed using the mixed coding method (Miles & Huberman, 1994; 2003, Van Der Maren, 1996). The results of the first goal, which aims to describe the process of teachers’ coaching by the coach, documented its aspects: complex, dynamic, oriented, precise and agentive. For example, the complexity was found mainly in supporting the learning process of teachers, their teaching process and their characteristics. The orientation was found in the presence of goals consistent with the problem identified and coaching practices aligned with these goals. The results in the second goal, which focused on the description of the interrelationship between the coach’s coaching process and his individual characteristics, showed an interrelation between the coaching process carried out and, above all, the conceptions of the coaches and their perceptions of the school context. For example, their control of the results obtained is consistent with their perception of the practices of the teachers. Finally, the results in the third goal, which focused on the description of the interrelation between the coaching process and the characteristics of the school context, showed the role played by the school principal in the coaching process. For example, the school principals communicated their goals to the coach and the latter adopted them and proceeded to plan, enact and control practices in order to reach them. Otherwise, this study presents contributions, among others, at the theoretical and empirical level. Indeed, it allowed to conceptualize teachers’ coaching by the coach in the school context by considering its three central concepts: the coaching process, the individual characteristics of the coach and the characteristics of school context. Empirically, she documented the complexity, dynamism, focus, precision and agency of the coaching process and its interrelation with the coach’s individual characteristics and the characteristics of school context. These aspects are not very present in the research since most of them mainly consider enacting of coaching practices."

389	Organisation et re-production des rapports de domination dans les distributions dissymétriques du travail enseignant : une enquête du point de vue d’enseignant·es de groupes racisés	"In less than a decade, the professional integration of immigrant teachers has generated a large body of research in Quebec. In general, these studies use interpretive frameworks that rely on an analysis of cultural gaps between immigrant teachers and the host society. Despite measures put in place in 2001 to mitigate the effects of systemic discrimination in employment in public bodies, there is no research linking the experience of these teachers to the persistent under-representation of racialized teachers in Quebec or, even more notably, in the French-language school boards of the Montreal Metropolitan Region (MMR) (Quebec Human Rights Commission, 2015).  Based on a critical/interpretative epistemological perspective and a framework of feminist analysis, this dissertation moves away from this essentializing prism in order to produce new knowledge aimed at increasing social justice within educational institutions. The feminist perspectives guiding the thesis have in common their desire to expose the configurations of social and power relations through which domination in the various spheres of society is materialized, including in the workplace. Inspired by the sociological method of institutional ethnography, this study takes the form of an enquiry seeking to understand how social relations, especially of race, are organized and (re)produced in the asymmetrical distributions of teaching work. The study was conducted from the point of view of vocational integration teachers who were assigned by racial social relations and were working in French-language school boards in the Montreal MRR (14). Their stories and questions led to an exploration of the institutional and practical processes regulating the obtention of a teaching licence and employment contracts. The study was expanded through interviews with principals of educational institutions (4), educational consultants (2), union representatives (2) and employees in the human resources sector (2) within two school boards of the MMR. Documents that codify these processes in different ways – laws, regulations, reports, collective agreements, etc. – have also been analyzed.  The thesis conclusions explore several aspects. The exposure of the configurations of social relations in teaching work cannot be done without more widely exposing the multiple hierarchies structuring this work and even its legislative framework. From various fragments of materials, the thesis reveals empirically how the increase of atypical and precarious work in teaching – which has become more pronounced since the 1990s – induced an increase in the possibilities of hierarchization among employees, from which arose a reconfiguration of the division of labour. The thesis shows how racial social relations organize the distribution of work in a profession already historically structured according to gender social relations. The results highlight the creation of hierarchical ""classes"" of teachers in order to fill assignments, which are themselves classified according to whether or not they make career advancement possible. In the absence of effective measures to counter systemic discrimination, this thesis shows how the arbitrary nature of the processes and the criteria by which teachers are selected run the risk of disproportionately confining teachers from racialized groups to atypical and precarious jobs. In light of these results, the thesis calls on educational leaders to intervene at several levels of educational institutions to confront inequalities in treatment that effectively compromise equality rights among teaching staff."

390	The mobility of elderly women of Puebla, Mexico : effects of walkability on daily trips in three neighbourhoods	As life expectancy increases in developing countries, many elderly people are faced with challenges concerning their mobility. In Mexico, where women see their mobility affected by gender violence in public spaces, elderly women find themselves vulnerable on two fronts: because of their age and their gender. In the city of Puebla, women make up a larger proportion of the elderly, but very little research has been done on their mobility habits. This Master’s thesis presents a case study on the daily mobility of elderly women living in three different neighbourhoods in Puebla. The data was collected through semi-structured interviews with elderly women, as well as an environmental audit evaluating the walkability in these neighbourhoods. The interviews revealed that walking was not a preferred mode of travel, especially not in their own neighbourhoods. Their perception of the environment and their ability to appropriate it affected their capacity and willingness to leave their home. This combined with the walkability evaluation of the audit reveals the importance of having an environment that is perceived as welcoming, attractive and safe.

391	L’intervention auprès des personnes contrevenantes présentant des difficultés sur le plan de l’attachement	Attachment style can influence behaviour as well as the perceptions that people have about themselves and others. In adulthood, there are four main attachment styles: secure, detached, preoccupied and fearful. Several difficulties may arise from a non-secure attachment. A significant proportion of offenders, particularly sex offenders and domestic violence offenders, are reported to have attachment difficulties. Thus, it appears important that clinicians take into consideration these difficulties when working with these individuals. The main objective of this report is to provide a critical analysis of the scientific documentation on the assessment tools designed to evaluate the attachment style presented by adult offenders and on the intervention strategies that should be fostered in a clinical context with adult offenders who have attachment difficulties. This project was carried out as part of an internship completed at the Department of Correctional Professionals Services (DCPS Montreal Southwest). Electronic and printed resources were consulted to obtain an overview of what has been published so far on the subject. In light of the scientific literature, interventions providing a secured environment from which the person could explore past and present feelings, thoughts and attachment experiences and find new ways to deal with negative emotions should be promoted. However, there are few resources on the empirical validation of interventions targeting adult offenders with attachment difficulties. The development of empirically validated intervention strategies targeting adult offenders with attachment difficulties appears essential for an optimal integration of attachment theory into the criminological practice.

If there is no consensus on a definition of manipulation, it is established that its perception may give rise to resistance on the part of the consumer. The qualitative study conducted with 14 consumers highlights two strategies, combative or resigned, and brings out four profiles of resistant consumers: the experienced, the reserved, the optimizer and the indifferent.

We conducted simultaneously a survey of institutional documents dedicated to PSE and a qualitative study with socioeconomic actors. The results show that PSE is based on an orthodox conception of sustainable development and focused on a weak sustainability approach. Regarding the qualitative study, interviewees are sceptical about PSE and have priority expectations in terms of social services, employment and healthy environment. Grey areas and ambiguities of PSE are finally discussed.	Philosophy , Ethics , Economics , Sustainable development , Emergence , Senegal , Sénégal	en	22394.0
395	Impact of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae biofilm mode of growth on the lipid A structures and stimulation of immune cells	Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (APP), the etiologic agent of porcine pleuropneumonia, forms biofilms on both biotic and abiotic surfaces. APP biofilms confers resistance to antibiotics. To our knowledge, no studies have examined the role of APP biofilm in immune evasion and infection persistence. This study was undertaken to: (i) investigate biofilm-associated lipopolysaccharide modifications occurring during the switch to biofilm mode of growth; (ii) characterize pro-inflammatory cytokines expression in porcine pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAMs) and proliferation in porcine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) challenged with planktonic or biofilm APP cells. Extracted lipid A samples from biofilm and planktonic cultures were analyzed by HPLC-high resolution accurate mass spectrometry. Biofilm cells displayed significant changes in lipid A profiles when compared to their planktonic counterparts. Furthermore, in vitro experiments were conducted to examine the inflammatory response of PAMs exposed to UV-inactivated APP grown in biofilm or in suspension. Relative mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory genes IL-1, IL-6, IL-8 and MCP-1 decreased in PAMs when exposed to biofilm cells compared to planktonic cells. Additionally, the biofilm state reduced PBMCs proliferation. Taken together, APP biofilm cells show a weaker ability to stimulate innate immune cells which could be due, in part, to lipid A structure modifications.

396	Imposing equilibrium restrictions in the estimation of dynamic discrete games	Imposing equilibrium restrictions provides substantial gains in the estimation of dynamic discrete games. Estimation algorithms imposing these restrictions – MPEC, NFXP, NPL, and variations – have different merits and limitations. MPEC guarantees local convergence, but requires the computation of high-dimensional Jacobians. The NPL algorithm avoids the computation of these matrices, but – in games – may fail to converge to the consistent NPL estimator. We study the asymptotic properties of the NPL algorithm treating the iterative procedure as performed in finite samples. We find that there are always samples for which the algorithm fails to converge, and this introduces a selection bias. We also propose a spectral algorithm to compute the NPL estimator. This algorithm satisfies local convergence and avoids the computation of Jacobian matrices. We present simulation evidence illustrating our theoretical results and the good properties of the spectral algorithm.

397	Factors influencing the practice of new graduate nurses : a focused ethnography of acute care settings	Aim: To explore the influence of an acute care setting on competency deployment of new graduate nurses (NGNs) from a competency -based undergraduate programme . Background: In the last 15 years, nursing education has shifted to competency -based education (CBE). Few studies have focused on how NGNs from these reformed programmes use the competencies they have developed. To be paradigmatically coherent with the nature of a competence, studies should also examine how context influences nursing practice and competency deployment. Design: A focused ethnography of three acute care units from one academic hospital in Canada. Methods: Purposive and snowball sampling strategies were used to recruit 19 participants: NGNs (n = 4), nurse preceptors (n = 2), clinical nurse specialists (n = 9) , and nurse managers (n = 4). Data were collected through individual interviews, focus groups , observation and documentation. Data were analysed according to Roper and Shapira’s (2000) ethnographic nursing analysis framework. Results: Organizational and individual factors were identified as influencing NGNs ’ competenc y deployment. Organizational factors are orientation, stability, workload, and the scientific culture of the unit. Personal factors have been linked to groups of professionals: for NGNs, personality and clinical placements during their initial education; for nurses working with NGNs, to be role models, to promote integration and to denounce bullying; and for other health professionals, to recognize nursing expertise. Conclusion: One way to s mooth the transition from academic to clinical settings for NGNs is by offering transition or orientation programmes that will provide them with stability and a reduced workload, allowing them to progressively deploy their competencies. Relevance to clinical practice: Organizational and individual factors influence how new graduate nurses deploy their competencies. Clinical educators and nurse managers can help new nurses by acting on these factors.

Aβ-related volume changes are inconsistent across studies. Since volume is composed of surface area and thickness, the relative contribution of Aβ deposition on each of these metrics remains to be understood in cognitively normal individuals. Methods A group of 104 cognitively normal individuals underwent neuropsychological assessment, PiB-PET scan, and MRI acquisition. Surface-based cortical analyses were performed to investigate the effects of cortical and subcortical Aβ burden on cortical volume, thickness, and surface area. Mediation analyses were used to study the effect of thickness and surface area on Aβ-associated volume changes. We also investigated the relationships between structural metrics in clusters with abnormal morphology and regions underlying resting-state functional networks and cognitive performance. Results Cortical Aβ was not associated with cortical morphology. Subcortical Aβ burden was associated with changes in cortical volume, thickness, and surface area. Aβ-associated volume changes were driven by cortical surface area with or without thickness but never by thickness alone. Aβ-associated changes overlapped greatly with regions from the default mode network and were associated with lower performance in visuospatial abilities, episodic memory, and working memory. Conclusions In cognitively normal individuals, subcortical Aβ is associated with cortical volume, and this effect was driven by surface area with or without thickness. Aβ-associated cortical changes were found in the default mode network and affected cognitive performance. Our findings demonstrate the importance of studying subcortical Aβ and cortical surface area in normal ageing	Amyloid-beta , Subcortical , Default mode network , Pittsburgh compound B , Cognitive aging	en	22349.0
399	Haven't we seen this already? Duplicate records in weekly Ovid autoalerts	Introduction: The primary objective of this study is to present data on records identified via Ovid's AutoAlert (SDI) feature. AutoAlert is one of several strategies healthcare professionals can use to keep up-to-date with the literature and thus maintain their clinical competence. It allows users to be notified via email when any new citations matching their search specifications are created in Ovid databases. Methods: We performed searches in Medline and Embase via Ovid on two topics and created weekly alerts for each search. Over a period of one year, each 'new' result was analyzed to determine whether it was previously retrieved by the initial search or in subsequent alerts. If the result had been retrieved previously, the nature of the revision to the initial record (the reason it was identified as 'new') was noted. Results: Extracted data was analysed in Excel. The investigators presented descriptive statistics on the frequency and nature of duplicate records generated via AutoAlert. Discussion: Given the increasing rate of publication in the medical literature (813,598 citations were added to Medline in 2017), email alerts in bibliographic databases can be useful tools to help healthcare professionals keep abreast of their topics of interest. Unfortunately, our study found that the AutoAlert feature consistently included edited or revised records in addition to newly created citations, and was therefore of limited value.

400	Thérapie génique ciblant CD33 dans les cellules souches hématopoïétiques, une approche innovatrice pour le traitement de la leucémie myéloïde aiguë	With very few new treatments introduced in the past decades, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains a cancer with poor prognosis. Recently, a revolutionary immunotherapy for B-cell malignancies has been approved, named CAR-T cells. It is based on adoptive T-cell therapy but the cells are genetically engineered to express a “chimeric antigen receptor” (CAR), a surface protein used to redirect T cell’s natural cytotoxic activity against tumors. CD33 is one of the few clinically validated targets for AML immunotherapy. However, myelotoxicity is a major concern because this antigen is also present on normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). Interestingly, CD33 was dispensable in humans and in several animal models without any apparent consequences. We hypothesized that a HSC graft, engineered with a knock-out/knock-in of CD33/CAR-CD33, would be a safe and effective therapy for AML patients. This strategy would benefit from the clinical potential of CD33 without the associated myelotoxicity. Because of the continuous renewal of effector cells, CAR-HSC would have several advantages over the CAR-T cells such as long-term in vivo persistence and reduced cellular exhaustion. Cytokine release syndrome could also be diminished in CAR-HSC settings by the slow generation of CAR-T. In this study, we showed that the anti-CD33 CAR is effective and specific against AML cell lines even when its expression is mediated by a T-specific promotor. This promotor allows restriction of transgene expression to the T lineage progeny. We have designed efficient gRNA to target CD33 gene. The strategy will now be tested in HSC and in mice models.

401	Établissement et persistance du réservoir du VIH chez des individus traités très tôt en phase aigüe de l’infection (cohorte RV254)	Antiretroviral therapies (ART) have largely increased the life expectancy of the HIV infected individuals who have access to it. Nonetheless, these therapies can’t eradicate the virus that persist in a latent state in long-lived CD4+ T cells. These infected cells form a viral reservoir that remains the main obstacle to a cure.  Several studies have shown that initiation of ART during the acute infection can lead to a delay in the viral rebound or in some cases to viremia control after a treatment interruption. However, the timing and location of the establishment and persistence of the viral reservoir during acute infection remain unclear. Using, blood and lymphoid tissues samples from acutely infected participants, we observed that the virus is firstly integrated in lymph nodes and colon cells and reaches a maximum frequency of infected cells at the Fiebig stage II, i.e. before seroconversion in the tissues. Moreover, we saw that a very early initiation of ART results in a drastic decrease of the number of infected cells in all compartments. Nonetheless a few infected cells persist under ART in the lymph nodes.   Our results suggest that a large number of cells are infected early in tissues before moving into the blood during the acute infection. Nonetheless, these infected cells form a labile HIV reservoir which is rapidly, but incompletely, eliminated by an early initiation of ART.

402	Développement d'un outil d'évaluation des techniques chirurgicales en plastie	Introduction During surgical residencies, technical skills continue to be assessed using subjective evaluation methods. We aim to develop an objective, valid and reliable evaluation tool to assess plastic surgery residents’ microsurgical skills in performing a digital nerve repair. Materials and methods Plastic surgery residents of different levels of training and staff surgeons performed a digital nerve repair on a human cadaveric hand model. These performances were recorded and assessed by blinded raters using a newly developed evaluation tool. This consisted of 12 steps, each rated using a 5-point Likert scale. The tool’s reliability was determined by comparing each candidate’s evaluation by the two separate raters and its validity determined by comparing performances of candidates of different levels of expertise. Results Ten candidates took part in this study. The inter-rater reliability was considered acceptable, with an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.690. The test’s internal consistency was excellent with a Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of 0.960. The test’s validity was demonstrated by the fact that higher levels of expertise were associated with higher performance scores (p=0.017). Conclusion We developed a new evaluation tool for a microsurgical procedure, that performed well in terms of reliability and validity. This makes it a pedagogically useful tool that can be incorporated in plastic surgery residents’ training to improve surgical skills teaching and assessment.

403	Évaluation de la fidélité intra- et interobservateur pour l’évaluation du vasospasme post-hémorragie sous-arachnoïdienne en angiotomodensitométrie	Objective: To review the literature on and assess the intra- and inter-observer reliability of computed tomography angiography (CTA) in the screening or diagnosis of cerebral vasospasm (CV) following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Methods: Articles reporting the reliability of CTA up to May 2018 were systematically searched and evaluated. Eleven raters independently graded 17 arterial segments in each of 50 SAH patients for the presence of vasospasm using a 4-category scale. Furthermore, readers were asked: to judge the presence or absence of any moderate/severe vasospasm (≥ 50 % narrowing); whether findings would justify augmentation of medical treatment; and/or DSA with/without angioplasty. Four raters reassessed the same patients in different order at least 4 weeks later. Results: The systematic review revealed that the reliability of CTA had not previously been rigorously assessed. The intra-rater reliability reached a substantial level (k > 0.600) in 3/4 readers for the detection of moderate-severe vasospasm, but inter-rater reliability remained below substantial even when results were stratified according to specialty and experience. There was less than substantial agreement for imaging-based recommendations (medical management or indications to proceed with DSA/angioplasty). Dichotomized per segment results (presence or absence of >50% narrowing) allowed reaching substantial agreement only among senior readers evaluating M1 segments. Excluding cases in which segments were obscured by metal artifacts did not allow additional arterial segments to reach the threshold for substantial agreement. Conclusion: CTA was not sufficiently repeatable among observers diagnosing CV to support a general use in guiding decisions in the clinical management of SAH patients.

404	L'immuno-modulation et l'immuno-suppression chez les grands brûlés	Burns induce an intense inflammatory activation leading to the exhaustion of patients' immune system. In turn, this phenomenon generates an immunosuppressive anti-inflammatory phase that opens the floodgates to nosocomial infections. Our laboratory has already analyzed samples of 25 patients with severe burns and has observed an alteration of monocytes, pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine levels and functions of B cells. We hypothesize that burns lead to the hyperactivation of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) which subsequently generates an immunosuppressive state. We also propose that the inflammatory state of patients is influenced by the microbiome. Our objectives are to evaluate the immunological activation of peripheral leukocytes, APCs in particular; optimize the analysis techniques of blood microbiome and study peripheral bacterial populations in burned patients.  Our in vitro experiments reveal that, in the presence of burned patient serum, monocytes adopt a regulatory profile of inflammation; whereas B cells proliferate less and produce less IgA, IgG and IgM. Monocytes stimulate the proliferation of B cells through cellular interactions but also inhibit antibody secretion. Soluble BAFF concentration in burned patients increases 5 days post-burn and this could establish a link between monocytes and B cell deregulation. Extraction and detection techniques of bacterial DNA from blood and skin have been optimized. The amount of circulating total DNA is modulated post-burn but the amount of bacterial equivalents in the blood of burned patients is unchanged.  It is crucial to obtain a better knowledge on the activation status of the immune cells and their interactions with the microbiome. This will allow the development of novel immune therapy to correct the immune exhaustion present in burn patients.

405	Facteurs métaboliques, nutritionnels, anthropométriques et pulmonaires associés à l’apparition d’anomalies du métabolisme du glucose dans une cohorte d’enfants avec fibrose kystique	Introduction: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the leading cause of mortality among Canadian children and young adults caused by genetic disease. Cystic Fibrosis-Related Diabetes (CFRD) has been identified as one of the most important comorbidities, increasing the risk of mortality by six-fold. Knowledge on the clinical signs related to the onset of glucose tolerance abnormalities, such as CFRD, impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and indeterminate status (INDET) is very limited in the CF pediatric population. Hypothesis: We postulate that some clinical parameters are associated with the occurrence of glucose tolerance abnormalities (IGT/INDET/CFRD) in children and adolescents with CF. Objectives: 1) To document the longitudinal evolution of some clinical parameters from the initial diagnosis of CF to the diagnosis of glucose tolerance abnormalities. 2) To identify clinical markers associated with the occurrence of IGT/INDET/CFRD. Methodology: Retrospective study of medical records of patients followed at the CHU Sainte-Justine CF Clinic between 1983 and 2018. Data were collected from the diagnosis of CF until the onset of glucose tolerance abnormalities (IGT/INDET/CFRD groups) or until the last follow-up visit prior to transfer to adult care (normoglycemic group (NGT)). Results of the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) were used to determine the presence of glucose tolerance abnormalities. The collected variables were metabolic (HbA1c, blood glucose and insulin levels pre and two hours post-OGTT), nutritional (serum retinol (vitamin A), alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E) and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (vitamin D)), anthropometric (weight, height) and pulmonary (first-second forced expiratory volume (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC)). Descriptive statistics, Kaplan-Meier analysis, and Cox regression models were used to compare variables between the IGT/INDET/CFRD groups and the NGT group. Results: Among the 281 included children, 75 were classified as IGT, 28 as INDET, 51 as CFRD and 127 as NGT. No marked differences were observed in the longitudinal evolution of nutritional variables (vitamin A, E and D) and pulmonary variables (FVC and FEV1). However, the trajectories of metabolic variables (HbA1c and glycemia two hours post-OGTT) and anthropometric variables (height and weight Z-scores) differed between the IGT/INDET/CFRD groups and the NGT group. An increase in HbA1c was associated with the occurrence of CFRD (HR 2.406, 95% CI [1.923; 3.010]) and INDET (HR 1.657, 95% CI [1.192; 2.303]), but not IGT. An increase in the Z-score of height decreased the risk of developing CFRD (HR 0.496, 95% CI [0.325; 0.756]). Age at the time of CF diagnosis, sex, exocrine pancreatic status, and CF gene mutations did not influence the occurrence of glucose tolerance abnormalities. Conclusion: Our results suggest that several clinical parameters are associated with the occurrence of glucose tolerance abnormalities. In addition to those currently used to monitor the development of CFRD (weight, height, FVC and FEV1), we found that other parameters are associated with the occurrence of glucose tolerance abnormalities (HbA1c). The identification of clinical precursors may allow early management of CFRD and potentially prevent progression of the disease.	cystic fibrosis , diabetes , weight , height , lung function , vitamins , blood glucose , children	en	22303.0
406	Les pratiques exemplaires en gestion de données de recherche en vue d’établissement de services de gestion de données de recherche en milieu collégial	This report makes recommendations for establishing research data management services in college institutions in Quebec, particularly for libraries of the college network. Like Canadian universities, college institutions in Quebec will need to comply with future research data management (RDM) requirements from Canadian research funding agencies. Furthermore, having good RDM practices provide benefits and reduce different kinds of risks for researchers and institutions. This study calls to explore and take actions about research data management with concerted actions by colleges and college technology transfer centres (CCTT). For example, consultative RDM services could be offered locally in college libraries with support of a college network RDM service according to the principle of subsidiarity. Also, colleges and CCTTs could be studying the possibility to join or implement shared RDM infrastructures (Canadian data repositories or common college institutional data repository). This work emphases the importance to understand and respect particularities (scholarly production, resources and needs) of college network actors in implementing RDM services. To formulate recommendations in this report, a literature review of best practices in RDM, principally in higher education institutions (colleges and universities) around the world has been done. Modes of scholarly productions in colleges in Quebec are substantially different from those of universities in terms of goals, infrastructures and dissemination. Hence, a literature review of modes of scholarly productions in the college educational system is realized. Using Web of Science, a bibliometric analysis of CEGEP and CCTT publications covering the period from 2008 to 2017 is also achieved. This analysis only includes public colleges and CCTTs officially recognized by ministère de l’Éducation et de l’Enseignement supérieur in 2018.

407	Suivi longitudinal de la charge externe de joueurs professionnels de hockey sur glace au cours d’une saison	For a typical team of the American Hockey League (AHL), the season has 76 matches spread over 28 weeks in which teams compete for a place in the playoffs. In addition to matches, players have to participate in on- and off-ice training sessions to maintain/build hockey-specific skills and fitness. The current thesis had the following purposes: (1) to draw a portrait of the physical demands place on the player and to better understand the evolution and changes that have occurred in modern ice hockey (2) to describe the impact of these changes as they relate to the position of the player (3) to detail the different methods of external load monitoring that are used in other sports such as soccer, rugby and Australian football and expose the challenges associated with employing them with a professional ice hockey team (4) to track the external load of a professional hockey team, through the use of accelerometers, to better understand its evolution during the season. Fifty players, who at one time or another were part of an American Hockey League team during the 2017-18 AHL season, participated in a study on external load monitoring. Using accelerometers, data from each training session and matches during the season were collected and analyzed. Results revealed that the intensity and the training load differed according to the position of the player during the matches and the trainings sessions preceding a match. These results raised the importance of carefully monitoring external load although the used of accelerometers seemed to present great potential for individualized monitoring of the player’s external load throughout a hockey season.

408	Phosphoproteomic study on osmotic shock in Saccharomyces cerevisiae over sub-minute and half- hour timescales	Protein phosphorylation is an important cellular regulatory mechanism. Kinases and phosphatases (KP) are vital for the signalling transductions in cells. Signals received by the cell must be transmitted effectively to ensure an appropriate adaptive response is achieved. Monitoring the phosphorylation activity on proteins helps us gain a better understanding to how cells work. In our study we have exposed Saccharomyces cerevisiae to high osmolarity using 0.4M NaCl, and caused a hyper osmotic shock. Protein phosphorylation was measured using a mass spectrometry technique called Stable Isotope Labeling by/with Amino acids in Cell culture (SILAC). This is a quantitative proteomic technique that allows the comparison between cells that are exposed to NaCl and a control group, where cells are not exposed to NaCl. This comparison between the two groups allows us to deduce dynamic regulation of proteins specific to the stimulus applied. We have used a sub-minute and a half-hour timescales to examine the effects of osmotic shock in S. cerevisiae. In this memoir, I have examined the MAPK-Hog1 pathway during the half-hour timescale and have compared it to the sub-minute timescale, which was previously published in Kanshin & Bergeron-Sandoval et al., 2015 [26]. Moreover, the entire data had 161 dynamic phosphopeptide from 100 unique proteins that were present on both timescales. Dynamic phosphopeptides were also compared to another phosphoproteomic study that had used cold/hot stress as a stimulus (Kanshin et al., 2015 [25]). There were remarkable overlaps between osmotic shock and in particular heat stress. This led us to examine the possibility that TORC1&2 involvement in the osmoadaptation process. Furthermore, cells temporarily stop cell cycling during the osmoadaptation process. Consistent with this observation, 68% of the proteins involved in the G1/S transition underwent changes in phosphorylation, perhaps reflecting their regulation, during the first 30 minutes of osmotic shock.  Kinases and phosphatases are known to heavily regulate themselves. A network of  interconnected active KPs revealed Hog1 to be the most connected kinase in the sub-  . This is indicative of how cells adapt to high osmolarity; Hog1 being responsible for the fast sensing and adaptation, and Cdc28 for stopping and regulating the cell cycle. In summary, I have argued that it is possible to extract dynamic phosphopeptides that are stimulus-specific within the half-hour timescale. I have compared dynamic phosphopeptides from the sub-minute timescale to the half-hour timescale and have examined biological processes that play a part in the osmoadaptive process.

409	La nature, le rôle et l’impact du déni et de la minimisation chez les délinquants sexuels au sein des programmes d’intervention	Object: Literature seems to place too much emphasis on denial and minimization in intervention programs by seeking accountability. However, some writers will say that denial and minimization do not need to be worked on to achieve progression and benefits during the program. Denial and minimization being presented as factors of receptivity, the minimal recognition of the acts committed would be necessary, compared to taking of responsibility. The purpose of this work was to illustrate the role, nature and impact of denial and minimization on intervention programs by exploring the experience of adult sex offenders. The importance of intervening on denial and minimization in programs and interventions to be prioritized to increase participants' responsivity was examined.  Method: In order to reach the goal of this studies, case studies were conducted within the framework of an internship in the CETAS. Data collection was conducted through file documentation and semi-structured interviews with three men who were convicted for sexual abuse towards a child. Interpretation of the results: The participants considered denial and minimization of the gravity of the gestures as factors of receptivity. They have put a lot of emphasis on eliminating denial and minimization in intervention programs so that the individual can progress and change. Some argued, however, that the individual may want to change even if he is minimizing the offense.

410	La perception du végétarisme chez les adolescents	"Context. Vegetarianism is a behavior that is gaining popularity among adults in Canada but is poorly studied in adolescents. The consumption of vegetable proteins has shown several benefits on the environment and on multiple health factors. Objectives. The purpose of this study is to examine the perception that Quebec adolescents participating in Culinary Brigades workshops express with other young vegetarians and their general attitudes towards vegetarianism. On the other hand, a codification grid inspired by the literature and enhanced by the answers transmitted by the data corpus is also created. Methods. A qualitative and quantitative approach was selected using a self administered questionnaire which was distributed at two times in the 67 participating schools to the Culinary Brigades either pre- and post-workshop (beginning and end of the year). For the qualitative phase, in the pre-workshop, the young people had to answer the open question ""For me, a vegetarian teenager is ..."". For the post-workshop quantitative phase they were asked whether they agreed (yes) or disagreed (no) with a list of eleven statements on vegetarianism. The project received ethical approval from the Health Research Committee An inductive and deductive method was used to create the coding grid for analyzing qualitative data in the pre-workshop. Using the SPSS software, the quantitative data were analyzed and compared to observe the presence or absence of a statistical relationship. Results. In pre-workshop, the topic of food was the element of answer most mentioned by young people (62.3%, n = 810 elements of answers), followed, in order, motivations (27.9% , n = 363), social norms (21.1%, n = 274), health (17.4%, n = 226), and individual (1.9%, n = 25). The analysis of the response elements found that the perception of vegetarianism was generally good among young people using positive words to describe food, but was not mentioned by most young people (14%). In the post-workshop, young people generally had a positive view of vegetarianism by agreeing to several positive statements about this type of diet, for example, that vegetarian food is good for the environment, that it is not it's good for your health. Conclusion. The study suggests that the perception of vegetarianism among youth in this cohort is generally good. In addition, the answers show that the participants understand several factors related to vegetarianism, including motivations (ethical, environmental, religious ...), the nutritional aspect of this diet and taste."	perceptions , adolescents , adolescence , vegetarianism , vegetarian , perceptions , teenagers , teens , young	en	22185.0
411	Domination éternelle dans les graphes	In this thesis, we study the eternal domination problem in graphs. We consider three different models of the problem, namely the one-guard moves model, the all-guards move model and the fractional model. First of all, we study some fundamental questions related to the relation between the independence number, the eternal domination number and the clique cover number of a graph in the one-guard moves model. Second, we propose a strategy which gives an upper bound of mi/7 + O(m+n) on the eternal domination number of the strong grid Pm ⊠ Pn in the all-guards move model. In the end, inspired by the fundamental results in fractional graph theory, we introduce a fractional analogue of the eternal domination problem.

412	Estimation efficace en présence de non-réponse dans les enquêtes	The efficient use of auxiliary information for estimating descriptive parameters in a finite population in the presence of unit nonresponse has become quite common. This thesis deals with reweighting procedures that involve a change in respondent weight to address unit non-response. A known approach is the propensity score adjustment, which consists of multiplying the base weight by the inverse of the estimated response probability obtained using a response model. In order to improve the efficiency of the propensity score adjusted estimators, we propose a method based on model calibration. This method involves modeling the relationship between survey variables identified as key variables and a vector of auxiliary variables on incorporating the auxiliary information into predicted values obtained by the model, which leads to a single weighting system. The resulting estimator can improve efficiency by making more use of the available auxiliary information. A simulation study evaluates the properties of the estimators in terms of bias and mean square error.

413	Évaluer la réalisation d’une intention avec le Virtual Multitasking Test 3e édition : une étude de validité du construit	Background: Prospective memory (PM) is a complex cognitive process which involves remembering realizing an intention in the future (Ellis, 1996). PM is recognized for its implication on autonomy and safety of the person in everyday life. In several clinical contexts, detecting PM disorders could have a therapeutic utility. Yet, the traditional neuropsychological tests do not represent well enough the complexity of daily tasks. However, virtual reality represents an interesting alternative given its good ecological validity. Virtual Multitasking Test-3 (VMT-3), a three-dimensional apartment, helps to estimate PM thanks to several everyday life tasks. Objective: The objective of this research is to validate the VMT-3 on a theoretical plan by comparing it with two standardized neuropsychological tests that are recognized as being ecological (RBMT-3 and CAMPROMPT). Method: The final sample involves 102 healthy participants, among whom 48 women and 54 men with an average age of 41. We compared the subjects’ performance using traditional tests of PM and episodic memory (EM) as well as the VMT-3. Results: The correlations of this present study found significant links between index of the VMT-3 and index of ME and MP part of the RBMT-3. The CAMPROMPT was only correlated with event-based index of the VMT-3. Conclusion: The VMT-3 proposes valid indications of PM (event-based type). Future research is necessary to continue this validation study. The results’ interpretation suggests that the realization of the VMT-3 is possible thanks to some cognitive functions, among which the PM, the executive functions and the multitasking. We suggest that the VMT-3 should be compared with ecological neuropsychological tests which evaluate multitasking abilities.

414	Les chambres de leucoréduction sont une nouvelle source de cellules pour la génération de lignées de lymphocytes T en immunothérapie	Opportunistic reactivation of latent viruses are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients. The transfer of ex vivo expanded pathogen T-cell lines is an attractive safe and effective strategy to treat virus related complications. The source of T cells can be either from peripheral blood or leukapheresis products of healthy donors. We evaluated the potential of PBMC from leukoreduction system chambers (LRSC) to generate therapeutic T cell products. Blood agencies usually discard LRSC that are used to leukodeplete plateletpheresis blood products which may be used as a source of T cells for manufacturing clinical scale T-cell products. The LRSCs reflect the composition of the peripheral blood except for a transient downregulation of CD62L expression in freshly extracted PBMCs from LRSCs. Non-specific stimulation revealed that LRSC or blood T cells were equivalent in terms of expansion, differentiation and function. Pathogen-specific T-cell lines from memory repertoires harvested from LRSCs and peripheral blood have equivalent proliferation, phenotype and reactivity. Moreover, PBMCs from LRSC can be used to prime and expand virus-specific T cells from seronegative donors. The large number of cells contained in LRSC and the possibility to use serial LRSC from regular platelet donors allows to create a T-cell bank ready to use.

415	Étude de la relation entre les oligomères amyloïde-bêta et la protéine d'adhésion synaptique Neuroligine-1	Synaptic loss and neurodegeneration, partly induced by amyloid-beta oligomers (Aßo), are the best predictors of memory deficits in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). An actual priority in the field is to identify a novel biomarker affected early by Aßo. The post-synaptic protein Neuroligin-1 (NL-1) could be a good candidate due to its roles in synaptic plasticity and memory. The first hypothesis of this study is that the synaptic dysfunctions caused by Aβo could rapidly and gradually affect the level of NL1. NL-1 expression was measured in chronic hippocampal Aβo1-42 injections, in primary hippocampal neuronal cultures exposed to Aβo1-42, and in 3xTg mice. Using 5 sets of probes assessing Nl-1 transcripts, an increase in mRNA levels after 2 days of Aβo1-42 injections was detected for 2 sets of probes, and a decrease in 3 sets of probes expression were measured after 4 days of injections. However, no change in protein level was observed. In vitro, the level of NL-1 decreases after 72 hours of exposure to Aβo1-42, following the decrease in neuron viability. Finally, female 3xTg mice show a decrease in NL-1 at 4 months. In addition, the second hypothesis that the absence of NL-1 will lead to increased toxicity has been confirmed. Aβo1-42 injected NL-1 KO mice performed poorly in spatial object recognition and in the Morris water maze, and had greater neuronal loss than all the other groups tested. This study therefore confirms the close relationship between NL-1 and Aβo1-42, possibly providing a new therapeutic target or biomarker for the development of therapies in the early stages of AD.

416	Étude d’un modèle murin transgénique spontané d’encéphalomyélite auto-immune expérimentale : investigation de l’état de la barrière hémo-encéphalique et des différences liées au sexe	The TCR1640 transgenic mice carry a T cell receptor specific for myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptide 92-106 and develop spontaneous experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). The disease is more prevalent in female mice and most of them develop an EAE with a relapsing-remitting (RR) disease course whereas the majority of the males present a primary progressive (PP)-EAE. This model perfectly reflects disease-related sex differences, heterogeneous disease courses, pathology and immune cell involvement seen in multiple sclerosis. The aim of this project is to study how the pathological burden evolves in spontaneous EAE developed by TCR1640 mice, and to unravel mechanisms behind sex-related difference.  The blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability and integrity of central nervous tissues from TCR1640 mice was investigated at different phases in the disease, using immunohistochemistry. BBB alterations were found in active phases of the disease, accompanied by CD4+ and FOXP3+ T cell infiltration and endothelium activation. The integrity of the BBB seems to be re-established following remission phase. To investigate disease-related sex differences observed in these mice, an adoptive transfer experiment was performed. Immune cells from TCR1640 were injected in WT mice in different combinations of males or females donor and recipient. We found that recipients injected with male cells developed PP-EAE, whereas recipients injected with females cells developed RR-EAE, regardless of the sex of the recipient animal. Moreover, transcriptomic analysis revealed that gene expression differs in immune cells for males versus females TCR1640 suggesting that RR versus PP disease course is dictated by sex-dependent genes encoded by the immune compartment.

417	Statut d’immigrant et tabagisme dans l’étude des inégalités sociales de santé chez les jeunes adultes à Montréal	It is well-established that disadvantaged individuals have poorer health (Marmot, 2005). Smoking behaviors are a major contributor to poor health and eradication of smoking is a cornerstone of strategies to combat inequalities (Marmot 2010). As in other age groups, young adults are subject to social inequalities which can vary according to a variety of characteristics including immigrant status. However, little is known about socioeconomic variation in smoking among young adults and whether or how this varies across subgroups such as immigrants. In this current analysis, we aimed to better understand if level of education interacts with immigrant status to influence smoking behaviors in young adults. We used baseline data from the Interdisciplinary Study of Inequalities in Smoking (ISIS), a transversal investigation of young adults that aimed to study social inequalities in smoking. The sample size for the current analysis was 2,093 young adults (age 21,47 (2,28) years; 56,5% female; 18,80% immigrants). In logistic regression models, we estimated the associations: (i) between immigrant status and smoking status; and (ii) between level of education and smoking status. We then determined whether an interaction term between immigrant status and level of education was statistically significant in the model. The analyses revealed that the interaction term was statistically significant and we therefore undertook a stratified analysis to estimate the association of interest in immigrants and nonimmigrants separately. In non-immigrants, we observed a “dose-response” association such that the prevalence of smoking increased as the level of education decreased. In immigrants, the risk of smoking was similar across education levels. Hence the importance for public health authorities of taking into account the concepts of socio-economic status and immigrant status in defining strategies for tobacco control.	immigrant status , socioeconomic status , smoking , young adults	en	22100.0
418	Systemic sclerosis immunoglobulin induces growth and a pro-fibrotic state in vascular smooth muscle cells through the epidermal growth factor receptor	Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is an autoimmune disease characterized by the presence of autoantibodies, fibrosis and vasculopathy. It has been suggested that autoantibodies in systemic sclerosis may induce the differentiation of cultured fibroblasts into myofibroblasts through platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) activation. The present study aims to characterize the effects of SSc IgG on vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and to determine if stimulatory autoantibodies directed to the PDGFR can be detected, and whether they induce a profibrotic response in primary cultured VSMCs. Cultured VSMCs were exposed to IgG fractions purified from SSc-patient or control sera. VSMC responses were then analyzed for ERK1/2 and Akt phosphorylation, cellular proliferation, protein synthesis, and pro-fibrotic changes in mRNA expression. The capacity of the IgG fractions to immunoprecipitate the PDGFR from VSMC lysates was also tested. Stimulatory activity in IgG fractions was more prevalent and intense in the SSc samples than in the controls (p<0.05), and SSc IgG immunoprecipitated the PDGFR with greater avidity than control IgG. Interestingly, activation of downstream signaling events (Akt, ERK1/2) was independent of PDGFR activity, but required functional epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). We also detected increased protein synthesis (p<0.001) and pro-fibrotic changes in gene expression (Tgfb1 +200%; Tgfb2 -23%; p<0.001) in VSMCs treated with SSc IgG. When compared to control IgG, SSc IgG has a higher stimulation index in VSMCs. Although SSc IgG interact with the PDGFR, the observed remodeling signaling events occur through the EGFR in VSMC. Our data thus favour a model of transactivation of the EGFR by SSc-derived PDGFR autoantibodies and suggest the use of EGFR inhibitors in future target identification studies in the field of SSc.

419	Norms of concept familiarity and emotional valence for 3,596 French nouns and their contribution in lexical decision	In the last decade, research has shown that word processing is influenced by the lexical and semantic features of words. However, norms for a crucial semantic variable-that is, conceptual familiarity-have not been available for a sizeable French database. We thus developed French Canadian conceptual familiarity norms for 3,596 nouns. This enriches Desrochers and Thompson's (2009) database, in which subjective frequency and imageability values are already available for the same words. We collected online data from 313 Canadian French speakers. The full database of conceptual familiarity ratings is freely available at http://lingualab.ca/fr/projets/normes-de-familiarite-conceptuelle . We then demonstrated the utility of these new conceptual familiarity norms by assessing their contribution to lexical decision times. We conducted a stepwise regression model with conceptual familiarity in the last step. This allowed us to assess the independent contribution of conceptual familiarity beyond the contributions of other well-known psycholinguistic variables, such as frequency, imageability, and age of acquisition. The results showed that conceptual familiarity facilitated lexical decision latencies. In sum, these ratings will help researchers select French stimuli for experiments in which conceptual familiarity must be taken into account.

420	"De la déportation à l’expression : 
la femme et le témoignage dans les dessins de 
Violette Rougier-Lecoq et Jeannette L’Herminier"	My analysis of the drawings of the French Resistance fighters Violette Rougier-Lecoq and Jeanette L’Herminier, who were interned at the concentration camp of Ravensbrück between 1943 and 1945, endeavours to move beyond traditional modes of thinking about visual works produced in Nazi detention facilities. I situate these images at the heart of the historic, artistic and testimonial dynamics whence they emerged, enabling me to better understand the formal and stylistic processes by which their makers became artist-witnesses who were capable of interpreting their concentrationary experiences through the works. I analyse both the creation and reception of the drawings. Using a comparative analysis of graphic art linked to the internment of women prisoners, I explore gender issues relating to their captivity. By challenging the iconographic conventions that usually frame interpretations of my corpus, I offer nuanced readings of the sketches that are better able to convey the ways in which these representations of women are significant. Focussing on their narrative dimensions, I suggest the drawings emerge at the intersection of the space of the camp and pictorial space and of the community of imprisoned women and the individual personality of each artist-witness. These themes have so far seldom been discussed in the existing literature. In order to grasp the network of meanings that traverse representations of the women and also to explore the representational constraints they simultaneously embody, I attend to the human and social consequences of captivity upon the inmates. I then consider the roles of perception and of the gestures of the artist in the production of these concentrationary works and the formal qualities that derive from these. Finally, by bringing extratextual knowledge to bear upon them, I provide new readings of the drawings as narrative testimonies.

421	Imaginaires basques et cinéma : trois explorations filmiques	This research-creation project explores Basque imaginary and its expression in cinema. For this purpose, three films will be studied in order to uncover the various facets of this imaginary and its evolutions. The first chapter will focus on a television mini-series directed by Orson Welles, Around the World with Orson Welles (1955), more specifically the first two episodes, shot in the Basque Country. We will observe how Welles utilizes his persona and his knowledge of ‘mise en scène’ in order to mythologize the Basque people and share their culture across the world at a time when said culture is strongly censored in Spain by Franco’s regime. The second chapter proposes a study of Ama Lur (1968) directed by Nestor Basterretxea and Fernando Larruquert, a film whose style represents an attempt to transcribe the Basque language in visual form and was the first Basque feature film produced under the dictatorship. Finally, the last chapter will analyze Julio Medem’s Vacas (1992). It will focus on how Medem employs recurring elements of the Basque imaginary and hijacks them so as to deconstruct them critically.  To conclude, we’ll take a succinct look at the film Euskara ez dut mintzatzen, the creative endeavor accompanying this thesis. We’ll briefly discuss the creative process behind this documentary essay as well as the influence the written, theoretical portion ultimately had on the making of the movie.	basque , mythe , histoire , culture , cinema , Basque , imaginary , myth , history , culture , nationalism , identity	en	22036.0
422	Genre, mémoire et histoire dans le monastère San Salvatore/Santa Giulia à Brescia, VIIIe-IXe siècles	Although the field of memory studies is well-developed in medieval history, the role of gender in the construction of memory is only just beginning to be integrated. This M.A. thesis considers the relationships among gender, memory and history at the monastery of San Salvatore/Santa Giulia in Brescia (ca. 8th and 9th centuries). These three concepts help to expand our understanding of the place memory occupied in the monastery and its historical context, a function reinforced by the primacy of monasteries in the management of memory and the crafting of history within the Carolingian Empire.  The Liber memorialis is the primary source for this study. The document, written from 856, contains lists of names of persons belonging to the prayer community and liturgical texts. It transmits ritual practices related to intercession for the dead as well as the names of people who are part of the abbey’s prayer community. We also seek to understand how the Liber memorialis served as a means to craft representation and the perpetuation of different levels and logics of real and ideal communities: the local and imperial aristocracy, the imperium, and the ecclesia. In this study, we will place the Liber memorialis of Brescia within the wider ideological context of time.

423	"L’amour de soi dans le contexte de la nouvelle créature. 
Une lecture synchronique d’inspiration narrative de Ga 5,1-17 
(et, en partie, de Ga 2,19-21; 5,18-6,10 et 6,15)"	What is « Biblical » self-love? Is it an absolute or a utopia, or is it narcissism, even a sin of selfishness ...? Is it a concept that evolved during the « progression » of the people of God, from alliance (s) to alliance? Can one speak of self-love when we analyze, in its context, the following statement: « [...] love your neighbor as yourself (Lv 19,18) »? This statement is often repeated at the center of several New Testament writings, particularly in the Synoptic Gospels (Mt 19,19 and 22,39; Mk 12,31; Lk 10,27), Paul's letters (Rom 13,9 and Ga 5,14) and the letter of James (2,8). This research is essentially limited to a synchronic reading of verses 5, 1–6, 10 of Galatians. This reading is inspired by a modified Culpepper model, on communication in a narrative, that excludes the real author and the real reader. This reading begins with the conclusion at the end of Galatians: «For what is important, is neither circumcision nor uncircumcision, it is a new creature» (Gal 6,15). The key to interpreting this reading is this            « new creature», a fundamental concept within the whole of the « narrato-preaching ». Paul, an implicit author and a « narrato-preacher », presents many stories (Paul, Jesus, Galatians, Israel ...), often in disorder, to the implicit readers and the « narrato-preached ». The main story exposed is that of the Galatians who, in the initial situation of the quinary plan, seem to be diverted from the one good gospel (1,6) and the truth (5,7) and who, in the final situation, are lead to become a new creature filled with a love of the neighbor and of oneself, thus seeking the good of both (ἀλλήλων: 5,13.15.26 and 6,2). This final situation is characterized by a love in action that the narrato-preacher compares metaphorically to a walk (5,16.25) in the freedom of the Spirit of Jesus Christ and, ideally, to a race without relent (2,2 and 5,7.9). For this final situation to be feasible, a prior denouement must take place. Indeed, the Galatian must, a priori, choose individually what is good for him and, consequently, take advantage of Christ (5,2) by standing up (5,1). Thus, by persuasion (5,8), faith (5,6) and grace (5,4), the former « self » of Galatians must die (2:20) and (re) become a « living » new creature (2.19-20, 5.6.25) filled with the love of Christ, a self-giving love. The denouement and the final situation in Galatians, using concentrism and / or chiasm, presents an obedience to the good gospel in the form of a race in love (in a collectivity, of ourselves and others) preceded by a walk (6,1-10) which is possible after the choice to become a new living « self » (standing-self-giving love), obedient (5, 7) to the truth and diverted from circumcision, law, flesh ...

Interwoven with her own story is the story of Juliette Clermont, the actress herself, who left the theatre in the middle of a play because of a panic attack. Having taken refuge at her sister's house, she tries to come to terms with her past, her father's abandonment of the family and her mother's suicide. Eventually, Ophélie and Juliette will both find a sense of purpose in writing.  Le masque comme figure du double et comme expérience de l'écriture dans le roman Les masques de Gilbert La Rocque is an analysis of the double narration in Gilbert La Rocque's novel Les masques and explores how double narration serves as a mask to represent what is at work within the act of writing.

425	Moïse Moïse ; suivi de Au nom de nous qui ne sommes pas	The narrator of the novel Moïse Moïse, Nathan Mausus, grows up in a torn and superstitious Quebec family where only one figure stands out: Moïse, his older brother. A role model for the narrator and a scholar who contrasts with the rest of the Mausus family, Moïse shines through his absence. At first appearing as the sanest person in the child’s world, Moïse ends up suffering psychotic episodes. After a stay in hospital, he leaves Quebec to study in New York, before embarking on a journey across the globe. After a fifteen-year exile, he returns to Quebec, transformed and radicalized. Moïse Moïse is a novel of personal formation as well as a family portrait but it intends to divert the codes associated with these. It questions family mythology; initiatory rites, poverty associated to the territory, and evaluates porosity between madness and radicalization. Au nom de nous qui ne sommes pas aims to determine the role of identity within the characters radicalization process in the novel L'orangeraie (2013) by Larry Tremblay. To do so, this essay bases itself upon discourse analysis and the appropriation of sociological and philosophical concepts borrowed from Benedict Anderson, René Girard and Paul Ricœur. The first part examines two communities, one real and the other imagined, while the second considers an individual’s value in a society dominated by the collective. The gap between the two communities appears as an essential break-point, from which emerges a legitimization of sacrifice. From this idea, it is possible to understand how family mythology, the process of transmission, the religion instituted in the narrative, individuality and twinship are part of radicalization in Larry Tremblay's novel.

427	Le charme kabbalistique d'Aurélia de Nerval	In the XIXth century, during the romantic period, a vivid curiosity for Kabbalah re appears in the French society. Through his readings as well as through his companions, Gérard  de Nerval is affected by this mystical renewal of interest. We will ask ourself how he and  Aurélia’s narrator were specifically influenced by this tendency. In accordance with his own  sensitivity and preocupations, Nerval brings a very singular perspective on the Kabbalah. For  him, this old literary and esoteric tradition is a way to treat his fears, ambitions and dreams.  Indeed, kabbalistic images and representations are everywhere in Aurélia’s story. All in all, as  we have no intention to draw Nerval into a tradition he does not belong to, we will wonder what  dreaming of Kabbalah can mean. Since language is the main bond between Kabbalah and  Aurélia, our work will be focused on questions of poetics.	Kabbalah , Poetry , Representations , Mysticism	en	21993.0
428	Les marques de modernité dans Les Fridolinades de Gratien Gélinas	This memoir focuses on the signs of Modernity at the end of year reviews Les Fridolinades, presented between 1938 and 1946, as well as in 1956, by Gratien Gélinas. A great number of characteristics of these shows lead us to believe that the theatrical Modernity was present on the Montreal stages as soon as the end of the 1930s. Although the end of year review has not preoccupied very many university researchers, Jean Cleo Godin, Jean-Marc Larrue and Germain Lacasse took interest in the Modernity of such a practice. Their hypothesis’ will first be explored. It is also because of the themes treated by Gélinas in his shows that it is possible to see modern ideas. Indeed, the reviews treat women’s rights, the Catholic church’s discourse, and they parody the popular outdated discourse of the time, all the while staging technology. Gratien Gélinas’s character, Fridolin allows the transformation of the mimesis concept. Instead of the traditional illusion, the playwright creates the participatory illusion. In other words, he lets the audience believe that it influences the creation of the show by interacting with it. Finally, as heteromorphs, Gélinas’ shows are reminders of certain forefront preoccupations.

429	La re-escritura de la historia en Déjame que te cuente de Juanita Gallardo (1997): entre el producto cultural y el discurso identitario	This dissertation proposes an examination of the new historical novel Déjame que te cuente (Juanita Gallardo, 1997) and the relevance of its narrative and discursive strategies. This novel deals, though not exclusively, with the love life of Rosario Puga y Vidaurre with Bernardo O'Higgins, the hero of Chile's Independence. The text describes events which take place between the years 1810-1825 and mixes historiographical facts from the period with fictions. This work treats the location of the corpus in the context of Latin American postmodernity, emphasizing its rearticulation in democratized Chile and the impact that this context had on women's narrative in the Chilean Post-Boom. It then examines the re-writing of history as resource in the construction of a national identity discourse and new national identity constructions. Finally, it studies the representation of femininity in Déjame que te cuente as a significant example of narrative productions by Latin American women of that period, as contrasted with gender representations after 2005. Our working hypothesis at the outset was that Déjame que te cuente is a representative text of Latin American postmodernism because it is presented from a double inscription as consumer good and symbolic good. The conclusions of this investigation permitted confirmation of the initial hypothesis. However, it should also be noted that, on the one hand, the new historical novel as discourse of national identity is not relevant in Chile after 2005. National identities have been replaced by imaginary constructions in which the individual memory predominates. On the other hand, representations about femininity have also evolved: the notion of the extension of sexed and gender categories has left its mark on new imaginary associated with gender representations.

430	L'humour littéraire : le fond tragique dans Zazie dans le métro, Midnight's Children et Crèvematin : étude du mouvement humoristique et de son rapport au tragique dans la littérature	For a long time, humor as a literary device has been neglected in both the academic and critical spheres. However, it is to be found in some major works from beginning to end, and sometimes it even dictates the path of the entire story. But laughter in literary works was first considered a frivolous action, before being relegated to its social functions. Indeed, in literature, humor can convey the most serious aspects of life and shows itself to be a formidable writing tool. It is precisely what I want to explore here, in describing the tragic undertone of three novels of different times and/or cultures. Through those novels, we will see the various types of tragedy that literary humor can mobilize, before coming to articulate what they have in common, the theme underlying them all. A certain schema guides this process in the three works under consideration: a movement which consists in masking humor’s dramatic aspects before exposing them, whether directly or indirectly. In that sense, the most traditional mechanisms of literature are made use of and subverted. In order to establish the study’s analytic framework, it will thus be a question of determining the characteristics of literature’s humoristic action. In attempting to understand the emergence of a chaotic structure necessary for producing the movement that characterizes humor, we will examine its specific temporality in relation to the time allowed in the act of writing. In tracking the will to destroy as a desire to create, we will see how humor undermines the literary illusion as well as how it inhabits language to exploit its possibilities and means of expression that go beyond mimesis. After examining the workings of humor, I will turn to the role of the tragic itself and its interaction with the humor that characterizes these novels. Following this reflection to its conclusion leads to the question of whether tragic humor ultimately cancels itself out. As it unfolds, then, this study comes to examine the intimate relationship between humor and the tragic, how they work together and which of these two poles assumes a greater importance. In this context, this study shows how the comic alters the dramatic that, without disappearing completely, appears in unexpected ways.	comparative literature , humor , tragic , dark humor , language , movement	en	21983.0
432	Police et manifestantes : une étude qualitative sur l'expérience des femmes en action de protestation	Studies on policing protest have identified key variables relative to strategies employed on groups, namely political ideology and identity of protesters. However, empirical data on gender is scarce even if this variable distinguishes women's experiences in other forms of police intervention. The purpose of this study is therefore to understand the experiences of women activists in their interaction with the police in the context of collective actions. In order to assess whether gender influences their relations with the police, nineteen semi-structured interviews were conducted with women activists who experienced numerous conflictual exchanges with the police. The analysis of the interviews has demonstrated that gender is important in the construction of their experience. Gendered interactions took place both at an individual level as well as when police intervened on protest groups. Sexist, paternalistic, machismo and sexualized comments and attitudes shape rapports between individuals, and shed light on the presence of the discretionary power of police officers during crowd management interventions. When trying to understand what motivates the choice of a particular intervention directed towards a militant group, it is difficult to consider gender as a predictive factor. However, it caracterizes part of women’s interactions when gathering around feminist or non-mixt issues. These interactions allow us to argue that the police controls social disorders, but also protects the gendered social order. This brings us to reflect on women's recourse of violence as a form of civil disobedience. Finally, the conflicting interactions have had considerable effects on the mobilization of these activists, leading to the crystallization of certain ideologies and perceptions about the police institution. This study follows a feminist perspective that pursues a broader goal of understanding the gender relations that build women's lives.

433	Détection et caractérisation de nanoparticules d’oxyde de zinc par spectrométrie de masse à plasma inductif en mode particule unique (single-particle ICPMS)	The increased production, use and release of engineered nanomaterials (NM) is concerning considering their possible persistence in the environment and their potential toxic issues. Unfortunately, actual knowledge about their presence in natural media is limited, mainly because of their very low concentrations (ng L-1) and the complex matrices in which they are suspected to be found. Therefore, there is a great need to develop analytical techniques that are sensitive, selective and adapted to those natural matrices. To do so, single-particle inductively coupled plasma (SP-ICPMS) is a very promising analytical technique. Allowing the one by one detection of metallic particles, SP-ICPMS has already been used for the characterization of NM in complex media. However, size detection limits (SDL) are higher for some metallic NM, which are, like the Zn base NM, rapidly dissolved or that have a natural high concentration of the ionic form in the sample. As a result, the use of SP-ICPMS for the detection and characterization of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NP), which is one of the most used in the industry, is a big challenge. To overcome it, an ion-exchange technique was used to remove the Zn2+ and its weakly bonded forms present in solution before their analysis. This technique has successfully been adapted to a highly sensitive ICPMS in order to lower the SDL of ZnO NP, going from 32 to 8.2 nm. To test the setup for a natural media, ZnO NP were spiked and analyzed in river water. After 24 h, particles were found to be more stable in the river water, most probably because of its higher pH. Also, the developed method allowed the analysis of natural zinc and copper containing colloids in river and in rainwaters. Stability of these particles in the rainwater was followed during one month during which the metal mass of the particles on average slightly decreased.

434	Luminogènes-AIE à base de ligands hydroxyamidines : synthèse, caractérisation et application comme pigments pour dispositifs	OLEDs (organic light-emitting diode) are able to transduce electrical energy efficiently into light and because of their flexibility, lightness and high-quality colors, they can also be used in flat-screen display applications. However, the commercialization of this technology is slowed-down by the high cost of the materials and the complex methods that are used for the device fabrication. The purpose of this research is to find low-cost affordable dyes for OLEDs with good energy efficiency characteristics that can be integrated in the device by less complex fabrication methods. In this project, we developed a new series of N,O bidentate benzamidine N-oxide ligands for aggregation-induced emission characteristics (AIE) through complexation. AIE is the non-emissive molecules in solution that luminesce in the solid state. AIE luminigens are a new category of dyes for solid state emission in optoelectronic devices. AIE characteristics can be triggered by the coordination of cationic center, which rigidify the O-N-C=N backbone of the ligand. Coordination chemistry allows the use of ligands and metallic centers as element-blocks for the construction of AIE complexes that have interesting structural and photophysical properties. In addition to this, the tunability of electronic properties and sterics of the complexes with AMOX ligands can be easily obtained by modifying the ligand with the addition of substituents. This would allow to vary the emission color of the dyes. Finally, by using cationic centers from less toxic earth-abundant elements, the production-cost and the environmental impact of this technology can be reduced, thus, opening a door to the commercialization of a sustainable and cost-effective lighting technology.

435	The role of paternal mind‐mindedness in preschoolers' self‐regulated conduct	This study examined the prospective links between paternal mind‐mindedness (MM) and 2 indices of preschoolers' self‐regulated con-duct, namely, inhibitory control and rule‐compatible conduct.Ninety‐two families (47 boys) participated in 2 assessments. PaternalMM was assessed with a 10‐min father–child free‐play session whenchildren were aged 18 months. Children's rule‐compatible conductwas reported by mothers when children reached 3 years of age,and inhibitory control was measured with a Snack Delay task, alsoadministered at 3 years. The results suggested that after accountingfor the contribution of child temperament (social fearfulness),paternal MM was positively related to children's inhibitory control.In contrast, the relation between paternal MM and mother‐reportedrule‐compatible conduct was not significant. The results areinterpreted in light of the mechanisms that may account for the linksbetween paternal MM and preschoolers' emerging capacity tovoluntarily control their behaviour.

436	Évolution des pratiques du sevrage à Montréal (XVIIe – XIXe siècles) : analyse isotopique des concentrations en azote 15 par micro-échantillonnage de la dentine	Weaning is the time when the contribution of breast milk decreases relatively to the child's total diet compared to an increase in other foods. Decisions when to stop breastfeeding may reflect a large variety of socio-economic conditions. For this paleochemical research, we explore the differences and similarities in weaning practices (presence or absence of breastfeeding, age of weaning, post-weaning diet) between two colonial populations, both located on the island of Montreal: Pointe-aux-Trembles (N=17) and Notre-Dame (N=26). These two cemeteries (the first one being rural and the second one urban) provided us the opportunity to compare weaning practices in two different environments. This study was done on individuals that both survived or died during childhood, allowing us to explore the possible effects of stress on weaning (e.g. shortened period of breastfeeding, poor post-weaning diet). The isotopic analysis of nitrogen of dentine micro-samples permitted us to observe the trophic enrichment between an infant and a mother at an individual level. We were able to determine that the weaning process started at around 18-24 months for the two groups. However, Pointe-aux-Trembles’ population weaned their children much earlier (before 12 months) than Notre-Dame’s population (between 18 and 24 months) or did not breastfeed at all. In fact, in the countryside mothers tended to give to their infants post-weaning food during the first months of life. According to historical sources, they were employed as wet nurses to breastfeed children from the city and this could explain these results. We also detected no difference for the age of weaning between sexes, but boys seemed to have consumed more proteins than girls during the post-weaning period. An early weaning (before twelve months), or a complete absence of breastfeeding (N=19) could also reflect variation in weaning practices amongst individuals and/or communities (First Nations) and colonists that peopled the Island of Montreal.

437	« On n’est pas devenus sādhu, on était faits sādhu » : Saṃskāra et espace de légitimité chez les ascètes occidentaux en Inde	This study explores the religious identity of Western ascetics in India. Based on a field investigation, it exposes the transformational aspect of my respondents’ self-image, and later examines the negotiation of this new religious identity through interaction.   I was told by a Western ascetic: “We did not become sādhu, we were made sādhu.” He was referring to his samskāra—the traces of his past lives—as the primary element of his journey. This statement precisely reflects the angle of this study, which asserts the perspective and subjectivity of these individuals through the comprehension of their religious trajectories. I wish to associate the relevance of anthropological tradition, in relation to social and cultural dynamics, to a phenomenological understanding of the religious experience.   Throughout this study, I will aim to understand how my respondents live through and negotiate the reestablishment of their system of meaning (Mary & Piault 1998; 8) by analyzing the individual and collective formation of religious identity. Since it is impossible to completely pinpoint its initial landmarks, the identity transformation of Western ascetics must be understood as an incessant process of hybridization (Bhabha & Rutherford 2006). Affiliated to contradictory beliefs, my respondents are seeking to negotiate and legitimize this hybrid identity through peer interactions. In this respect, the analysis shows that community validation and the quest for recognition are the inherent aspects of the formation of their identity. Bound by inclusion and exclusion, Western ascetics establish self-recognition based on their perception of an “authentic” ascetic. Legitimacy is then created, allowing them to travel through the universe of Hindu asceticism while aspiring to reach mokşa.	samskara , interaction , hindu asceticism , identity negociation , hybridity , phenomenology	en	21902.0
438	Évaluation du lien entre la caudophagie et le microbiote intestinal chez le porc	Tail biting is a behavior problem seen in pigs defined by the act of nibbling of the tail of a penmate. This behavioral disorder represents an important challenge in porcine production because it generates substantial economic losses and affects animal welfare. Some solutions are already in place to minimize this phenomenon, such as enriching the environment or tail docking, but they are either not optimal or present issues for animal welfare. Diet has been shown to have an effect on tail biting and this could be because of changes in the intestinal microbiota. In humans, intestinal microbiota has been shown to modulate behavior. This action would be a part of the so-called brain-intestinal microbiota axis. This study aimed to evaluate the association between tail-biting and intestinal microbiota in pigs. The intestinal microbiota of biter and bitten pigs was compared to a negative control group (non-biter and non-bitten). The different groups of pigs (n=36 in total) were selected at the beginning of the growing/finishing phase by the analysis of a targeted behavior analysis centered on tail-biting (biter group) and a notation grid of damages caused to the tail (bitten group). Composite sample of fecal matter were sampled at the beginning and at the end of a tail-biting episode. Serum cortisol was measured by an ELISA assay.   The V4 segment of the 16S rRNA gene was sequenced in order to study the structure and composition of the IM and quantitative PCR (qPCR) method was used to quantify lactobacilli in the different groups. The beta diversity analysis revealed a significant difference between the intestinal microbiota structure of biter and bitten pigs in comparison to the negative control group in terms of relative abundance of operational taxonomic unit. For the composition, Lactobacillus, compared to other groups, were significantly more associated with the negative control group (p=0.001). Results of qPCR showed higher levels of lactobacilli in this same group. However, no significant differences were found in alfa diversity analysis. Cortisol levels were significantly higher in biter and bitten pigs in comparison to the negative control group (p=0.02, p=0.0076 respectively). This study demonstrates that tail-biting is associated to the IM structure and composition in pigs.	Pigs , Intestinal microbiota , Behavioral disorder , Tail-biting	en	21869.0
439	Role of interleukin-1 in the pathogenesis of the infection caused by Streptococcus suis serotype 2	Streptococcus suis serotype 2 is an important porcine bacterial pathogen and an emerging zoonotic agent causing sudden death (pigs), septic shock (humans), and meningitis (both species), with exacerbated inflammation being a hallmark of the infection. A rapid, effective, and balanced innate immune response against S. suis is critical to control bacterial growth and limit the spread of the pathogen without causing excessive inflammation. Even though interleukin (IL)-1 is regarded as one of the most potent and earliest pro-inflammatory mediators produced, its role in the S. suis pathogenesis has not been studied.  Using a well-standardized mouse model of systemic infection, we showed that an intermediately pathogenic sequence type (ST) 25 North American strain, a highly pathogenic ST1 European strain, and the epidemic ST7 Chinese strain induce high levels of IL-1 in important filter organs such as liver and spleen. Moreover, dendritic cells and macrophages, which are two cell types centrally involved in the S. suis pathogenesis, are important sources of this cytokine, with the ST7 strain secreting the highest levels. The study of the underlying mechanisms involved in this production showed that, independently of the strain, IL-1β production required MyD88 and involved recognition via TLR2 and possibly TLR7 and TLR9. This suggests that recognized bacterial components are similar and conserved between S. suis strains. However, very high levels of the pore-forming toxin suilysin produced by the ST7 strain only, are required for efficient maturation of proIL 1β. Such maturation involved the activation of the NLRP3, NLRP1, AIM2, and NLRC4 inflammasomes via pore formation and ion efflux.  Using IL-1R-/- mice, we demonstrated that IL-1 signaling may play a beneficial role during S. suis systemic infection by modulating the inflammation required to control and clear bacterial burden, thus, promoting host survival. Beyond a certain threshold, however, S. suis-induced inflammation cannot be counter-balanced by this signaling, making it difficult to discriminate its role. A better understanding of the underlying mechanisms involved in the control of inflammation could help to develop control measures for this important porcine and zoonotic agent.

440	Localisation immunohistochimique de l’enzyme 5α-réductase type 1 et 3 dans la peau et la prostate de chiens beagle en santé	The 5α-reductase isoenzymes (5αR) are responsible for the conversion of testosterone into DHT. Recently, we reported the presence of mRNA for 5α-reductases in canine skin. Although we detected mRNA encoding 5αR1 and 5αR3 but not 5αR2, the distribution and localization of 5αR isoenzymes throughout the canine skin and hair follicle are still unknown. The objectives of this study were therefore to demonstrate the specific distribution and localization of 5αR type 1 and 3 isoenzymes in the skin, hair follicle and prostate of healthy beagle dogs by immunohistochemistry. Eight healthy, unrelated and intact young-mature beagle dogs (4 males and 4 females) with no history of skin disease were selected for this study. Skin biopsy samples were obtained from three anatomic sites normally affected by alopecia X (dorsal neck, back of thighs and base of tail) and two sites generally unaffected (dorsal head and ventral thoracic regions). Canine prostate glands (n=3) also collected. In the prostate gland, 5αR1 was present in secretory epithelial cells, basal epithelial cells and blood vessels. On the other hand, 5αR3 was present in basal epithelial cells and blood vessels, but was not detected in secretory epithelial cells. In the skin, 5αR1 was detected in anagen hair follicle at the level of connective tissue sheath, outer and inner root sheath, hair shaft, and dermal papilla. It was also detected in the sebaceous and sweat glands, arrector pili muscles and in vascular endothelial cells. The 5αR3 protein was detected in connective tissue sheath, dermal papilla and vascular endothelial cells of anagen hair follicles. To our knowledge, this is the first study describing the specific localization of 5αR1 and 5αR3 isoenzymes in normal canine skin, hair follicles and prostate of normal healthy beagle dogs.

441	Calcium dynamics and related alterations in pulmonary hypertension associated with heart failure	Congestive heart failure (CHF) represents an important Canadian health problem. Most patients with CHF develop pulmonary hypertension (PH), which is an important marker that signals progression of the disease and its poor outcome. Significant advances have been made for the treatment of heart failure (HF). Nevertheless, the morbidity and mortality among patients with advanced heart HF, who have developed PH remains high. Increased pulmonary vascular pressure (PVP) observed in PH leads to increased vascular tone and vascular remodelling associated with altered vasodilatory responses. It is noteworthy that a decrease in vasodilatory responses has been observed in PH. At the core of vasodilatory alterations lies endothelial dysfunction. This hallmark of most cardiovascular diseases is associated with alterations in calcium (Ca2+) homeostasis. Although global Ca2+ plays a role in a wide range of cellular functions, this thesis work focused on the impact of local Ca2+ signalling in endothelial cells (ECs). Among the different types of local Ca2+ signals, Ca2+ pulsars were identified. Ca2+ pulsars are local endothelial Ca2+ signals whose activity is finely regulated by physiological agents that modulate intracellular levels of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) and Ca2+. Ca2+ pulsars have been shown to have an effect on several important cellular functions. In mesenteric arteries, Ca2+ pulsars induce endotheliuminduced relaxation of vascular smooth muscle cells. Up until now, the regulatory mechanisms of Ca2+ pulsars remain to be uncovered. The spatio-temporal characteristics of Ca2+ pulsars suggest that they could play a role in the control of pulmonary vascular tone, potentially involving more transmembrane ion channels, as well as regulatory proteins. Transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) channels are non-selective mechanosensitive osmo-regulated cation channels broadly expressed in a number of tissues. Activation of TRPV4 channels allows Ca2+ entry into the cell. A number of studies have shown the implication of TRPV4 as well as other channels from the TRP family in PH. Endothelial Ca2+-related pathophysiological mechanisms modulating pulmonary vascular tone and leading to the development of group II PH are poorly defined. In addition, the scarcity of studies exploring the pathophysiology and therapies of group II PH resides in the lack of validated small animal models with an adequate determination of the presence and severity of PH. The work in this thesis identified and characterized for the first time intracellular Ca2+ pulsars in pulmonary endothelium and their alterations in a clinically relevant mouse model of group II PH that was developed. In addition, this work revealed the implication of endothelial TRPV4 channels in Ca2+ pulsars dysregulation in group II-PH.

442	Modélisation, élaboration et évaluation de rapports à visée diagnostique des données du PIRLS 2011	This study uses the cognitive diagnostic approach (CDA) to provide teachers with precise and detailed feedback on the cognitive strengths and weaknesses of students through comprehensible diagnostic reports. It was conducted with the aim of addressing teachers’ pressing need for diagnostic information based on large-scale tests, as well as the lack of empirical research on diagnostic report development and evaluation. More specifically, our study aims to: (1) model data from 4,762 Canadian students who took the 2011 PIRLS test and (2) develop and evaluate diagnostic reports for teachers, using modeling results. In order to attain the first objective, necessary underlying skills to solve the 35 items in PIRLS 2011 were identified based on the PIRLS 2011 development framework and with a panel of three experts. Two templates, Q1 and Q2, were then developed, representing the connexions between these skills and items. With these two “Q” templates, we modeled the data with the DINA and G-DINA models, which enabled us to assess how the models fit the data and to estimate the diagnostic quality of the items as well as the skill mastery profiles of the students.  As for the second objective, a panel of five experts first rephrased the identified skills descriptions in accessible terms for teachers in the classroom. Next, among the skill mastery profiles obtained from the modeling, we chose the profile that was most representative of the students. Then, three report formats were developed based on this standard profile, using the design protocol derived from our literature review. Finally, 98 elementary school teachers, educational consultants and remedial teachers evaluated these reports by means of a survey focusing on report preference, report quality evaluation and report comprehension. The results point to a preferred report format among the participants. This preference is explained by the familiarity of the type of chart presented, and it is constant regardless of contextual information. The participants evaluated the quality of the reports very positively, with no variation according to contextual variables. However, there is a significant difference between report quality evaluation and report preference. Participants who evaluate their preferred format show more positive perceptions. Regarding report comprehension, participants have a very good understanding of all three formats. The group that best understands the reports is the one that made the most positive quality evaluation. The results of the study point to the possibility of receiving, through accessible, reliable, and comprehensible diagnostic reports, more precise and detailed feedback on the strengths and weaknesses shown by students in large-scale tests. Our study is the first to apply a report development and evaluation framework based on a cognitive diagnostic approach, thus helping improve support for reading acquisition in elementary schools.

443	Staufen1 est un régulateur post-transcriptionnel du cycle cellulaire	The cell cycle is crucial for growth, but also for development. This mechanism is so critical that the slightest damage to one of its stages can lead to problems of growth and development, but also to the appearance of anomalies, such as cancers, and ultimately death. As a result, cell proliferation is a finely regulated mechanism, best avoiding possible failures and imbalances.  The regulation mechanisms of the cell cycle transitions are grouped at several levels, and are highly hierarchical and structured: the transcriptional and post-translational regulations are among the most studied aspects to date. Other processes, such as post-transcriptional regulation, are less documented. However, number of discoveries of RNA-binding proteins, which play a key role in the different phases of the division cycle, is increasing since the past decade. Splicing, nuclear export, localization, degradation and translation of mRNAs represent the multiple aspects of post-transcriptional regulation, and amply justify their importance in refining the control of the different phases of the cell cycle.  Staufen1, an RNA-binding protein, is one of the incredible discoveries that have revolutionized our understanding of gene expression regulation, and has helped deepen our understanding of the mechanisms underlying various cellular and physiological processes. The research work undertaken during this thesis has contributed to deepening our knowledge of Staufen1 protein function in the post-transcriptional regulation of the cell cycle and proliferation. We have identified a new mechanism of degradation of STAU1 during mitosis exist, involving the ubiquitin-proteasome system. We have also shown for the first time that STAU1 could inhibit tumor proliferation in colorectal cancer, and our results have been confirmed and extended in later studies. Moreover, the results of our experimental approaches in untransformed cellular models, strongly suggest a positive roleof Staufen1 in promoting the proliferative potential during tumorigenesis. . These results are consistent with a multitude of studies showing the positive role of STAU1 in the regulation of proliferation and its involvement in various types of cancers. However, more comprehensive review of Staufen1 studies suggests a multi-mechanistic model in the various carcinogenic processes, and opens up a future field of investigation to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that support the STAU1 functions associated with cell proliferation and tumor development.

444	Intégration sensorielle chez les individus ayant un trouble du spectre de l’autisme	The ability to integrate information from one or more sensory modalities is essential to perceive the world as unified and coherent. It has been suggested that autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may be associated with difficulties to integrate sensory information from different modalities. However, the empirical evidences remain complex and equivocal. In this context, the purpose of this thesis is to provide a better understanding of the relationship between ASD and sensory integration. The results suggest that ASD is associated with a decrease in the ability to integrate information from different sensory modalities (MSI). Contrary to what was suggested in the literature, this difficulty generalizes to social and non-social stimuli. It also seems specific to MSI, since no deficit was observed for the integration of stimuli coming from the same modality. Moreover, the reduced MSI observed in ASD is not related to atypical attentional shift between modalities, which is similar in both groups. Overall, these results improve knowledge related to sensory integration in individuals with ASD. These demonstrate atypical MSI processes in ASD, and pave the way for future studies that will attempt to clarify the etiology, the neural correlates and, more importantly, the clinical impact associated with these differences in MSI.

445	Urbanisation capitaliste, justice urbaine et démocratie participative : pour une transformation quasi-perfectionniste des institutions municipales	This thesis strives to meet two targets. The first one is to prove that urban spatiality, specifically capitalist urbanization, createsand supportssomesocio-spatial injusticeswhich affect city-dwellers’ political liberty,aspolitical liberty is understood in neo-republican terms. The second targetis to defenda quasi-perfectionisttransformation of municipal institutions,which couldpromote city-dwerllers’diverse and active democratic participation. The first chapter shows that city is a vehicle of socio-spatial injustices, through social violence in public spaces, residential segregation and capitalist exploitation of urban environment (throughgentrification). In the second chapter, I examine four answersto those issues, proposed by political philosophers(Anderson, Young, Turmel and Ferdman). After emphasizing their limits, I draw two conclusions:ontheone hand, urban injustice issues mustbeinterpretedin power relation(domination and alienation) more than in distributive terms; on the other hand, urban politics mustassumea moral perfectionism. Chapter 3 studies HenriLefebvre’s proposal that human beings never stop to inhabit and to undermine those alienating spaces where they live in. I consider that this kind of liberty, which is recovered through spatial practice and which floods the interstices of urbanity, is not sufficient to overthrowbothmunicipalelite’sdomination andcapitalist alienation. Chapter 4 and 5 form the major positive contribution of this thesis. In chapter 4, I demonstrate that social and political domination of urban elites and capitalist exploitation of cities are none other than consequences of structural and institutional weaknesses. In fact, they are the results of a double institutional domination of cities and inhabitants. First, municipal democratic institutions are corrupt by privileged social groups which monopolize political and economical power positions. Second, cities are submitted to superior government stages goodwill (like states or provinces). This double institutional domination leads structurally to promote a capitalist urban development. Yet, the latter does not only reduce social equality between inhabitants, but also their ability to engage and to participate publicly, that means it reduces their civic virtues. I conclude thata quasi-perfectionist transformation of municipal democracy could secure inhabitants effective participation in the controland the public deliberations about urban planning politics, and could secure conditions of equal political liberty. iv   Chapter 5 applies thoselessons given by the later and defendtheinclusion of immigrants in the urban demos, thedecentralization ofpowers and the needto review cities’ legal status, and the arrangementofa participative democracyat the municipal level. I show that participative democracy could fight against corruption, enables demosto take smarterdecisions, and indirectlycultivatesinhabitants’civic virtues.

446	Un combat d'école? : le champ historiographique vu de Québec (1947-1965)	After the shocks of the Depression and the Second World War, the conditions of historical production and representation in Quebec changed in important ways. In the midst of passionate debate concerning Quebec’s “late” accession to “modernity”, a young generation of academic historians offered new interpretations of francophone Quebecers’ existence as a collectivity. The “Quebec Historical School,” whose main members were Marcel Trudel, Fernand Ouellet and Jean Hamelin, took form in this context. In a sustained dispute with their counterparts of the “Montreal School”, these Laval University historians helped shape a fundamental matrix of contemporary Quebec historiography. With its prominent place in scholarly memory and in the Quebec profession’s origin myth, the “Quebec School” has bequeathed a legacy that seems self-evident. Yet those who have studied it employ utilitarian or ideological criteria rather than properly heuristic ones. The very obviousness of the meaning usually attributed to the “school” hides a complexity that this thesis submits to close analysis. What kind of historians were Trudel, Ouellet, and Hamelin? What was the place of their work in Quebec and Canadian historiography? To what influences were they exposed? What “origin narrative” did they endorse? To what extent did they serve a political cause? Placed before the difficulty of speaking of a school in the strong sense of the word (on account, notably, of the diversity of the members’ work, the absence among them of a strongly articulated intellectual doctrine, and the presence of two generations and three individual trajectories), the thesis seeks to identify common strains of thought within the group and to assess its contribution to reshaping post-war Quebec historiography. It argues that the three Laval historians’ defining characteristic was to have formed not a school of thought but a “school of activity” (Gilmore) organized around a similar conception of practices and historical method rather than an orthodoxy or a unified and coherent explicative model. Of course, this disposition did not prevent the three historians from acknowledging a kind of “family resemblance” and from tending toward a common interpretative horizon. Combining the approaches of historiography and intellectual history, this study follows three major contributors to Quebec historiography whose paths both converged and diverged as they responded to the challenges of their intellectual, institutional and political worlds. To this end, the thesis takes a close look at the intellectual environment at Laval, the group’s national and international networks, and its contacts with post-war antinational, liberal and federalist thought. Through the prism of the “Quebec school”, this study affords a view of the changing relations between historical knowledge and culture in mid-twentieth-century Quebec.

447	La frontière et les ombres : les clandestins afghans de Peshawar, Pakistan	A four-decades long, perpetually mutating war, has forced millions of Afghan people into exile. These now constitute the world’s second largest and most enduring refugee population. Divided for the most part between Iran and Pakistan, corresponding roughly to the varied ethnic, linguistic and religious affiliations that make up Afghan society, these refugees are increasingly confronted to rejection from the states that had hitherto welcomed them. The situation of Afghan refugees represents a point of convergence between a multiplicity of phenomena – local and global, political and social, economic and cultural – that make it a unique standpoint from which to think about our times. It marks something like the visible imprint of an unraveling of the biopolitical dispositive1, of its very paradigm even, as it is unfolding at the postcolonial Frontier. It is a moment which also appears as a sort of “crisis of the postcolonial subject”. One torn between its “tribal”, religious and juridical selves. What such crisis lays bare however is just how such an overlap of competing modes of subjectivation may open a breach, allowing for the subversion of their very controlling and exclusionary purposes. This ethnography focuses more specifically on the Pashtun, undocumented Afghan refugees living in Peshawar, Pakistan. It examines the diverse strategies they deploy in negotiating a living space, in spite of being officially unallowed in the country – how they manage their best to live (almost) normal lives. Throughout this work, as if an extension of the indetermination and ambiguity that characterises the situation of these refugees, this ethnography is confronted also with the epistemological question concerning the possibility or impossibility of an anthropology of troubled times.

448	L’art de bâtir à Río Bec (Campeche, Mexique)	Since their discovery, at the end of the 19th century, the architectural remains of the Río Bec region (Campeche, Mexico) have been repeatedly observed, described and interpreted. However, despite all the attention they have received, little research has been done and published concerning their construction. Archaeological reports and publications sometimes devote a few lines to this topic, but almost all of these have focused primarily on formal and decorative features, with the main objective of defining stylistically and chronologically the architectural tradition to which they belong. The present study aims to approach the Rio Bec architecture in a different way by exploring its technological dimension. Through the analysis of the quarries found at the eponymous site, the thorough examination of the architectural remains situated in their surroundings, and the petrographic characterization of the surviving building materials, this study attempts to reconstruct the chaîne opératoire employed by the builders. It offers a presentation of the means and methods used in each stage of this chain, from the selection and acquisition of the raw materials to the completion and inauguration of the buildings, including the processing and shaping of the materials, as well as the conception, execution and evolution of each component of the buildings. Such an approach provides fresh insights not only into this unique architecture, but also into the organization of construction activities and labor in this part of the Maya lowlands.

449	Définir la qualité de vie des aînés vivant à domicile avec des incapacités : enjeux éthiques émergeant des politiques de santé publique et des services à domicile au Québec	The Quebec government uses the notion of “quality of life” in its public health policies, particularly that of 2003 (Chez soi: le premier choice) and 2012 (Vieillir et vivre ensemble, chez soi, dans sa communauté, au Québec), in order to affirm its commitment to provide quality home care services to seniors, and thus enable them to live and grow old at home, with dignity. The state uses the concept of “quality of life” as a pesuasive argument, but without clarifying its meaning. Without a definition, this concept contributes to the implementation of policies and procedures that, in the end, do not meet the commitment originally made by the state.  To help respond to this lack of definition, a qualitative study was conducted involving thirty-five people aged 65 to 95, living at home with disabilities. Through semi-structured interviews, participants expressed their understanding of the meaning of “quality of life” and defined it with eight groups of recurrent keywords: 1) Autonomy, Health; 2) Social relationships, caring; 3) To be well surrounded: family, friends; 4) Adaptation, Acceptance, Known Limits; 5) Means: Services, Money; 6) Home; 7) Love, Happiness, Spirituality; and 8) Security. In connection with Amartya Sen’s capabilities approach, more than half of the participants confirmed that they had “freedom of achievement”. By contrast, more than a quarter of older people said they did not have this freedom. Others participants qualified their quality of life with conditions, including “what is needed”, “health”, “sufficient financial resources” and “feel useful”. The results of these interviews were compared with those of two other qualitative studies conducted in Great Britain and France, which used the same five general questions to define the quality of life of seniors. The terms used by the participants in the three countries match, showing that seniors’ concerns and priorities are similar despite different geographical locations. This study can arguably help those decision-makers responsible for implementing policies (e.g., home-based services) to accomplish their task of ensuring the quality of life of older persons, by understanding the real needs of the elderly. However, there was a significant discrepancy between the 2003 and 2012 Quebec policies on home care services and the reality experienced by seniors. The reports of the Québec Ombudsman, the Auditor General of Quebec, the Health Council of Canada and the results of studies by many researchers show that home care services are not deployed as promised by the policies. Poor elderly people who cannot compensate for services not provided by the state, have inequitable access to services and live in situations of vulnerability, which can even lead to early institutionalization.  Every senior living at home with a disability has the right to a dignified life, regardless of their financial situation. Ensuring quality of life is a shared responsibility of all actors in society, including community organizations, the entourage of the elderly person and seniors themselves. However, each of these actors must assume a share of responsibility proportional to their power of action. Since the state has the capacity to assume responsibilities and achieve goals far superior to any other organization or family, it has a concomitant population-level responsibility to serve all citizens.	quality of life , seniors , home , disabilities , ethics , aging , ageing , shared responsibility , autonomy , equity , social justice , capabilities	en	21681.0
450	Article processing charge hyperinflation and price insensitivity : an open access sequel to the serials crisis	Open access publishing has frequently been proposed as a solution to the serials crisis, which involved unsustainable budgetary pressures on libraries due to hyperinflation of subscription costs. The majority of open access articles are published in a minority of journals that levy article processing charges (APCs) paid by authors or their institutions upon acceptance. Increases in APCs are proceeding at a rate three times that which would be expected if APCs were indexed according to inflation. As increasingly ambitious funder mandates are proposed, such as Plan S, it is important to evaluate whether authors show signs of price sensitivity in journal selection by avoiding journals that introduce or increase their APCs. Examining journals that introduced an APC 4–5 years after launch or when flipping from a subscription model to immediate open access model showed no evidence that APC introduction reduced article volumes. Multilevel modelling of APC sensitivity across 319 journals published by the four largest APC-funded dedicated commercial open access publishers (BMC, Frontiers, MDPI, and Hindawi) revealed that from 2012 to 2018 higher APCs were actually associated with increased article volumes. These findings indicate that APC hyperinflation is not suppressed through market competition and author choice. Instead, demand for scholarly journal publications may be more similar to demand for necessities, or even prestige goods, which will support APC hyperinflation to the detriment of researchers, institutions, and funders.

451	Lessons learned from blind individuals on videodescription	Audio-visual contents are made accessible to blind individuals with added videodeseription (VD) that translate the visual information into auditory information. We interviewed ten legally blind individuals (with and without residual vision) to monitor the quantity and frequency of infonnation needed in YD. It was found that residual vision and the complexity of the content have a significant impact of the level of VD needed. This suggests that a tool for the dissemination of VD must provide a basic level of information and also offer enough flexibility to confirm some information on demand.

452	Sleep in the acute phase of severe traumatic brain injury : a snapshot of polysomnography	Background and Objectives. The onset of pervasive sleep-wake disturbances associated with traumatic brain injury (TBI) is poorly understood. This study aimed to (a) determine the feasibility of using polysomnography in patients in the acute, hospitalized stage of severe TBI and (b) explore sleep quality and sleep architecture during this stage of recovery, compared to patients with other traumatic injuries. Methods. A cross-sectional case-control design was used. We examined the sleep of 7 patients with severe TBI (17-47 years; 20.3 ± 15.0 days postinjury) and 6 patients with orthopedic and/or spinal cord injuries (OSCI; 19-58 years; 16.9 ± 4.9 days postinjury). One night of ambulatory polysomnography was performed at bedside. Results. Compared to OSCI patients, TBI patients showed a significantly longer duration of nocturnal sleep and earlier nighttime sleep onset. Sleep efficiency was low and comparable in both groups. All sleep stages were observed in both groups with normal proportions according to age. Conclusion. Patients in the acute stage of severe TBI exhibit increased sleep duration and earlier sleep onset, suggesting that the injured brain enhances sleep need and/or decreases the ability to maintain wakefulness. As poor sleep efficiency could compromise brain recovery, further studies should investigate whether strategies known to optimize sleep in healthy individuals are efficacious in acute TBI. While there are several inherent challenges, polysomnography is a useful means of examining sleep in the early stage of recovery in patients with severe TBI.

453	Le grand frère : coaching, adolescence et lien de confiance	"The main objective of this research is to explore the role of the trust bond in the relationship between coaches and players in a men's soccer team at a Quebec high school. Our theoretical framework comes from the constructivist paradigm, the theories retained are symbolic interactionism and ethnomethodology. Data collection was done through a participant observation phase followed by 9 semi-structured interviews. The grounded theory was used to analyze the interviews. This research indicates that the trust bond is established between two actors through a construction process. The analysis allows us to identify 7 roles the coach plays with his players that allow him to establish a relationship of trust with them : the model, the initiator, the coach, the friend, the protector, the helper and the source of love. As a big brother, the coach guides his players through the hassle of life in both sportive and extra sportive elements. Using the trust bond, the coach appears as an individual able to intervene with these young men who form a so-called ""difficult"" population to reach by the social services."

454	Accumulation et translocation de cinq éléments traces dans la biomasse aérienne de végétaux d’intérêt  dans un contexte de phytoremédiation	Ecological services provided by nature has led to the flourishment of greening initiatives in urban areas as a means to sustainable development and for the reclamation of devalued polluted sectors in terms of environmental, social and economic perspectives.  One impediment associated with such greening initiatives on polluted sites is the resulting contamination of aboveground plant material by trace elements.  My research project consisted of a trial of fifteen species selected for their urban predominance, ecological relevance, edibility, prospective commercial use and phytoremediation potential. Species were grown for 15 weeks in a tunnel greenhouse, in pots filled with contaminated technosol containing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons as well as Cu, Zn, Se and Ag. The soil was also spiked with Cd as a model of highly hazardous and mobile trace elements. The prime objective was to quantify the accumulation of trace elements in the aboveground biomass in terms of relative concentration as well as true extracted quantities (phytoextraction). The second objective of the project was to determine translocation patterns within aboveground tissues: stem, leave and reproductive organs (flowers or fruits).  Within the trial, some species were selected for their potential hyperaccumulation of Se (mustard) and Cd (wonder-berry and common yarrow). Our results indicated that accumulation and translocation patterns differed greatly according to species and trace elements. The potential hyperaccumulator species morel and yarrow as well as mustard stood out from other by their potential to accumulate Cd and Se respectively. Exclusion mechanisms were observed for Cd translocation within reproductive organs for all species that produced fruits or flowers, however all edible parts were above standard recommendations in terms of Cd concentration. Regarding these results, soil characterization and contamination should be an essential preliminary step before any greening initiative can take place, in order to select the appropriate species.	translocation , technosol , zinc , greening , phytoremediation , trace element , copper , zinc , silver	en	21607.0
455	Les cognitions soutenant la cyberdélinquance sexuelle commise envers les enfants : leur nature, leur mesure et leur rôle	Scientific research on contact sexual offenders against children has highlighted the importance of cognitive factors in relation to sexual offending and sexual recidivism (e.g., Helmus, Hanson, Babchishin, & Mann, 2013). Early research focused on identifying the cognitive products, also called cognitive distortions, of individuals who sexually offend against children, and developing psychometric instruments for their measure (e.g., the MOLEST scale; Bumby, 1996). More recently, efforts have focused on developing a better understanding of the cognitive structures, (i.e., cognitive schemas also called implicit theories) that appear to represent the offenders’ deep beliefs about the world and their victims. This knowledge, however, was developed for offenders who engage in contact sexual offending and the research on the cognitions of individuals who engage in online sexual offending remains very limited. While preliminary results suggest that online sexual offenders possess offense-supportive cognitive structures that are different from those of contact sexual offenders (Bartels & Merdian, 2016), much work remains to better understand this phenomenon. The overarching goal of this thesis was to improve our understanding of the offense-supportive cognitions of online sexual offenders. This thesis presents the results of three separate but complementary studies that shed light on the nature, measure and role of cognitions that support online offending. First, from a sample of sixty police interrogations of online sexual offenders, a thematic discourse analysis identified eight implicit theories shared by child sexual exploitation material users and child luring offenders: 1) Nature of Harm; 2) Uncontrollability; 3) Child as Sexual Being; 4) Entitlement; 5) Dangerous World; 6) Child as Partner; 7) Virtual is not Real and; 8) Internet is Uncontrollable. The results of this analysis served as the basis for the development, following Classical Test Theory and Item Response Theory, of the Cognitions on Internet Sexual Offending scale (C-ISO) which was validated with an independent sample of 241 individuals who had been convicted for online sexual, contact sexual, or non-sexual offenses. The analyses revealed that the scale possesses excellent psychometric properties, includes a wide range of items that represent a continuum of difficulty and that successfully discriminate between offenders’ groups. The third study examined the association of these cognitions, combined with atypical sexuality, problematic self-regulation and perceived anonymity, with online sexual offending against children. Results revealed that cognitions supporting online sexual behaviour are specifically associated with the commission of online sexual offending against children, while cognitions supporting the sexual abuse of children are associated with the commission of contact sexual offending. In addition, results indicate that cognitions moderate the relationship between sexual preoccupation online sexual offending behaviors for men highly preoccupied by sexuality.  The results from this doctoral research have several research and clinical implications. First, this thesis contributes to the development of knowledge regarding the nature of cognitions by identifying the cognitive structures of online sexual offenders associated with the consumption of child sexual exploitation material and the luring of children online. Furthermore, it provided the first psychometric tool specifically validated for the measurement of cognitions supporting online sexual offending, which will allow measuring changes in a therapeutic context. Finally, the improved understanding of the cognitions that support online sexual offending will contribute to the elaboration of better clinical targets in the treatment of men who have engaged in the sexual exploitation of children on the internet.	cognitions soutenant le crime , offense-supportive cognitions , online sexual offenders , implicit theories , cognitive structures , internet sexual offending , psychometric measure , Classical Test Theory , Item Response Theory	en	21602.0
456	"The Effect of Collective Psychology on the Mistreatment of Nineteenth-Century Women in Charlotte Brontë's Jane Eyre and Charlotte Perkins Gilman's ""The Yellow Wallpaper"""	Collective psychology, at its core, is the study of the ways in which individuals act in group settings. An overview of various works written in the field of collective psychology brings forth an understanding of this phenomenon and how the behavior which ensues from its presence in a group or crowd can lead to devastating results. This thesis demonstrates how collective psychology was a primary cause for the mistreatment of women in the nineteenth century. This phenomenon is utilized as the basis for an analysis of literary works written by nineteenth-century women. More specifically, this study observes the influence of a patriarchal society on the behavior of individuals within society, as well as within their homes. This thesis explores literary examples that feature women who undergo various types of mistreatment based on the effects of collective psychology. I will consider Charlotte Brontë’s Jane Eyre and Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s “The Yellow Wallpaper” to demonstrate the important patterns of mistreatment which emerge due to the complex phenomenon of collective psychology. This analysis will demonstrate how the female characters from these works endure mistreatment by those closest to them because of the insidious presence of this phenomenon in their lives.

457	"Le tatouage contemporain : vecteur d’identité 
ou artefact de consommation?"	The aim of this dissertation is to uncover the motivations by which individuals have decided to permanently mark their bodies with particular motives capable of defining their identity in the same way as their individuality. These reasons, however, are subject to inflections of trends and modes conveyed in the media. In the last 20 years, tattoo has gone subtly from a brand of rebellion and originality to a standardized brand associated with youth and fashion. In this thesis, we have tried, by interviewing a dozen people from various backgrounds and having lived this mutation, to understand the reasons for having these tattoos as well as the changes of perception on the phenomenon. Thus, based on various theories including the Goffmanian theory of self-staging, David Le Breton's theory of identity-making and Bauman's vision of consumerism, we can partially explain the phenomenon.

458	La cornemuse bulgare ou comment inventer une tradition musicale	The music tradition of the Bulgarian bagpipe gaida established itself as a Bulgarian tradition in the dawn of Bulgarian nationalism in the 1860s, continued its development as such after the Liberation from Ottoman domination (1878), during the XX century, and even now at the beginning of XX century.       We interested here how this music tradition had entered the Bulgarian national imaginaire by the means of the satirical press, the international fairs, the fine arts, the literature, the cinema, and the folklore festivals in order to become such a powerful sumbol of the nation.

459	Traitement de troisième vague pour les personnes atteintes d’un trouble psychotique et d’anxiété sociale : influence de la pratique quotidienne de la pleine conscience	There is evidence suggesting the acceptability and feasibility of mindfulness-based intervention for people with psychosis but little is known regarding the daily integration and use of these strategies. This study aims to explore participants’ experience of daily mindfulness practice and to investigate the influence of practice level on the intervention’s efficacy. More particularly, quantitative and qualitative data were collected from six participants who completed an eight weeks compassion, acceptation and mindfulness individual therapy. The participants provided daily practice diaries, and, on a weekly basis, filled-out emotional regulation, experiential avoidance and mindfulness questionnaires. They also attended a semi-structured interview at the end of the therapy. The results suggest the acceptability and feasibility of the intervention and a certain influence of practice level on the outcomes. Even if not statistically significant, the association between practice level and emotional regulation and experiential avoidance are clinically significant. Also, data suggest that the issues and needs inherent to the daily practice of mindfulness were specific to each participant. It brings light the importance for the therapist to be flexible in the delivery of mindfulness abilities and the necessity to adapt treatment protocols to each participant.

460	Towards an integrated understanding of aggression in the general population : findings from an epidemiological catchment area study	The goal of this study is to identify patterns of various forms of aggression in the general population and their psychosocial and environmental correlates. Data from the Montreal Epidemiological Catchment Area study (N = 1855) were analyzed using latent class analysis and multinomial logistic regression. Four classes were identified: a ‘Low Aggression’ profile (91.4%) – individuals were older, more likely to be women, and had greater quality of life – and three profiles with individuals displaying aggression. The ‘Acting out’ profile (4.3%) reported property and mild verbal aggression, and profile membership was associated with impulsivity. The ‘Violent’ profile (2.0%) reported severe verbal aggression and physical aggression, and membership was associated with posttraumatic stress disorder and substance use disorders. Finally, the ‘Self-injuring’ profile (2.2%) reported self-harming behaviors along with mild verbal aggression and property destruction and were psychologically distressed. Findings are consistent with the risk factors in violence risk assessment instruments. They also shed light on how different types of aggression are interrelated and may help in the development of a psychological formulation of individuals for whom different types of aggression co-occur so that integrated prevention strategies may be put in place.

461	Regional cerebral blood flow during wakeful rest in older subjects with mild to severe obstructive sleep apnea	Objectives: To evaluate changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) during wakeful rest in older subjects with mild to severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and healthy controls, and to identify markers of OSA severity that predict altered rCBF. Design: High-resolution 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT images during wakeful rest. Setting: Research sleep laboratory affiliated with a University hospital. Participants: Fifty untreated OSA patients aged between 55 and 85 years divided into mild, moderate and severe OSA and 20 age-matched healthy controls. Interventions: N/A Measurements: Using statistical parametrical mapping, rCBF was compared between groups and correlated with clinical, respiratory and sleep variables. Results: Whereas no rCBF change was observed in mild and moderate groups, participants with severe OSA had reduced rCBF compared to controls in the left parietal lobules, precentral gyrus, bilateral postcentral gyri, and right precuneus. Reduced rCBF in these regions and in areas of the bilateral frontal and left temporal cortex was associated with more hypopneas, snoring, hypoxemia, and sleepiness. Higher apnea, micro-arousal, and body mass indexes were correlated to increased rCBF in the basal ganglia, insula, and limbic system. Conclusions: While older individuals with severe OSA had hypoperfusions in the sensorimotor and parietal areas, respiratory variables and subjective sleepiness were correlated with extended regions of hypoperfusion in the lateral cortex. Interestingly, OSA severity, sleep fragmentation and obesity correlated with increased perfusion in subcortical and medial cortical regions. Anomalies with such a distribution could result in cognitive deficits and reflect impaired vascular regulation, altered neuronal integrity, and/or undergoing neurodegenerative processes.

463	Kants Dritte Kritik und die Genese des Badischen Neukantianismus	I argue here that the relationship of the neo-Kantian School of Baden to Kant’s philosophy passes through the mediation of Hermann Lotze. If, for instance, the neo-Kantian theory of values sees in “feeling” the criterion of the recognition of values, and if this recognition, of beauty in the first place, imposes itself upon the individual subject as some sort of “ought” (Sollen), these two elements, typical of Kant’s aesthetic judgment, have been taken over and to a large extent transformed in the writings of Lotze, who was, as wee might recall, the teacher of Windelband. And besides, the dogmatic approach to teleology that we find in Lotze was to have far-reaching consequences for the Baden School, namely with regard to its interest for history as the ideal ground for the progressive realization of values.

464	"Automated external defibrillator geolocalization with a mobile application, verbal assistance or no assistance : a pilot randomized
simulation (AED G-MAP)"	Background: Shockable rythms are common among victims of witnessed public out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), but bystander defibrillation with a public automated external defibrillator (PAED) is rare. Instructions from the emergency medical dispatcher and mobile applications were developed to expedite the localization of PAEDs, but their effectiveness has not been compared. Methods: Participants were enrolled in a three-armed randomized simulation where they witnessed a simulated OHCA on a university campus, were instructed to locate a PAED and provide defibrillation. Participants were stratified and randomized to: (1) no assistance in finding the PAED, (2) assistance from a geolocalization mobile application (AED-Quebec), or (3) verbal assistance. Data collectors tracked each participant’s time elapsed and distance traveled to shock. Results: Of the 52 volunteers participating in the study (46% male, mean age 37), 17 were randomized to the no assistance group, 18 to the mobile application group and 17 to the verbal group. Median (IQR) time to shock was respectively 10:00 min (7:49-10:00), 9:44 (6:30-10:00), and 5:23 (4:11-9:08), with statistically significant differences between the verbal group and the other groups (p≤0.01). The success rate for defibrillation in <10 minutes was 35%, 56% and 76%. Multivariate regression of all participants pooled showed that knowledge of campus geography was the strongest predictor of shock in < 10 minutes (aOR = 14.3, 95% CI: 1.85-99.9). Among participants without prior geographical knowledge, verbal assistance provided a trend towards decreased time to shock, but the differences over no assistance (7:28 vs 10:00, p=0.10) and over the mobile app (7:28 vs 10:00, p=0.11) were not statistically significant. Conclusion: In a simulated environment, verbally providing OHCA bystanders with the nearest public AED’s location appeared to be effective in reducing the time to defibrillation in comparison to no assistance and to an AED geolocalizing mobile app, but further research is required to confirm this hypothesis, ascertain the external validity of these results and evaluate the real-life implications of these strategies.

465	Lien entre l’agression sexuelle durant l’enfance et le développement de maladies infectieuses non transmises sexuellement	Child sexual abuse is a prevalent worldwide problem and is associated with numerous psychological consequences, including anxiety, depression, post-traumatique stress disorder and suicide ideation both in childhood and adulthood. With respect to physical health, in adulthood, child sexual abuse is associated with increased gastrointestinal symptoms, gynecological symptoms, cardio-respiratory symptoms, pain and obesity. However, few studies have documented the specific repercussions of child sexual abuse on the physical health of children and adolescents. In youth, child maltreatment, which includes child sexual abuse, is associated to more asthma, migraines, somatic complaints and increased hospitalisations for various physical health problems. The association between childhood adversity and various chronic diseases is only partially explained by at-risk behaviors (eg., smoking and physical inactivity), and therefore, it has been postulated that childhood adversity can lead to a dysregulation of the immune and endocrine systems, which would then lead to chronic inflammation, and therefore, to physical health problems. The main objective of this doctoral essay was to determine if there is an association between child sexual abuse and the development of infectious diseases in children and adolescents, which could be an early clinical manifestation of the dysregulation of the immune and endocrine systems. Of the 955 eligible children and adolescents who had a substantiated report of sexual abuse between January 1st 2001 and Décember 31st 2010, medical data was retrieved for 882 individuals, who formed the sexually abused group. These 882 children and adolescents were matched to 882 participants on age, gender, and administrative healthcare region to form the general population group. This matched-cohort study compared the number of infectious disease diagnoses between the two groups between the date of the substantiated sexual abuse report and August 1st 2013. Results indicate that sexually abused participants had 1.27 times more (95% CI – 1.13 to 1.42; p < 0.001) infectious diseases diagnoses than those from the general population. They received 1.83 times more genitourinary infections diagnoses (95% CI – 1.43 to 2.33; p < 0.001), 1.31 times more diagnoses for other types of infections (95% CI – 1.11 to 1.55; p = 0.002) and 1.21 times more respiratory and ear infection diagnoses (95% CI – 1.05 to 1.40; p = 0.007). There was no statistically significant difference regarding skin infection diagnoses. These results indicate an association between CSA and more frequent diagnoses for all types of infections, genitourinary infections, respiratory and ear infections and other types of infections but not for skin infections. Preventative measures and interventions should be implemented for sexually abused youth who have infections.

466	Der Phänomenologiebegriff bei Kant und Reinhold	In this paper I study the sources of Reinhold’s concept of phenomenology introduced in his Beyträge zur leichteren Übersicht des Zustandes der Philosophie… of 1802. Kant renounces to take up Lambert’s definition of phenomenology, which amounts to a theory of illusion (Schein). At the time of the Dissertation (1770) as well as in the Metaphysische Anfangsgründe der Naturwissenschaft (1786) he prefers to define phenomenology as a doctrine of appearances (Erscheinungen). Reinhold for his part integrates both definitions in his conception of phenomenology and assigns to it the task of tracing how illusion operates through the world appearances.

Its signaling is transduce through two 7 transmembrane receptors, CXCR4 and ACKR3. CXCR4 controls migration cues and cellular attachment by a G-protein-dependant signaling pathway. The second receptor, ACKR3, promotes CXCL12 degradation through a G-proteinindependent, arrestin-dependant pathway. The latter leads to the generation and maintenance of a sharp CXCL12 gradient, promoting directional cell migration. Because of its involvement in a range of pathological processes including, but not restricted to, HIV entry and metastatic dissemination of cancers, CXCR4 is an attractive pharmacological target. Over the past two decades, several antagonists targeting it were synthetized. Despite the low sequence homology between CXCR4 and ACKR3, two of these antagonists, AMD3100 and TC14012, were shown to act as agonists on ACKR3. The causes of this reverse effect on CXCR4 and ACKR3 are not known. Thus, in the first article of this thesis, we used ACKR3 substitution mutants and molecular modeling based on the CXCR4 crystal bound to CVX15 (a TC14012 derivative) to determine the binding mode of TC10412 on ACKR3. The cumulative results of functional assays and molecular dynamics simulations allowed the identification of key determinants in the interaction between ACKR3 and TC14012. These results provide essential information for the future development of more specific ligands targeting one of these receptors. B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) is the most common pædiatric neoplasia. While the 5-year event-free survival exceeds 85%, more than 25% of these “cured” children will suffer potentially life-threatening sequelæ due to overtreatment. A more precise stratification strategy of the individual risk of relapse is required to allow an accurate personalised therapy reduction or intensification. It has recently been shown that the survival of patient-derived xenografted (PDX) mice correlates with the individual risk of relapse in children with B-ALL. Thus, in the VI second section of this thesis, we report for the first time a method to identify new risk markers using B-ALL PDX mice model. The model was first validated using known prognostic markers for pædiatric B-ALL (t(12;21), hyperdiploid (HD) and CD20). We then demonstrated that the combined use of markers (CXCR4high ACKR3low, nont( 12;21) and non-HD) predicts with great sensitivity a short survival of PDX mice. The key parameters highlighted in this study will now have to be validated in a prospective or retrospective study. The latter would test the association of our combined parameters with the individual clinical outcome of B-ALL children to validate our PDX results. Our algorithm may eventually lead to a more accurate individual risk stratification of pædiatric B-ALL patients thus guiding personalized therapy adjustment.

468	Les sources du concept fichtéen de phénoménologie dans la Doctrine de la science de 1804 (2e série)	Fichte characterizes the second part of his Doctrine of Science of 1804 with the term « phenomenology », to which he assigns a double meaning : theory of illusion (Schein) and theory of phenomenon (Erscheinung). If the first part of this definition reminds us of Lambert, the inventor of phenomenology as a philosophical discipline, the second part corresponds to the idea that Kant has of this discipline, for instance in the Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science. Now the question is : is it possible to integrate into a single discipline two concepts as different as Schein and Erscheinung? If Fichte is successful in uniting both concepts in his phenomenology, it might be due to the fact that he follows in this the path already opened by Reinhold in his Beyträge of 1802-1803.

469	La pharmacogénomique de l’insuffisance cardiaque : revue systématique de la littérature et présentation d’une cohorte de patients atteints d’insuffisance cardiaque	Context. Heart failure (HF) affects 1 to 2% of the population and its prevalence is expected to increase in the aging population. Recent evidence suggests that HF and associated risk factors are heritable. HF has multiple phenotypes each associated with different risk factors, pathophysiology and prognosis. Objective. This project presents the current knowledge on HF pharmacogenomics found in the scientific literature and describes a cohort of HF patients who participated in a case-control study. The characteristics of different subgroups are presented and compared to current epidemiologic data. Results. We recruited 829 HF patients who participated in the Montreal Heart Institute biobank project. The mean age is 66,1 ± 10,2 years and 76,6% are male. The median left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is 38% (interquartile range: 28–52%) and ischemic etiology accounts for 55,0% of HF cases. The HF with a reduced LVEF phenotype represents 55,4% of participants while 11,2% and 33,4% of cases have HF with a mid-range LVEF and HF with a preserved LVEF, respectively. Conclusion. The HF with a preserved LVEF phenotype was underrepresented in our cohort compared to what is expected in the scientific literature. We report more men and ischemic etiology, which could be explained by the fact that the Montreal Heart Institute is a reference center for transplantation. Characteristics of the major HF phenotypes are consistent with those reported in the scientific literature, thus suggesting that our cohort is representative of these sub-groups.

A first work for large ensemble and a second one for an instrumental formation including voices are being discussed in the present document. The ideas of the following works are, dichotomically, cartesian and esoteric. The analysis includes comments regarding harmony, counterpoint and orchestration. Though, the main focus of the exegesis is being put on the genesis of the ideas and their musical manifestations through conceptual constructions. I wish to share with the reader my creative process. That way, I hope that the reader will identify compositional constants on which my musical language is being constructed.	Composition , Lyrical fantasy , Symbolism	en	21402.0
471	Les représentations de la violence dans les récits concernant la santé et les moyens de subsistance de femmes migrantes vivant en Afrique du Sud	In this Master’s thesis, we will attempt to answer the following question: How do migrant women, living in high violence contexts in South Africa, portray and incorporate violence into their narratives about their health, healthcare access and livelihood? More specifically, our goal is to understand how these women integrate experienced violence and how they communicate it in order to identify the different representations that they make of it. Although several researchers have shown interest in these news waves of violence, few have focused their attention on how migrant women experience these adversities on a daily basis. To answer our research question, we performed a secondary analysis of a database. In total, fourteen interviews were selected in which violence was mentioned. Our sample is composed of migrant women and community healthcare workers (CHW) that are mandated to provide basic care as well as promote health and prevent disease within communities. As part of this qualitative research, the favoured approach to analyse our data is descriptive interpretative, because it allows the use of data that was not collected by the initial researcher of the study. We used the constant comparative method of data analysis, as developed by Professor Kathy Charmaz (2006), to analyse our data. The results of the process showed that xenophobia is the theme used by the women in our study corpus to represent the violence migrants experience on a daily basis. Although the concept was not explicitly mentioned in the interviews, it was noticeable in the passages where migrant women and CHWs spoke of social exclusion and discrimination against migrant population living in South Africa. Two conclusions were drawn from our analysis in regard to the way migrant women integrated the violence experienced. The first is related to physical and psychological abuse and can be described as protective strategies used by some women to avoid risky situations. The last conclusion drawn is the link between the adversities experienced by migrant women and they’re feeling of belonging, where violence reduces their sense of belonging. Finally, through our analysis, a link has been established between interpersonal violence and collective violence and the presence of a so-called structural violence in South Africa. This could help explain, to a certain extent, the high prevalence of violence in the country.	Violence , Qualitative , Public health , Migrants , South Africa	en	21399.0
472	Zebrafish model of Glycine Encephalopathy	Glycine encephalopathy (GE) is a rare recessive genetic disease caused by defective glycine cleavage and characterized by increased accumulation of glycine in all tissues. In severe GE, patients have a high lethality in the first week of life, hypotonia, lethargy, and survive with variable developmental delay and intractable seizures. The treatments available are often inefficient on the severe form of the disease and little translational research has focused on the pathogenic mechanisms involved in GE. Here, we generated a zebrafish model of severe GE by knocking out the ortholog of the ‘GLycine DeCarboxylase’ gene GLDC, commonly mutated in the disease. We show that the gldc -/- zebrafish larvae recapitulate GE on a molecular level, with reduced gldc expression and increased glycine levels in the body. Gldc - /- also shows a phenotype reminiscent of severe GE symptoms, such as early lethality, hypotonia, and lethargy. A broad molecular characterization of gldc -/- mutants showed that there is a large metabolic disturbance affecting other amino acids and neurotransmitters than glycine, with lactic acidosis at stages preceding death. A transient imbalance was found in cell proliferation in the brain of gldc -/- but that does not have obvious consequences on major brain networks. Importantly, we confirmed that the gldc -/- hypotonic phenotype is due to NMDA and glycine receptor overactivation and demonstrated that there is an exacerbated hyperglycinemia at these synapses, which can be rescued pharmacologically using NMDA and/or glycine receptor antagonists, as well as genetically by overexpressing the glycine transporter GlyT1.	glycinergic encephalopathy , glycine , metabolism , gldc , zebrafish , genetic , translational	en	21390.0
473	Rôle des modulateurs de la protéine kinase D dans la propagation du virus herpès simplex de type 1	Herpes simplex virus type 1 affects the world's population by causing benign lesions such as cold sores, but also severe complications such as blindness. However, current treatments do not eradicate this virus, because the latter has a fast and complex life cycle. The molecular actors involved in the various stages of the viral cycle are still little known, but the laboratory has previously demonstrated the involvement of the host protein kinase D and diacylglycerol, its main anchoring molecule, in the release of the virus from the trans-Golgi network to the plasma membrane. This project goes further by studying the role of different modulators of protein kinase D in viral propagation. Following RNA interference, overexpression and drug experiments, the results demonstrate that, unlike protein kinase D, several of its modulators such as CERT, GGA1 and Nir2 negatively regulate the extracellular release of the virus. These effects are, moreover, independent of the total intracellular levels of diacylglycerol. Finally, electron microscopy suggests that protein kinase D and Nir2 do not only play a role in the trans-Golgi network, but also affect other steps of viral propagation such as nuclear release. These results contribute to a better understanding of the transport of herpes simplex virus type 1 and its interactions with the host cell. These new data could eventually lead to the development of new treatments, since they can be applied to other viruses or large cellular cargos.

474	Population masculine au sein des familles avec mutation germinale dans les gènes BRCA1 et BRCA2 aspects cliniques et pathologiques des cancers	Male BRCA1 or BRCA2 germline mutation carriers have an increased risk of cancer. The clinical practice shows that few men undertake genetic testing despite the actual progresses in cancer screening and treatments that may improve outcomes in men BRCA mutation carriers. A retrospective descriptive cohort study was performed to analyze the clinical and histological cancers characteristics in this population. The project consists in creating a database from information collected between 2000 and 2013 during the initial genetic counseling consultation and does not contain any updating procedure. The project cannot document the statistical cancers incidence, nor to modify the recommendations of follow-up or screening offered to the target population. During the 2000-2013 period, we identified 222 men with a known genetic status, which represent 6 % of the total male population belonging to 282 families with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer and with members harboring a deleterious or suspect deleterious mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes. We also noticed that the index case, the first individual tested because of a personal and family cancer history and who allowed the identification of the familial mutation, was a man in 1,5% of the studied families. This cohort included 142 mutation carriers: 62 with a BRCA1 mutation, 79 with a BRCA2 mutation, a double heterozygosity for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in one (01) case and 80 noncarriers.  The majority (95%) are a French-Canadian descent and born between 1904 and 1992.  Two mutations commonly reported in the French-Canadian founder population: c.4327C>T (4446C>T) in BRCA1 and c.8537_8538delAG (8765delAG) in BRCA2 were the most frequently identified (43%) in our study. Up to 37% (52/142) of men BRCA mutation carrier had a cancer of which ten (10) had two different cancers. Unsurprisingly, the proportion of cancers was more frequent in the mutation carrier group vs non-carrier (p˂0,001) more over this proportion was greater in the BRCA2 mutation carriers group when compared to the BRCA1 mutation carriers (0,016). We did not find a difference in the age of diagnosis between groups.  Prostate cancer was the most frequent with 20 cases, the mean age at diagnosis was 62 years old and it consists mainly of an adenocarcinoma type with high Gleason score (greater than 7). Breast cancer is rare in male population, it is the second most common cancer in our cohort with 12 cases. It was associated with BRCA2 mutation (p = 0,009). The mean age at diagnosis was 62 years old. The invasive carcinoma was the most frequent type with positive hormonal receptors status.  We identified 14 other cancers types: skin (06), lung (04), colorectal (03), pancreas (03), lymphoma (02), bone marrow (02), testis (02), Adrenocortical carcinoma (01), stomach (01), hypopharynx (01), tongue (01), bone (01), kidney (01), thyroid (01) and in two (02) cases it was metastatic with unknown primitive site.  Male BRCA1 or BRCA2 germline mutation carriers need a long-term follow-up for cancer screening and use of the appropriate treatments. Unfortunately, only a small number of men have undergone genetic testing.  The key solution is probably in sensitising to this issue as well healthcare professionals as members of the BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers families. The results of the present study will serve as basis to estimate the progress realized in the follow-up of this population in the future studies.

Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are computerised objects with network capabilities that act on the physical world. Examples of such systems include autonomous vehicles, intelligent pacemakers and some devices in the Internet of Things (IoT). Due to their nature, they may cause important injury in the physical domain as a result of a cybersecurity breach. This master’s thesis aims at uncovering, from the principles of liability law in Quebec, an extra-contractual liability framework applicable to the manufacturer of cyber-physical systems and capable of approaching the specificities of a problem set at the border between the virtual and physical realms.	robots , civil liability , extra-contractual liability , liability from the act of a thing , manufacturer liability , safety defect , cyber-security , cybersecurity , cyber security , cyber-physical system , internet of things , connected thing	en	21353.0
476	La grammaire d’Outremont : ethnographie de trois controverses autour des hassidim	This work analyses three subjects of controversy around the Hassidic Jewish community of the neighbourhood of Outremont - Montreal, between 2014 and 2016: the dispute around the celebration of Purim; the installation of cabins for the Soukkot celebration and the proposed law to ban places of worship on Outremont’s commercial streets.  Through ethnographic research in the neighbourhood, it examines the way these controversies, considered as conversations and practical accomplishments, took place. By closely considering the borough question period and public consultations, the informal encounters between Hassidim and non-Hassidim and the more intimate conversations between the neighbourhood’s inhabitants, it investigates how the controversies manifest themselves in the every-day life of Outremont. Whilst the discourse surrounding the controversies in the public space tends to crystallise around municipal regulations, the individuals’ discourse change, when they switch from the public to the intimate sphere. This produces what we have called the ‘grammar’ of Outremont. In this grammar, public speech about religion and the issues of cohabitation between Hassidim and non-Hassidim is avoided because it is considered taboo in the Outremont public space.

478	Influence de la température sur les mouvements précoces chez l’opossum Monodelphis domestica	Changes in external temperature are detected by nerve fibres located in the skin and mucosae that express thermosensitive receptors. In mammals, thermosensation is mostly studied in mature animals and little is known about its development. We use the newborn opossum as a model of study to asses if thermosensation is functional at early stages of development, using in vitro preparations of brainstem and spinal cord where both facial skin and forelimbs (FL) were kept. Like other marsupials, newborn opossums are very immature at birth, but must climb on the mother’s belly to find a teat where they attach. Stimulations consisted of puff ejections of liquids at cold, neutral and hot temperatures directed towards the face, and FL responses were observed visually under a microscope or triceps activity was recorded in electromyography. Cold temperatures always induced FL or muscular responses, but neutral and hot temperatures were less potent to do so. Sections of the trigeminal nerve and spinal cord showed that thermal responses are at least partially mediated through the trigeminal nerve. Facial skin removal abolished FL responses to hot and neutral stimulation, but only decreased those to cold temperature. Immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR suggest that TRPM8, the main receptor involved in cold sensation in adult mammals, is not expressed in opossum at birth. Overall the present study demonstrates that the newborn opossum is sensitive to temperature, but mostly to cold and that this sensation is not mediated by TRPM8.

479	Étude longitudinale du lien prédictif entre les événements de vie négatifs et les symptômes somatiques à l’adolescence : le rôle modérateur des traits de personnalité	Although previous studies showed that negative life events predict somatic symptoms, the nature of the relationship needs to be better understood, especially for adolescents.  Consequently, the goal of this longitudinal study was to evaluate if negative life events in middle adolescence predict somatic symptoms two years later, after controlling for initial somatic symptoms and other known risk factors of somatic symptoms.  The study also tested whether personality traits moderated this predictive relationship.  The sample consisted of 1036 adolescents from seven high schools from the metropolitan areas of Montreal and Quebec City.  Data were collected at two times points using self-reported questionnaires; the first in the third year of high school (age 14 and 15) and the second in the fifth year (age 16 and 17).  Multiple regression analyses did not confirm that negative life events during adolescence predict somatic symptoms two years later.  A significant negative relation was observed only when initial somatic symptoms and other variables known as risk factors of somatic symptoms were controlled for.  The relationship was not in the expected direction; the higher an adolescent is exposed to negative life events in third year of high school, the least he tends to report somatic symptoms two years later.  Furthermore, certain personality traits such as Emotional stability and Openness predict somatic symptoms two years later. In fact, Emotional stability predicts less somatic symptoms, while Openness predicts more somatic symptoms two years later.  As expected, somatic symptoms show high stability across two years and girls tend to report more such symptoms.  Adolescents with living in family with low socioeconomic status are also more at risk of reporting subsequent somatic symptoms.  Finally, none of the tested interactions were significant.  Thus, personality traits do not seem to act as either protection factors or vulnerability factors of the relationship between negative life events and somatic symptoms.

480	Étude spectroscopique des phénomènes de résonance dans les plasmas micro-ondes	In plasmas produced by high-frequency electromagnetic fields, electron heating can result from ohmic heating (collisional) or from collisionless processes. In this regime, the production of suprathermal electrons can result from the conversion at the resonant point (when the plasma permittivity εp→0) of the propagating electromagnetic wave into electrostatic waves and their absorption by Landau damping. The objective of this Master's thesis is to experimentally characterize the effect of collisionless processes associated with the presence of resonance phenomena on the electron energy distribution function (EEDF). The study was carried out by trace-rare-gases optical emission spectroscopy (TRG-OES) in various plasmas capable of exhibiting resonance phenomena. For low-pressure tubular plasmas (< 50 mTorr) produced by an electromagnetic surface wave at 600 MHz, EEDF is characterized by two temperatures: TeAldescribes the mean energy and TeTail represents the high-energy tail of the distribution. A parametrical study of these temperatures as a function of the axial distance and the gas pressure revealed that the ratio TeTail / TeAlincreases with the characteristic length of the electron density gradient L. Similar measurements and analyses were also performed in a magnetized microwave plasma source sustained at the electron cyclotron resonance. In such conditions, the production of suprathermal electrons results not only from the resonance phenomena and wave-particle interactions mentioned above but also from the electron cyclotron resonance	Plasma produced by microwave fields , optical emission spectroscopy , wave-particle interactions , resonance phenomenon	en	21295.0
481	Modélisation d'observations spectroscopiques, résolues en phase, d'exoplanètes de type Jupiter chaudes avec NIRISS à bord du télescope spatial JWST	"We present simulations of infrared spectroscopic observations of the phase curve of exoplanets in transit with the Near-Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (NIRISS) in the Single-Object Slitless Spectroscopy mode (SOSS) in order to determine which systems can provide positive detections of phase modulation and which planetary parameters can and cannot be constrained by the observations. We combine emission spectra, based on a model for brown dwarf, BT-Settl, modulated by the phase of a planet around its host star, as well as reflection spectra of the star light. Given our knowledge of NIRISS, photon noise and read noise are added to the simulated observations.  We assume that the planet is a hot Jupiter that can be modeled in two ways.  A first model uses two temperatures, each characterizing one of the hemispheres of the exoplanet, which values are of the order of 10^3 K. These simulated observations are then compared to theoretical models to constrain the temperature of the planet. A simulation for WASP-43b (a exoplanet found by the Wide-Angle Search for Planets program) shows that the temperatures of its hemispheres can be constrained to better than 50 K.  A second model uses several temperatures according to a distribution in ``orange slices"". The algorithms developed may also adjust the hot hemisphere phase shift on the exoplanet, the albedo of the exoplanet and the variability of the star. Simulations show that these temperatures can be constrained, for WASP-43b and HD-189733b, with an uncertainty of 200 K and, for WASP-19b, with one of 350 K."

482	Simulation du transport de neige	Whether it is for synthetic scenes in movies or video games, the realism of environments passes by the addition of visual effects common to our experiences. Snow is part of complex natural phenomena that make their physical and visual simulation all the more difficult to treat. In fact, snow falls in scenes under the action of wind. It piles up and is compressed in some areas, breaks and falls, is repelled by wind once deposited, liquefies or evaporates, freezes, accumulates impurities, etc. The goal of this research is to develop a simulator of snow transport in synthetic spaces. This simulator is designed as an automatic tool to integrate snow in scenes by adding its precipitation, transport by wind, simulation of melting and evaporation, but also to offer some control to artists in order to produce the desired results with easy and understandable settings such as the snow precipitation rate or the wind direction and speed in the scene. We propose a method for the simulation of snow transport that consists of : 1. A precomputation phase to estimate wind and precipitations in a scene. 2. A physical model of snow transport to capture its evolution through time. 3. A method of implementation on GPU. Our results demonstrate the need to simulate the various phenomena on the realism of snow distribution.	Computer Graphics , Snow , Snow transport , Fluid simulation	en	21281.0
483	Modélisation spatiale des changements dans les milieux humides ouverts par automate cellulaire : étude de cas sur la région administrative de l’Abitibi-Témiscamingue, au Québec, Canada	Wetlands are among the most productive ecosystems that exist throughout the planet. Thirty five per cent of the world’s wetlands can be found in Canada, with an approximately eighty five percent located in the boreal forest However, these ecosystems are among the most threatened ecosystems due human disturbances. Regrettably, once a wetland has been disturbed it is difficult to restore it to its natural state. The study of the complexities around dynamic changes in wetlands can be approached by the use of modeling and spatiotemporal simulations as tools for assisting environmental conservation. Complex systems modeling approaches such as cellular automata coupled with statistical models allow us to simplify these complexities and understanding emerging patterns of complex systems, such as wetlands. This study proposes the simulation of open wetlands based on a hybrid model by logistic regression, Markov chain and cellular automata, in order to project future scenarios of open wetlands distribution in the administrative region of Abitibi-Témiscamingue, Quebec. This thesis consists of two parts: 1) wetland diagnosis and characterization of the study area; and 2) an article on the modeling of spatiotemporal changes in open wetlands using a hybrid model, to simulate spatial distribution of open wetlands for the years 2015, 2025, 2035, 2045 and 2055 in the Abitibi-Témiscamingue administrative region. Model simulation results showed an average increment, by decade, of over five percent between simulations from 2015 to 2055. The results agreed with the observed spatiotemporal patterns from Landsat imagery from 1985, 1995, and 2005. The observed and projected spatial distribution of open wetlands in the study region offer some insight of the dynamics of this fragile ecosystem. With an increase in open wetlands, habitat availability for waterfowl will as well augment, in addition to the services associated with them. The outcomes of this research bring new information and perspectives in terms of future open wetlands conservation policies.

484	Bien se souvenir : représentation de la violence politique et de la mort dans La Constellation du Lynx, de Louis Hamelin, suivi de La vingt-troisième nuit, roman	The October crisis has built itself, in the popular imagination, out of discourses, reappropriations, rewritings and reactions coming from a variety of perspectives on what happened. Louis Hamelin's novel La Constellation du Lynx takes part in the reappropriation process by using historical fiction. It refutes the official version and uses fiction to point out its incoherences. Our essay interrogates the novel's representations of political violence. And, by examining the historical reasoning deployed in the novel, and by pointing out usages of narrative shiftings and world duplications, as well as the elaboration of a non-narrative form of story, we analyse how the novel treats Pierre Laporte's death (Paul Lavoie, in the novel) as an insoluble enigma. The objective is to show how the novel states the impossibility to know the truth. La vingt-troisième nuit tells the story of a student that barely makes it through the police trap that resulted in 512 arrests in Montréal, 2012, May 23th. The action of Twenty-third night asks itself what would've happened if someone died during a demonstration. Readers follow Laurent, who has reasons to believe that his friend Maxime, who accompagnied him during the demonstration, died while running from the police. He searches for his friend all night. Retrospective episodes intersperses the novel, episodes when Laurent questions how he pertains with the student movement, how he shares his friends' point of view on the events, and what to believe on the social medias. Strongly aware that he stands in a critic position in the historical events, until the end, he measures his role in the crisis, as well as the forces that could influence the movement and the legitimacy of the student revolt, if his friend's death is confirmed.	1970 , Louis Hamelin , manifestations , October crisis , political violence , death , non-narrative story , conspiracy theory , truth , historical fiction , novel , 2012 student strike , demonstrations	en	21258.0
485	L'intergénéricité dans « L'énigme du retour » de Dany Laferrière	The aim of this master thesis is to show that Dany Laferrière's « L'énigme du retour » (translated into english as « The return ») has the characteristics of several literary genres, mainly travel writing, autobiographical fiction as well as poetry and the combinaison of these forms produces an innovative work, this thesis also postulates that Laferrière's novel, through questions related to exile, return and the origins of literature, maintains an intertextual dialogue with several literary works, particularly, V.S. Naipaul's  « The Enigma of arrival », Aimé Césaire's « Notebook of a Return to the Native Land », and Virgil's « Aeneid ». In addition to the question of returning to the native country, the present study will focus on a few recurring themes in « L'énigme du retour », in particular the narrator's bereavement and the homage paid to two figures who are important to him, that is, his biological father and Aimé Césaire, who is implicitly identified as a « spiritual father ». This analysis will also try to show that « L'énigme du retour » is an attempt at the reworking of conventional forms of literature, reminding us of the « pre-conventional » early seminal texts.	roman francophone contemporain , genre , énigme , contemporary francophone novel , haitian literature , travel writing , autobiographical fiction , poetry , genre , intertextuality	en	21257.0
486	"Fécondité par rang au sein d’une génération en France et au Québec : e
stimation de probabilités d’agrandissement à partir d’un seul recensement"	The interest of this research is to observe the differences between the estimates of the fertility rate and the probabilities of enlargement using only the census data, using the indirect “own children method“, which links the Cohabiting children and a potential mother within the household. In the case of France, the method will be validated by comparing the results obtained by the indirect method with those obtained from the 2011 Family and Housing Survey (EFL) data, a survey coupled with the census and interviewing women on the Of the children they had, whether or not the children cohabited with the mother at the time of the census. Concerning Quebec, the results obtained from the indirect method will be compared with those resulting from the operation of the 2011 General Social Survey - Family cycle. Most of the studies developed in order to find the differential factors that affect fertility rate are based on family policies. For this reason, it is important to study and to analyse individual socio demographic variables to characterize the factors that influence the probabilities of become mother or having more children. We are interested in the variables associated with increasing or decreasing probabilities of enlargement. This research examines the relationship between sociodemographic variables available in the different sources of information consulted and probabilities of enlargement. We use the variables: date of birth, sex, and relationship with the head of household to classify and establish relationships (motherchild), and the variables mother's education level and place of birth of the mother to segment and calculate the probabilities of enlargement. The study highlights the underestimation in the probabilities of enlargement and the ISF that use census data (children who live in the household) in comparison with socio-demographic surveys that inform about all children of the main woman in the household. Our results show that, in France and Quebec, more educated women wait longer before becoming mothers and they are less likely to have a large family. Furthermore, they are most likely to remain childless. iv For the mother's place of birth variable, the results are inconclusive. On the one hand, for France, descriptive analyzes of the average age of the mother at first birth and the time elapsed between births are minimal (less than three months). However, the probabilities of enlargement indicate that immigrant women are more likely to have large families (more than three children). On the other hand, for Quebec, the analysis shows that, although women begin their maternity later than women born in Quebec, they are more likely to have a large family (more than three children), especially women from African countries and Maghreb countries. Nevertheless, based on the results of the analysis of variance, there is insufficient statistical evidence to show an effect between the place of birth and the mean time elapsed between the second and third births. We prove that the results of the census underestimate the fertility rates and the probabilities of enlargement cause by the impossibility of counting the total of children born from the main women of the household. The results of this paper provide new perspectives for analyzing fertility trends in subpopulations based on census data. This relatively classical approach distinguishes the ages of women, but also the ranks of birth, which has been more rarely analyzed in previous studies. The results of this research help us to measure the effects of mother's education and birthplace on the probabilities of enlargement. They help us answer a variety of questions, including questions about why women did not have a third child.

It deals with the potential integration of these projects in the management of dissemination activities at archival centers and services in Quebec, and with the archivist’s role in this new context. This research is approached in the perspective of the enrichment of the archival discipline by proposing strategies that introduce management practices leading to a greater consideration for the artists and their needs, as well as the development of new dissemination approaches that result from them. These strategies are developed according to the characteristics and the economic constraints of the environment, and the sources of financing that may be considered for such projects. This study revealed that the projects produced by the artistic exploitation of archives are not only compatible with the mission and the management of many archival centers and services, but they are also profitable by their potential to increase the use of archives, and to raise awareness and to attract new clienteles.

488	Le design comme levier d’optimisation de l’économie circulaire : le cas des PME œuvrant en agriculture urbaine	The development of a global vision for the circular economy, entrepreneurship and design spheres of activity involves a dynamic and complex approach. At the intersection of these three spheres lies an opportunity for understanding the operationalization of a closed-circuit economy within today’s enterprises. The latter are essential players in the transition towards this new economic model. In order to improve the implementation of circular economy (CE), the main focus is on issues related to its operationalization. The goal is to document the path taken by Quebec small and medium enterprises cognizant towards sustainable development issues, particularly working in urban agriculture, a field currently in full transformation. The question that this research proposes to answer is the following: what are the brakes and levers related to the operationalization of the circular economy among SMEs? With the growth of planetary issues due to overproduction / overconsumption as a premise, this research is building its framework on environmental sciences (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, EDDEC Institute) and entrepreneurial (Harvard Business Review) theories. With the main objective being to shed light on levers and weaknesses related to the operationalization of a CE within SMEs, the methodological approach chosen for this research is phenomenological. It aims primarily at observing, through semi-structured interviews, the journey of four different companies who are already cognizant towards sustainable development issues. The strategic design approach (Madge, Plouffe and De Coninck) will allow to conclude this research project with a proposition for solution paths in operationalization.

In such contexts, no formal authority can exercise complete control over the trajectory of collective action. In order to guide change, the State, who nonetheless occupies a particular position, has the obligation to insert itself in the ever evolving interactions of key actors. This thesis aims to analyze and understand the State’s governing capacities, and the dynamics between the concerned actors in piloting and implementing a public health system reform.  The thesis proposes a theoretical framework drawing upon the organizational analysis of Crozier & Friedberg (1987) and the policy instruments approach of Lascoumes & Le Galès (2004). In this perspective, the identified actors are motivated by their particular stake in the issue and mobilise strategies that effect the evolution of the collective action. In order to reach its objectives, the State calls upon instruments of various kinds, such as those based on formal authority or communication and information.   The theoretical framework is applied to a case study: the New-Brunswick health system reform launched in 2008. In terms of reorganisation, the eight existing regional health authorities (RHAs) were amalgamated in two (RHA A and RHA B). RHAs A and B thus represent two units of analysis. In addition, the analysis is informed by interviews with representatives of the State, such as health ministers, deputy ministers, and other relevant stakeholders, such as chief executive officers of health organizations, health professionals, and citizens. The analysis is also supported by a review of the grey literature, including media reports. The study period is characterized by three specific time points: the formulation of the reform (2006 to 2008), the grand launch and immediate response (2008 to 2010), and the implementation of the reform (2010 to 2015). During these phases, the stakeholders were compelled by various aspects of the reform that motivates them to change their behaviors, for example, access and coordination of care, performance and public participation. Moreover, factors present in the systemic context, such as language rights within the health care setting, provide further motivation, among certain actors, influencing change. This research demonstrates that as the context evolves the State must adapt to the dynamic interactions of the actors involved, and mobilizes various instruments to respond accordingly. The response to various strategic actions may be conceptualized as a continuous learning process.  In conclusion, practical recommendations are proposed, aimed at decision-makers when conducting public health system reforms. The recommendations proposed are also consistent with the modifications made to the theoretical framework. These relate to the objectives proposed by the State, the continuous learning process, the types of instruments that can be used to renew legitimacy, and regarding the citizen population, an influential group of actors in the pluralistic context. The recommendations emphasize the general idea that a reform takes place over a long period of time, and that its programming by the State can be very difficult.

490	Causes and consequences of chromosome segregation errors in the mouse preimplantation embryo	Cell division is a universal biological process necessary for reproduction, development, cell survival and the maintenance and repair of tissues. Accurate chromosome segregation during mitosis is essential to ensure replicated chromosomes are partitioned equally into daughter cells. Errors in chromosome segregation often result in cells with abnormal numbers of chromosomes, a condition termed aneuploidy, which is associated with impaired cellular health, tumorigenesis, congenital defects and infertility. Counterintuitively, preimplantation embryos from many mammalian species, including humans, often consist of a mixture euploid and aneuploid cells. Such mosaic aneuploidy in embryos is inexorably caused by errors in chromosome segregation during mitotic divisions following fertilization and has been associated with reduced developmental potential in fertility treatments. However, ever since its discovery 25 years ago, how and why mosaic aneuploidy arises in the preimplantation embryo has remained elusive.  To explore the causes and consequences of embryonic chromosome segregation errors, advanced imaging approaches were employed in the mouse preimplantation embryo. Live cell imaging analysis of chromosome segregation dynamics identified lagging anaphase chromosomes as the most prevalent form of chromosome mis-segregation in embryos. Lagging chromosomes frequently result in the encapsulation of single chromosomes into micronuclei, which occur in embryos in vitro and in vivo. Further live imaging and immunofluorescence experiments revealed chromosomes within micronuclei are subject to extensive DNA damage and centromeric identity loss, failing to assemble functional kinetochores and being recurrently mis-segregated during ensuing cell divisions in preimplantation development. To uncover the underlying causes for the increased propensity for chromosome mis-segregation in embryos, live imaging and loss-of-function approaches were used to examine the effectiveness of the mitotic safeguard mechanism, the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC). These studies demonstrated that the SAC normally functions to prevent segregation errors during preimplantation development but SAC signaling at misaligned chromosomes fails to delay anaphase. Moreover, SAC failure in embryos is most evident during mid-preimplantation development, independent of cell size. Partial inhibition of SAC target, the Anaphase Promoting Complex (APC/C), extended mitosis and reduced chromosome segregation errors in embryos.  These studies have uncovered deficient SAC function during preimplantation development as a major cause for the high incidence of lagging chromosomes in embryos, which result in repeated mis-segregation of single chromosomes in a manner that necessarily causes mosaic aneuploidy. Additionally, this work provides proof-of-principle demonstration that pharmacological modulation of SAC-APC/C signalling can avert chromosome segregation errors in the early embryo. Altogether, these findings present new insights into the causes and nature of chromosome mis-segregation in embryos, providing novel mechanistic explanations for the occurrence of mosaicism that will have substantial implications for the detection and potential therapeutic prevention of aneuploidy in preimplantation embryos.

491	La politique étrangère du Canada envers la Chine de 1984 à 2015 : l’impact de la centralisation de la prise de décision et l’influence des élites	This thesis offers an in-depth process tracing analysis of Canada’s foreign policy towards China from 1984 to 2015. Based on more than thirty semi-structured interviews, primary documents and secondary sources, it is shown that foreign leaders and political, social and business elites with close ties to Canadian prime ministers have been able to influence their foreign policy ideas. These ideas in turned shaped Canada’s foreign policy towards China. Canada established official relations with the government of China in 1970 with a policy of positive engagement. In the mid-1980s, Brian Mulroney’s progressive-conservative government developed a new strategy to help Canadian firms benefit from China’s economic reform and open-door policy. After an interruption of this policy in the wake of the Tiananmen Square crisis, Jean Chrétien’s and Paul Martin’s Liberal governments implemented a policy based on trade, constructive engagement on human rights issues and high-level political contacts between leaders of both countries. Influenced by new elites with a negative view of China, Stephen Harper’s Conservative government brought an abrupt change in Canada’s policy towards China in 2006. From 2008 to 2012, Chinese leaders and Canadian business elites developed new ties with Stephen Harper in order to bring back a more positive approach.  However from 2012 to 2015, right-wing conservative elites that feared Chinese involvement in the Canadian economy would encroach on Canadian sovereignty complicated once more relations with China. The evolution of Canada’s policy towards China is the consequence of foreign policy decisions dominated by the premier minister. An important contribution of this thesis is to demonstrate how certain Canadian elites were able to secure an influence on Canada’s China Policy by developing and maintaining close ties with Canadian prime ministers. As part of the Foreign policy analysis (FPA) literature, this thesis also contributes to Sino-Canadian relations studies and Canadian political studies by offering a theoretical model embedded in Elite theory and making use of foreign policy ideas as an analytical tool for understanding political decision-making.

492	De la sensibilité différentielle à la diathèse-stress dans la prédiction de la consommation de substances à l’adolescence : interactions entre l’environnement familial et le tempérament au cours du développement	Person-environment interactions predicting substance use can be interpreted according to several developmental theoretical models. The diathesis-stress model suggests that certain individuals (e.g., impulsive individuals) would have higher substance use levels compared to their peers when they are exposed to negative environments. The differential susceptibility model suggests that these same individuals would also have lower substance use levels than their peers when exposed to positive environments. The main objective of this thesis is to examine the diathesis-stress and differential susceptibility models in the context of interactions between temperament and the familial environment when predicting adolescent substance use. It includes four articles, i.e., one systematic literature review, two empirical studies and one perspective paper. The first article presents a systematic literature review on the interaction between temperament and the familial environment in the prediction of adolescent substance use and externalizing behaviors. Results show that interactions between temperament and the familial environment measured in childhood support the differential susceptibility model while interactions between temperament and the familial environment measured in adolescence support the diathesis-stress model. Since the a posteriori analyses for the models were limited methodologically, the next two articles examined the patterns of interactions a priori. The second article examines the interaction between temperament (impulsivity and inhibitory control at 6 years) and parenting practices (maternal coercive parenting at 6 years and parental knowledge at 14 years) in the prediction of alcohol use frequency at 15 years. Results show that an interaction between impulsivity and coercive parenting supports the differential susceptibility model. Thus, results support the findings of the literature review. The third article examines the interactions between personality (impulsivity and sensation seeking at 15 years) and parental knowledge at 15 years in the prediction of binge drinking frequency and drug use frequency at 15 and 17 years. Results show that the interactions between impulsivity and parental knowledge support the differential susceptibility model whereas the interactions between sensation seeking and parental knowledge support the diathesis-stress model. Thus, the developmental shift observed in the literature is supported for impulsivity, but sensation seeking could be a characteristic capturing sensitivity to positive and negative environments later in development. The fourth article offers a perspective that goes beyond adolescent externalizing behavior and substance use and proposes how the differential susceptibility model could apply to borderline personality disorder. The article presents how several personal characteristics associated with borderline personality disorder (e.g., emotional reactivity, impulsivity) could be markers of a sensitivity to positive and negative environments. Following these four articles, the discussion addresses key points such as: a revision of the notion of vulnerability, the importance of targeted prevention and the importance of thorough analyses of interaction effects.	temperament , personality , impulsivity , family , parenting , environment , alcohol , drugs , externalizing problems , moderation	en	21164.0
493	Les substrats cérébraux du déclin de la mémoire sémantique dans le vieillissement pathologique : contributions de la magnétoencéphalographie	Semantic memory (SM) contains all of our knowledge of the organization and meaning of the world around us. It supports many complex cognitive operations such as communication and reasoning and plays a decisive role in our daily functioning. At the neuroanatomical level, SM relies on a widely distributed network, which makes it particularly resistant to neuronal decline. It is, in fact, the only memory system that is known to remain stable during normal aging. As a result, the presence of an early semantic decline in older adults is generally observed in a neurodegenerative context, such as in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and in the semantic variant of primary progressive aphasia (svPPA). However, the neurofunctional correlates associated with semantic decline in pathological aging remain to this day poorly understood. Therefore, the main objective of this thesis is to explore the cerebral changes associated with semantic processing in these two neurodegenerative diseases, using magnetoencephalography (MEG) as a method of investigation, in order to document the neurofunctional changes associated with semantic decline, as well as the functional compensatory brain mechanisms that are deployed to allow residual processing when the integrity of the semantic network is compromised. This thesis also aims to determine if common mechanisms of neural plasticity are at play to counteract the effects of semantic deterioration in these two diseases, and to initiate a reflection on the potential clinical implications of these neurofunctional changes. In the context of the subtle SM alterations observed in the prodromal stage of AD, these mechanisms could be reflective of the neuropathological decline even before the emergence of significant structural alterations, highlighting their relevance regarding an early diagnosis. In the case of manifest but relatively circumscribed alteration of SM, such as in svPPA, these mechanisms are informative of the capacity of the compromised semantic network to adjust in order to support residual processing, which can also be useful in deciding which interventions (rehabilitation, palliative) are likely to be most helpful for patients.  The first study (chapter 2) is aimed to investigate the neural correlates underlying semantic disorders in the subclinical stage of AD (aMCI), using a semantic judgment task about famous faces. Our results support the assumption that the pattern of neural alterations observed in aMCI patients is not limited to the hippocampal region, as it extends within several regions of the extended semantic network, including the anterior temporal lobes (ATL). These results also suggest that the pattern of neural dysfunction observed in aMCI patients precedes the emergence of structural alterations within the semantic network, and that the compensatory mechanisms deployed to support the finer semantic processing associated with famous faces in these patients rely notably on an increased recruitment of the right ATL region.  The second study (chapter 3) is aimed to better understand the neural correlates of residual semantic processing in the context of a significant but selective impairment of SM, through the single case study of a svPPA patient, using a semantic categorization task about biological entities and manufactured objects. Despite equivalent behavioral performance, this study revealed a pattern of significant hyperactivation within key regions of the semantic network in the svPPA patient in comparison with controls, extending to the left inferior temporal gyrus and right ATL region. Overall, these findings emphasize that peri-atrophic regions within the ATL may support remaining semantic abilities.  Finally, the last chapter of this thesis (chapter 4) is dedicated to reflect on the clinical and theoretical implications associated with the results of these two studies. The limitations of this thesis and future perspectives are also addressed in this section.	semantic memory , Alzheimer’s disease , mild cognitive impairment , semantic variant primary progressive aphasia , magnetoencephalography	en	21162.0
494	L'apport de la santé psychologique à la performance de tâche et innovante : vérification de mécanismes cognitif, motivationnel et social au sein de divers contextes d'emploi	"Researchers in organizational psychology have long had an interest in the happy and productive worker thesis, which posits that happier workers also demonstrate higher level of job performance (Taris & Schaufeli, 2015). Although many important contributions have been made over the years in this field of research, some questions deserve further investigation, which this thesis aims to address. Specifically, among the multitude of heterogeneous mediating mechanisms that have been theoretically postulated, not much have been put to empirical test, nor contrasted with one and another to clarify which intervening variables are really at play in the ""happy-productive"" relationship. Moreover, research is needed to verify if this relationship holds depending on different work characteristics. This thesis focuses on the construct of psychological health at work and seeks to understand its influence on performance. It proposes a model which includes postulated mediating and moderating mechanisms.   The first article aims at formulating a theoretical model of the influence of psychological health at work on task and innovative performance. Relying on conservation of resources (Hobfoll, 1989) and broaden-and-build (Fredrickson, 2001) theories, the model details the postulated cognitive, motivational and social mediating mechanisms as well as moderating mechanisms pertaining to knowledge, autonomy and social characteristics of the job.   The second article empirically tests the theoretical model with a sample of workers in different occupational groups. Results show that the psychological health-task performance relationship can be understood as a dynamic of broaden cognitive flexibility and higher achievement motivation. On the other hand, the relationship between psychological health and innovative performance can be understood as a dynamic of horizontal social investment with team members, captured as team-member quality exchanges (TMX). No moderating effects of work characteristics were supported.   As such, this thesis contributes to existing knowledge by operationalizing the resources investment principle within the psychological health-performance relationship and specifying how each resource contributes to certain types of performance. As no moderation effects were confirmed, the results also suggest that the mediating mechanisms identified preserve the same relevance under different work contexts related to knowledge, autonomy and social work characteristics. Limits of this thesis and suggestions for future research are discussed."

495	Maltraitance durant l’enfance et régulation de la tristesse et de la peur à l’âge adulte : une analyse qualitative	Introduction : Childhood maltreatment is associated with several negative impacts on mental health, which are partly attributable to difficulties with emotional regulation. Although various studies suggest a link between general difficulties with emotional regulation in adults and childhood experiences of maltreatment, emotional regulation related to specific emotions and emotional contexts is yet to be explored. Aims : The two studies which constitute this thesis aim to (1) depict a precise qualitative portrait of emotional regulation of adult women who experienced childhood maltreatment and (2) describe more specifically the regulation of sadness and fear related to childhood abuse, two emotions which are often negatively perceived and therefore usually avoided. Method : University of Montreal students were recruited for the purpose of two larger studies on sadness (N = 72) and anxiety (N = 128) and completed online questionnaires. Based on their Childhood Trauma Questionnaire scores measuring experiences of childhood maltreatment, twelve women reporting a significant level of abuse (maltreated group) and twelve women reporting no such experience (normative group) were selected, this for each of the two emotions (2 x 12+12). Each participant was individually met and an induction of sadness or fear by film was used to target and explore emotional regulation in an experimental setting, which focuses on the emotional experience in real time. An interpretative phenomenological qualitative analysis was performed on each participant’s emotional speech. A between-group comparison was also done to provide a rich and precise description of the regulation of each group and get a contrast between them. Results : Overall, the results of the first study indicate that sadness appears less regulated for women who report childhood maltreatment and that this emotion is experienced by them at either a minimized or an overwhelming level. Several negative attitudes toward sadness emerge from the discourse of maltreated women, while women in the normative group present a more nuanced experience of this emotion and attitudes toward it. In the second study, fear appears as experienced at a pathological level and through somatization in the maltreated group, while the normative group presents a more detached experience of this emotion. Conclusion : The results of both studies allow us to shed light on live emotional regulation among women who experienced childhood maltreatment and to describe specific deficits in the regulation of sadness and fear. Intervention issues and clinical reflections based on the results are discussed.	Abus , Maltreatment , Childhood abuse , Childhood neglect , Emotional regulation , Sadness , Fear	en	21156.0
496	Le rôle des formes périglaciaires dans l’hydrologie et l’évolution des pentes d’un désert polaire dans le Haut-Arctique canadien	Geomorphology exerts a fundamental control on ecosystems. In the case of periglacial landscapes, the mechanisms by which they evolve are not clearly defined, as research on the subject has often been excessively focused on the expressions of freeze-thaw processes as climatic control over landform development. It is however essential to identify and clarify what are the fundamental dynamics of sediment transport in periglacial regions to understand the evolution and the functions of these landscapes. At the scale of a unit slope, the mechanisms originating from cryo-conditioning are the main drivers of evolution. These include the effects of freeze-thaw processes on surface deposits and the production of large, periodic water supplies by snow redistribution and snowmelt. This thesis investigates the role played by periglacial landforms in the establishment of drainage pathways on a High Arctic polar desert landscape. It aims at establishing links between the azonal processes of runoff generation and sediment transport, and the climate-dependant processes of sorting and mass movement associated with the formation of patterned ground. It achieves this objective by focussing on surface deposit morphology (ch. 2), on the hydrological functions those patterned ground possess (ch. 3), on sediment transport on the slope (ch. 4) and on the impacts of those flowpaths on limnological conditions in a downstream headwater lake (ch. 5). The organisation of the drainage pathways is dependant upon the combination of sorting processes with erosion from snowmelt of large snowdrifts. The coarse nature of the reworked glacial drift and gelifracted slope deposits allowed water to move through the large voids between the particles, creating underground flow pathways of a relatively high hydraulic conductivity. These networks of preferential flow pathways similar to water tracks were efficient at transporting snowmelt, preventing the interaction of water with the rest of the soil outside of the flow paths. Some of the seeping water sources downslope from the snowdrifts yielded amounts of suspended sediments of similar amplitudes as other surface flow pathways in the Arctic. Solute transport was however the main driver of denudation, with concentrations exceeding suspended sediments by up to an order of magnitude. The presence of these flow paths influenced the timing of ice melting on the lake, contributing to the novel disappearance of perennial ice on the donwstream lake in 2011 and 2012. In addition, these flowpaths reacted to the degradation of the transient layer of permafrost in 2014, releasing solute rich waters in the soils and into the downstream lake. Further degradation of permafrost is expected to increase inputs of salt-rich waters to the littoral zone. The thesis effectively exemplifies how the evolution of a polar desert slope under severe periglacial conditions can be dependant upon the relation between sorting and water flow. This underlines the relevance of azonal processes for the geomorphology of a frost-dominated region, but maintains the importance of the periglacial control on soil morphology exerted by freeze-thaw processes.

497	Overt social support behaviors : Associations with PTSD, concurrent depressive symptoms and gender	Women are twice as likely as men to develop a posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Gender differences in social support after a traumatic event might partially explain this disparity. However, the portrait of the links among PTSD, depression, social support, and gender is still unclear. This study examined behaviors of individuals with PTSD and their significant other in relation to PTSD and concurrent depressive symptoms, and tested gender as a moderator of these associations. Observed overt supportive and countersupportive behaviors of 68 dyads composed of an individual with PTSD and a significant other in a trauma-oriented discussion were coded with a support coding system and analyzed according to gender. Gender was revealed to act as a moderator of the links between interactional behaviors of individuals with PTSD and their concurrent depressive symptoms. More specifically, women were less implicated and less likely to propose positive solutions compared with men. On the other hand, men were more implicated and less likely to criticize their significant other than were women. PTSD and concurrent depressive symptoms were related to poorer interpersonal communication in women. Hence, women and men with PTSD and concurrent depressive symptoms might benefit from gender-tailored interventions targeting symptoms and dyadic behaviors.

498	Proposition de reconceptualisation du construit de capacité d’absorption : la capacité d’absorption actualisée	The concept of absorptive capacity remains a large stream of research since its introduction by Cohen and Levinthal in 1989. Defined as the “ability to recognize the value of new information, assimilate it, and apply it to commercial ends” (Cohen and Levinthal, 1990). They also mentioned that “these abilities collectively constitute what we call a firm’s, absorptive capacity” and they stay capital to innovative capability of an organization. The absorptive capacity, a key factor for strategic management, sustains the competitive advantages of an organization. But, even the number of growing studies and articles on this topic, we know little about how it appears and its development. These questions remain unresolved. The topic of this dissertation concerns these last two points: how appears the absorptive capacity and how to develop it.  We first see that the current suggested models show some difficulties to operationalize the concept. As per Lane, Koka and Pathak (2006) review, most of the scholars did not work with the basic assumptions made by Cohen and Levinthal (1989, 1990, 1994). They reified the concept and now use it as a “minor citation – a grace note that embellishes a paper without adding substance” (Lane et coll., 2006). Authorship of ideas and theories forget the basic assumption, transform them into things, and finally forget that they have done so. Few of them revised the definition, scope and frontiers of the absorptive capacity. If empirical literature is still growing little conceptual development occurs (Lim and Falk, 2013). The concept needs more research to get a theoretical maturity from a consensus among scholars. From these facts, we conclude that a new conceptualization of the absorptive capacity construct should offer some potential solutions. Starting with the three original papers, we aim at clarifying the scope of absorptive capacity and reconceptualize the construct. We demonstrate that weak signals and information constitute strategic insights, as suggested by Cohen and Levinthal, to recognize as valuable. We establish a clear distinction between confounded learning capacity and absorptive capacity. We argue that absorptive capacity emerges as a phenomenon, issued from a complex and adaptive organizational system, at the conjunction of three capabilities: learning, dynamic and creative. We explain why we take this perspective by an overview of the system’s theories, considering also some quantum mechanic ideas, looking at the chaos theory and finally, choosing complex adaptive systems as a background to absorptive capacity.  We will first review what a good theory is, its properties, its quality and how to assess it. We will see each phase of conceptualization and clearly precise their content. This way, we will get a framework to guide us step by steps to create a construct. This framework will also give us decisions-making references. As basic criteria to elaborate this new construct, we think about its constitutive abilities instead their outcomes. We expect to assess its validity by using item responses theories, namely the Rasch model. We also want this construct designed with meaning words to managers and close to daily used and known management practices.  From our deep review of the three seminal papers of Cohen and Levinthal (1989a, b-1994, 1990), we concluded that a new model of absorptive capacity should have three distinct capabilities: organizational learning, dynamic and creative capabilities. Each of them has tree categories of actions growing in task’s difficulties and competencies to execute them. The learning capability is founded on the abilities to mobilize lessons from experiences: single, double and triple loop learning. Dynamics capabilities constitute abilities to modify used practices when the external environment changes, so to adapt, reconfigure and integrate current or new resources. Creative capabilities are under problems solving, prototype making and deployed R&D abilities. Based on complex systems, we argue that absorptive capacity appears as emergent phenomenon when the required organizational capabilities perform together. Members of an organization mobilize their absorptive capacity when they recognize the value of a new external and weak signal or information. This acts as a trigger to start the process of signal’s or information’s absorption. The absorptive capacity comes from the conjunction of the three abilities: learning, dynamic and creative ones. The process we suggest showing how to start with product imitation and grow to radical innovation. We suggest that learning with dynamic capabilities gives access to imitation and incremental innovation; learning with creative capabilities promotes incremental towards radical innovation; creative with dynamic capabilities open to radical innovation and, collectively with a learning capability, give the absorptive capacity. So, more the learning abilities, the flexibility to introduce new practices or methods and the creative abilities overlap, more an organization constructs his absorptive capacity and more it grows its probability of innovation. To substantiate our model, we show how it converges to three other theories in three different domains. We use the Bloom taxonomy (Bloom, 1954) current in education sciences, and show our model is in accordance with steps recommended for the cognitive development to learn. Then, from the SECI of Nonaka and Takeuchi (1995), we illustrate how it corresponds with its knowledge creation modalities. Finally, we see that the abilities required by our model are the same that Amabile (1996) described as essential to creativity in their componential model.

499	Vocabulaire employé pour l'accès thématique aux documents d'archives patrimoniaux : étude linguistique exploratoire de termes de recherche, de description, d'indexation	Users carry out searches for archives by subject, yet the access offered in the archives is mainly by provenance resulting in a gap between the desired access and the offered access. To meet users’ demand, some archival services already offer access by subject. Research instruments used by these services provide the basis for our research. We analyzed the vocabulary used by archivists to describe and to index archival documents by subject. That is to say, the choice of words and the semantic relationships that exist between the meanings of these words in the documents from which they come from (descriptions, index). We analyzed both the users’ vocabulary in the questions asked to the reference archivist by email and the answers offered by the latter. Thus, our study covers a large part of the communicative chain between users and archives they are looking for by subject. The comparison of these two vocabularies has brought out the semantic gap that separates them. By studying the terms used for research, for description, and for indexing, we wish to contribute to the advancement of knowledge on the vocabulary used for thematic access to heritage archives (VATAP). We have chosen corpus studies as our research methodology. We study the semantic relationships between the terms in a corpus from four data sources (user-to-reference questions, reference archivists’ answers, descriptions, indexes), collected from three different archives services. We limit our research to data obtained from large archival repositories as they have the means to develop tools to guide and facilitate access. The originality of our research lies in the application of linguistics to the study of VATAP. Our study describes VATAP and contributes to a better accessing of heritage archives by subject. We accomplish this by formulating recommendations for the archivists’ use based on the study of the most frequent semantic relationships in our corpus. The linguistic formalization needed for our research could serve as a premise for automatic indexing. This exploratory study of users’ vocabulary allows participating institutions to better understand this aspect of their users’ profile.

500	The influence of sustainability in project management practices in the building sector	Sustainability is an increasingly adopted objective (and an overarching concept) that affects, and is affected by, every aspect of the construction project process. As the building sector is increasingly forced to adopt sustainability in organizational processes, researchers within the field have provided knowledge to improve “green” building performance, focusing on technologies, materials, and environmental management tools. Practitioners have usually focused on increasing efficiency, typically seen as reductions in the use of energy, water and other resources. However, insufficient knowledge still exists about the processes required in the effective implementation of sustainability principles. This dissertation seeks to create a comprehensive understanding of how sustainability principles influence project management and organizational processes in building projects.  The research is based on five case studies of recent Montreal located building projects that have implemented sustainability principles. First-hand data included 14 Interviews with experts in sustainability, project management, and construction, as well as 24 interviews with professionals involved in the five projects.  More than 200 project documents, press releases, and policy documents from the client organizations were studied and compared with the information obtained from the interviews and observations. The data was analyzed through a series of diagrams and mapping techniques that aimed at revealing the evolution of both the structure of the temporary multi-organization (TMO) and the sustainability practices within the case studies.  Findings reveal that sustainability enables the alignment process between project management and business strategy. They also show that the implementation of “green” certifications in building projects often generates a series of tensions that influence project management processes and practices. Moreover, the study reveals that stakeholders adopt a multiplicity of sustainability approaches and that these approaches change during different stages of the project, generating additional tensions between stakeholders.  The investigation suggests that in order to adopt sustainability practices in the building sector there is an urgent need to shift from linear, regulatory, and product-centred approaches to a more holistic, open, and process-centred approach. Contrary to common belief, results show that sustainability is not a homogeneous approach applied to building projects and that the diversity of approaches has a significant impact on project performance. There is, therefore, a need to fully understand different stakeholder approaches as well as their evolution in the project phases. From a practical point of view, results from this study can be used by project managers to avoid conflicts between stakeholders, reduce tensions between managerial approaches, facilitate innovation and collaboration, and transform tensions into opportunities for project quality enhancement.

501	"Lubrication and wear protection of micro-structured hydrogels using
bioinspired fluids"	We report the fabrication and the use of a bioinspired synovial fluid acting as a lubricant fluid and anti-wear agent at soft and porous chitosan hydrogel tribopairs. This synthetic synovial fluid is composed of sodium hyaluronate (HA) and a bottle-brush polymer (BB) having a polycationic attachment group and polyzwitterionic pendant chains. 2.5 %w/w chitosan hydrogel plugs are organized in a bilayered structure exposing a thin and dense superficial zone (SZ), covering a porous deep zone (DZ) and exhibiting microchannels perpendicularly aligned to the SZ. Using a low-load tribometer, the addition of HA lubricating solution at the hydrogel-hydrogel rubbing contact drastically decreased the coefficient of friction (CoF) from μ = 0.20 ± 0.01 to μ = 0.04 ± 0.01 on the DZ configuration and from μ = 0.31 ± 0.01 to μ = 0.08 ± 0.01 on the SZ surface when increasing HA concentration from 0 to 1000 μg/mL and its molecular mass from 10 to 1500 kDa, similar to what was found when using BB polymer alone. When combining the BB polymer and the 1500 kDa HA, the CoF remained stable at μ = 0.04 ± 0.01 for both studied contact configurations, highlighting the synergistic interaction of the two macromolecules. Hydrogel wear was characterized by assessing the final gel surface roughness by the means of an interferometer. Increasing HA concentration and molecular weight plus the addition of BB polymer lead to a dramatic surface wear protection with a final gel surface roughness of the hydrogels similar to the untested gels. In brief, BB polymer in combination with high molecular weight HA is a potential lubricating fluid as well as a wear resistant agent for soft materials lubrication and wear protection.

502	Threshold Luce rules	In the late 1950’s, Luce proposed two different theories of imperfect utility discrimination that have had a lasting impact on economics. One model (1956) gave rise to the literature on just noticeable differences while the other (1959) laid the foundations for the literature on discrete choice. In this paper, I present a unified model of imperfect utility discrimination that generalizes Luce’s two models; and addresses the main limitations of each. Surprisingly, choice behavior consistent with this model is characterized by two conditions from Luce’s monograph (1959).

503	Capacités de réserve et entraînement cognitif dans le vieillissement : similarité des effets protecteurs sur la cognition et le cerveau = Reserve capacity and cognitive training in aging : the similarity of the protective effects on cognition and brain	The reserve concept was proposed to account for difference observed in some individuals between the degree of their brain damage and its expression at the cognitive level. Reserve was found to be modulated by environmental factors such as the level of education and practice of cognitively stimulating activities during life. An important issue is to understand the neurobiological mechanisms underlying reserve capacities in order to promote interventions that would strengthen these capacities. Results from studies on the neurobiological mechanisms involved in different types of cognitive training and those of reserve lead us to hypothesize that reserve can be built later in life using targeted intervention procedure. We will discuss the advantage of having a high level of reserve and the opportunity to build one at a later time, during the phase of aging.

504	Early nonparental care and social behavior in elementary school : support for a social group adaptation hypothesis	We examined the contribution of non-parental child care services received during the preschool years (i.e. between 5 months and 5 years) to the development of social behavior between kindergarten and the end of elementary school (i.e. between 6 and 12 years) with a birth cohort from Québec, Canada (N=1544). Mothers reported on the use of child care services, while elementary school teachers rated children’s shyness, social withdrawal, prosociality, opposition and aggression. Children who received non-parental child care services during the preschool years were less shy, less socially withdrawn, more oppositional and more aggressive at school entry (age 6 years). However, these differences disappeared during elementary school as children who received exclusive parental care during the preschool years caught up with those who received non-parental care services. We discuss this “catch-up” effect from the perspective of children’s adaptation to the social group.

505	Incomplete hippocampalInversion : a comprehensive MRI study of over 2000 subjects	The incomplete-hippocampal-inversion (IHI), also known as malrotation, is an atypical anatomical pattern of the hippocampus, which has been reported in healthy subjects in different studies. However, extensive characterization of IHI in a large sample has not yet been performed. Furthermore, it is unclear whether IHI are restricted to the medial-temporal lobe or are associated with more extensive anatomical changes. Here, we studied the characteristics of IHI in a community-based sample of 2008 subjects of the IMAGEN database and their association with extra-hippocampal anatomical variations. The presence of IHI was assessed on T1-weighted anatomical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using visual criteria. We assessed the association of IHI with other anatomical changes throughout the brain using automatic morphometry of cortical sulci. We found that IHI were much more frequent in the left hippocampus (left: 17%, right: 6%, χ2−test, p < 10−28). Compared to subjects without IHI, subjects with IHI displayed morphological changes in several sulci located mainly in the limbic lobe. Our results demonstrate that IHI are a common left-sided phenomenon in normal subjects and that they are associated with morphological changes outside the medial temporal lobe.

506	Aggression can be contagious : longitudinal associations between proactive aggression and reactive aggression among young twins	The present study examined sibling influence over reactive and proactive aggression in a sample of 452 same‐sex twins (113 male dyads, 113 female dyads). Between and within siblings influence processes were examined as a function of relative levels of parental coercion and hostility to test the hypothesis that aggression contagion between twins occurs only among dyads who experience parental coerciveness. Teacher reports of reactive and proactive aggression were collected for each twin in kindergarten (M = 6.04 years; SD = 0.27) and in first grade (M = 7.08 years; SD = 0.27). Families were divided into relatively low, average, and relatively high parental coercion‐hostility groups on the basis of maternal reports collected when the children were 5 years old. In families with relatively high levels of parental coercion‐hostility, there was evidence of between‐sibling influence, such that one twin's reactive aggression at age 6 predicted increases in the other twin's reactive aggression from ages 6 to 7, and one twin's proactive aggression at age 6 predicted increases in the other twin's proactive aggression from ages 6 to 7. There was also evidence of within‐sibling influence such that a child's level of reactive aggression at age 6 predicted increases in the same child's proactive aggression at age 7, regardless of parental coercion‐hostility. The findings provide new information about the etiology of reactive and proactive aggression and individual differences in their developmental interplay.

507	Associations between mother-child relationship quality and adolescent adjustment : using a genetically controlled design to determine the direction and magnitude of effects	This study used a genetically controlled design to examine the direction and the magnitude of effects in the over-time associations between perceived relationship quality with mothers and adolescent maladjustment (i.e., depressive symptoms and delinquency). A total of 163 monozygotic (MZ) twins pairs (85 female pairs, 78 male pairs) completed questionnaires at ages 13 and 14. Non-genetically controlled path analyses models (in which one member of each twin dyad was randomly selected for analyses) were compared with genetically controlled path analyses models (in which MZ-twin difference scores were included in analyses). Results from the non-genetically controlled models revealed a) child-driven effects in the longitudinal associations between adolescent perceived maternal support and depressive symptoms, and b) parent-driven a nd child-driven effects in the longitudinal association between perceived maternal negativity and adolescent delinquent behaviors. However, results fr om the genetically controlled models revealed only child-driven effect, suggesting that, purported parent-driven effects were a product of error arising from potential gene-environment correlations (rGE).

508	Testing the impact of a social skill training versus waiting list control group for the reduction of disruptive behaviors and stress among preschool children in child care : the study protocol for a cluster randomized trial	Background: Most preschoolers growing up in western industrialized countries receive child care services (CCS) during the day, while their parents are at work. Meta-analytic data suggest that CCS represent a stressful experience for preschoolers. This may be because preschoolers have not yet developed the social skills necessary to cope with the new and rapidly fluctuating social contexts of CCS. We tested the effectiveness of a child care-based social skill training program aiming to improve children’s social behaviors and reduce the stress they experience. Method and design: We used a cluster randomized control trial (cRCT) to compare children’s social behaviors and stress levels in pre- and post-intervention according to whether they received a social skill training intervention or not. Nineteen (n = 19) public CCS (n = 362, 3-years-old preschoolers) of underprivileged neighborhoods (Montreal, Canada) were randomized to one of two conditions: 1) social skills training (n = 10 CCS); or 2) waiting list control group (n = 9 CCS). Educators in the intervention group conducted bi-weekly social skills training sessions over a period of 8 months. The intervention covered four topics: making social contacts, problem solving, emotional selfregulation, as well as emotional expression and recognition. Main outcome measures included preschoolers’ disruptive (e.g. aggression, opposition, conflicts) and prosocial behaviors (e.g. sharing toys, helping another child), and stress levels assessed by salivary cortisol sampling at pre and post intervention assessments. Educators’ practices will be tested as potential mediators of the expected changes in behaviors and neuroendocrine stress. Discussion: To our knowledge, this is the first cRCT to test the effectiveness of a child care based social skill training program on the reduction of disruptive behaviors and levels of stress. Significant challenges include the degree of adherence to the intervention protocol as well educators and preschoolers’ turnover. Trial registration: Current clinical trial number is ISRCTN84339956 (Ongoing study, Retrospectively registered on March 2017) No amendment to initial protocol.

509	A prospective, longitudinal, study of men with borderline personality disorder with and without comorbid antisocial personality disorder	Background: Some evidence suggests that the prevalence of Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is elevated among male criminal offenders. It is not presently known whether offending, and violent offending, are limited to those presenting comorbid Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD) who have a childhood history of conduct problems and whether offending is linked to psychopathic traits. Methods: A community sample of 311 males followed from age 6 to 33 years, one third of whom had a criminal charge between ages 18 and 24, completed diagnostic interviews and the Psychopathy Checklist-Revised interview. Information on childhood included parent-reported family characteristics and teacher-rated of hurtful and uncaring behaviours, conduct problems, hyperactivity and inattention, and anxiety at age 6, 10, and 12 years. Health files were obtained as were records of criminal convictions from age 12 to 33. Results: At age 33, 4% of the men presented BPD and not ASPD, 16% ASPD and not BPD, 8% BPD + ASPD, and 72% neither disorder (ND). Comorbid disorders were common: BPD were distinguished by high levels of anxiety disorders, BPD and BPD + ASPD by depression disorders, and BPD, BPD + ASPD, and ASPD by substance dependence. Official files indicated use of health services by all participants. One-third of participants with BPD and BPD + ASPD acquired a diagnosis of a personality disorder. More than one-third of participants with BPD + ASPD obtained scores indicative of the syndrome of psychopathy. Convictions for violent crimes varied across groups: In adolescence, BPD none, BPD + ASPD 16%, ASPD 16%, and ND 3.6%; from age 18 to 33, BPD 18%, ASPD 19%, BPD + ASPD 52%, and ND 4.4%. Offenders with BPD + ASPD were convicted, on average, for four times more violent crimes than offenders with ASPD and seven times more than ND offenders. In childhood, men with BPD + ASPD and with ASPD had obtained similarly elevated ratings for disruptive behaviours as compared to ND. Conclusion: BPD comorbid with ASPD was associated with violent criminal offending in adolescence and most strongly in adulthood, elevated levels of psychopathic traits, and childhood disruptive behaviour. BPD showed similar characteristics but to a much less degree.

511	BDNF Val66Met polymorphism interacts with sleep consolidation to predict ability to create new declarative memories	It is hypothesized that a fundamental function of sleep is to restore an individual's day-to-day ability to learn and to constantly adapt to a changing environment through brain plasticity. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is among the key regulators that shape brain plasticity. However, advancing age and carrying the BDNF Met allele were both identified as factors that potentially reduce BDNF secretion, brain plasticity, and memory. Here, we investigated the moderating role of BDNF polymorphism on sleep and next-morning learning ability in 107 nondemented individuals who were between 55 and 84 years of age. All subjects were tested with 1 night of in-laboratory polysomnography followed by a cognitive evaluation the next morning. We found that in subjects carrying the BDNF Val66Val polymorphism, consolidated sleep was associated with significantly better performance on hippocampus-dependent episodic memory tasks the next morning (β-values from 0.290 to 0.434, p ≤ 0.01). In subjects carrying at least one copy of the BDNF Met allele, a more consolidated sleep was not associated with better memory performance in most memory tests (β-values from -0.309 to -0.392, p values from 0.06 to 0.15). Strikingly, increased sleep consolidation was associated with poorer performance in learning a short story presented verbally in Met allele carriers (β = -0.585, p = 0.005). This study provides new evidence regarding the interacting roles of consolidated sleep and BDNF polymorphism in the ability to learn and stresses the importance of considering BDNF polymorphism when studying how sleep affects cognition.

512	Evaluation of qualityof-life in patients with narcolepsy treated with sodium oxybate : use of the 36-item short-form health survey in a clinical trial	Introduction The present post hoc analysis was designed to evaluate health-related quality of life (HRQoL) using the 36-item Short Form Health Status Survey (SF-36) during an 8-week trial of sodium oxybate (SXB). Methods SF-36 was assessed in a phase 3 placebo-controlled trial in patients with narcolepsy (N = 228) randomized to placebo or SXB in doses of 4.5, 6, or 9 g nightly for 8 weeks. Changes from baseline in SF-36 (last observation carried forward) were compared between SXB and placebo, and effect sizes (ES) were estimated. Results Baseline SF-36 values were lower than normative values for the US general population. After 8 weeks of treatment, mean (±standard deviation) improvement from baseline on the Physical Component Summary (PCS) was significantly greater with SXB 9 g/night than placebo (6.3 ± 9.1 vs. 1.5 ± 6.2; p = 0.005), with moderate ES; no significant difference was found between the SXB and placebo groups on the Mental Component Summary. SXB 9 g/night resulted in significantly (p < 0.05) greater improvements than placebo in Physical Functioning (4.4 ± 9.2 vs. 1.0 ± 8.0), General Health (GH; 3.1 ± 7.0 vs. 0.4 ± 6.8), and Social Functioning (6.8 ± 16.8 vs. 1.1 ± 9.6). All SXB doses resulted in significant improvement (p < 0.05) relative to placebo for Vitality, with moderate ES. No significant differences versus placebo were observed for Role–Physical, Role–Emotional, or Mental Health domains. Conclusion Treatment with SXB was associated with a dose-dependent improvement in HRQoL, with the 9-g nightly dose demonstrating a positive impact on PCS and individual SF-36 domains of Vitality, GH, and Physical and Social Functioning.

514	Dare to Dream: Promoting Indigenous Children’s Interest in Health Professions through Book Collections	Introduction: Indigenous peoples in Canada experience significant health challenges, but few pursue careers in the health sciences. Two programs by medical librarians designed to encourage children in First Nations communities to dream of careers in the health professions will be presented.  Description: An academic library in [Province] developed children’s health and science book collections with Indigenous school libraries. Library and information science students, as well as a librarian, participated in health education activities in the recipient schools. This project inspired the community service project of the joint MLA/CHLA-ABSC/ICLC Mosaic|Mosaïque 2016 conference, which focused on placing similar collections in Ontario Indigenous communities. The mechanics, benefits, and challenges of the programs will be discussed including book selection and delivery.  Outcomes: Hundreds of books have been delivered and informal qualitative evaluative data from the recipient communities indicates positive outcomes. Some difficulties in providing optimal access to the books were identified due to communication problems or the relative lack of library infrastructure in these communities.  Discussion: Reading for pleasure is linked to student's academic success. Access to varied and quality literature is important for school achievement, therefore these collections may potentially impact student’s future life chances. While a direct correlation between these collections and student’s future career choices cannot be easily measured, it is known that Indigenous high school graduates frequently choose to pursue professions linked to the needs of the community. Therefore any materials drawing attention to potential community health needs may well influence student’s choices.

515	Exploration, en composition musicale, des rencontres entre musiques de l’Occident et du Moyen-Orient, particulièrement d’Iran	The purpose of this master’s dissertation is to explore musical encounters between Middle Eastern music (especially Persian classical music) and Western music, with the purpose of preserving the aesthetic elements of each one. I tried, as well, to find musical tendencies that are common between these heterogeneous musical systems in order to achieve a formal unity in a unique language. This master dissertation will deal with the analysis of the musical pieces, which I have been composing during the Master’s instrumental composition program at the Université de Montréal: Heterotopia, The Substantial Movement, Kamalto and Cypress Mourning. What is considered in the analysis of the mentioned works particularly focuses on the usage of modal materials, morphemes, rhythmic cycles, improvisation, ornamentation and the combination of pitch systems, as well, in more general ways, on the textures and the forms.

516	Prévalence et mécanismes de résistance aux triazolés des espèces d’Aspergillus section Fumigati	Aspergillus fumigatus is the principal agent of invasive aspergillosis. A growing number of A. fumigatus isolates in Europe are found to be resistant to the triazoles, the primary antifungals used in treatment. Moreover, many “cryptic” Aspergillus species, morphologically and genetically similar to A. fumigatus, are misidentified in the clinical diagnostic laboratory, and several of these “cryptic” species are intrinsically resistant to the triazoles. Resistance mechanisms of “cryptic” Aspergillus section Fumigati species are not well known. In the present retrospective study, conducted on a collection of Aspergillus clinical isolates from Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, the prevalence of the « cryptic » species among all Aspergillus section Fumigati was 1.4%, and 1.0% of all isolates in the collection were azole-resistant. Analysis of resistance mechanisms produced evidence for efflux pump-mediated resistance in Aspergillus turcosus and A. fumigatus isolates, in contrast to the triazole-resistant Aspergillus thermomutatus and Aspergillus lentulus species which display resistance likely mediated by mutations in the cyp51a gene.

517	How participating in a new culture facilitates the integration of the new identity : the additive and subtractive processes	Immigration and globalization impact the identities of millions of individuals. They do so by offering individuals opportunities to participate in new cultural groups and, therefore, to participate in the activities and behaviors that are typical of new cultural groups. Previous research suggests that participating in a new cultural group (e.g., using their language) can help immigrants identify more with their new group. That is, the more immigrants participate in the new group the more they identify to it. However, previous research has ignored 1) whether participation increases identification with the new group in the context of globalization, a context that drastically differs from immigration, and 2) how the newly added cultural identity will relate to the identity of origin. In line with these questions, the first goal of the present thesis is to test whether participating in a new group will predict higher identification with the group across migration and globalization contexts. Secondly, research shows that identifying with a new cultural group may, under some circumstances, be associated with lower identification with the group of origin (subtractive identification pattern). In other cases, the addition of a new identity will not predict lower identification with the identity of origin (additive identification pattern). The second goal of this thesis is to understand which pattern of identification (additive or subtractive) will emerge as individuals participate in a new group. Three articles serve these goals. The first article lays down the theoretical foundation of the thesis. First, it described the psychological processes by which participation impacts identification with the new cultural group, and hence why this process should be applicable across immigration and globalization contexts; second, it proposes that perceived similarity predicts the identification pattern that will occur (additive or subtractive). More specifically, perceiving similarity promotes a sense of coherence between the two cultural identities that can facilitate the additive pattern. On the other hand, perceiving little similarities may suggest that the cultural identities are incoherent, resulting in a subtractive pattern. The second article makes use of four correlational studies (three studies in Kyrgyzstan and one study in a Franco-Ontarian community) to test the hypotheses that, in the context of globalization, participating in a new group predicts higher identification with it (Hypothesis 1), and that this increased identification with the new group will be either positively/neutrally (Hypothesis 2a) or negatively (Hypothesis 2b) associated with the group of origin, depending on the perceived level of similarity between the cultural groups. The third article presents experimental data, offering evidence for the causal role of participation on identification shifts (Hypotheses 1, 2a and 2b), as well as testing for the first time how the value of the new group moderates the relation between participation and identity shifts. Overall, this series of articles provides theoretical and empirical evidence for the impact of actions (participation in a new group) on our self-concept, and more specifically on our cultural identities, both the new identities and the identities of origin.

518	Cinéma analytique et transfert : l'expérience spectatorielle dans Persona et L'Heure du loup de Bergman et Antichrist, Melancholia et Nymphomaniac de Von Trier	The simultaneous development of cinema and psychoanalysis led to many studies confronting and associating these two fields. This thesis examines more specifically transference as a phenomenon arising in the encounter between spectator and film, and is based on Jungian psychoanalytic theories. Considering an analytic cinema, which associates reflexivity and psychological themes, I hypothesised the existence of “psyche-films”, enabling the study of the psychoanalytic transference within spectator’s experience. Through their spatial and temporal constructions and their figural composition, these “psyche-films” are akin to psyches projected on screen and visually accessible. According to Jung, transference is a transpersonal phenomenon with psychological and physical consequences, involving two individuals whose unconscious communicate together. Bringing out the characteristics of such a phenomenon, this thesis explores the possibility of considering the film’s own unconscious, in particular with the help of film aesthetics theories, and questions the consequences, inside body and psyche, that might be caused by the transferential encounter between spectator and film. In order to study the possibility of such a transference in the spectator’s experience, five films regarded as “psyche-films” are analysed using a Jungian perspective: Persona and Hour of the Wolf, directed by Ingmar Bergman and Antichrist, Melancholia and Nymphomaniac, directed by Lars von Trier. To this end, this research is performed using psychoanalytic (Jung, Ferenczi, Freud, Abraham and Török), aesthetic (Brenez, Lefebvre, Vancheri) and philosophical (Damasio, Derrida) perspectives, and considering an ideal spectator.

519	Comprendre l’imperméabilité cutanée : étude spectroscopique de mélanges modèles de la phase lipidique du stratum corneum	The stratum corneum (SC), the outermost layer of mammal epidermis, acts as a barrier dictating the rate of absorption of exogenous molecules through the skin and preventing water loss from the body. SC is mainly composed of flattened and fully keratinized dead cells (corneocytes), embedded in a lipid matrix, which is mostly constituted of ceramides, free fatty acids, and cholesterol. The transdermal diffusion of molecules is mainly related to the intercellular lipids, which form multilamellar membranes in the solid-crystalline phase. The main goal of this thesis is to better understand the relationship between the structure of the lipid matrix and the skin impermeability. SC lipid phase includes more than 400 different lipid species. Due to this very complex composition, model membranes are often used for the study of the physicochemical properties of membranes, the lipid behavior, and of the permeability of different chemicals. First, we determined how the length of the free fatty acid acyl chains influences the phase behavior of a lipid matrix composed of ceramide NS24, lignoceric (FFA24) or palmitic (FFA16) acid, and cholesterol. The structural properties of membranes were examined by 2H NMR and infrared spectroscopy. This study revealed that the phase behavior of these ternary mixtures is strongly affected by the length of the FFA. We found that lignoceric acid led to the formation of a more homogeneous mixture with ceramide NS24 and cholesterol, than the palmitic acid/ceramide NS24/cholesterol mixture. Also, the tertiary mixture containing lignoceric acid showed a transition from solid to gel phase when heated above 37 oC, an unusual feature for this type of model membranes. The combination of ordered lipids and homogeneous membranes is proposed as a critical element for SC impermeability. Second, we studied a more complex mixture containing cholesterol, a series of free fatty acids varying from 16 to 24 carbon atoms, and two types of ceramides: ceramide NS24 and EOS. The latter is considered a key component for the formation of the long periodicity phase in native and model SC membranes. The 2H NMR, infrared and Raman spectroscopy results showed that both the free fatty acid and the ceramide NS24 acyl chain remained in the solid-crystalline phase at physiological temperature while the oleate chain in ceramide EOS led to the formation of highly disordered domains. These liquid nanodrops remained in the liquid state down to -30 °C. The steric constraint imposed by the crystalline lipid matrix is proposed to prevent the crystallization of ceramide EOS oleate chains. This finding modifies the structural description of the SC substantially and proposes a novel physiological role of ceramide EOS as this lipid is a strong modulator of SC solid/liquid balance. The work leads to a re-examination of the mechanism currently proposed to explain the permeability of SC, as well as the effect of transdermal agents. Finally, we studied the interaction of very long-chain fatty acids with 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) membranes to determine how these fatty acids adapt to spatial constraints. Three different FFAs with acyl chain varying from 16 to 24 carbon atoms were used: palmitic (FFA16), arachidic (FFA20) and lignoceric (FFA24) acid. The leaflet thickness of a POPC bilayer corresponds to the length of the hydrophobic part of FFA16, and therefore is smaller than the length of FFA20 and FFA24. The way in which these fatty acids structurally adapt in POPC bilayers was study by 2H NMR and molecular dynamics simulations. We found that the lower part of the protonated FFA24 acyl chain was disordered in a manner similar to that observed for the oleate chain of the EOS ceramide, its acyl chain interacts with the more fluid part of the opposite leaflet. This interdigitation of the end of the acyl chain caused a second plateau observed in the order profiles (SC−D), an unusual feature in lipid systems. In this case, the protonated carboxyl group of FFA24 was located slightly below the polar head of the POPC. The deprotonation of the FFA24 shifted the molecule toward the aqueous interphase. This movement reduces the spatial constraints, increases the order of the acyl chain and causes the disappearance of the plateau at the end of the chain.  The results presented in this thesis contributed to better understand how the structure of the SC lipid matrix dictates the skin impermeability. We showed spectroscopic evidences of the distinct phase behavior of some of the most important SC lipids. Furthermore, we suggested a novel mechanism for the regulation of transdermal diffusion of molecules.	stratum corneum , phospholipides , model membranes , phase behavior , lipids , skin , very-long chain fatty acids , phospholipids.	en	20756.0
520	Le moutya à l'épreuve de la modernité seychelloise : pratiquer un genre musical emblématique dans les Seychelles d'aujourd'hui (océan Indien)	"Moutya is a musical practice born out of slavery in the Seychelles islands (Indian Ocean) from the end of the 18th century. It is made of singing, drumming and dancing. During our fieldwork, this practice, known as moutya otantik (authentic moutya) by the Seychellois, was hard to find, not to say absent. Interviews with cultural workers and musicians contributed to our understanding of the concept of moutya otantik born in parallel with the ""creole Seychellois"" cultural identity, as a political construction that served national purposes following the coup that led to the Seychelles Revolution in 1977.  This dissertation first examines the representation of a moutya otantik as organized and presented by workers of the Ministry of Culture. It then looks at how moutya has been adapted and renewed when staged and recorded mainly during official events, at touristic venues or within the local music industry. This approach makes it possible to talk about the historical and dynamic processes of creolization that are inherent to creole music, with which moutya shares obvious affinities, and also to connect moutya with other local, regional and, more generally, Creole cultural phenomena.  New production and presentation spaces are observed through case studies based on musicians' individual and collective experiences. Analyses of sound material and musical performances attempt to better define moutya and show that it is now expressed in a diversity of forms and in a dynamic interrelation with different music. In this context, it must necessarily be approached in a broad and complex way."

521	Réflexion critique sur la relativisation du droit à la protection de l’enfant : les distinctions de traitement du signalement des situations de compromission dans la Loi sur la protection de la jeunesse et dans la législation encadrant la profession d’avocat	This thesis examines the degrees of youth protection that emerge from the provisions of the Youth Protection Act (YPA) regarding reporting. Two areas of critical focus are presented with respect to the legislative treatment of abused children, depending on whether their situation should, or could, be reported. International law, an interdisciplinary approach (the use of psychology in service of the law), and comparative law (a study of Swiss law) are used to critically analyze Quebec’s law in respect of reporting.    The first area of critical focus is the distinction based on the grounds on which children are considered to be in danger. While there is an obligation to report physical or sexual abuse and the risk of it, the reporting of other kinds of abuse carry no such obligation and are thus discretionary for citizens and for professionals who are not in contact with children in the exercise of their profession, save for lawyers. The thesis investigates the legitimacy of this prioritization at the reporting stage, doing so in the light of children’s need for particular protection and of contemporary scientific knowledge.   The second area of critical focus is the distinction according to the category to which the reporter belongs. Lawyers and notaries are the only ones excluded from the obligatory and discretionary reporting in the YPA, binding on all other professionals and citizens. The upshot is that children’s rights and their need for tailored protection enter into conflict with adults’ rights, in particular the client’s right to solicitor-client privilege.   Following our critical analysis, we propose reforms that may provide preferable legal solutions, better reconciling the fundamental rights and interests in play.	youth protection , mandatory and discretionary reporting , reporting grounds , solicitor-client privilege , fundamental rights , Youth protection , Mandatory and discretionary reporting , Reporting grounds , Solicitor-client privilege , Fundamental rights	en	20732.0
522	Évaluation de l'implantation et des effets perçus du pilote du Groupe de réflexion sur les drogues (2e génération)	Adolescence is a critical moment to prevent substance abuse considering that it is a period favourable for first experiments with drugs. It is especially important to offer programs to at-risk teenagers because they are more inclined to develop an addiction. This research project aims to describe the fidelity of implementation and identify the perceived effects of the pilot of the Groupe de réflexion sur les drogues (2nd generation) (GRD), an innovative prevention program for teenagers with problematic substance use or at risk of becoming it. The sample includes four teenagers residing in two readaptation units of the Centre Jeunesse de Montréal – Institut Universitaire as well as to educators having delivered the program. Logs, questionnaires and individual interviews allowed to collect data. Descriptive quantitative analysis and qualitative thematic analysis were performed. Overall, results show that the GRD was established as it was conceived and that the participants benefited from the activities intended in the instructor’s guide. Results also show some possible effects, especially on increasing motivation to change, modifying consumption patterns, learning new knowledge on drugs and using protective behavioral strategies. Involvements for research and practice are also discussed.	consommation de substances psychoactives , adolescences , Substance use , Prevention program , Pilot project , Harm reduction , Adolescence , Implementation , Effects	en	20708.0
523	Trajectoires de l’Aufklärung : autour de la polémique Kant-Herder	This thesis aims at deepening our understanding of the short debate that took place between Kant and Herder in 1784 and 1785. Often presented as a dialogue of the deaf between a Kant at the heights of his glory and an obsolete Herder, we want to demonstrate not only that, despite appearances, that debate was fruitful for both philosophers and that the philosophy of Herder, far from being obsolete, is rather a philosophy of the Enlightenment just as Kant’s is. Herder simply offers another trajectory for the Enlightenment: immanentism, which is opposed to the transcendentalist way of Kant. Thus, we want to show the irreducibly plural character of the Enlightenment.

524	Débruitage d’image par fusion de filtrage spatio-fréquentielle	In this work, we are interested in the fusion of two different algorithms of denoising and operating in the space domain for one of the two and in the frequency domain for the other one. The proposed technique will merge (fuse) the essential characteristics of these two algorithms. One of them is based on the fact that any natural image inherently exhibits spatial self-similarities (Non-Local means algorithm) and this property turns out to be especially efficient for denoising the contours, details and the spatial high frequencies of an image. The other algorithm is based on the fact that the image/signal is sparse and by this fact, each part of the image can be broken into a small number of periodic elementary functions (via the Discrete Cosine Transform). This latter denoising algorithm has proven to be especially effective for denoising homogeneous regions existing in a natural image. The image, degraded by a Gaussian additive noise is first denoised in both domains and segmented for contour detection. The three estimates are then fused to obtain the final denoised image. The article [15] and the article [73] will allow us to detect contours. Our experiments give good results of denoising. The evaluation of these results, based on the visual aspect, the mean squared error (MSE) and the signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), demonstrates the relevance and effectiveness of the approach. This technique gives better results than those of [11] and [55, 78].	restauration , image processing , denoising , filtering , restoration , noise reduction	en	20692.0
525	Les princesses Médée et Himiko : une étude comparative des mythologies grecque et japonaise	Mythology is often considered a key component of the culture for a given society. It is often used to explain natural and social phenomenon particular to the aforementioned society. The hypothesis guiding this research is that, although mythology is considered culturally linked to a society, there is a basis for creating myths that is common to human kind, like some sort of a mythological blueprint common to all cultures. To verify this hypothesis, this study will focus on comparing Greek and Japanese mythology through the princesses Medea and Pimiko. At first, these princesses might seem to have nothing in common, however after a thorough study, it is possible to see that they are similar in more ways than one. They are, however, not completely identical. This is because some cultural traits truly are unique to a given society. By studying these differences, it is possible to determine what is truly similar between two cultures. However, with the study of mythology, it is considered normal that some information is missing. This can be the result of two deciding factors. The first one is that this piece of information was destroyed at some point in time. The second one is that it never existed in any written form and simply disappeared. This second factor will be discussed at length in this paper.

526	La noblesse castillane et la mer durant la Guerre de Cent ans : étude des récits de voyage du Victorial et du Canarien	"The main purpose of this very text is to study the evolution of the French and Castilian nobilities at the end of the medieval ages through the manuscripts of the Victorial and the Canarian. The development of the nobility’s role is important to see the relationship of some nobles with the oceanic environment and the diplomatic impacts it had created at the beginning of the 15th century. Meanwhile, changes relatively to the relationship between nobility and royalty are also obvious, du to the disruption occasioned by the Hundred Years war. On the other hand, violence at sea also brings an interesting aspect to this study. It helps to understand the upcoming of new responsibilities to the nobles living on the coasts. Finally, the Victorial and the Canarian represent an important side of this work, not only because it shows the stylistic influence of the ""amour courtois"" literary movement, but also because they are posthumous testimony of the life of don Pero Niño and Jean de Béthencourt. All this proves that, even if the implication of nobles into major enterprises among the sea remains very limited, it is very clear that oceanic side becomes a new reality of war and political alliances at the end of the Middle Ages."

527	Étude exploratoire des effets du vieillissement normal lors de tâches réalisées dans un environnement virtuel	Neuropsychological assessments can reveal cognitive changes in normal aging, most notably in the executive system. Moreover, virtual reality seems interesting to observe these changes due to its higher sensitivity and ecological validity. This study aims to understand how virtual tasks can affect both the cognitive workload and performances of elderly subjects, while considering their aptitude with technology. We compared performances of 14 young adults and 11 healthy elderly on standard neuropsychological tests of executive functions and on the Virtual Multitasking Test-2 (VMT-2), a 3D virtual apartment where the subjects must complete tasks similar to those done in everyday life. Descriptive analyses indicated there were no differences among the groups on many variables, such as: scholarship, state of depression and anxiety or cognitive status (Montreal Cognitive Assessment; MoCA). However, elderly subjects performed worse on standard tests (Color-Word Interference Test, Trail Making Test, Zoo Map Test), required more time in the VMT-2, completed less tasks, and reported being more cognitively overloaded as compared to younger ones. Correlation analyses revealed that to execute tasks in the VMT-2, one required processing speed, visual scanning, cognitive flexibility and action planning. We suggest that the difference in performances between the groups in the VMT-2 are related to aging and to the greater difficulties that the elderly experienced when interacting with the virtual environment.

528	Étude de faisabilité portant sur l’évaluation de la production et de la compréhension du langage oral en français	Children learning French as a first language show morphosyntactic competence even before it is taught to them in elementary school (Marquis, Royle et al. 2012). School-aged French native speakers are also sensitive to semantic and morphosyntactic violations (Courteau, Royle et al. 2013). The purpose of this case study is to test the feasibility of using, in children with specific language impairment (SLI), two tests evaluating morphosyntactic production as well as semantic and morphosyntactic violation detection. We evaluated a five-year-old child without SLI who had completed kindergarten and an eight-year-old child with SLI who had completed his second year of elementary school, using a French “ passé compose ” (perfect past) verb production task (Marquis, Royle et al. 2012), and a semantic and morphosyntactic violation detection task in a visual auditory modality with noun phrases (Royle, 2010). Data analysis confirms the possibility of using these tasks with children who have SLI.

529	Validation d'une tâche de classement à l'intérieur du Virtual Multitasking Test (VMT-2) et effets du vieillissement normal	Normal aging is a natural process characterized by cognitive, functional and neuroanatomic changes. Executive functions (EF) are sensible to age effects. A dysfunction in this area is closely related to impairment in instrumental activities of daily living (IADL). To date, traditional neuropsychological evaluation is the most widely used approach for cognitive assessment. However, its low ecological validity is often questioned. Virtual reality (VR) is presented as an interesting alternative because it evaluates the degree of functionality by reproducing more accurately real-life situations. The use of VR technology in the field of cognitive aging is still at its early stages. Thus, the objectives of this research were the following: (1) to differentiate healthy younger and older adults in a sorting task of the Virtual Multitasking Test (VMT-2) and (2) to study the validity of the sorting task regardless of participants’ age, on the one hand, and by controlling for age effect on the other hand. The final sample size (n = 25) included 14 “younger adults” participants and 11 “older adults” participants. Results suggest that elderly took more time to complete the task than younger adults. Significant correlations were also found between VMT-2 measures and performance on neuropsychological measures, especially on executive functioning. However, nuances must be made when we consider the age effect. In conclusion, VMT-2 seems to be a valid tool for cognitive and functional assessment in normal aging. Future research should investigate its utilization with elderly at risk of developing a neurocognitive disorder. This can promote early intervention and thus help maintain functional independence.

530	Construction, diffusion et effectivité des standards transnationaux en matière de responsabilité sociale des entreprises	Attempts at regulating corporations by means of transnational standards have grown over the past several years. In order to better understand this phenomenon, this article thesis studies the institutional processes of standards on corporate social responsibility (CSR). By analysing the crucial phases of the “lifecycle” of a CSR standard, we first study the construction and legitimation processes of two transnational standardization projects. Secondly, we analyse the diffusion processes of a newly created standard which is released in the organisational landscape. Finally, we adopt a macrosocial perspective and focus on the environmental question to reflect on the role and responsibilities of corporations with regards to the current environmental crisis. This research adopts a dynamic neo-institutional framework that focuses on actors and on institutional work aimed at creating, legitimizing, and diffusing a new institutional element. This qualitative research uses a case study methodology and examines the standard ISO 26000– Guidance on social responsibility developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). This private transnational standard, which is not certifiable, was developed between 2002 and 2010. It is aimed at all organizations and covers the main issues of organizational responsibility. The analysis notably relies on numerous interviews with key actors at the international and national level (Germany and Canada).  The first article focuses on the initiation and construction of transnational CSR standards by comparing the inception of the UN Global Compact, a public standard, with the outset of a private standardization project – the ISO 26000. By focussing on the actors and by applying the concept of institutional work, the analysis distinguishes between six forms of institutional work which had been undertaken: the creation of the standard (discursive/substantial), the mobilization of support (internal/external), and the organization of an inclusive space for discussion (consultation/negotiation). On the one hand, the social position of the initiators and of the organization that produces the standard as well as the external conjuncture can either hamper or facilitate the construction of a standardization project. On the other hand, certain forms of institutional work can foster the legitimation of the project. Legitimacy, potentially bestowed by an interested audience, is a necessary condition for the recognition and adoption of the standard by corporations. The analysis reveals the legitimation mechanisms in the initial construction of a CSR standard and shows that the amount of the different forms of institutional work varies depending on the specific conditions of each initiative.  Continuing the analysis of institutional work, the second article focuses on the phase that follows the publication of a new CSR standard and studies the diffusion processes of ISO 26000 in Germany and Canada. The analysis reveals that a standard is not diffused automatically, but that many actors, for the most part having participated in the development of a standard, from various backgrounds (consultants, standards organizations, governments, researchers, business associations), engage to promote the standard. The organization that launched the standard has only a limited influence on these activities, and national contexts have an important influence on a standard which aspires to be transnational. The case of ISO 26000 allows us to categorize different diffusion activities and build a matrix comprising four types of diffusion: diffusion work can be direct or indirect, as well as explicit or implicit. If the adoption of a standard by corporations is one of the consequences of diffusion work, another result can be the integration of ideas and elements of the standard in other CSR initiatives.  Given that environmental responsibility is one of the key topics of corporate responsibility, the third article places the CSR debate in the broader context of environmental problems and the consented efforts to mitigate them. The article evaluates the strengths and weaknesses of the green movement, governments and corporations in environmental reforms to note that nothing indicates a social change which would allow societies to overcome the global environmental crisis. By means of foresight methodology, the article examines the possible impacts of a major oil crisis that would lead to an economic depression in industrialized countries. This involuntary end to the economic growth model would open a window of opportunity for effective environmental reforms. The article ponders the role and responsibility of corporations in such a context. Specifically, it reveals that a responsible corporation would offer models of work reduction and work sharing. The absence of this topic in the current debate on corporate responsibility shows the limits of the dominant CSR discussion.  By analysing the institutional work of actors, this thesis contributes to the understanding of the institutionalization processes of CSR standards. Thereby, it helps us comprehend the phenomenon of voluntary transnational regulation initiatives aimed at making corporations more responsible. At the same time, the thesis shows that the current definition and implementation of CSR does not adequately respond to the current environmental crisis. Therefore, it calls for a reconceptualization of CSR.	diffusion , ISO 26000 , institutional work , institutional creation , legitimation , institutionalization , standardization , corporate social responsibility , transnational regulation , ecological transition , UN Global Compact , postgrowth , transnational governance , environmental reform , CSR	en	20635.0
531	Trouble de stress post-traumatique chez des travailleurs humanitaires de retour de mission : vers une meilleure identification des facteurs de risque et de protection	Humanitarian aid workers (HAW) are defined as the personnel of non-profit aid agencies that provide material and technical assistance in humanitarian relief contexts. Literature suggests that HAW are repeatedly exposed to various sources of stress, including potentially traumatic events (PTE). As a result, they are at high risk of developing mental health problems, including elevated risk for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The aim of the current thesis project is to expand our current knowledge on the different sources of stress encountered during a humanitarian mission and on the predictors of PTSD within an application of the diathesis-stress model to traumatic stress in a sample of 248 expatriate HAW back from a mission for less than a year. A first study focuses on the development and validation of a self-administered questionnaire measuring the level of chronic stress experienced by the HAW during a humanitarian mission. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was used to explore the underlying structure of the 22-item scale and results supported a two-factor structure, corresponding to operational and organizational stress, as proposed in the literature. The psychometrics properties of the scale were analyzed and the findings indicated the CSQ-HAW was a reliable and valid measure of chronic stress encountered by HAW while on the field. The CSQ-HAW significantly correlated with general stress and both posttraumatic stress and depression symptoms. In addition to identifying the most frequent sources of stress and quantifying the degree of stress associated with each stressor, this new instrument may serve as a meaningful tool in screening and preventing psychological distress in HAW. A second study intend to expand the current knowledge on predictors of PTSD within an application of diathesis-stress model to traumatic stress in a sample of 248 expatriate HAW back from a mission for less than a year. More specifically, this study aims to determine the prevalence rate of PTSD and examine the predictive relationship of exposure to PTE, chronic stress, dissociation, Type D personality, social and organizational support on PTSD symptomatology among expatriate HAW. In our sample, 15.8% of HAW reported levels of PTSD symptoms indicative of a PTSD diagnosis. The proposed model accounted for a large portion of the variance (45.0%) in PTSD symptomatology scores. Chronic stress accounted for the largest proportion of PTSD unique variance, followed by dissociation, indirect and indirect exposure to PTEs, and finally social and organizational support. One significant interaction effect was detected between sex and direct exposure to PTEs. Results will be shared with NGO in order to provide them with potential ways to develop specific interventions suitable for their workers.

532	Analyses de simulations magnétohydrodynamiques du cycle solaire	A large set of global magnetohydrodynamical numerical simulations of the solar convection zone are undertaken in order to understand numerous aspects of the solar dynamo. Motivations behind the research presented here lies with the observation of solar phenomenons, namely the existence of a secondary, short period, solar cycle, the differential rotation in the convection zone, and the pole to equator temperature difference. The thesis is separated in 5 sections : a research paper in which the first phenomenon, appearing in an MHD simulation of the solar convection zone, is investigated, a chapter displaying four typical simulations generated from a benchmarking process between two codes, and a second research paper where the relationship between the differential rotation and the latitudinal gradient is explored in the simulations described in the previous chapter. Additionnally, an introduction to the basics of solar physics, and a conclusion in which ideas to projects related to those presented here are discussed, complete the thesis. The first research paper analyze a global MHD simulation of the solar convection generating regular large-scale magnetic cycles for which a secondary cycle with a short periodicity is detected and characterized. With the help of kinematic mean-field αΩ2 solar dynamo models using the turbulent electromotive force extracted from the global model, we discover that this secondary cycle originates from the joint complexity of this force with the differential rotation, rather than dynamical interactions with the inductive flows. A deeper analysis of the simulation generated from the global model reveals a short cycle signature in the temperature field, consistent with helioseismic signatures. These results support the existence of a secondary dynamo process operating in the upper half of the convection zone. The following chapter focus on the elaboration and analysis of four simulations designed in the context of a large benchmarking exercise between ASH and EULAG models. The simulations are identical one to another, except for the presence or absence of a stable layer underlying the convectively unstable one, and the inclusion (or not) of magnetism. An empirical description of the physical characteristics is given. Surprisingly, the addition of a stable layer has an impact as large as, or even greater than, magnetism on the quasi-equilibrium established within the convection zone. Energy flux through the interface is certainly playing a role in these dynamics. The addition of a stable layer on a simulation containing magnetism triggers transitions in the dynamo regime, these not being explained to this day. The second research paper analyzes the impact of a latitudinal temperature gradient beneath the interface on the differential rotation, this gradient establishing itself naturally in the simulations with a stable layer introduced in the preceding chapter. This gradient breaks the Taylor-Proudman constraint, this being explained by the thermal wind balance equation. The natural establishment of the gradient comes from the rotationally-induced latitudinal dependence of convective energy transport and the low thermal diffusivity characteristics in EULAG simulations. These enable the building up and maintenance of a solar-like differential rotation profile a subset of simulations.

533	Négocier la domination autoritaire au Soudan : développement participatif et dynamiques de pouvoir dans la province du Nord Kordofan	In 1989, a coup launched by a coalition of Islamists and military officers implemented a new authoritarian regime in Sudan. Existing theories of authoritarian resilience are unable to fully explain why this regime, which is characterized by its internal instability, has endured for twenty-eight years. The pervasiveness of repression and the repeated failures of the regime in terms of development are especially puzzling. By analyzing the implementation of a policy of participatory development in the province of North Kordofan, the dissertation demonstrates that development does not contribute to authoritarian resilience only when it bears results, but also through its discourses and practices. Launched in 2013, the Renaissance of North Kordofan is based on participatory devices that enable local authorities to extend their power upon the population, while using simultaneously a depoliticizing discourse that portrays the initiative as consensual. This discourse conceals how dissenting voices are silenced and how various vested interests are at play within the projects. It especially makes it possible to avoid talking about the central government’s responsibility in the current economic situation of North Kordofan, even though the government is indeed taking part in the Renaissance. Popular participation is channeled by local authorities to push the central state to fund the initiative. Through this mechanism, a win/win relationship between the two governance levels is implemented, since participation is also a pacification strategy, mitigating the potential threat of popular insatisfaction. The dissertation thus demonstrate that this local development policy contributes to entrench the authoritarian regime. In doing so, it brings new insights about the multidimensional aspect of authoritarian power, which is not exercised nor experienced the same way in all the areas that are subjected to it.

534	L'imaginaire de l'arbre dans le Zhuangzi	The present study delineates the meanings and the specificity of the imaginary of the tree in the Zhuangzi, a proto-Daoist work co-written by multiple authors beginning in the 4th century BCE. The tree imaginary evinces the Zhuangzi’s novelty by presenting a vision of wisdom radically opposed to the prevailing values of the time. Indeed, its principal function is to restore the status of nature vis-à-vis culture. More precisely, the tree imaginary gives expression to the struggle against anthropocentrism by advocating a return to the human being’s natural, instinctive, and authentic qualities – over and against specifically human creations.  In the aim of de-compartmentalizing different ways of philosophizing, the present study bases its theoretical framework on the work of Gilbert Durand, particularly Les structures anthropologiques de l’imaginaire and L’imagination symbolique. Durand restores the imagination’s place in the field of philosophy by destroying the ostensible dichotomy between rationality and the imaginary. He defines the latter as a dialectical activity of the mind as well as the main factor in achieving psycho-social equilibrium.  The Zhuangzi’s tree imaginary calls into question the moral rules governing society as well as discursive logic. The authors criticize the former because they run counter to natural impulses ; the latter, because it produces oppositions that fail to account for reality. The tree also evokes the free blossoming of the natural particularities of each person, a process which goes hand in hand with the acceptance and encouragement of difference. This free flourishing becomes possible only if one transforms the way one regards one’s environment and oneself so as to recognize the value of each being above and beyond one’s own perspective. In other words, this process – designated here by the term “plural vision” – implies embracing and comprehending a plurality of perspectives. Lastly, the tree points to the ultimate stage of wisdom, i.e., mystical strolling, understood as an inner experience of emptying oneself in order to put oneself in unison with the constitutive emptiness of the Dao 道, the immanent generative, transformative, and unifying principle of all things. This experience must be understood in terms of feeling an inner emptiness that is fully free and joyful.   Insofar as the tree illustrates nature par excellence, the present study’s originality consists in revealing the proto-ecological import of the Zhuangzi by bringing out a conceptual kinship among the key themes of the tree imaginary and the aim of better adapting the human being to the environment. Indeed, by completely opposing anthropocentrism and the instrumental vision of nature, the principal themes of the Zhuangzi’s tree lay out a bio-centric vision that can foster a way of being and acting in harmony with nature.

535	Sélection de modèles robuste : régression linéaire et algorithme à sauts réversibles	Model selection and parameter estimation are two main aspects of statistical analysis. This thesis discusses these aspects from a Bayesian point of view via three papers. The first one deals with a computational procedure, named the reversible jump algorithm, that allows to simultaneously select models and estimate parameters. This sampler being difficult to tune in practice, we aim at providing guidelines to users for an optimal implementation. An optimally tuned sampler corresponds to a sampler that generates Markov chains that optimally explore their state space. Our goal is achieved through the optimisation of a stochastic process that corresponds to the limit (in distribution) of the sequence of stochastic processes engendered by the algorithm. In the second paper, a strategy leading to robust estimation of the parameters of a linear regression model in presence of outliers is presented. The strategy is to make assumptions that are more adapted to the eventual presence of outliers, compared with the traditional model assuming normality of errors. This normality assumption is indeed replaced by a super heavy-tailed distribution assumption. Robustness, which is represented by the convergence of the posterior distribution of the parameters (based on the whole sample) towards that arising from the nonoutliers only, is guaranteed when the number of outliers does not exceed a given threshold. Finally, the results presented in the first two papers are combined to introduce a Bayesian robust principal component regression approach that involves model selection in the prediction process. The characteristics of this approach contribute to increase the accuracy of the predictions produced.

536	La profession d'interprète Langue des signes québécoise-français : vers un profil de sortie de la formation	The profession of interpreting between Quebec Sign Language (LSQ) and French has yet to be formally recognized in Quebec, and employees working in this field are not required to have any specific training. Many studies have indicated a general dissatisfaction among users, employers, and even interpreters themselves regarding the skill level within the profession. In the field of education, competency-based learning aims to make training an integral part of professional practice. When designing curriculum using a competency-based approach, the exit profile should be the first point of order. This profile includes the full list of competencies that students should have acquired during their studies. The aim of this thesis, which combines qualitative and applied research, was to establish an exit profile for professional training in LSQ-French interpretation. This was done by gathering and dissecting best practices in professional interpretation through group interviews with three groups: interpreters, Deaf people, and employers. The data was analysed using an inductive approach to identify the professional activities of interpreters and the dedicated resources that these require. Based on the results, the theoretical framework, and survey obtained expert recommendations, this thesis proposes an exit profile consisting of eight principal competencies, associated in turn with a set of skills, knowledge, and attitudes. It ultimately suggests that a program inspired by this exit profile be designed and implemented using a program based approach. This would address the dissatisfaction expressed by interpreters, employers, and the Deaf community and facilitate professionalization in the interpreting field.

537	De l’influence du type de substance injectée sur le comportement du partage du matériel d’injection	Among behaviors considered as public health concerns in the Quebec population, those that concern the abuse or addiction to drugs are major. Intravenous drug use is an essential part of drug use dynamics because this mode of consumption is considered to be a risk for the spread of viral infections, in particular through the sharing of injection equipment. Although this practice has declined in the last two decades in Quebec, it has not disappeared and seems to have stabilized in recent years. Since not all intravenous drug users share their injection equipment, it is important to identify the factors that contribute to the persistence of such behavior in order to develop effective measures that can stem this problem. In addition to the individual characteristics of people who inject drugs and the socioenvironmental contexts in which this consumption occurs, several actors recommend that the influence of substances consumed on injection practices be taken into account. In order to do this, we chose to examine the role and influence that the injected substance may have on the behavior of sharing injection equipment by soliciting the experience of people who inject drugs. Nine participants were selected through four community organizations in Montreal, Quebec and Gatineau to participate in a semi-directed, individual interview on specific episodes of substance use. The objective was to better understand the meaning they give to their injections experiences, with or without the sharing of equipment, as well as the types of sequences and the underlying mechanisms that are at work between the injection of a specific drug and the sharing of injection equipment. This study shows that the influence of the injected substance on injection behavior is considerable and has several aspects. Thus, the chemical composition, physical composition, economic dimensions and cultural norms associated with the various substances act in ways that are either common to all the drugs injected or specific to each of them. In the first case, the sharing of injection equipment seems to be mainly influenced by the centralization of the process of preparation of the injections and by the sharing of the substance consumed between several consumers. In the second, we observe the influence of the degree of confusion induced by the intoxication by a substance, the feeling of urgency resulting from the symptoms related to the suppression of its effects, the frequency of injection necessary to maintain them, and the process of preparation which is sometimes unique to it. Ultimately, the influence of the injected substance on the behavior of sharing injection equipment, and the resulting degree of vulnerability, seems to be due to the combination of these factors, since these factors have the potential to amplify or mitigate each other.

538	Analyse de la pratique des professionnels de la santé à l’égard des maladies fébriles aigües non paludiques au Burkina Faso	In tropical regions, febrile diseases are the main cause of consultation with malaria playing a major role. Many efforts have been made, particularly in Africa, in the fight against malaria with significant progress in recent years. Unfortunately, little attention has been given to the management of febrile diseases other than malaria. There is, in fact, evidence that mortality is higher in the group of febrile patients without malaria than among those with malaria in endemic regions. This is a public health issue that has been further highlighted by the widespread use of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for malaria.  The main objective of this research is to carry out an analysis of the professional practices of healthcare providers in the management of non-malaria acute febrile illness in urban and rural sites in Burkina Faso. Inspired by Schön’s approach, which supports the evaluation of professional practice in the course of action, we have attempted to decipher this practice through clinical vignettes. The general hypothesis of this research is that the professional practice regarding non-malarial acute febrile illness in Burkina Faso is not in accordance to the guidelines issued by the Burkinabe Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization (WHO). A survey of practices, characterized on clinical situations and based on officials’ standards and guides of the Ministry of Health Burkinabè and the WHO, was conducted among 286 Burkinabè healthcare providers.  The use of a linear mixed hierarchical model on the survey data showed limited knowledge about management of non-malaria acute febrile diseases. This gap was more evident at the admission and diagnosis level. The healthcare providers answers from rural areas answered to diagnosis, treatment and the use of antibiotics were more in accordance with official’s standards and guides. Overall, more educated participants had higher scores. Nearly 50% of participants felt that they needed training in at least one of the clinical situations in clinical vignettes. There is a need to strengthen capacity of non-malaria acute febrile illness management of Burkinabè healthcare providers. It can be acheived through continuing education, but also by including this important issue in the basic training courses of primary healthcare providers.

539	Nouvelle thérapie épigénétique dans le traitement du neuroblastome pédiatrique	Pediatric neuroblastoma is one of the most common extracranial cancer in children. Despite an improvement in survival with the currently available therapies, neuroblastoma with an amplification of the transcription factor MYCN has a very poor prognosis. New therapeutic approaches must be developed to increase the survival of patients. One such approach is epigenetic drug therapy. Neuroblastoma, like many other pediatric cancers, contains several epigenetic alterations at the level of DNA methylation and histone modifications. In a screening of FDA-approved drugs, we discovered some molecules having characteristics of epigenetic drugs that were unknown until now. Our study seeks to demonstrate the efficacy of these molecules in the treatment of neuroblastoma cell lines. Following preliminary tests, one of the molecules approved by the FDA stood out: disulfiram, a medication approved for the treatment of chronic alcoholism. We treated neuroblastoma cell lines (MYCN amplified: IMR-32, N91 and SK-N-DZ; MYCN non-amplified: SK-N-AS and SK-N-SH) for 48 hours with disulfiram at clinically relevant concentrations (from 10 nM to 20 µM). Our results demonstrate a 50% growth inhibition (IC50) of 80nM for the cell lines tested. In addition, after analysis by flow cytometry, we found a cell cycle block in G2/M. RNA sequencing also revealed that disulfiram affects a many genes (downregulated n=508, upregulated n=207). We also observed a decrease in the transcription factor MYCN and a reduction in acetylation of several histone marks by Western blot’s analysis. Further studies are underway to determine the mechanism of action of disulfiram. This study shows the potential of disulfiram in the treatment of neuroblastoma.

540	Apport du gène Transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) au diabète induit par les statines	Statins usage increases the risk of diabetes apparition by 11% compared to a placebo [1]. In the present study, we used a genomic approach focused on the TCF7L2 gene, strongly linked to diabetes, to show the relationship with statin-induced diabetes. We used data from two Phase 4 randomized clinical trial studies where statins where used: TNT (Treating to New Targets) and IDEAL (Incremental Decrease in End Points Through Aggressive Lipid Lowering). Both studies compare a high atorvastatin dosage (80 mg) to either a moderate dose or a lower dose simvastatin. The genomic study was performed using the MEGA genotyping chip (Illumina). Statistical results of both studies were combined by meta-analysis. Our results show a 16% increase in risk of new onset of diabetes (p=0.022) in high dosage users, compared to lower dosage users confirming our observations. We show that the T allele of the rs7903146 variant of the TCF7L2 gene has a 29% increase in risk of diabetes at baseline or any time during the study (p=1.98E-13) compared to the C allele in any dosage. No genetic variant in or near the TCF7L2 gene was associated to the new onset diabetes in both high and low statins dosage. Furthermore, the rs7903146 variant was not significantly associated with diabetes aggravation in subjects who had diabetes at study baseline (p=0.266). These results contribute to a better understanding of the role of the TCF7L2 gene and the risk of new onset of type 2 diabetes in statins users.

541	Marco Micone, écrivain-traducteur québécois? : une étude sociographique de ses transitions littéraires	"The present research focuses on Marco Micone, a writer-translator of Italian origins who migrated to Montreal in 1958. His literary production has been the subject of numerous studies, the vast majority of which concern his original writings and, to a lesser extent, his self-translations. His translation-adaptations for the theatre, on the other hand, have been largely neglected. Our research is aimed at filling this gap and suggests exploring Micone’s literary and professional trajectory from a sociological standpoint. Accordingly, the adoption of the sociographical approach (Bourdieu, 1992) sheds light on 1) the interdependence between Micone’s texts (both originals and translations) and the contexts in which they have been conceived; 2) the articulation between Micone’s original contributions, translations and self-translations. Insofar as these different practices of writing have succeeded - and barely overlapped - each other in time, we attach special importance to the transitions marking the passage from one type of writing to another. To do this, we propose a diachronic rereading of Micone’s works, from 1982 to 2008, by situating them in relation to the literary and social fields in which they were inscribed. In addition to the two objectives mentioned above, this approach aims to better understand the habitus of this plurilingual writer-translator, his position in the social and literary fields as well as his complex relationship with literary elites. Ultimately, two original findings emerge from this analysis: his apparent linguistic and literary insecurity – related to a possible ill-assured position within the literary field – as well as his marked taste for experimentation and linguistic hybridity. These two aspects, which cross the whole of his trajectory and give it meaning, originate from Micone's social, political and aesthetic affinities as well as from the status of ""migrant writer"" that was attached to him very early in his career. By integrating a social dimension to migration literature, our case study frees the latter from any romantic interpretation and highlights the tight eligibility criteria which characterize it and influence writers’ cultural production. From a translational point of view, the contribution of our thesis is twofold. First, it demonstrates that self-translation, like translation, can be a way of integrating a new literary national field. Secondly, this study shows that the habitus of a migrant writer-translator, influenced by numerous variables, can be hybrid and more malleable, as it derives from the coexistence of different professions, languages and cultures. Keywords: Marco Micone, sociology of translation, sociographical approach, linguistic hybridity, migration literature, translation-adaptation, self-translation, Québécois theatre."

542	Étude de l’association entre la consommation de cocaïne par épisode de binge et les troubles de santé mentale	Objectives: Although cocaine binges and mental health problems have both been identified as significant risk factors for bloodborne infections and other health hazards, little is known about the relationship between mental health and cocaine binging. Hence, the aim of this study is to examine the association between psychiatric disorders and cocaine binging. Methods: Participants were part of a prospective cohort study of individuals who either smoke or inject cocaine. The main outcome, namely a cocaine binge within the last month, was defined as the repetitive use of large quantities of cocaine until the individual was unable to access more of the drug or was physically unable to keep using. Psychiatric disorders were assessed using the CIDI and the DIS questionnaires. Logistic regression models were performed to examine the association between cocaine binging and psychiatric disorders, adjusting for potential confounders. Results: Of the 492 participants 24.4% reported at least one cocaine binging episode during the prior month. 48.0% of the study population met the criteria for antisocial personality disorder, 45.5% for anxiety disorders, and 28.2% for mood disorders. Participants with antisocial personality disorder were more likely to binge (Adjusted Odds Ratio: 1.73, 95% CI: 1.10-2.73) while those with a mood disorder were not. The association between anxiety disorders and cocaine binging was significant only in univariate analyses. Conclusion: Antisocial personality disorder increased the odds of reporting cocaine binging in our study population. These results highlight the need for a better understanding of the specific dimensions of antisocial personality disorder contributing to the increased risk of unsafe drug use behaviors.

543	L'adénylate cyclase de type 9 favorise le développement de l'athérosclérose chez la souris	A pharmacogenomic study recently showed that polymorphisms in the ADCY9 gene determine the clinical response to the cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitor dalcetrapib in patients suffering from atherosclerosis. Theses variants controlling dalcetrapib response had no effect in patients treated on placebo, suggesting interaction between ADCY9 and CETP activity. The study revealed that dalcetrapib was associated with change in body weight. We then investigated the role of Adcy9 in atherosclerosis development and in lipid metabolism in interaction with CETP. Mice inactivated for Adcy9 showed a 65% reduction in the development of atherosclerosis lesions compared to WT. Atheroprotection in Adcy9-inactivated mice was associated with a protection of endothelial function and a reduced accumulation of foam cells in the atherosclerotic lesion of the vascular wall. Metabolic study during atherosclerosis demonstrated that Adcy9 controls body weight and fat metabolism. These results were associated with an increase in feed efficiency when Adcy9 was inactivated and a modulation of the SNA activity. In transgenic mice expressing CETP, the atheroprotection resulting from Adcy9 inactivation was lost. Atherosclerosis development and body weight variation were the same between mice groups. We concluded that Adcy9 inactivation protects against atherosclerosis, but only in the absence of CETP activity. These results in mice support our pharmacogenomic discovery in patients and emphasize the interaction between of CETP activity and ADCY9 function in the treatment of patients suffering from atherosclerosis.

544	Contrôle d’Accès Sécurisé dans l’Info-Nuage Mobile (Secure Access Control in Mobile Cloud)	Mobile cloud computing has emerged as a promising technology to make use of highly scalable servers in the cloud, and to overcome the limitations of mobile devices. However, because of the risks associated with the security and privacy of enterprises’ stored-data in the cloud, most IT and chief executive officers are concerned about using this type of technology. These concerns are intensified when users/employees tend to use wireless devices (e.g. laptops and smart phones) to stay connected while moving across/outside the enterprise.  In this thesis, we develop new methods, based on Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) technique, to design secure and efficient data access control for mobile cloud. These methods allow data owners (enterprises or individuals) to ensure security of data and provide fine-grained access of data to mobile users using defined policies and constraints. We start by exploring security threats and challenges related to access provision of data stored in the cloud. We identify challenging issues, when attribute-based access control is used by mobile devices, related to anonymity, mobility, and restricted computational resources of devices. To address these issues, we develop three methods; each of them is the subject of one contribution.   The first contribution provides privacy preserving anonymous access of data stored in the cloud. It develops a new statistical anonymity model for ABE, provides cryptanalysis results for existing contributions in anonymous attribute-based encryption, and presents a new multi-authority ABE (i.e. FACS) that anonymizes users’ identities (without trusting any authority or provider). It also extends FACS to EFACS, which enables it to support users’ statistical anonymity. The second contribution provides Location-Based Services (LBSs) for attribute-based access control in mobile cloud. More specifically, it introduces a new multi-authority attribute-based access control scheme (i.e. PPLBACS) that anonymizes users’ identities against malicious authorities and providers. The proposed scheme uses dynamic location of mobile users as a contextual attribute, employs location interval constraints as a policy, and authorizes access to legitimate mobile users. The third contribution provides spatio-temporal anonymity for location-aware access control in mobile cloud. In particular, it presents a new decentralized multi-authority ABE scheme (i.e. IDMA-ABE), which supports intervals for the domains of attributes/policies. Based on DMA-ABE scheme, a new Location-Based Access Control Scheme (LBACS) is proposed. LBACS aims at: (a) supporting coexistence of spatio-temporal attributes as well as static attributes; (b) using range of values (instead of a specific value) for domains of spatio-temporal policies and specific values for other policies/constraints; and (c) protecting users’ identities against malicious Cloud Service Provider (CSP). We also extend LBACS to ELBACS in order to provide untraceability and spatio-temporal statistical anonymity of users without trusting authorities and providers.

545	Thérapie avec hormone de croissance en fécondation in vitro : une étude randomisée contrôlée	IVF protocols are constantly in revision to improve follicular development and increase the number of live births. Studies in mammals have shown that growth hormone (GH) was important for follicular development. The addition of GH could increase IVF pregnancy rates. This study is a randomized, controlled, open label trial including 528 participants into two groups receiving an ovarian stimulation antagonist protocol at the clinique ovo (Montréal). The women assigned to the treatment group will take 2.5mg/d of Saizen® subcutaneously following the patient’s stimulation medication. The primary objective is to determine if the clinical pregnancy rate after a fresh transfer in women receiving GH in addition to GnRH antagonist protocol is significantly higher than the control group. The secondary objectives are the outcomes of the stimulation cycle and pregnancy for fresh and frozen transfers. An analysis was performed in September 2016 to determine the interest of pursuing the study due to “Bill 20” which entails a decrease in recruitment. From June 2014 to September 2016 (date of the interim analysis), 212 patients were enrolled (n= 105 study group, n=107 control group), 96 patients in the study got oocytes retrieval and 98 in the control group. No statistically significant difference was observed in clinical pregnancy rate (33.33% study group VS 40.28% control group, p = 0.405). No statistically significant difference was observed for the mean number of oocytes retrieved (11.57 study group VS 9.65 control group, p = 0.064). The number of freeze all was significantly higher in the study group (15.63% VS 5.10% p = 0.016). All types of transfers, 101 transfers occurred in each group. 21 live birth were observed in the control group and 17 in the study group (p = 0.471). In conclusion, with the current data, the analysis performed cannot allow us to prescribe co- treatment with GH in antagonist protocol in normal-responders women. It is necessary to continue recruitment in order to increase the power of the results before confirming on using GH for these patients undergoing IVF treatments.

546	Médicaliser au féminin : quand la médecine occidentale rencontre la maternité en Chine du Sud, 1879-1938	This thesis examines the medicalization of maternity in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong between 1879 and 1938. By exploring this phenomenon through the medical missionary work carried out in the region, this analysis tries to understand how the medical care of the Chinese parturients and mothers was implemented on the ground, alongside or outside the limited government policies of the time. It highlights the local manifestations of this process and examine it from the perspective of those who are most involved: the women.  The Christian missionaries in Guangdong, especially those belonging to the American Presbyterian Mission, hoped to convert the female population and developed care services that met the Chinese social norms and expectations of gender segregation. In specialized or adapted health facilities, they also organized maternity hospitals, as well as maternal and child health services, which aimed to extend the care before and after delivery. While their efforts may have been partially hampered by the doubly-subordinate position of women in Confucian social organization, the missionaries encountered more than one Chinese society in the south of the country. Some local features may have facilitated their efforts to bring Western medicine to the population. Being less subject to gender segregation and more involved in the family economy than other Chinese women, many women in Guangdong completed medical and nursing training in mission programs. As a result, the medical profession experienced a genuine feminization and sinicization. Moreover, this region of the world proved to be much more conducive to social innovation and women's emancipation than some of the Western countries from which the missionaries came. As the main driving forces in the medicalization of maternity, women (both professionals and non professionals, as caregivers or as patients), did not just passively receive and accept the norms, knowledges and practices of Western medicine. Rather, they negotiated them on the basis of their own socio-cultural values and, by doing so, helped to reshape their contours. In this way, medicalization became, at the same time, a process of naturalization.

547	La monarchie et l’environnement en Alsace et au Canada sous l’Ancien Régime : l’eau, politiques et représentations	In XVIIth Century France, two phenomena tend to modify the relationships between the State and the territory. The first one is the expansion of the kingdom’s borders, due to political and strategical considerations from the metropole. The second phenomenon is the ever-increasing involvement of the State into hydraulic planning, such as the creation of new waterways or the draining of swamps. This valorization of the hydrographic network aims at answering the needs of the French monarchy fort the kingdom, that is to say, to strengthen its power by developing the economy and protecting the territory. Such a trend allows us to raise the question which will be at the heart of this research: how relevant is the management of the environment to the expansion of French sovereignty on newly integrated territories, in Europe and across the Atlantic? To what extent does the management of waterways, with all their assets and constraints, pertain to the integration of said territories? Based on the recent developments of environmental history, the thesis offers to compare Alsace and New France, analyzing the ways these newly acquired territories are appropriated by the French Crown by looking at the interactions between public authorities, populations and environment. The analysis takes into account not only the material aspect of water, but also its cultural, political, social and material dimensions. Doing so, the sources provided by and for the State show that the hydrographic network is taken into account to achieve France’s political, military and economic goals, not only for the conquest, but also for the subsequent administration of territories. Thus, the thesis highlights the part played by the management of the environment in the ways the territory is handled and appropriated: This role is crucial in the case of areas recently attached to the kingdom. Indeed, through its strategy of expansion of its sovereignty, the French State asserts itself as a genuine participant in the handling of waterways, taking manifold measures. The representatives of the royal State, both in the colonies and in the province, contribute to legitimizing the actions of the monarchy and to establishing the king’s authority by controlling both the uses and the material adaptations of the waterways. The wording of the archives, and the measures taken by the central power as well as by its representatives, reveal much about the capacity of action of the populations, a pragmatic aspect that must be taken into account, but also much about the constraints imposed by the hydric environment itself. Thus, comparative hydro-history, as used in this thesis to analyze two very different territories, enables us to reveal the discrepancy between what could be called a perceived environment, upon which general politics and great layout projects are based, and a genuine environment for each area. In both territories, specific characteristics and sometimes contradicting interests go against the plans of the monarchy, therefore forcing it to compromise and adapt.

548	Éléments pour une esthétique de la chair : l'art tel un boucher au temps de la viande libre	Out of the cities, slaughterhouses are places in which cruelty, a cruelty fondamental to our societies, is concealed, remains unseen, as if not existing. There, the animal, led to be slaughtered, is transformed from flesh to meat: its flesh, reified, bloodless and abolished in the process, into a guiltless to be swallowed product. The same thing, the same reification is happening to man. In his relation to technology, in his will to not-see and to screen away, at least from his own gaze, cruelties which hurt him in his flesh, to neutralize all affect, man has become a « thing », « meat in the making », lost himself, mindless, one with the cattle. A new idealism takes him away from material reality – to drive him toward a reassuring abstraction where, so he thinks – without really thinking, he is safe from violence and death. In the face of this numbing and blinding of the mind, art only can awake the flesh to all its ambiguities, its life, and can make visible reality’s repressed cruelty: nor science nor philosophy, which tends to subsume any particular and concrete reality (pain becoming a concept of pain), but an art that represents this reality in a constantly new and changing way. This thesis strives to think theorize conceptualize an aesthetic of the flesh as a potential resurrection of the reified flesh (i.e. meat) by art that concretizes reality. The aesthetic of the flesh (of works of art depicting forms of cruelty) wants to oppose an aesthetic of the meat (the art concealing cruelty, leaving the body to his abstraction, to his free meat). It is the figures, always ever more present as the 20th century advances, of the slaughterhouse, the meat, the techno-reified flesh, in modern literature, philosophy and visual arts (in the works of Kafka, Döblin, Bacon, Franju, Pynchon, etc.), that will help me create and conceptualize this aesthetic of the flesh. Horror produced by these works of art is not vain provocation. But an awareness, a knowledge of a cruelty that we tend, it’s only natural, to repress but that we have to acknowledge if we don’t want to be unknowingly subject to its devise. There is in the horror staged by these works something of a truth, that we have to recognize if we want to go beyond it. The aesthetic of the flesh endeavours to such a truth and its possible, its impossible going further.

549	The Association Between Food Security and Diet Quality Among First Nations Living On-Reserve in Canada	Background: First Nations (FN) experience high levels of food insecurity that greatly exceed those of the non-aboriginal population. Associated with this burden are alarming rates of obesity and nutrition-related chronic disease. Little is known about food insecurity’s relationship to diet quality outcomes for FN living on-reserve. Objective: This study explores the associations between household food insecurity (FI) and poor diet quality for FN adults living on-reserve in 5 Canadian regions (south of the 60th parallel).  Methods: Dietary recall data from the First Nation Food Nutrition and Environment Study (FNFNES), a cross-sectional study, were analyzed using two diet quality indices: a Canadian Healthy Eating Index (HEI) and NOVA, which assesses diet by level of food processing. Regression analyses explored socio-demographic correlates of FI and diet quality. HEI total and component scores and the caloric contribution of NOVA groups and subgroups were compared between food security levels.  Results: FI prevalence was high (35.7%), notably in households with children (40.4%), those where all members are unemployed (45.4%), and those receiving social assistance (55.5%). Sex, age group, and education level were also correlated with FI. The mean total HEI score was low (49.0  12.65). Total HEI mean scores were associated with sex, age group, region, social assistance, traditional food consumption, any household TF activity, and education. They were also significantly higher for people from food secure households compared to FI (49.7 vs. 48.1, respectively), though not after adjusting for socio-demographic variables. After adjustments, FI remained significantly associated with higher intakes of processed culinary ingredients (sugars and plant oils), lower intakes of homemade dishes, and less fruit and vegetable consumption. Conclusions: This study found a small, but significant, relationship between food insecurity and diet quality. Findings also emphasized the need to address income, social assistance benefits and access to traditional foods to improve food security and nutritional outcomes for First Nations.

550	Étude d’impact : analyse des données de fréquence alimentaire, d’activité physique et d’image corporelle chez des enfants d’âge scolaire au Burkina Faso	"A study conducted in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, in 2009 and 2014 assessed the behavior of school-aged children. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of an intervention in schools on dietary habits, physical activity, and attitudes and perceptions towards body image. The nutritional intervention, called the “Nutrition-Friendly Schools Initiative” (NFSI) initiated by the World Health Organization in 2006 to prevent the double nutritional burden, was launched in six intervention schools in Ouagadougou. A baseline study in 2009 collected dietary and socio-demographic data from the six intervention schools as well as from six control schools that were comparable in terms of socioeconomic status (private/public) and geographic location (urban/peri-urban), prior to the initiation of the NFSI. Grade 5 students completed a questionnaire on the frequency of consumption of ""healthy"" foods (fruits, vegetables, meat, fish, legumes) and ""superfluous"" foods (cakes, biscuits, sweets, ice cream, soda), determinants of eating behavior,  body image perception, and physical activity. Similar data were collected in 2014, five years after the initiation of NFSI, among 709 schoolchildren (54,3% girls) in the same 12 schools. The average age of the schoolchildren was 11,6  1,3 years. The analyses revealed an effect of the intervention on the consumption of ""healthy"" foods but not of ""superfluous"" foods. In intervention schools, schoolchildren ate ""healthy"" foods more frequently than in control schools. Schoolchildren who participated in the NFSI showed greater satisfaction with their body image in 2014 than in 2009 (p = 0.030), compared with students in control schools (p = 0.974). Between 2009 and 2014, sports practice increased in both groups of schools, with a higher frequency of practice in intervention schools than in control schools. However, the practice of sport was already higher in intervention schools in 2009, before the establishment of the NFSI. In intervention schools, there was a decrease in the use of active transportation and a higher tendency to watch television and use the computer during the week compared to control schools. This study found improvements in diet, sport practice and satisfaction with body image in schoolchildren. However, the results also showed an increase in sedentary behavior among students. After five years of NFSI activity, it is difficult to establish causal links between the intervention and changes in students’ eating behavior and lifestyle. Thus, future longitudinal school-based studies would be required to assess the impact of the NFSI on student behavior.

551	An approach to improved microbial eukaryotic genome annotation	New sequencing technologies have considerably accelerated the rate at which genomic data is being generated. One ongoing challenge is the accurate structural annotation of those novel genomes once sequenced and assembled, in particular if the organism does not have close relatives with well-annotated genomes. Whole-transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) and assembly—both of which share similarities to whole-genome sequencing and assembly, respectively—have been shown to dramatically increase the accuracy of gene annotation. Read coverage, inferred splice junctions and assembled transcripts can provide valuable information about gene structure. Several annotation pipelines have been developed to automate structural annotation by incorporating information from RNA-Seq, as well as protein sequence similarity data, with the goal of reaching the accuracy of an expert curator. Annotation pipelines follow a similar workflow. The first step is to identify repetitive regions to prevent misinformed sequence alignments and gene predictions. The next step is to construct a database of evidence from experimental data such as RNA-Seq mapping and assembly, and protein sequence alignments, which are used to inform the generalised Hidden Markov Models of gene prediction software. The final step is to consolidate sequence alignments and gene predictions into a high-confidence consensus set. Thus, automated pipelines are complex, and therefore susceptible to incomplete and erroneous use of information, which can poison gene predictions and consensus model building. Here, we present an improved approach to microbial eukaryotic genome annotation. Its conception was based on identifying and mitigating potential sources of error and bias that are present in available pipelines. Our approach has two main aspects. The first is to create a more complete and diverse set of extrinsic evidence to better inform gene predictions. The second is to use extrinsic evidence in tandem with predictions such that the influence of their respective biases in the consensus gene models is reduced. We benchmarked our new tool against three known pipelines, showing significant gains in gene, transcript, exon and intron sensitivity and specificity in the genome annotation of microbial eukaryotes.

552	Étude du rôle de la phosphatase DUSP1 dans la régulation de la réponse immunitaire innée autonome dans les cellules épithéliales pulmonaires lors de l'infection par le virus respiratoire syncytial et le virus Sendai	Introduction: One of the major causes of death worldwide are the lower respiratory infections, particularly those caused by viruses like the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). To defend the host, cells produce an autonomous antiviral response that is mostly dependent on type I/III interferons to limit viral replication. They also secrete proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines to orchestrate the immune response. In order to avoid tissue damage caused by an excessive cytokine production, these responses have to be strictly regulated. Key activators of the host's defense against respiratory viruses are activated by multiple phosphorylation events, making phosphatases important negative regulators.  Results: In this Master's thesis, we study the dual-specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1) and its implication in the negative regulation of the host's response induced by RSV and Sendai virus (SeV). We found that DUSP1 is induced in early RSV and SeV infections in A549 cells and is subjected to proteasomal degradation. We also show that DUSP1 negatively regulates the activation of JNK and p38 MAPKs during SeV and RSV infections. Interestingly, we found that AP-1 activation and subsequent cytokine production were not modulated by DUSP1, potentially due to the protection provided by the JIP1-JNK interaction. Finally, we show for the first time that DUSP1 promotes apoptosis and suppresses cell migration.

553	Caractérisation structurale et biophysique de l’impact de l’acétylation de SUMO1 sur son interaction dépendante de la phosphorylation avec PML	PML-Nuclear Bodies (PML-NBs) formation and dynamics is regulated by an extensive network of post-translational modifications (PTMs), which includes SUMOylation of PMLNB- resident proteins, phosphorylation of SIMs (SUMO-Interacting Motifs) and acetylation of SUMO proteins. Recent studies suggest that acetylation of SUMO proteins regulates PML-NB function, but the precise role of acetylation is still not clear. Using Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) and X-ray crystallography studies, we have investigated the impact of SUMO1 acetylation on its interaction with the phospho SIMs of PML and Daxx. Interestingly, neutralizing the positive charges of K37, K39, K45 or K46 by either acetylation or glutamine substitution significantly decreases the binding affinity towards phospho-mimetic PML-SIMs as measured by ITC, but the decreases are more dramatic with the K39 and K46 variants than with the K37 and K45 variants. In the crystal structures of the phospho-SIMs of PML and Daxx in complex with K46Ac, there are dramatic disruptions of interactions at the binding interfaces, but the changes that occur at the interface appear to be distinct for the SIM involved. The other acetylated variants in complex with the phospho-SIM of PML displayed a more global effect of charge re-organization at the binding interface. Together, our results provide an atomic level description of how SUMO1 acetylation can modulate its interaction with different phospho-SIMs, indicating that there is considerable plasticity in SUMO/SIM interactions and this plasticity could be altered by different types of PTMs in order to regulate distinct cellular functions.

554	H3K27M/I mutations promote context-dependent transformation in acute myeloid leukemia with RUNX1 alterations	Neomorphic missense mutations affecting crucial lysine residues in histone H3 genes have been shown to be initiating mutation in a variety of solid tumors. Despite the high prevalence of H3K27M mutations in pediatric glioblastoma proceeded by the loss of global H3K27me2/3, these mutations have not been studied in human hematological cancers. Using the H3.3K27M/I transgenes we studied the effects of the loss of H3K27me2/3 on normal and transformed hematopoietic cells. We identified oncogenic histone H3K27M/I mutations in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) that led to a significant reduction of H3K27me2/3. The mutation profiles of H3K27M/I patients revealed that these lesions invariably co-occurred with RUNX1 alterations. Expression of H3.3K27M/I in an AML1-ETO9a driven mouse model resulted in accelerated in vitro proliferation and in vivo disease latency. The expression of H3.3K27M in human CD34+ umbilical cord blood cells led to a selective expansion of a primitive hematopoietic progenitor population, but was insufficient to drive leukemogenesis on its own. This demonstrates a collaboration between RUNX1 and loss of H3K27me2/3. In the context of RUNX1 alterations in AML, hypo-H3K27me3 accelerates disease progression. We conclude that H3K27me2/3 has a leukemia suppressive function in RUNX1 mutant and translocated AML. Our findings have the potential to inform the development of a targeted therapeutic strategy for the treatment of RUNX1mut AML patients.

555	Qualité de l'allaitement chez le nourrisson diagnostiqué avec une ankyloglossie suite à une frénotomie linguale	Objectives. To assess breastfeeding efficacy and mother’s nipple pain over time after lingual frenotomy in infants diagnosed with ankyloglossia. The secondary objective is to assess the impact of timing of the procedure and type of frenum on the outcomes. Methods. Healthy infants under 3 months of age diagnosed with ankyloglossia and difficult breastfeeding were recruited for this cohort study at the Montreal Children’s Hospital. Age of infant and type of ankyloglossia according to Coryllos classification were noted and frenotomy was done if indicated. Breasfeeding efficacy using the Infant Breastfeeding Assessment Tool (IBAT) and nipple pain using Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NRS) were recorded at baseline, 7 days and 1 month post-frenotomy. A 6-month telephone follow-up was used to assess length of breastfeeding.  Results. Seventy infants diagnosed with ankyloglossia were included in this study and received a frenotomy. Sixty-one percent were males and the average age at time of the frenotomy was 17 days.  Ankyloglossia of type 2 (41%) was the most common, followed by type 3 (38%), type 1 (17%) and type 4 (4%). In all types, IBAT and NRS scores improved significantly between baseline and 7 days (p<.001) and between 7 days and 1 month (p<.001). Fifty-five percent of infants were 14 days or less. Infant age at the time of frenotomy and frenum type were not significantly correlated to breastfeeding scores or pain rating. Conclusions. A significant improvement of IBAT and mothers's NRS in infants presenting with ankyloglossia and breastfeeding difficulties were observed after frenotomy, regardless of the timing of the procedure and type of frenum. Ankyloglossia should always be examined in infants with breastfeeding difficulties, and frenotomy may be considered by healthcare providers.

556	Le syndicalisme au Québec, enjeux de représentation des membres d’origines ethnoculturelles diverses	This Master’s paper focuses on the various issues surrounding ethnocultural minorities’ participation and representation in Quebec trade unions. The aim of this research is to better understand the determining factors that underlie the implication of ethnocultural minority members within trade unions, as well as to assess the impact of these determinants on the level of inclusion within these organizations. This analysis of trade union inclusiveness and of their associated practices taken in relation to the participation of minority group members was inspired by Poutignat’s typology of trade union practices aimed toward diversity.  In this research, a two-phase approach was adopted. At first, with the objective of filling a major statistical gap regarding ethnic minority representation, the researcher gathered descriptive statistical analysis in order to establish the current state of affairs. Subsequently, twelve semi-directed interviews were conducted with members, representatives and employees of a Quebec-based trade union, this with the intention of identifying the inner workings of minority group member participation within trade unions.  Firstly, our analysis has shown that immigrants are underrepresented within trade unions. The individuals that are most strongly affected are those who have been living in Quebec for less than 10 years, independently of sex, scholarship and employment sector. The Haitian community is the only group in which these statistical findings do not apply. People from this community are not characterized by an underrepresentation in unions, although, conversely, their unionization rate is higher than the reference group i.e. people of French and English Canadian descent. Secondly, three key findings have emerged from the interviews that were conducted. On one hand, people belonging to an ethnic minority are confronted with specific issues that are less likely to affect individuals from the majority ethnic group. On the other hand, three types of determinants appear to have an impact on the participation of people from an ethnic minority group : micro (individual), meso (workplace), and macro (trade union center). Finally, the results of this research suggest that the presence of a significant ethnic minority group and the activism that certain minority group representatives may display are the two main factors that determine the adoption of an inclusive stance by a trade union.

557	Essai sur la radicalité : les violences faites contre soi	This thesis aims to understand political radicalism through the study of self violence. I worked with three ideal types of violence : the mystical, the ascetic and the charismatic one. In order to analyze these types of political violence, I developed the idea of « way of being in the world » which refers to a particular set of mind, a way of understanding the world and shaping it. The notion gathers, among other things, a political imaginary, a scale of values, a specific cosmogony and a set of choices and acts, which can be violent or not. To elaborate this point and to link it with the concept of self violence, I selected three cases : Mohammed Atta embodies the mystical violence, Bobby Sands and Catherine de Sienne illustrate the ascetic violence and the PKK pictures the charismatic violence.

558	L’adaptation des travailleurs sociaux en contexte de réorganisation du réseau de la santé et des services sociaux	This thesis explores how social workers in Quebec adapt to organizational change. Mainly it aims to understand the adaptation experiences of the professionals within the health and social services network during the reform, in which was caused by Bill 10 (Act to modify the organization and governance of the health and social services network, in particular by abolishing the regional agencies) (Assemblée nationale du Québec, 2015). Through a qualitative perspective, twelve social workers of the health and social services network of the region of Montreal, participated in a semi-structured interview. Schlossberg's mutli-dimensional model (2011), the 4 S's (situation, self, support and strategies) has been used as conceptual framework. This model allows us to understand the adaptation of the person in process of change. Furthermore, this study helps us to understand the importance of change management in process of adaptation because the impacts can be significant at the personal, professional and organizational levels.

559	Bonheur et politique : une étude comparée des provinces canadiennes	This paper builds on happiness studies, and strives to explain the disparities of life satisfaction levels between Canadians. Since 1985, the well-being level expressed by Quebecers has risen considerably more than in other Canadian provinces. Political factors partly explain these provincial gaps, as well as the growth observed in Quebec. Left-wing politics positively affect the overall pursuit of happiness. The reach of the welfare state, the degree of economic regulations and the strength of labour unions movements explain, to some extent, the gap between life satisfaction levels amongst the Canadian federation. The Quebec model, distinct from the rest of Canada, has dealt rather well with the shifts of the previous decades.

560	Recherche de quarks vectoriels produits par l'échange de gluons lourds dans le cadre de modèles de Higgs composite avec le détecteur ATLAS	Being the missing piece of the Standard Model (SM) for decades, the Higgs boson was finally observed by the ATLAS experiment in 2012. Despite this discovery, it is justified to think that the SM is an effective theory at low energy scale, and one of the physics goal of the ATLAS experiment is to understand the origin of the electroweak symmetry breaking which the SM fails to explain. The technical and logistic challenges necessary for such a discovery makes the ATLAS detector one of the most sophisticated apparatus in the world. As a multipurpose detector, the ATLAS detector is built to investigate physics Beyond the SM and discover new particles. Composite Higgs models (CHM) are extensions to the SM that shed light on some problems left open, such as the mass hierarchy problem. Composite Higgs models also predict the existence of new particles such as vector-like quarks (VLQs). As one the simplest extension to the SM particle content VLQs are actively search for at the LHC.  This thesis presents the results obtained in the search for the single production of VLQs $\BH$ of charge $-1/3$ through the exchange of a heavy gluon $G^*$. Based on a simplified minimal CHM, the search is performed for the process $pp \to G^* \to \BH\bar b/\bar B_\text{H}b \to H\bbbar \to \bbbar\bbbar$. The dataset corresponds to 19.5~$\fb$ of $pp$ collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt s = 8$~TeV. No significant excess of events with respect to SM predictions is observed. Therefore upper limits on the cross section times branching ratio are set. Using a specific benchmark model, a lower limit of 2.0~TeV on the $G^*$ mass is obtained when $\mg = 2\mb$.

561	Styles de soutien des superviseurs de recherche : relations avec les attitudes et le bien-être des étudiants gradués	The research supervisor’s support is key to the success in higher-level studies (Howells Stafford, Guijt, & Breadmore, 2017). The quality of the relationship between a student and his/her advisor is often claimed to foster student satisfaction and to encourage degree completion (Schlosser, Knox, Moskovitz, & Hill, 2003). However, support remains a construct that is operationalized in many different ways. It is thus difficult to prescribe specific behaviours supervisors should adopt to optimize support offered to students. This study examines how different supportive or unsupportive behaviours relate to graduate students’ wellbeing and attitudes towards research. 203 graduate students were recruited to complete an online survey measuring their perceptions of the support they received from their supervisor and their own wellbeing and attitudes towards their studies. Whereas the hypotheses predicted that different demonstrations of support (affective and instrumental) would be linked differentially to student outcomes (satisfaction, engagement, wellbeing, etc.), results show that instrumental support explains a larger part of the variance of the outcomes. However, it is micromanagement that best explains undesirable states such as negative affect and work related strains. Supportive behaviours (affective and instrumental) and micromanagement are statistically distinct, suggesting the latter may exert a harmful influence despite other demonstrations of support towards students. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.	Satisfaction , Engagement , Supervisor support , Graduate students , Wellbeing	en	20329.0
562	Les implications normatives de la conceptualisation de l'anorexia nervosa	Anorexia nervosa is defined as a mental illness per se, according to DSM-5, but this definition may involve late treatment of the eating disorder. Since anorexia nervosa is a mental illness with a high mortality rate, it is necessary to review the conceptualization of this mental disorder.  My hypothesis is that the concept of anorexia nervosa is normative and harmful for people with this disorder. To explore this hypothesis, we have to review the epistemological questions about the concept of species in  philosophy of psychiatry. It will be a question of defining whether anorexia nervosa is a natural species or a human specie, a concept as presented by Ian Hacking.   I will explore the idea that anorexia nervosa is not only a human species, but also a transient mental disorder. If this disorder is a transient mental disorder, then what can it relate to? With what we know of the general behaviors of anorexia nervosa, it is possible to establish ontological tracks for a redefinition of the disorder. I will question self-control and autonomy in the person with this disorder based on the theories of George Ainslie and Alfred Mele.  Since we can not consider people with anorexia nervosa to be autonomous, we must help them with psychological support. I will propose an expanded conceptualization of anorexia nervosa and discuss pragmatic and conceptual advantages in considering anorexia nervosa as an obsessive-compulsive disorder.

563	L’auteur authentique et son contraire chez Søren Kierkegaard	"As a religious author, Søren Kierkegaard was greatly interested in the question of communication, since his subject of predilection is marked by paradox: it is impossible to directly share the certainty which lies at the heart of intimacy and yet, it was necessary for him to talk about it, in order to confront a superficial Christianity that no longer perceived the problem of ""becoming Christian"". Within this thought, oriented towards subjectivity, he questioned himself less about the communication of objective knowledge than about that of a power: to become a singular individual, whose interiority is accessible to God. He developed his communication dialectic through the criticism of contemporary authors; thus he indirectly put his own writing to the test. In order to situate Kierkegaard's literary criticism, it is important, first and foremost, to highlight the commentary he made on his time, in which the socio-cultural conditions undeniably influenced the authors, especially those whose personalities were not well enough established to emancipate from them. The phenomenon of levelling in the era of the masses generates an ephemeral literature that pushes authors to conform to the ""demands of their time"", issued by the abstract entity of the ""public"". Such a state of affairs sparks confusion, but did not prevent some writers from developing a completely personal life-view, acting as a ""center of gravity"" for authentic work."

564	L'équilibre du sens : vers un concept phénoménologique de norme chez Maurice Merleau-Ponty	Although philosophers may first find it odd to speak of norms in the context of perception, the argument for normativity finds support in the writings of some of the spearheads of the phenomenological tradition, amongst them Edmund Husserl and Maurice Merleau-Ponty. In what follows, I draw on Maurice Merleau-Ponty’s existential phenomenology to conduct research on the topic of normativity in perception. However, a phenomenological analysis of perception’s normative claim requires that we redefine our traditional conception of norms as authoritative standards or prescriptive moral guidelines: phenomenologists hold that prior to any theoretical or moral engagement with the world, certain sets of norms already play a role at an embodied, pre-reflexive level and account for our ability to orientate ourselves in the intersubjective world. To this end, I argue that a set of embodied norms open up horizons of experience through a normative structure of apprehension that shapes both the existential possibilities we conceive of and the nature of our engagement with the world. My research focuses primarily on Merleau-Ponty’s notion of spatial and existential norms, as this notion helps shed light on the extatic temporality of bodily commitments carried through in personal and subpersonal layers of experience. In view of these commitments, I examine the transformative promise of experiences of bodily disorientation and their relevance in bearing witness to the fundamental vulnerabilities of embodied existence. Lastly, I am interested in the agential and ethical consequences of aknowledging these vulnerabilities and in the existential transformations they can prompt.	perception , orientation , Edmund Husserl , Maurice Merleau-Ponty , phenomenology , normativity , norms , embodiment , temporality , identity	en	20290.0
565	Rôle de la GTPase ARF6 dans la prolifération cellulaire	Although it is vital in normal physiological conditions, cell proliferation, when poorly controlled, could contribute to the pathogenesis and progression of serious diseases such as atherosclerosis and cancer. In this study, we demonstrate that the GTPase ARF6, classically known for its role in endocytosis, plasma membrane-endosomal trafficking and actin remodeling, controls cell proliferation at two different levels of the cell cycle, G1 phase and mitosis. First, in a cardiovascular context, we show that ARF6 controls AngII-induced ROS production by positively regulating Rac1 activation and NOX1 expression. ROS act as mediators to promote the transactivation of EGFR and the activation of the three MAP Kinases ERK1/2, p38MAPK and JNK1/2 inducing the expression of genes required for G1/S transition and proliferation. Second, we show that ARF6 plays an important role in the last phase of the cell cycle, mitosis. Indeed, ARF6 is required for the stability of microtubules (K-fibres) and the proper positioning of chromosomes at the metaphase plate allowing SAC satisfaction, triggering of cyclin B ubiquitination, its degradation and chromosomal segregation (anaphase). Finally, by studying the mTOR pathway in ARF6 depleted cells, we characterized a new regulation of this pathway during mitosis. We demonstrate that the kinases p85S6K1 and S6K2 are activated in a CDK1-dependent manner to phosphorylate the ribosomal protein S6 during mitosis.

566	Caractérisation immunogénétique des cellules dendritiques non-conventionelles dans un contexte auto-immun	Dendritic cells (DC) play a key role in the immune system by bridging the innate and adaptive immune system using their Antigen Presenting Cell (APC) function. They can be subdivided into several subsets with distinct features, which are involved in either tolerogenic or inflammatory processes. Variations in the in vivo number of those DC subsets have been associated with genetic susceptibility to certain diseases, such as autoimmune diabetes.  However, proving a causal connection from these correlations remains a challenge, as we have not identified the factors involved in the specific regulation of the DC subsets number, limiting our ability to modulate theses phenotypes independently. Thus, we aimed to identify genetic determinants responsible for the specific regulation of DC subset numbers using linkage analysis in mice, to then determine if autoimmune diabetes susceptibility varies following DC subset modulations.  We have shown an increase in pDC number in NOD mice, which is genetically susceptible to autoimmune diabetes. This phenotype is regulated by a dominant locus on proximal chromosome 7, but it not associated with diabetes incidence in congenic mice. In contrast, we also observe an increase in the number of a novel DC subset, termed mcDC, which is regulated by a distal chromosome 2 interval. This locus, termed Idd13, is also associated with diabetes genetic susceptibility, suggesting a vital role of mcDC in disease, possibly through their T cell anergy reversal function.    These results show that DC subsets are regulated by distinct determinants.. Despite the correlation between pDC/mcDC number and autoimmune diabetes susceptibility, our results demonstrate a divergent contribution of DC subsets to pathogenesis. We shall investigate further to refine genetic intervals and identify the candidates genes involved in the regulation of both pDC and mcDC in vivo number.	immunologie , Dendritic cells , Auto-immunity , Genetics , Diabetes , Immuno-deficiency	en	20265.0
567	Impact du stress oxydant et de l'inflammation sur le métabolisme intestinal des lipides et les fonctions mitochondriales dans la fibrose kystique	Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a lethal monogenic disease that predominantly affects Caucasians. It results from the mutation of the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR) gene. The deficiency in essential fatty acids (EFA) is classical and is associated with intestinal lipid and liposoluble vitamin malabsorption that is extremely difficult to control. Oxidative stress (OxS) and inflammation could participate in the occurrence of these lipid disorders by involving the mitochondria, a key organelle of redox homeostasis. The hypothesis of this work is that the deletion in the CFTR gene is associated with oxidative, inflammatory and mitochondrial perturbations, and alters intestinal lipid metabolism in CF. The specific objectives are to characterize the oxidative and inflammatory profile, to evaluate the functioning of mitochondria and to identify the modulation of lipid metabolism in the intestine. The CFTR gene deletion in Caco-2/15 intestinal epithelial cells was performed using the innovative Zinc Finger Nuclease transfection method, which allowed the generation of a CFTR (-/-) knockout cell line. Our results demonstrate the presence of an oxidative and inflammatory profile related to CFTR deficiency. Mitochondrial dysfunctions such as DNA oxidative damage, energy metabolism derangement and susceptibility to apoptosis are probably the result of the downregulation of PGC1α and NRF2 transcription factors, as they represent the dominant regulators of mitochondrial biogenesis and transcription of antioxidant response elements. The lipid profile is in favor of exaggerated lipogenesis, increased lipid synthesis and lipoprotein overproduction. These results underline mitochondrial dysfunction arising solely from the CFTR gene defect but, on the other hand, they suggest that the typical lipid transport abnormalities of CF patients result from the entanglement of various factors such as mucus abnormalities, morphological aberrations in the intestinal epithelium, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and irregular liver bile acid metabolism.

568	Implication des inhibiteurs de PARP dans le cancer de l’ovaire	Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the most lethal gynaecological cancer in North America. Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase (PARP) inhibitors have been used to improve treatment; two of which including Olaparib are approved by the FDA. Olaparib demonstrates good efficacy (30% response) as a single agent for patients with ovarian cancer and even more so for those with a mutation in the BRCA1/2 (45%) genes. This result was explained as a consequence of synthetic lethality between the mutants BRCA1/2; which are the principal actors of the DNA repair system by homologous recombination (HR), and the inhibition of PARP, which is the main actor of DNA repair by base excision repair (BER). In patients with no BRCA1/2 mutation (25%), the observed response is also explained by an effect of synthetic lethality, but this time due to either a decline in BRCA1/2 gene expression or the inhibition of other proteins specific to HR (BRCAness effect). In contrast, 55% of BRCA1/2 mutated patients did not respond to treatment. The overall response is only 30%, while 50% of high-grade serous (HGS) EOC patients have an HR deficiency. To try to explain this contradiction, this thesis seeks to define and improve the response to Olaparib in the HGS EOCs. First, a model was developed to study the different responses to PARP inhibitors. To the 12 pre-existing EOC HGS cell lines in the laboratory, 6 new lines presenting with characteristics specific to PARP inhibitors response were characterized and added [TOV2978G, TOV3041G, TOV3291G, OV866 (2), OV4453 (recurrent BRCA2 nonsense mutation of germinal origin) and OV4485 (splice-site mutation BRCA1)]. From this cell model, a new predictive pattern of susceptibility to Olaparib was determined. The idea presented is that the responding patients have an HR deficiency (BRCAness) but that it must be combined with a NER or MMR deficiency. Despite efforts to target these patients and to produce new, more effective PARP inhibitors, the overall response is still around 30%; cases of acquired resistance are increasing and drastic maintenance treatment is still the only way to obtain a clinical response. All this has led us as a third objective to focus on the type of cellular fate induced by the PARP inhibitors allowing us to determine a combination therapy for an improved response. We demonstrate that Olaparib leads to a reversible senescent state in the HGS EOC cell lines despite their TP53 mutations. This condition can be targeted by senolytics (mainly a Bcl2 / Bcl-XL inhibitor) to create a synergistic response when combined with PARP inhibitors. The in vivo experiments confirm the efficacy of the therapeutic combination. This work has contributed to the better identification of patients who are able to respond to PARP inhibitors and to determine a new and particularly effective combination therapy.	mutation BRCA , Olaparib , NER , MMR , high-grade serous , ovarian epithelial , cell line , BRCA mutation , PARP inhibitors , Olaparib , DNA repair , NER , MMR , senescence , cell cycle arrest , therapeutic combination	en	20221.0
569	Évaluation de politiques de séquençage d'arrivées d'avions par Simulation Monte Carlo	With the air traffic increase, airport runway management is becoming a critical issue both at the operational and safety levels. Runways have limited capacity and a minimum separation distance must be maintained between two consecutive aircrafts during both takeoff and landing phases due to wake turbulences. The minimum separation between two aircrafts depends on their size, influencing their sensitivity to turbulence. As a result, the ordering of takeoffs and landings affects the minimum total waiting time for a sequence of takeoffs or landings, as well as the delays imposed on passengers. Various scheduling policies have been proposed to reduce the delays, usually based on heuristics as the sequencing problem is NP hard. In addition, little attention is usually paid to the random factors influencing take-off and landing times. We focus on landings as they are more critical than takeoffs and propose a discrete event simulation tool to evaluate different landing scheduling policies, taking account of the operational constraints on separation as well as the uncertainties on the arrival times in the airport area. We then compare several popular policies, based on various measures of performance. Contrary to the usual assumption of deterministic flight durations, we consider the noise between the expected arrival time and the realized arrival time and examine the impacts on the scheduling performance.

570	L'adaptation de l'image ﬁxe à l'image animée : une approche de recherche-création pour le cinéma d’animation d'auteur	HARVEY is a graphic novel that I illustrated in 2009. As I am adapting this illustrated book into an animated film, I want to question the transfer between these two media within the context of a research-creation study. Which elements of the original source will be kept, modified or excluded in this process? With the research part, my intention is to delineate the adaptation process from a first visual system (the graphic novel) towards a second visual system (the animated short), specifically in terms of aesthetic exchange between a still and an animated image, and in the light of adaptation theories. Besides supplying the creative elements from my process (moodboard, story-board, posing layout and animatic), the creation part also integrates an experimental component as a way of testing theories advocating the expansion of the creative gesture. Through this work, I demonstrate that graphic autoadaptation towards animation is a suitable practice for the exploration of a method of researchcreation, and that this approach always hinges on the navigation of tensions between the control of a message, the media specificities, and the inherent narrativity within the story that is adapted.

571	Jouer le Gouverneur : analyse du rapport émotionnel au système dans le jeu vidéo de gestion	This master thesis focuses on the emotional connection with the system in management video games. First, an understanding of what is a management game within the multiple genres that constitute the video game industry is conducted. The historical creation of the genre will then be studied by highlighting the lack of research for that specific kind of games. The goal is to understand how immersion works to create an emotional connection with the system. The system is the center of our player’s experience and makes possible playing the role of the governor in the simulation. This role is the link between the system and the community that has to be managed. Finally, game examples with different emotional connections are studied to show that management stays central to the experience of the genre even if the player doesn’t have the same emotional connection with one game and the other.

572	Le cinéclub comme institution du public : propositions pour une nouvelle histoire	The public of movies, i.e., the historical and social interlocutor of cinema reception - excluding the abstract, epistemic figure of the spectator – is not often present in most of the historical or theoretical researches on cinema. Film societies, which we propose as an institution created by the public, even less; they are practically forgotten in academic texts. It is this institution and the public that creates it the object we want to study from three different cases: the process of formation of the public which occurs simultaneously with the development of proto-cineclubists and films societies forms – in a period that coincides with that of the so-called pre-cinema, till early cinema or cinematography of attractions. Then we examine the transition period, or institutionalization process which leads to the formation and subsequent institutionalization of film societies. Finally, in a completely different context, we try to show the role of film societies in a moment of civil resistance when they are an essential part of civil society empowerment and its influence in the fall of the Brazilian military dictatorship. This study is presented in five parts. The Introduction situates the problem and briefly shows how it has been treated. Chapter 2 examines the formation of the public and the forgone forms of film societies. The following chapter (3) shows the constitution of the first film societies, concurrent and within the institutionalization process of the cinema. Chapter 4, from a totally different context, searches the same characteristics of public organization in the resistance of Brazilian civil society to the military dictatorship (1964-1985).

573	Les représentations de la religion et du fait religieux dans le Journal de voyage de Michel de Montaigne (1580-1581) et les Essais (1580-1595)	This research seeks to demonstrate the impact of Michel de Montaigne’s journey through  Switzerland, Germany and Italy (1580-81) on the philosopher’s life and the writing of the final  versions of his famous Essais. To do so, this master’s thesis will analyze and compare  Montaigne’s representations of Christian and pagan architecture, religious agents and  ceremonies in the Journal de voyage and those exposed in the subsequent editions of the Essais.  The analysis of the evolution in Montaigne’s descriptions of different christian confessions and  ancient religions will allow us to determine the impact of his travel experience in time and space.

574	Entre genre, race et nation : vers une nationalité hybridée : le cas des métis franco-vietnamiens «abandonnés» en Indochine française lors de l’entre-deux-guerres	"The ""Métis question"" in French Indochina is a complex subject which several authors have studied, but which still constitutes a rich field of research and analysis for historians of colonization. This thesis attempts to explore the multiple dialogues and interactions between the French-speaking urban Indochinese public sphere and the metropolitan colonial powers with regard to the treatment of Franco-Vietnamese mixed-race children considered ‘abandoned’ in the inter-war period. This study brings to light the political usurpation of the Métis question by the French authorities to reinforce colonial legitimation to further perpetuate their system of domination. In this process, several journalistic reflections, testimonies and objects of propaganda were confronted by the official governmental discourse in order to draw up a holistic and synthetic picture of the multiple ambiguities inherent in the deployment of the French colonial strategy in Southeast Asia: the « mission civilisatrice »."

575	Cycle des nutriments dans les mares d’une tourbière ombrotrophe du sud du Québec	Open-water pools are common features in northern peatlands but their nutrient biogeochemistry has seldom been studied. The goal of this thesis is to understand the nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and carbon (C) cycles in pools of an ombrotrophic peatland located in southern Québec and to determine the environmental factors controlling such cycles. The relationship between pool water chemistry and their physical and biological characteristics were studied. Pool characteristics significantly explained 28.2% of the variation in water chemistry. Of this, 81.9% and 14.8% were respectively explained by pool depth and the dominant vegetation type surrounding the pools. Shallow pools had higher C and N concentrations than deep pools. Organic C (OC) from pools where vegetation was dominated by coniferous trees was also more recalcitrant to decomposition than OC from pools where vegetation was mainly composed of mosses. The influence of depth on pool biogeochemistry was confirmed by a seasonal survey of pools of different sizes. Over the course of the 2016 growing season, nutrient biogeochemistry from shallow and deep pools significantly evolved differently. All summer long, P concentrations were low in all pools, indicating that ombrotrophic peatland pools are P-limited. My work has shown that water chemistry in a rain-fed peatland is not only determined by atmospheric inputs, but also by internal biogeochemical processes. This study highlights the complexity of these environments.	Biogeochemistry , Open-water pools , Peatlands , Nutrients , Nitrogen , Phosphorus , Carbon , Limnology	en	20140.0
576	Les particularités stylistiques d'une langue non-métaphorique : Andromaque de Jean Racine	An inquiry on the particular status of metaphor in French poetry and theatre in the second half of the 17th Century, our study is organized around three goals. In our first chapter, we show that this rhetorical figure was the object of numerous discussions throughout the Grand siècle, and that a conscious effort to eliminate it or reduce it to a cliché had already begun to manifest itself at the beginning of the century, not only in the form of literary criticism, but also in the work of various authors. We dedicate our second chapter to the poetry of Racine, which we approach by analyzing three dominant rhetorical figures in the Andromache, his first great success, the powerful presence of which might be attributed to its way of compensating for the lack of original metaphors. In our third chapter, a comparative analysis between two hypotyposes in Racine and one in Victor Hugo will permit us to prove, with respect to the use of metaphor, one of the significant differences between classic and romantic aesthetics, which succeeds the former.

577	Le vieillissement des groupes linguistiques au Québec	The demographic and linguistic landscape of Quebec has been constantly evolving for many decades. The aging and linguistic issues are two of the main concerns of the Government of Quebec. The atypical characteristic of this Canadian French-speaking province, surrounded by English-speaking territory, has been the subject of numerous studies. The objective of this research is to analyse the differences in demographic ageing of each language group but also the age effects on the linguistic mobility. Linguistic indicators such as the mother tongue, the language spoken at home, and the working language will be used, and age will be the key demographic variable of this analysis. The Canadian censuses of 1971 and 2006 will provide the data to calculate the different demographic ageing indicators such as the average age, the dependency ratio and the replacement index. This analysis shows that the French-speaking group is the oldest but also the one who ages the fastest. The mobility linguistic is also discussed. This leads us to conclude that language transfers are significant mainly during childhood. After the age of 40, they are very rare. Generally, linguistic mobility is low and its impact on the demographic ageing is negligible.

578	Considérer les écarts de conduite dans le processus de réadaptation : comment les intervenants adaptent-ils le cadre général de l’intervention à la résistance des jeunes délinquants à haut risque de récidive?	High-risk offenders often exhibit a low level of commitment and resistance to intervention during their rehabilitation process (Motiuk and Serin, 2001). In order to better adapt the general framework of the intervention to the specific resistance of the most problematic youths, field specialists use an experiential knowledge still largely unknown of the research’s field (Le Blanc and Trudeau-Le Blanc, 2014). Using a qualitative method design, this project examined 110 high risk youth offenders’ clinical records in a variety of settings over a 10-month period. The principal objective is to understand how the general intervention framework is adapted according to certain specific resistance patterns presented by youth offenders during the rehabilitation process. Based on the perspective of youth educators, this present paper proposes certain lines of thoughts concerning the framework of general intervention, the dynamics of resistance and the specific interventions in place. Results demonstrate how different context of rehabilitation and the characteristics of high-risk youth offenders trend towards more surveillance or autonomy granted to the youths, with consideration for their resistance. The disruptive behaviours are interpreted in accordance with three main forms of resistance: instrumental, oppositional and inertial. While low mobilization redirects intervention towards more surveillance measures, collaboration provides more attention towards autonomy during the rehabilitation process. Based on youth worker’s perspective, this paper proposes certain implications concerning the general intervention framework, the dynamics of resistance and the specific interventions.

579	Exploration des facteurs contraignants et facilitants, perçus par des professionnels de la santé, à l’implantation d’une unité collaborative d’apprentissage en milieu clinique	In Quebec, the teaching and learning models in clinical settings used for clinical training of nursing students are the preceptorship and group model (Ha and Pepin, 2008). Although these models have several advantages, they also have some limitations (Budgen and Gamroth, 2008). It is therefore pertinent to explore the possibility of implementing a complementary model to these current models. Consequently, the collaborative learning unit (CLU), developed and implemented in British Columbia, has some interesting characteristics (Lougheed and Galloway Ford, 2005). However, to date, no studies have been conducted in Quebec on this model. The purpose of this study was to explore the constraining and facilitating factors perceived by health professionals engaged directly or indirectly in the clinical training of nursing students when it comes to implementing a CLU in the clinical setting.       In this exploratory study, five health professionals each participated in an individual interview while nine health professionals participated in a focus group. A semi-structured interview guide was used. The terms of reference guiding this study was Love's Intermediate Level Theory in Nursing (2014) and the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (2007) paper on changing practices in health.       In light of this study, it is possible to group the constraining factors for the implementation of a CLU recording to three different themes: non-adaptation of the UCA model to the Quebec context, organizational context unfavorable to the implementation of a UCA and concern about the level of autonomy and shared responsibility of the student in an UCA. Facilitating factors are presented in three themes: adaptation of the model of the UCA to implement it in the Quebec context, organizational context favorable to the establishment of a UCA and opportunities related to autonomy and the shared responsibility of the student in a UCA. The results of this study were used to formulate recommendations for the nursing practice, education and research.

580	Negotiating the frontier between computer-assisted composition and traditional writing : the utility of each and their effective cross-integration	While computers have had a major influence on music composition, both through electroacoustic music and computer-assisted composition (CAC), there can remain a divide between those pursuing more traditional writing techniques (intuitive composition done by hand) and those incorporating algorithmic elements in their music. The following is an exploration of some of the ways to produce smoother intersections between the worlds of intuitive writing and computer-assisted composition, through the use of a number of different computer-assisted composition software and practises. These range from situations where the computer provides little more than a gentle nudge or a pool of information from which to draw, to situations where, through the user’s input, the computer exerts a high degree of control on the final musical information. Works by Matthew Lane will demonstrate the use of some of these technologies, alongside detailed explanations of how they were incorporated. A first section will look at composition and programming techniques for low integration of CAC, reflecting a more intuitive approach. The works Mutations II, “Waves” and “Run” from Short Pieces on Falling, Never a Moment Lost, and (Let Me Hear) What Maria Hears, amongst others, will serve to demonstrate the efficiency of these techniques. A second section focuses on medium integration of CAC, as demonstrated by the author’s modular progression management system. This framework, developed in OpenMusic, helps in the generation of progression passages, and is adaptable and easily modified for different works. This framework will be examined primarily through the works Melodious Viscosity and Like a Square Peg. The third and final section looks at high CAC integration through gesture, using the author’s software ScoreScrub. Using this software, the user can effectively “scrub” across existing score samples to produce new musical passages. The primary works analysed will be Gift efter Carl Herman Erlandsson and the orchestral work Världen och jag.

581	Mortalité et activation immunitaire chronique chez les personnes vivant avec le VIH naïves de traitement antirétroviral en Afrique de l’Ouest	HIV/AIDS is a major public health problem in Sub-Saharan Africa, which accounts for 75% of the burden of HIV/AIDS in 13% of the world's population. Sub-Saharan Africa has benefitted from major advances in the fight against HIV/AIDS, including antiretroviral therapy (ART). This has helped to improve performance indicators in the fight against HIV/AIDS, although some areas such as West Africa have lagged behind. Interventions are mainly guided by the World Health Organization recommendations, which are based on evidence obtained in settings that differ from real-life in resource-limited settings (RLS). Observational data are scarce, particularly in ART-naive people living with HIV (PLHIV) with high CD4 cell counts. For example, the new recommendations for initiating ART for all PLHIV regardless of CD4 cell counts remain to be validated in RLSs. Mortality and chronic immune activation (CIA) are also two important topics in this population. CIA plays a central role in the progression of HIV as well as other factors such as viral serotype. A certain level of CIA has been reported in exposed seronegative (ESN) people such as seronegative partners in serodiscordant couples. The extent of CIA and its relationship to sexual exposure to HIV (SEHIV) has been little studied in West Africa. The same holds true for the association between CIA and smallpox vaccination (SPV) despite several studies that have reported a positive association between this vaccination and the immune system of PLHIVs. This thesis had three objectives: 1) to describe mortality in ART-naive PLHIVs with a baseline (at entry in the cohort) CD4 cell counts ≥350/μL in West Africa, and to assess its association with these CD4 cell counts, the viral serotype and the CIA level at the entry in the cohort; 2) to compare the level of CIA of ESNs with those of PLHIVs and seronegative controls and then to assess its association with SEHIV in ESNs and seronegative controls; 3) to evaluate the association between SPV and CIA in ART-naïve PLHIVs. For objective 1, a cohort study has been undertaken with competitive risk analyzes (Fine-Gray regression for competing risk) and classical survival analyzes (Kaplan Meier and Cox models) wich allow estimating respectively the sub-distribution Hazard ratio (sHR) and the Hazard ratio (HR). Two analytical cross-sectional studies have also been undertaken (for each objective 2 and 3) with logistic regression models and linear regression models. The multivariate regression models allowed estimating the adjusted relative risks using a 10% change in estimate method considering some co-variables such as age, sex, education level and inclusion period. We used beta-2-microglobulin (β2m) as soluble marker of CIA.  The cohort study (objective 1) that included 908 Gambian ART-naïve PLHIVs with CD4 cell count ≥350/μL at the entry in the cohort has found a death incidence rate of 7.5/100 person-years (95% confidence interval (95% CI)= 6.3-8.9). The risk of death was higher at CD4 cell count 350-499 compared to CD4 cell count ≥500 (adjusted HR= 1.49; 95% CI: 1.07-2.07). Compared to HIV-2, mortality was higher for HIV-1 and HIV-1+2 co-infection (adjusted HR=1.66; 95% CI: 1.26-2.81 and 2.15; 95% CI: 1.24-3.73, respectively). A high level of CIA was also associated with a higher risk of death (adjusted HR=3.23; 95% CI: 2.01-5.19 for those with a level of β2m ≥2.85 mg/L compared to those with a level <2.85 mg/L). The cross-sectional study (objective 2) comparing 54 heterosexual serodiscordant couples to 40 seronegative controls has showed that SEHIV was associated with a high (>2.2 mg/L) level of CIA (adjusted odds ratio (OR)=5.36; 95% CI: 1.20-23.88); but not with a moderate (>1.81mg/L) level of CIA (adjusted OR=2.08; 95% IC: 0.64-6.75). Finaly, for the cross-sectional study on smallpox vaccination (objectif 3) which included 101 ART-naïve PLHIVs, we did not find any association between SPV and CIA (adjusted β = -0.08; 95% CI: -0.80-0.63 for those who have been vaccinated compared to those who have not been vaccinated). The results of this thesis suggest that earlier initiation of ART could reduce mortality among PLHIVs in West Africa. Low level of CIA could also reduce mortality. However, the results do not suggest that HIV-2 infection slows HIV-1 disease progression. The results also allow us to generate hypotheses on two ESN profiles: “immunoquiescent” which could have correlates of protection against HIV infection and “immunosusceptible” whose level of CIA depends on SEHIV. Finaly, SPV would not appear to be associated with HIV progression through its impact on CIA. Our results are produced in a “real-life” context with technically and financially accessible measures in RLSs. They might be easily reproducible in the health systems of RLSs.

582	Attirer, recruter et retenir les enseignants en zones rurales : une analyse des politiques du Burkina Faso en la matière	Teacher shortages constitute one of the main obstacles to achieving quality universal primary education and Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) remains the region most affected by these shortages (UIS, 2014). There is evidence that teacher shortages are in general more acute in rural and remote areas (RRAs) in this region. There are two main reasons for this situation. First, compared with urban areas, the RRAs of SSA have the lowest school access ratios (Mulkeen & Chen, 2008; UIS, 2006). Efforts to enlarge coverage are therefore concentrated on these areas, which induces an important increase of teacher demand. Second, RRAs usually face great difficulties attracting, recruiting and retaining quality teachers (Mulkeen & Chen, 2008; UNESCO-BREDA, 2009). This has led several SSA countries to design policies aimed at ensuring the availability of teachers in rural schools.  In this thesis, we pursue two objectives: 1) describe the policy instruments in place to attract, recruit and retain teachers in Burkina Faso rural areas; and 2) document the implementation of these policy instruments. Our investigation was guided by labor market theories, in particular supply and demand theories as applied to the education sector and teacher labor markets, and Honig’s (2006) model for analyzing contemporary education policy implementation. To understand the effects of education policies, one can draw on various methodological approaches. After reviewing these approaches, we opted for an approach that consists in reconstructing the professional trajectories of a cohort of teachers. More specifically, we used available administrative data to reconstruct the professional trajectories of a sample of 100 teachers who received their first appointment in a region of Burkina Faso in 2005. The data covered items such as their various postings, their career advancement and their remuneration. We also conducted individual interviews with a sub-sample of the cohort. Our analyses show that the two types of policy measures implemented, based on the rural deficit model (Ankrah-Dove, 1982), are effective in the short term to attract teachers in RRAs but have limited long-term effectiveness in retaining them in most hardship RRAs.  The contributions of our research are multiple. First, it offers a fine-grained analysis of the historical evolution of teacher management policies in the context of a French-speaking Sub-Saharan African country. From a methodological point of view, the approach we developed is both innovative and specifically relevant to the Sub-Saharan African context when analyzing the implementation of policies designed to manage teacher supply and demand. Our research also demonstrates the significant value of using the analysis of teachers’ professional trajectories as a methodological tool for evaluating the effects of teacher policy implementation. Finally, with regard to to social relevance, we suggest 17 avenues for improving current policies in Burkina Faso. Although they are specifically grounded in the context of this country, these avenues can also be relevant for other French-speaking Sub-Saharan African countries that are experiencing challenges of a similar nature.

583	Les parcours d’orientation linguistique postsecondaire et professionnelle :l’expérience de jeunes adultes issus de l’immigration à Montréal	This study explores the negotiation work undertaken by young adults from immigrant backgrounds in Montreal with respect to the construction of their linguistic post-secondary and professional career paths. In the scientific literature, their transition process to postsecondary education and the labor market experience has been problematized mainly with regard to graduation rates and employment access within international and Canadian contexts. The interpretive angle of this thesis brings out the specificity of this experience in the socio-historical context of Quebec. Based on the biographical and retrospective life-story method, the qualitative corpus is comprised of 25 young adults from immigrant backgrounds who, following their secondary education in the French sector, pursued postsecondary studies (CEGEP/university) in a Montreal institution (English/French), and who have two years of experience in the Montreal labor market. The comparison of the testimonies of these young adults makes an in depth exploration of the complexity of their orientation experiences possible, which is complementary to existing quantitative research on this topic. Given that 21 of these young adults belong to different visible minority groups, the results of this thesis shed light on the particularities of the postsecondary and professional pathways of visible minorities from immigrant backgrounds. Inspired by comprehensive sociology, the analytical framework of the thesis accounts for the back-and-forth dynamics between micro and macro sociological dimensions, operated by the social actor. A relational conceptualization of social experience makes it possible to introduce the notion of boundaries, more specifically of «majority/minority» boundaries, in the analysis of the postsecondary and professional orientation experience. The nonlinear conceptualization of life pathways makes it possible to take into account the bifurcations and the constitutive reorientations of these pathways. On the empirical and theoretical levels, this thesis contributes to the development of the role of «majority/minority» boundaries and, more specifically, to the role of power relations in the postsecondary and professional linguistic orientation processes of young adults of immigrant origin, especially those who are visible minorities. In fact, by examining the orientation pathways from a «majority/minority» boundary negotiation angle, the results show that relationships of discrimination and exclusion influence the postsecondary and professional orientation choices of these young adults from immigrant backgrounds. Many of these young adults, distance themselves from French-speaking postsecondary and work environments and choose to integrate themselves into English-speaking environments in the face of experiences of particular forms of discrimination, such as racism, linguism and religious intolerance. The results highlight the vulnerability of certain visible minority groups, such as Blacks and Arabs, who experience more discriminatory behavior through which they feel excluded from the Quebecois majority group: these young adults, mainly Francophone, prefer to work in English-speaking environments. The thesis thus shows that the power relation that govern the social relationships in Quebec society reinforce ethno-cultural boundaries between Francophone Quebecois and young adults of immigrant origin, regardless of whether they have had a relatively successful transition to postsecondary education and the labor market.

584	L’appropriation des connaissances visuo-orthographiques par des élèves de la première à la quatrième année du primaire	Reading and writing are fundamental skills for school learning. Learning to spell represents a major challenge for many pupils, whether they have a learning disability or not. Yet, the growth of spelling skills is closely associated with reading and writing development. The French spelling system, due to its structure and its opacity, requires that learners amass knowledge about the phonological properties of words, and also their morphological and visual properties, to succeed in reading and spelling all words. Research has shown that the visual properties of words, which can be classified according to forms of visual-orthographic phenomena, represent orthographic properties which are particularly difficult to master in the primary grades. Furthermore, working memory and processing speed are required for processing the orthographic components of words. Empirical data have shown that memory and rapid naming abilities are linked to reading and spelling performance. The general goal of this study was to investigate the extent to which visual-orthographic processing, phonological and visual memory, and rapid naming performance play a role in the reading and spelling performance of 119 pupils enrolled in the first to the fourth grade of primary school. The specific objectives were to describe their overall performance, examine the relationships among the variables being studied, and identify which one(s) best explain(s) reading and spelling performance.  A word recognition task, a reading comprehension task, and a spelling production task were administered to assess reading and spelling skills. A matching test in which nonword sequences were presented orally and a matching test with visual sequences as stimuli were used as phonological and visual memory measures. A rapid object-naming task (R.A.N.) and a rapid color-naming task were used as measure of processing speed. To observe their visual-orthographic processing skills, the participants were given a word-pseudohomophone choice task and retrieval tests (oral and written).  Results indicated that visual-orthographic processing skills increased with grade level. Correlational analyses revealed that grade was related to each variable, that reading and spelling skills were linked to each other, and that visual-orthographic processing skills appeared to be the variables most strongly correlated to reading and spelling skills. Regression analyses indicated that grade level best explained performance in spelling production, word recognition, and reading comprehension and that the word-pseudohomophone choice task represented the only variable making an additional and significant contribution to reading and spelling performance. These results suggest that the visual properties of words should be taught in class so as to support the development of learners’ reading and spelling skills. It should be the subject of future research intending to explain how these properties are acquired and develop.

585	L’enseignement de la lecture/appréciation des œuvres littéraires à l’école primaire : enquête sur les pratiques déclarées et les conceptions d’enseignants québécois	In order to better understand the declared teaching practices and the conceptions of teachers about the reading/appreciation of literary works at the elementary level, we have conducted a questionnaire survey with Quebec teachers of the three primary cycles (N=518). We pursued the following three specific objectives: 1) identify and describe the declared teaching practices related to activities, materials and assessment; 2) identify and describe the conceptions of primary school teachers about ministerial prescriptions, reading/appreciation and its teaching; 3) compare these declared practices and these conceptions of teachers according to the three primary cycles. Data collected allow us to argue that the use of literary works is widespread for the teaching of reading/appreciation in the primary classroom, but to varying degrees depending on the two main types of teachers that come out of our study: the more passionates (N=360) and the less interested (N=158). Correlations analyses show that the variable Loving to teach reading/appreciation is the one that would have the most significant impact on the declared practices and the conceptions of the teachers with regard to reading/appreciation of the literary works in the school. About the declared teaching practices, periods of free personal reading (97.7 %) and moments of reading when the students have finished their activites in class (93.4 %) are the most frequent activities concerning reading/appreciation each week. The material used weekly by teachers to work on the reading/appreciation of literary works consists mainly of literary works (66.2 %) of diffrents genres, especially narrative (album: 81.3 %; novel: 61.2 %; tale: 55.3 %). To evaluate the reading/appreciation of literary works, the use of written questionnaires is frequent, as is the use of more reflexive forms. Teachers report using these tools less to assess critical judgment (55.0%) than understanding (90.0%) in reading students. About the conceptions, the teachers say that they work on the four competencies of the “Français, langue d’enseignement” discipline, on the composantes of Apprécier des œuvres littéraires, the skills and the process of reading/appreciation. The majority of teachers (69.5 %) say they like to teach reading/appreciation of literary works, and they state that it is their tastes and personal interests that influence them most (82.6 %). They point out that they want to respond better to their student’s needs (60.8 %) and take account of their progress (42.1 %), as well as having a better access of literary works (45,9 %) and a greater choice (40.5 %) to stimulate students pleasure to read (94.6 %). On a personal level, a majority of teachers say they like to read (97.9 %) and exchange about their readings with their students (95.0 %). Intercycle comparisons show that there are statistically significant intercycle differences for 50 of the 110 variables analyzed and that the significative differences are more numerost on the practices side (32 variables on 55) than on the conceptions side (18 variables ont 55). The declared practices and conceptions of first cycle teachers, who are on average more experienced, more trained and who prefer to teach reading/appreciation, appear more favorable to this teaching. Our research shows that, since the introduction of the pedagogical renewal in the early 2000s, teachers in Quebec have intensified their teaching practices in the reading/appreciation of literary works and their conceptions have evolved compared to previous surveys. Given this rather positive overall picture of the teaching of reading/appreciation of literary works, different challenges remain for teachers and further research has to be carried out to refine the analysis and to study practices observed in the classroom.

586	Synthèse d’amidines et de composés trifluorométhylés par le biais de molécules hautement réactives	This work is separated in two distinct parts aiming to describe the recent advances concerning the use of highly reactive molecules such as trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride (Tf2O) and trifluormethyldiazomethane in organic synthesis. In the first section, the amide activation strategy using triflic anhydride was applied in order to synthesize free secondary and tertiary amidines. Those molecules find numerous applications, particularly in natural product synthesis and medicinal chemistry. Although their purification on small scale is quite difficult, their synthesis and caracterization were successfully achieved. Next, investigations were conducted towards the trifluoromethylation of organic compounds. The idea was to trifluoromethylate highly electronegative activated amides in order to transform them into trifluoromethylketones. Unfortunately, this route appeared to be uneffective and was switched to another promising trifluoromethylating source : Trifluormethyldiazomethane. In the second section, the safe and efficient synthesis of trifluoromethyldiazomethane in continuous flow is described. That diazo compound was then used in the synthesis of trifluoromethylated pyrazolines. A reactivity trend was unveiled as those molecules spontaniously tautomerize (or not) depending on the nature of the substrate. Trifluoromethylated pyrazolines are interesting compounds on their own, especially for the pharmaceutical industry, but also serve as precursors to trifluoromethylated cyclopropanes. Finaly, some ideas and related future projects are discribed, in particular in what should be an efficient and possibly enantioselective synthesis of trifluoromethylated cyclopropanes in continuous flow.

587	Lithic raw material usage in the archaic Northeast : debitage analysis of the Gaudreau Site, Weedon, Quebec	The Archaic period in the Far Northeast is characterised by hunter-gatherer mobility strategies adapted to a closed forest, which offered diverse and abundant resources. This period can be identified archaeologically by its diverse lithic assemblage, consisting of both flaked and ground stone tools. The Gaudreau site in Weedon, Quebec, is a multicomponent site that includes an Archaic occupation. Successive occupations throughout the prehistoric period have led to extensive vertical and horizontal mixing of artefacts at the site. An initial analysis of  those objects diagnostic of particular time periods revealed spatial patterns that allowed for a fifty square metre sample area to be defined for study of the Archaic lithic industry. Previous studies of the site’s Archaic artefacts guided the design of an analysis of debitage from this part of the site. For the three most abundant raw materials, a sample of five complete flakes was taken from each quadrant. For all other raw materials, the entire population of debitage was examined. Attributes were recorded from each individual piece of debitage examined and these data were aggregated along multiple axes to reveal patterns among different raw materials, flake types, and locations. This revealed key patterns in raw material and tool curation, the segmentation of the reduction sequence, and resource procurement strategies. The study revealed that site inhabitants used materials sourced from within their regional network in a more expedient manner than those imported from beyond its limits, and treated prismatic materials differently than those that fractured conchoidally. The Gaudreau site inhabitants considered toolstone quality and procurement cost in making tool production choices in the context of the regional economy and on-site segmentation of the reduction sequence.

588	"Le ""travail curriculaire"" des enseignants en éducation physique : du travail prescrit au travail réel"	In this doctoral thesis, we are going to analyze the curricular work of teachers in physical education. The curricular work is the sum of all processes of interpretation, adaptation and transformation by the teachers of the prescribed curriculum to make it teachable to students (Tardif & Lessard, 1999). In 2012, the physical education municipal curriculum (PEMC) was implemented for every municipal schools of Cuiabá, in the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil. However, little was known about the way teachers would integrate this curriculum in their teaching in the classroom. Consequently, our research question is: how do teachers interpret and transform the prescribed curriculum in their classroom? In other words, how do they implement the curriculum? Regarding our theoretical framework, it relies on the sociology of teaching work and on French ergonomics, more specifically the approach of the activity clinic. This is a mixed research, with a stronger accent put on the qualitative perspective. Furthermore, this memoir can be categorized as a research-intervention in accordance with the historical-developmental approach. In the first phase, we distributed a questionnaire to 73 teachers to learn about their perceptions of the PEMC and the professional training they received to implement the curriculum. In the second phase, we conducted a multi- cases study with four teachers – three women and one man. Two of them were novice teachers (T1 and T2) and the other two were experienced (T3 and T4). We consulted documents (the prescribed curriculum, the schools’ educational projects, the teachers’ school planning) and we conducted semi-directed interviews at the start and at the end of the 2015 school year. In addition, we filmed class lessons for a period of two months. During the multi-cases study, we also used the single and crossed self-confrontation method, where we could examine different point of views about the teachers’ activities in the classroom. Of all the major results of the research, we can highlight that: concerning the general perception of the PEMC which was positive, 82.19% of the teachers found it advantageous to teach according to it; concerning the use of the PEMC, almost 80% of the teachers always or almost always use the curriculum to build their yearly school planning, 76.72% use it to plan their classes and 72.61% adapt it before using it. Regarding the obstacles for the implementation of the PEMC, the lack of educational material (41.1%) and inadequate infrastructures (34.25%) are the factors that most prevent the curriculum implementation. Concerning the professional training, 74% of the teachers found it sufficient for the implementation of the PEMC and that it was functional for almost 90% of them. As for the results of the multi- vi cases study, we would like to point out that: the teachers use the PEMC to build their yearly planning, in the long or short term, but they interpret it, adapt it and transform it during teaching in the classroom, in their own way and depending on the knowledge they have of the lessons content, of the curriculum and of the students, the resources and locations available, but always by transforming and adapting it also. In short, the contextual and personal factors of the curricular work influence that adaptation of the curriculum. Also, our study showed that the teachers are interprets, actors, authors and builders of the physical education curriculum taught in class and that the students are co-authors of the lessons with their teachers.	curriculum , teachers , curricular work , physical education , implementation	en	19975.0
589	La légitimité des parties prenantes dans l'aménagement des villes : éthique de la conduite des projets urbains	Urban projects - also referred to as urban development projects - are largely dependent on the increased involvement of a multitude of stakeholders, whose assets for, and demands on, the project may be complementary and / or contradictory. In this context, how much priority should be given to different stakeholders? To answer this question, project leaders are called upon to assess the legitimacy of these stakeholders. To examine this concept, the study calls upon the crossing of texts from theoretical corpuses other than the classic corpus of urban planning and urban studies: those of stakeholder theory in the field of organizational management and business ethics; the model of the « cités », anchored in pragmatic sociology; and theories of justice. Then it confronts the lessons of these theories with the empirical analysis of a virtual practical case created for the purpose of this research. The round-trip between theory and concrete situations, often emphasizing tensions between competing legitimacies, makes it possible to refine the ethical principles underlying these legitimacies, through a method inspired by that of reflexive equilibrium. The analysis shows that the legitimacy of a stakeholder results from reasoning based on an efficiency standard or on an ethical standard, ideally compatible in the context of an ethics of responsibility. In the first approach (effectiveness) the proponent will be mainly attentive to the stakeholders' capacities for action on the project, including representativeness, legal capacities (titles, rights, contractual links), knowledge and know-how (expertise, skills), creativity, material and financial resources, and the ability to engage other stakeholders into the project. In the second (ethical) approach, the project proponent will be mainly attentive to the legitimate demands of stakeholders on the project: demands for global well-being, capability building (autonomy, freedoms, opportunities for individuals, socio-economic benefits), community ties (values ​​and traditions of large and small communities), well-being of others and environmental claims. The research then enables the emergence of six ethical principles for the assessment of legitimacies: global utility, respect for freedom, equity, solidarity (and tolerance), care and environmental responsibility. While the theories of planning and urban studies - one of the main objects of which is the critical analysis of the manufacturing processes of cities - have paid little attention to the normative principles underlying these processes, this research proposes a conceptual framework that is useful for researchers and professionals to make a judgment, especially in terms of ethics, on decisions concerning the consideration of stakeholders in urban projects. In doing so, it helps to lay the foundations for an ethic of the conduct of urban projects.

590	"Validation de la version française canadienne du
Perception of Prevalence of Aggression Scale auprès d’un
échantillon d’intervenants en protection de la jeunesse ="	The objective of this study is to evaluate the construct validity of the French Canadian version of the Perception Of Prevalence of Aggression Scale (POPAS), a selfreport questionnaire measuring exposure to workplace violence committed by clients in the health and social services sector. Method. A sample of 310 youth protection workers is utilized to confirm the four-factor internal structure of the instrument. If this structure is not confirmed, an exploratory structural equation model is used. The selected factors undergo Cronbach alpha tests that assess their internal consistency. They are correlated with the French version of the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist Scale (PCLS) and the number of absentee days caused by violence in order to measure convergent validity. There are also correlated with the Felt Accountability (FA) scale to assess divergent validity. Comparison analyses according to work environments assess criterion validity. Results. The confirmatory factor analysis does not corroborate the four-factor structure of the POPAS. The exploratory structural equation model validates a three-factor structure: ‘‘verbal violence’’, ‘‘physical violence’’ and ‘‘violence against oneself’’. The first two possess good internal consistency. The positive correlations between these two factors and the PCLS, as well as between these two factors and the number of absentee days, support the convergent validity of POPAS. However, the absence of a significant correlation between the last factor and the PCLS, as well as between this factor and the number of absentee days, does not support convergence. The lack of correlation between the factors and the FA supports the divergent validity of the POPAS. The differences observed as they relate to work environments also attest to criterion validity. Discussion. The construct validity of the French Canadian version of the POPAS suggests that this instrument allows for an evaluation of the subjective frequency of different forms of workplace violence experienced by youth protection workers. It therefore represents an alternative to the use of official data (i.e. incident reports made to the employer), which poorly reflect the reality of these workers given the underreporting of violent incidents in this sector.

context-dependent post-retrieval word integration in working
memory"	Which cognitive processes are reflected by the N400 in ERPs is still controversial. Various recent articles(Lau et al., 2008; Brouwer et al., 2012) have revived the idea that only lexical pre-activation processes(such as automatic spreading activation, ASA) are strongly supported, while post-lexical integrative pro-cesses are not. Challenging this view, the present ERP study replicates a behavioral study by McKoon andRatcliff (1995) who demonstrated that a prime-target pair such as finger − hand shows stronger primingwhen a majority of other pairs in the list share the analogous semantic relationship (here: part-whole),even at short stimulus onset asynchronies (250 ms). We created lists with four different types of semanticrelationship (synonyms, part-whole, category-member, and opposites) and compared priming for pairsin a consistent list with those in an inconsistent list as well as unrelated items. Highly significant N400reductions were found for both relatedness priming (unrelated vs. inconsistent) and relational priming(inconsistent vs. consistent). These data are taken as strong evidence that N400 priming effects are notexclusively carried by ASA-like mechanisms during lexical retrieval but also include post-lexical inte-gration in working memory. We link the present findings to a neurocomputational model for relationalreasoning (Knowlton et al., 2012) and to recent discussions of context-dependent conceptual activations(Yee and Thompson-Schill, 2016).

593	Étude d’interactions biologiques à l’aide de la résonance des plasmons de surface et de la spectroscopie de fluorescence	The understanding of biological interactions is of utmost importance if we are to comprehend the complex mechanisms taking place in living beings. These interactions can involve proteins, oligonucleotides and peptides, but are not limited to these types of biomolecules. Biological interactions are characterized by their affinity and binding kinetics. Therefore, it is extremely important to have an analytical tool able to measure these properties in order to characterize the interaction between biological molecules. This Master’s research had the objective to optimize surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy (SPR) to study biological interactions of poorly characterized biomolecular interactions and to measure both affinity and kinetic parameters of the binding between several sets of relevant biological molecules. The SPR technique relies on the immobilization of a biological receptor on a gold-coated prism to create a biosensor. One of the studied biomolecules is anchored on the surface while the other one is flowed through a fluidic cell placed on top of the prism. The resulting measured signal results from the binding between the two biomolecules and allows us to determine thermodynamic (KD) and kinetic (kon and koff) parameters associated with the biological complex. These properties of SPR were exploited in this thesis to study the interaction between the protein CD36 (Cluster of Differentiation 36) and peptides homologous to the GHRP-6 (Growth Hormone Releasing Peptide 6), the interaction between a ganglioside (GM1) and the Cholera toxin B sub-unit (CTB) and a synthetic peptide, the interaction of cytokines and the proteinaceous soluble receptor EBI3 (Epstein-Barr virus Induced Gene 3) and the interaction between GFP (Green Fluorescent Protein) and another protein provided by a collaborator. The sensors developed for this Master’s project allowed us to study complex interactions for which few standard methods of analysis exist. This Master’s thesis also briefly describes an instrument prototype able to monitor either bulk or surface fluorescence during the SPR assay.

595	Supporting ethics educators in Canadian occupational therapy and physical therapy programs: A national interprofessional knowledge exchange project	Ethics education is the cornerstone of professional practice, fostering knowledge and respect for core ethical values among healthcare professionals. Ethics is also a subject well-suited for interprofessional education and collaboration. However, there are few initiatives to gather experiences and share resources among ethics educators in rehabilitation. We thus undertook a knowledge exchange project to 1) share knowledge about ethics training across Canadian occupational and physical therapy programs, and 2) build a community of educators dedicated to improving ethics education. The objectives of this paper are to describe this interprofessional knowledge exchange project involving ethics educators (with a diversity of professional and disciplinary backgrounds) from Canadian occupational and physical therapy programs as well as analyze its outcomes based on participants’ experiences/perceptions. Two knowledge exchange strategies were employed: an interactive one-day workshop and a wiki platform. An immediate post-workshop questionnaire evaluated the degree to which participants’ expectations were met. Structured telephone interviews nine to ten months after the workshop collected participants’ perceptions on whether (and if so, how) the project influenced their teaching or led to further interprofessional collaborations. Open-ended questions from the post-workshop questionnaires and individual interviews were analyzed using qualitative methods. Of 40 ethics educators contacted, 23 participated in the workshop and 17 in the follow-up interview. Only 6 participants logged into the wiki from its launch to the end of data collection. Five themes emerged from the qualitative analysis: 1) belonging and networking; 2) sharing and collaborating; 3) changing (or not) ways of teaching ethics; 4) sustaining the network; and 5) envisioning the future of ethics education. The project attained many of its goals, despite encountering some challenges. While the wiki platform proved to be of limited benefit in advancing the project goals, the interactive format and collaborative nature of the one-day workshop were described as rewarding and effective in bringing together occupational therapy and physical therapy educators to meet, network, and share knowledge.	ethics , occupational therapy , physiotherapy , Canada , ethics teaching , knowledge exchange , interprofessional education , rehabilitation , ergothérapie , éthique , physiothérapie , formation interprofessionnelle , réhabilitation	en	19865.0
596	Intégration de la démarche d’évaluation et des TIC mobiles (iPad) au préscolaire	Kindergarten education in Quebec follows the changes inspired the competency-based approach, constructivism and the integration of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) which have had particular ramifications in the field of assessment: the child needs to play an active role in same. Even if the integration of ICT in assessment is a challenge in kindergarten, few studies have shed light on these changes as regards teaching practices. In this context, we proposed a training program aimed at accompanying a kindergarten teacher in her assessment practices through the use of a digital tablet. This training program addressed problems dealt with in class and helps enrich teaching practices.  In this study, we aimed to document the integration of mobile technologies and assessment practices in the daily life of a kindergarten teacher through the following tools: a questionnaire on assessment practices and video taping of learning circles, classroom practices and group discussions. The five components of professional development as defined by Shulman and Shulman (2004) were considered for analysing changes brought about in the vision, the motivation, understanding, practices and community sharing, during and at the end of the training. Results indicate a number of changes, which are more or less pronounced as regards regulation practices, differentiated instruction practices and use of assessment tools, be it at the level of the use of descriptive rubrics or self-assessment. As regards the integration of the digital tablet, results show marked changes as its use was favored in certain stages of the evaluation procedure, like data collection, judgement and communication. Finally, teacher accompaniment through learning circles proved to be beneficial.

597	"Application du renforcement non contingent pour
réduire les comportements problématiques chez les
personnes ayant un trouble du spectre de l’autisme"	Noncontingent reinforcement (NCR) is an intervention with strong empirical support to reduce problem behaviour in individuals with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The intervention involves providing access to a preferred stimulus, typically the reinforcer maintaining the problem behaviour, on a regular or continuous basis. The paper has an educational purpose, which is to describe and discuss issues to consider when applying NCR with individuals with an ASD. The importance of conducting a functional assessment prior to intervening is explained with an emphasis on the different types of reinforcers that maintain problem behaviour. Then, the identification of preferred stimuli is described in case the reinforcer maintaining the problem behaviour cannot be used as part of NCR. Subsequently, two different procedures are presented in order to assist clinicians in implementing the intervention. A fictitious clinical example illustrates the use of NCR with a child with an ASD who emits problem behaviour (i.e., screaming) during meetings at home between his mother and a professional. Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of the intervention as well as directions for future research are discussed to promote an optimal application of NCR with individuals with an ASD.

599	Ion homeostasis in rhythmogenesis : the interplay between neurons and astroglia	Proper function of all excitable cells depends on ion homeostasis. Nowhere is this more critical than in the brain where the extracellular concentration of some ions determines neurons' firing pattern and ability to encode information. Several neuronal functions depend on the ability of neurons to change their firing pattern to a rhythmic bursting pattern, whereas, in some circuits, rhythmic firing is, on the contrary, associated to pathologies like epilepsy or Parkinson's disease. In this review, we focus on the four main ions known to fluctuate during rhythmic firing: calcium, potassium, sodium, and chloride. We discuss the synergistic interactions between these elements to promote an oscillatory activity. We also review evidence supporting an important role for astrocytes in the homeostasis of each of these ions and describe mechanisms by which astrocytes may regulate neuronal firing by altering their extracellular concentrations. A particular emphasis is put on the mechanisms underlying rhythmogenesis in the circuit forming the central pattern generator (CPG) for mastication and other CPG systems. Finally, we discuss how an impairment in the ability of glial cells to maintain such homeostasis may result in pathologies like epilepsy and Parkinson's disease.

602	Reaching Innu and Atikamekw Youths in their communities: Future Healthcare Professionals Working Together	Background Mini-Schools of Health are held since 2011 in indigenous communities by the Université de Montréal's Faculty of Medicine and the student's Groupe d’intérêt en santé autochtone (GISA). These events take place in schools and allow health sciences and social work undergraduates to discuss health issues with Innu and Atikamekw youths. The Mini-School aims to promote school perseverance, a healthy lifestyle, and build cultural competence in undergraduates. Mini-School participants come from thirteen different undergraduate programs and multidisciplinary collaboration is facilitated by commonly addressing complex indigenous health issues.  Method Mini-Schools take place three times a year. The communities of Wemotaci and Manawan are visited in the fall or spring, during a one-day trip. The third Mini-School takes place in June during a full week. Innu communities located in the Côte-Nord region, notably Ekuanitshit and Nutashkuan, are visited. Between 250 and 300 students are met yearly in each community by forty undergraduates. Recruitment of undergraduates is managed by the GISA and the Interprofesionnal Student Council. Pre-departure training is mandatory to provide knowledge about the community’s reality and promote respectful and culturally informed interactions. Interdisciplinary exchanges are initiated during the training as participants from various programs bring different perspectives in the discussion. Mini-Schools are held a few days after training and allow undergraduates to join students in class to discuss various themes. In elementary schools, the pleasure of physical activity and healthy eating are addressed, as well as general well-being. In high schools, emphasis is given to complex health issues such as mental health, drug abuse and sexual health. At the same time, other participants host kiosks in the gymnasium and share with students their passion about their future profession. Interactive games are organized to present career prospects such as: nurse, doctor, social worker, pharmacist, nutritionist, optometrist, dentist, audiologist and physiotherapist. Mini-Schools are concluded by a community dinner and a visit to the healthcare facility.  Outcomes Since the introduction of the Mini-Schools in 2011, more than five hundred undergraduates have taken part in the project. Medical students were the only participants at first but the potential for interprofessional education was soon perceived and students from other programs, mainly in health sciences but also information sciences, were invited to join. Participants from various study programs have developed strong friendships and have kept in touch by organizing social and academic activities.  Positive feedback is commonly reported from undergraduates and students. In-person meetings with school administrations and teachers revealed a great level of community satisfaction with these activities. The good reception of the Mini-Schools suggests a short-term positive impact. The long-term impact is yet difficult to measure since it will require data such as the evolution of the graduation rate and the number of future health professionals from these communities.  Conclusions The immersive and intense experience of the Mini-School might be prone to enhance readiness for interprofessional collaboration among future healthcare professionals. This project also allows rich interactions in the communities that hopefully will encourage students to believe in their dream and to become healthcare professionals.	santé autochtone , mini-école de la santé , collaboration interprofessionnelle	en	19649.0

605	"Improving the measurement of neighbourhood characteristics through systematic
observation: Inequalities in smoking as a case study"	Systematic observation is increasingly used as a method to measure neighbourhood        characteristics thought to influence health inequalities. This article reports on       the theory-driven development of a new observation tool composed of reflective       indicators of neighbourhood characteristics believed to influence inequalities in       smoking. We also report the results of generalisability analyses conducted to       estimate the reliability (inter-rater reliability and temporal stability) of the        observation tool. We use the reliability results to reflect on the quality of the       measures and on the theoretical anchors of the tool. We conclude by making       recommendations to improve measures collected through systematic observation.	Neighborhood , Systematic observation , Reliability , Social inequality , Smoking	en	19594.0
606	Application de la sémantique intertextuelle à la modélisation de constats d'infraction de la ville de Québec	"In the current thesis, we propose an XML modelling of a legal document, the statement of offense, using Marcoux’s intertextual semantics approach to information object design. Our method combines the modelling approaches of Maler and El Andaloussi, Glushko's Document Engineering and Salminen's RASKE method. We first analyse a selected corpus of documents, and identify information relevant to our topic and its context of use. We then transpose the document from a paper medium onto a XML-based electronic medium by i) the construction of a Document Type Definition (DTD) and ii) the elaboration of its intertextual semantics specification. The result is a prototype that enables the authoring of a statement of offence in XML, and allows for the automatic rendering of the document’s intended meaning in a natural language via a web browser.  By designing the DTD so that the content models are mostly introduced sequentially, and by distributing the themes included in the ""Règlement sur la forme des constats d’infraction"" in accordance with the syntax of the French language, we simplify the rendering of the intertextual semantics and possibly improve its idiomaticity."

607	Conception et caractérisation de nanoparticules polymères théragnostiques destinées au traitement des tumeurs cérébrales	The interest in developing new applications of nanotechnology in the pharmaceutical health care increases year after year. The role of nanosystems became clearer, especially after some of them contributed to revolutionary solutions in serious diseases. In our project, we sought to synthesize ‘intelligent’  nanoparticles  (NPs)  capable  of  selectively  delivering  anticancer  agents.  NPs  were synthesized to target brain cells affected by glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a brain cancer with a poor prognosis and a very low rate of median survival. To this end, we planned to synthesize and analyze these nanoparticles and also to study the proof-of-concept of their efficiency. First,  we  carefully  selected  the  formulation  process  and  the  polymers  prior  to  optimize physicochemical characteristics of the nanogels (NGs) formulated with chitosan. After optimization of the NGs size, PDI and surface potential, we synthesized NGs loaded with active  substances.  Two  therapeutic  molecules  were  selected.  First  we  chose  doxorubicin  HCl (DOX) which is too hydrophilic to cross the BBB, whereas demonstrating in vitro efficacy against GBM. The second drug was temozolomide (TMZ), already used in the treatment of GBM as an adjuvant to radiotherapy after surgery. Analytical methods were then developed to determine the encapsulation efficiency (EE %) and drug loading efficiency (DLE %) of both drugs. For the preparation of theranostic nanogels, we followed the same procedures after the addition of the USPIO contrast agent during the NGs synthesis. Next, we needed to ensure the quality of our NGs during long-term storage. To achieve this goal, we developed a freeze-drying process using different kind of sugar cryoprotectants at varying concentrations, in order to protect NGs against mechanical and physical stresses at play during freeze-drying.  Most  promising  sugars  used  with  unloaded  NGs  were  subsequently  used  to cryoprotect DOX-loaded NGs. Finally, we studied the release of DOX from DOX-loaded NGs before and after freeze-drying. This study in particular had two objectives. The first was to compare the effect of the freeze-drying process on the behavior of the DOX-loaded NGs, observing the impact of this procedure on the release kinetics. The second purpose of the release study was to test the ability of NGs to release their contents at three different pH: 5.8 (intracellular pH of tumor cells), 6.8 (interstitial space of the tumor) and 7.4 (blood plasma).

608	Toutou Tango (cahier d'activité) suivi de Le jeu de la construction du sens dans Téléthons de la Grande Surface	By taking elements out of their respective context and placing them together in a shared space, the form of the list in poetry engages the reader in different ways than linear forms of literature made of regular sentences would. Therefore this thesis proposes that the list gives way to a wider range of interpretation, transforming the activity of the reader into something of a game. The creative part, Toutou Tango (cahier d’activité) explores the form of the list as a way of apprehending reality into words and plays with the idea of the reader’s intervention in the text. The essay about Téléthons de la Grande Surface studies a reader’s intervention and its dialogic aspects in regards to meaning-making. Especially within the context of the list, meaning is in the eye of the beholder.	dialogisme , list , meaning making , reader , dialogisme , poetry	en	19542.0
609	Usages de l'épistolaire dans la littérature française du XVIIIe siècle (Crébillon fils, Rétif de la Bretonne, Laclos)	The eighteen-century literary scene is marked by the success of both epistolary and libertine novels. Through the imposition of a communicational structure specific to letters, the epistolary novel deals with introspection and subjectivity, and takes some liberties with the expression of passion: if La Nouvelle Héloïse by Rousseau and English novels such as Clarissa by Richardson contribute to the popularity of the epistolary novels, the aforementioned novels forgo the theme of “pure” love in order to describe the exploits of libertine characters. This major shift provokes the interest of the public towards this new genre. We think that letters are used as the favoured medium for the libertine’s narrative because of the successful combination of epistolary and libertine novels. The search for authenticity in literature makes letters the most pertinent means of expression, while the consequences of a changing society occupy a particular place in libertine novels. We suggest a specific compatibility between the two genres: the subjectivity that is inherent in letters allows the libertine character to express himself without any apparent narrative filter, and the libertine’s principle of intrusion allows the reader to access all the letters. The novels in our study (Les Heureux Orphelins by Crébillon, Le Paysan et la Paysanne pervertis by Rétif de la Bretonne et Les Liaisons dangereuses by Laclos) each associate the libertine’s speech and epistolarity in a different way.

610	Le processus d'adhésion aux citoyens souverains : une étude exploratoire du phénomène au Québec	Groups of sovereign citizens are hard to define since they are the subject of very few studies. According to sources, they are terrorist groups or sectarian groups or they are part of a radical movement. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police, courts and some federal and provincial departments and agencies are taking measures to offset the impact of criminal actions they commit. As for the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), it does not consider these groups as terrorist entities. The purpose of this thesis is not to define these groups per se, but rather to understand the enrolment process for Quebec sovereign citizens. Through situational action theory, it shows the various steps involved in the creation of a moral filter by this movement’s members. By analytic induction based on testimonies of group members, it shows the prerequisites for enrolling in the sovereign citizen movement – such as victimization and selective exposure to conspiracy theories. This thesis is the first study to poll the views of these members in order to understand how they get to commit illegal acts that they consider to be totally legitimate.	sovereign citizen , enrolment process , situational action theory , victimization , selective exposure , conspiracy theories	en	19525.0
611	La dignité au travail chez les employés atypiques	This study begins with a brief historical overview of the concept of dignity. Despite the multiple meanings given to the notion of dignity over time, a clear duality appears between definitions that privilege the intrinsic, inalienable nature of dignity and those that attribute dignity according to the quality of an individual's actions. While dignity at work has received far less scholarly attention, the emergent literature replicates the same dichotomy that is found in studies of dignity. The question of dignity at work is particularly important for atypical employees who, due to their precarious status, are especially vulnerable to workplace indignity. Surprisingly, atypical workers, a category that includes seasonal workers, temporary workers, workers on short-term contracts, and permanent part-timers, remain on the sidelines of much academic research, despite constant growth in their numbers as a proportion of the Canadian labour market since the late 1990s. The importance of studying dignity at work appears clearly in the following conundrum: how can we understand dignity at work when dignity implies that one recognizes the unique value of every human person based on his/her autonomy to choose his/her own ends, yet the context of work requires that workers commit themselves to attaining objectives imposed by someone else?   Using an interpretive methodology to explore the meanings of dignity at work, this study is based on semi-structured interviews with twelve atypical employees. The findings show how participants reconciled the duality between being and doing as a source of dignity. Participants added three other dimensions that are not present in the extant literature: interaction, work systems, and time. These five dimensions are combined to create a typology of dignity at work that is specific to atypical employees. Interaction acts as a core concept that links all of the other dimensions together. The organization of work systems and the ephemeral status of atypical employees work together to trivialize workplace practices that undermine the dignity of atypical employees, who come to perceive their situation as a rite of passage to be endured while waiting for a better future.

612	Chronic pain and pain processing in Parkinson’s disease	Pain is experienced by the vast majority of patients living with Parkinson’s disease. It is most often of nociceptive origin, but may also be ascribed to neuropathic (radicular or central) or miscellaneous sources. The recently validated King’s Parkinson’s Disease Pain Scale is based on 7 domains including musculoskeletal pain, chronic body pain (central or visceral), fluctuation-related pain, nocturnal pain, oro-facial pain, pain with discolouration/oedema/swelling, and radicular pain. The basal ganglia integrate incoming nociceptive information and contribute to coordinated motor responses in pain avoidance and nocifensive behaviors. In Parkinson’s disease, nigral and extra-nigral pathology, involving cortical areas, brainstem nuclei, and spinal cord, may contribute to abnormal central nociceptive processing in patients experiencing pain or not. The dopamine deficit lowers multimodal pain thresholds that are amenable to correction following levodopa dosing. Functional brain imaging with positron emission tomography following administration of H215O revealed abnormalities in the sensory discriminative processing of pain (insula/SII), as well as in the affective motivational processing of pain (anterior cingulate cortex, prefrontal cortex). Pain management is dependent on efforts invested in diagnostic accuracy to distinguish nociceptive from neuropathic pain. Treatment requires an integrated approach including strategies to lessen levodopa-related response fluctuations, in addition to other pharmacological and non-pharmacological options such as deep brain stimulation and rehabilitation.

613	"The impact of time and repeated exposure on famous person knowledge in amnestic Mild
cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease"	Objective: Famous people knowledge has been shown to be impaired early in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). However, the question of whether recently acquired knowledge is more impaired than remotely acquired knowledge remains a matter of debate. The aim of this study was to investigate the patterns of semantic memory impairment in aMCI and AD by investigating two factors that may influence the retrieval of such knowledge, namely remoteness and frequency of repetition of information over time. Method: Three groups (19 controls, 20 aMCI and 20 AD patients) were compared on a test assessing general and specific biographical knowledge about famous people, where the period of acquired fame (remote vs recent) and the type of fame (enduring vs transient) were controlled for. Results: Global performance of aMCI and AD patients was significantly poorer than that of controls. However, different patterns of recall were observed as a function of time and type of fame. A temporal gradient was found in both patient groups for enduring names but not for transient ones, whereby knowledge about remote enduring famous persons was better recalled. Patients were more impaired at questions assessing specific biographical knowledge (unique to an individual) than more general knowledge. Conclusions: Tests of famous people knowledge offer a unique opportunity to investigate semantic deficits in aMCI and AD, because they make it possible to estimate the time at which memories were acquired, as well as the type of fame. Results are discussed in light of memory consolidation models. Keywords:	Mild cognitive impairment , Alzheimer’s disease , Semantic memory , Famous names	en	19485.0
614	"Deconstructing maternal sensitivity: Predictive
relations to mother-child attachment in home and
laboratory settings"	Despite the well-documented importance of parental sensitivity for child development, there is a lack of consensus regarding how best to assess it. We investigated the factor structure of maternal caregiving behavior as assessed at 12 months by the Maternal Behavior Q-Sort (Pederson, Moran, & Bento, 1999) with 274 mother-infant dyads. Subsequently, we examined associations between these empirically-derived dimensions and child attachment, assessed in the home and laboratory (final N = 157). Three dimensions of maternal behavior were identified, corresponding fairly closely to Ainsworth’s original scales. They were labeled Cooperation/Attunement, Positivity, and Accessibility/Availability. Only Cooperation/Attunement consistently predicted home-based attachment at 15 months and 2 years, and at comparable strength to the overall sensitivity score, suggesting that this construct may be central to sensitivity. At 18 months, compared to their primarily secure counterparts, different types of laboratory-assessed insecure attachment were associated with different patterns of maternal behavior. Mothers in avoidant relationships (n = 18) were low on Cooperation/Attunement and Accessibility/Availability, but fairly high on Positivity. Mothers of disorganized infants (n = 11) were Cooperative/Attuned but somewhat less Positive toward, and less Accessible/Available to, their infants. A multi-dimensional approach to parental behavior may facilitate the identification of parenting precursors of insecure parent-child relationships.

615	Impacts d’un guide pratique sur les connaissances concernant le traitement contre l’eczéma et son application dans une population pédiatrique : phase 1 : conception et validation d'un guide pratique écrit et d'un questionnaire de connaissances sur l'eczéma de l'enfant auprès d'une population de jeunes adultes	Atopic dermatitis, also known as eczema, is a common chronic disease for which treatments are often complex and difficult to understand. This prospective study aims to develop and validate a written action plan and a knowledge questionnaire about eczema in order to fill an existing gap in literature concerning the availability of a self-management training program that would be accessible to patients suffering from this condition. The secondary end-points aim to evaluate the impact of the written action plan as well as the impact of health literacy and other demographic variables on eczema knowledge over a short period of time. A pilot over 11 subjects was firstly conducted in a prenatal class at the University of Sherbrooke. Validity and reliability analyses were performed and allowed for alterations on the written action plan as well as the knowledge questionnaire so that they could be used on a larger scale. These modified assessment tools were then used on the 107 patients recruited at the dermatology clinic of the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Sherbrooke (CIUSSS de l’Estrie-CHUS) for comparative analyses. Results demonstrate a significant increase on the short-term eczema knowledge when comparing mean knowledge scores on the pre-test and post-test. On a general basis, there is no significant difference on the knowledge progression for the many demographic variables analysed (delta between pre-test and post-test mean scores). Also, knowledge progression between the different levels of health literacy is comparable. These results demonstrate a lack of impact of health literacy and other demographic variables on the studied assessment tools, which support their applicability on a larger scale.

616	Cancer de la prostate résistant à la castration métastatique : utilisation des nouveaux traitements dans un contexte réel au Québec	Introduction: Since 2004, docetaxel-based chemotherapy has been the cornerstone of the management of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). The therapeutic arsenal expanded in 2011 to involve several alternative drugs such as abiraterone and enzalutamide for use in docetaxel-refractory patients and then in docetaxel-naïve ones (since 2013). This study aimed to describe docetaxel, abiraterone (and enzalutamide) use and its associated factors in Quebec. It also aimed to describe bone-targeted therapy (denosumab and zoledronic acid) utilization and its associated factors in mCRPC patients. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted in two of the main McGill University hospitals. Hospital-based cancer registries were used to identify patients treated for prostate cancer in medical oncology departments between January 1, 2010 and June 30, 2014. Then patients with mCRPC were selected. Patients’ medical charts were reviewed and mCRPC clinical data and treatments were extracted until May 10, 2016. The cohort was divided into two groups according to mCRPC diagnosis period. The cutoff date chosen was February 1, 2012 as it corresponded to the public reimbursement of abiraterone (and denosumab) in Quebec. Descriptive statistics were used to describe docetaxel, abiraterone, enzalutamide, and bone-targeted therapy (denosumab and zoledronic acid) utilization. The Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test were used to estimate time to receive a first prescription for docetaxel and bone-targeted therapy since mCRPC diagnosis. Cox regression was used to identify predictive factors of docetaxel, abiraterone (or enzalutamide), and bone-targeted therapy use. Results: In our cohort, 308 patients with mCRPC were selected with 162 patients (53%) diagnosed with mCRPC before February 1, 2012 (pre-2012 group) and 146 (47%) diagnosed with mCRPC after February 1, 2012 (post-2012 group). The median age at mCRPC was 74.0 years old. In the pre-2012 group, patients received following treatments: docetaxel 82%, abiraterone 53%, and abiraterone or enzalutamide 54% versus 53%, 74% and 86%, respectively, in the post-2012 group. Factors associated with docetaxel use were having metastases (bone and lymph nodes, and visceral) at CRPC diagnosis, referral to an oncologist before mCRPC development, being younger than 80 at mCRPC diagnosis, having symptoms at mCRPC diagnosis and being diagnosed with mCRPC before 2012. Factors associated with abiraterone (or enzalutamide) use were having metastases (bone, lymph nodes, and visceral) at CRPC diagnosis, referral to an oncologist before mCRPC development, being older than 80 at mCRPC diagnosis, having cardiac or chronic comorbidites at mCRPC diagnosis and being diagnosed with mCRPC after 2012. The median time to have a prescription for docetaxel was delayed by six months in patients diagnosed after 2012 comparatively to those diagnosed before 2012 (p=0.0001). Among patients with bone metastases, 82% had at least one prescription for a bone-targeted therapy (denosumab or zoledronic acid). Factors associated with bone-targeted therapy use were having bone metastases at CRPC diagnosis, being diagnosed with mCRPC after 2012 and having symptoms at mCRPC diagnosis. Conclusion: The introduction of abiraterone (and enzalutamide) reduced overall docetaxel utilization and delayed time to its initiation. Metastases extent, age, moment of diagnosis with mCRPC, and referral to an oncologist before mCRPC development were the predictive factors either docetaxel, abiraterone or enzalutamide utilization. Patients with mCRPC benefit from bone-targeted therapy (denosumab or zoledronic acid) for bone metastases.

617	Fonction auriculaire gauche dans la maladie de Fabry par analyse échocardiographique de la déformation myocardique	Background: Fabry disease (FD) is characterized by the accumulation of sphingolipids in multiple organs including the left atrium (LA). It is uncertain if the LA reservoir, conduit and contractile functions evaluated by speckle-tracking echocardiography are affected in Fabry cardiomyopathy and whether enzyme replacement therapy can improve LA function. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, LA strain, strain rates and phasic LA volumes were studied in 50 FD patients and compared to 50 healthy controls.  Results: All three LA phasic functions were altered. The peak positive strain (reservoir function) was 38.9 ± 14.9 % vs. 46.5 ± 10.9 % (p=0.004) and the late diastolic strain (contractile function) was 12.6 ± 5.9 % vs. 15.6 ± 5.3 % (p=0.010). In 15 patients who started enzyme replacement therapy during the study, most of the LA parameters improved at one-year follow-up (peak positive strain from 32.0 ± 13.5 % to 38.0 ± 13.5 %; p=0.006) whereas there was a trend towards deterioration in 15 patients who never received treatment (peak positive strain from 47.3 ± 10.8 % to 41.3 ± 9.3 %; p=0.058). Nine FD patients (21%) experienced new-onset atrial fibrillation or stroke during four-year follow-up. By univariate analysis, peak positive strain and early diastolic strain demonstrated significant associations with clinical events, surpassing conventional echocardiographic parameters and clinical characteristics. Conclusions: Left atrial reservoir, conduit and contractile functions by speckle-tracking echocardiography were all affected in FD. Enzyme replacement therapy improved LA function. Left atrial strain parameters were associated with atrial fibrillation and stroke.

618	New insights on ammonia metabolism in endothelial cells of the blood brain barrier	Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a complex neuropsychiatric syndrome, which is a major complication of liver disease. Cytotoxic edema is a serious complication of HE, known to be the result of astrocyte swelling. Blood derived pathogenic factors such as ammonia (NH4+) and oxidative stress’ (OS) are known to be synergistically implicated. Endothelial cells (EC) of the blood brain barrier (BBB) are the first cells regulating passage into the brain and to contact blood-derived molecules. The effect of ammonia and oxidative stress on EC transport and metabolism has never been thoroughly explored. Therefore, our aim was to evaluate the effects of NH4+ and reactive oxygen species (ROS) on EC of the BBB using in vivo and in vitro models systems. The Na–K–2Cl cotransporter (NKCC1) has been demonstrated to be involved in the pathogenesis of brain edema in numerous neurological conditions. NKCC1 can transport NH4+ into the brain and is regulated by ROS. Therefore, the expression of NKCC1 was evaluated in primary EC submitted to different concentrations of ROS and NH4+ as well as in cerebral microvessels (CMV) isolated from the bile-duct ligated (BDL) rat, a model HE induced by chronic liver disease. No upregulation of NKCC1 was present in either the treated EC or CMV. Glutamine synthetase (GS) is an enzyme with an important compensatory role in NH4+ detoxification during liver disease. GS is expressed in muscle and brain (astrocytes) but has never been thoroughly explored in ECs of the BBB. GS protein expression and activity was found in EC of the BBB in vitro (primary EC) and in vivo (CMV isolated from naive rats). In the BDL model, GS expression in CMVs was not significantly different from SHAM-operated controls. In addition, we treated ECs with conditioned medium from plasma of BDL rats and found a decrease in GS protein and activity when compared to SHAM. Furthermore, EC treated with NH4+ increased GS activity while treatments with ROS with and without NH4+ decreased GS activity. Overall these results demonstrate for the first time that GS is present in EC both in vivo and in vitro. GS is downregulated in EC treated with BDL plasma (but not in BDL CMV). Interestingly, NH4+ stimulates GS activity in ECs, while ROS inhibits GS activity, possibly justifying the results found from the conditioned medium studies. We speculate that ROS prevents the upregulation of GS in the BBB, decreasing the capacity of the EC to detoxify ammonia and to limit ammonia entry into the brain. We foresee that upregulating GS in ECs of the BBB could become a new therapeutic target for HE.

619	Le rôle protecteur de la périlipine 2 dans la cardiomyopathie diabétique	The accumulation of lipids in the ER alter its functions and homeostasis which triggers a signalling pathway called ER stress (ERS). This pathway is initially programmed to recover ER homeostasis, but prolonged, it triggers an apoptosis cascade. Absorbed lipids are routed to the ER where they are converted to diacylglycerides (DAGs) and triacylglycerides (TAGs) which are packaged into lipid droplets. Lipid droplets contain a core of TAG and cholesterol esters which are converted by a phospholipid monolayer with associated proteins. In our laboratory, we are interested in investigating the mechanisms of lipotoxicity in the setting of diabetic cardiomyopathy.  We demonstrated that palmitate, the most abundant saturated fatty acid in the human diet, triggers ERS in H9c2, a cardiomyoblast cell line. This stress is accompanied with a lack of lipid droplets, accumulation of DAGs in the ER, and followed by a high mortality of cells via the activation of an apoptotic pathway. Moreover, palmitate causes the degradation of Plin2, a partial reduction of Plin3 expression, while Plin5 is intact. In contrast, oleate, the most abundant mono-unsaturated fatty acid in human diet, induces the formation of abundant lipid droplets but does not cause ERS nor DAG accumulation in the ER compartments. Plin2 degradation is also a result of ERS inducers that are independent of lipids associated mechanisms like tunicamycin and thapsigargin. The lack of Plin2 in these two conditions has no effect on the lipid droplets formation nor on the TAG synthesis. On the other hand, inhibition of proteasome slightly protected Plin2 and reduced the palmitate-associated cell death. Moreover, the co-administration of oleate with palmitate reduced the cell death and induced Plin2 expression, both in an oleate dose-dependant way. Finally, overexpressing Plin2 reduces palmitate-associated ERS and cell death. In brief, Plin2 plays a protective role against ERS. This mechanism seems partially independent of lipids which is a novel function of Plin2.	Diabetic Cardiomyopathy , Lipotoxicity , ER stress , Lipid Droplet , Perilipin 2	en	19421.0
620	De la propriété de soi à un concept égalitariste de la propriété	The purpose of this thesis is to try and undermine the libertarian project of defending the liberal structure of ownership through its use of the principle of self-ownership. Far from denying the concept of self-ownership, we adopt the principle associated with libertarian thought and show that the adoption of such a principle leads us to a restructuring of the concept of ownership towards one that is coherent with egalitarian and democratic values. We hope that, by doing so, we are able to show the incoherence within libertarianism and give the tools necessary for egalitarians to defend their ideas on libertarian grounds.

621	Michel-Ange et le motif des genitalia : signification, perception et censure	We propose a study on the male genitalia in Michelangelo’s production, in order to grasp the significance in different works of art depending on the subject that they represent. By focusing on four pieces of art of the Florentine artist, we would like to clarify the visual impact of the male genitals unveiled and the perception from the Italian audience of the fifteenth century and sixteenth century. The Bacchus (1496-1497), The David, (1501-1504), The Risen Christ (1519-1520) and The Last Judgment (1536-1541) have been chosen for the variety of the topics they illustrate and for the different contexts of production and exhibition. We compare religious pieces of art to profane pieces of art to identify specific issues that result in every case. The decision to stick to only Michelango’s artistic production also implies looking at a specific type of male figure, directly inspired by the Antiquity.   For a better understanding of what results from the genitalia’s unveiling, we define essential notions like nude, nudity, sexuality, masculinity and virility in the Renaissance. With a historiographical approach based on The Sexuality of Christ in Renaissance Art and in Modern Oblivion, written by Leo Steinberg, we support his hypothesis about the representations of Christ’ genitals. And with a historical approach we suggest some hypotheses about the nudity of iconic figures realised by Michelangelo.  By focusing mainly on the pieces of art mentioned above and the detail of genitalia, we notice that artists, such as Michelangelo, did not represent this detail by chance, but because this part of the body is rich of signification and can serve to express many concepts.

622	La critique romantique face au Moyen Âge : La Harpe, Villemain, Nisard et Sainte-Beuve	The nineteenth century rediscovered, in a context of rupture with the Ancien Régime's aesthetic, the middle Ages' literature and its prolongations. That literature has been received in different ways, according to the position of each critic in the quarrel of the romantics. This quarrel thus modulated the reception of the works from before the XVIIth century: those became an example to follow for some; or were only, for others, mere examples of the French civilisation's childhood. That new taste of romantics for works neglected by the two preceding centuries brought a questioning about the literature in general, in a new perspective of its historicity. From now on, literature had to be regarded as an expression of a particular and ever changing civilisation. In this context, a new discipline appeared soon: the history of French literature; history still mixed with subjective evaluations and didacticism. We'll delve therefore on the reception that the literature before the XVIIth century received from the most famous and the most representative critics and historians of the nineteenth century, i.e. La Harpe, Villemain, Nisard and Sainte-beuve. We'll study how the literary doctrines of each critic influenced theirs judgements; and will see how the Middle Ages' works has been sometimes used to defend the aesthetic contentions of its judges. We'll analyse as well the variety of the judgements that happened to occur over the years within the framework of a same trend.

623	Le poids des préjugés dans trois romans Kettly Mars	This master’s thesis studies how the prejudices of the haitien social space affect the text layout in three Kettly Mars’s novels: Kasalé, L’heure hybride and Saisons sauvages.  These prejudices defend by the bourgeoisie represent an elite culture which values French language and a western inheritance and despises the popular culture, impregnated with an African inheritance and characterized by the practice of vodoo and the Creole language. “The colour prejudice”, described by certain authors as the base of the system of social organization, also takes an important place within the social discourse.   The three studied novels take place during the political regime of Duvalier: François Duvalier governs in Kasalé and Saisons sauvages and Jean-Claude Duvalier governs L’heure hybride. The presence of dictatorship affects the treatment of the prejudices in Kettly Mars’s novels especially because François Duvalier exploited the Haitian bourgeoisie’s prejudices in his political rhetoric by claiming to be a defender of Haitian popular culture. Nevertheless, Kettly Mars’s novels illustrate the way the dictatorship reproduces these prejudices. With the sociocritic’s notions of “discours social” and “imaginaire social”, this study will question the text layout of the prejudices on the skin color, the popular culture (which includes voodoo and Creole) and the sexuality and the sexual roles through stereotypes, social representations and languages in novels.

624	Sentiment de justice chez les personnes victimes : le rôle de l'information et du contact humain	Victims’ needs are numerous and have been repeatedly listed as needs of information, reparation, psychological support, status within the criminal justice system, protection and practical needs. With procedural and interactional justices as background, information and human contact are assessed in terms of responding to the victims’ needs. The sample represents 188 victims in the Quebec legal process between December 2003 and March 2004. Information on support services and contact with those services are, in bivariate level, directly related to the sense of justice. At the finish line, however, the multivariate level tells us that information about the investigation remains the only variable related to this sense of justice. Finally, in terms of human contact, contact with the Crime Victims Assistance Centers (CAVAC) and sustained contact with the police are important variables.

625	Prévalence, mesures et méthodes alternatives de traitement de la douleur dorsale chez les adolescents ayant une scoliose idiopathique	Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is a three-dimensional spinal deformity. This pathology is the most common spinal deviation encountered in adolescents and has been thoroughly researched over the past few decades regarding its aetiological factors, its risk of progression and management. It is now commonly accepted that the aetiology of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is multifactorial and includes, among other things, genetic, hormonal, mechanic, and neuromuscular factors. Though predicting which deviation will progress remain challenging, certain factors such as the age of the patient at presentation, its gender, bone maturity (Risser sign), menarchal status, and the severity of the spinal deformity are now widely accepted as factors that may provide some guidance to estimate this probability. Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis has often been considered as a non-painful pathology, and this is perhaps why researchers have failed to assess back pain in this population more systematically. Only a few studies have been published over the last two decades on this subject. Among those studies, inclusion criteria are widely heterogeneous, as is the working definition of back pain, how the prevalence period was estimated, and which outcome measure was relied upon to assess back pain in this population. Because of this, the determination of back pain prevalence in scoliosis patients remains challenging. Considering the relationship between adolescent and adult spinal pain, and the high societal cost associated with this condition, it would be appropriate to obtain a clearer picture of this condition in this population. v The primary objectives of this thesis were to (objectif 1) update the current knowledge of back pain prevalence in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis patients, to (objectif 2) ascertain if a relationship was present between the severity and localisation of the scoliosis and the back pain, too (objectif 3) reassess the psychometric properties of the SRS-22fv questionnaire, and to (objectif 4) explore an alternative back pain management for those patients. The first retrospective study included in this thesis assessed back pain prevalence in 300 adolescent idiopathic scoliosis patients. It also looked at how pain was reported and if pain management was recommended for patients reporting back pain. This study confirmed that back pain was a prevalent condition in this population and that in the vast majority of those reporting back pain, there was no kind of management recommended. The second prospective study assessed back pain prevalence in more than 500 adolescent idiopathic scoliosis patients. Point prevalence of back pain was close to 68 %. For the thoracic and lumbar regions, the pain was positively associated with the severity of the scoliosis and bracing, prescribed to stabilise or prevent the curve progression, had a protective effect. Data collected in the previous study were employed to validate the most commonly utilised outcome measure in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, the SRS-22. The SRS-22 is a measurement instrument used to ascertain the quality of life and pain in scoliotic patients. The third article includes a report on analyses done regarding the validation of the SRS- 22fv. Complete data were available for 352 adolescents. The study demonstrated that a briefer version (18 items) had a better internal consistency and explained a greater proportion of the variance thus 63,3 % instead of 47,4 % for the SRS-22fv. vi The last study included in this thesis looked at an alternative treatment for the management scoliotic patients with or without back pain. This modality of spinal manipulation is a treatment that healthy adolescents commonly utilised. However, it was found that the rate of utilisation remains unclear within adolescent idiopathic scoliosis patients. A literature review revealed the need to have better-designed studies to assess the efficacy of spinal manipulation in this population adequately. The acquired knowledge throughout this thesis leads us to a better comprehension and understanding of back pain in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis patients. Back pain appears to be more prevalent than initially estimated and a relationship seems to be present between the level of pain intensity and the scoliosis localisation and severity in patients suffering from this pathology.

626	Deciphering causal genetic determinants of red blood cell traits	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed several genetic variants associated with complex phenotypes. This is the case for red blood cell (RBC) traits, which are particularly amenable to GWAS as they are routinely and accurately measured. Understanding RBC trait variation is important given their significance as clinical markers and modifiers of disease severity. Notably, increased fetal hemoglobin (HbF) production in sickle cell disease (SCD) patients is associated with a higher life expectancy and decreased morbidity. Nonetheless, most variants identified through GWAS fall in non-coding regions of the human genome, increasing the difficulty of identifying causal links.    The main goal of this project was to identify and characterize genes influencing complex traits, and in particular RBC phenotypes. First, I developed an approach to identify and test potential gene knockouts affecting anthropometric traits in a large sample from the general population, which did not yield significant associations. Then, I characterized the DNA methylome and transcriptome of erythroblasts differentiated ex vivo from hematopoietic progenitor stem cells (HPSC), and identified several genes potentially implicated in fetal and adult-stage erythroid programs. I also identified microRNAs (miRNA) that show specific developmental expression patterns and that are enriched in inversely expressed targets. Finally, I mapped expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) in erythroblasts, and identify erythroid-specific eQTLs for ATP2B4, the main calcium ATPase of RBCs. These genetic variants are associated with RBC traits and malaria susceptibly, and overlap an erythroid-specific enhancer of ATP2B4. Deletion of this regulatory element using CRISPR/Cas9 experiments in human erythroid cells minimized ATP2B4 expression and increased intracellular calcium levels.    In conclusion, large and comprehensive genotyping datasets will be necessary to test the role of rare gene knockouts on complex phenotypes. The transcriptomes and DNA methylomes of erythroblasts show substantial differences correlating with their developmental stages and that may be implicated in HbF production. These results also suggest a strong implication of erythroid enhancers and miRNAs in developmental stage specificity.  Finally, characterizing the erythroid-specific enhancer of ATP2B4 suggest that integrating epigenomic, transcriptomic and gene editing experiments can be a powerful approach to characterize non-coding genetic variants. These results implicate ATP2B4 in erythroid cell hydration, which is associated with malaria susceptibility and SCD severity, suggesting that therapies targeting this gene could impact diseases affecting millions of individuals worldwide.

627	Implications éthiques, sociales et légales de l'épigénétique : perspectives rhétorique, dialectique et réflexive sur l'application des connaissances scientifiques	Epigenetics is a field of research focusing on variations in gene activity that do not involve changes in the DNA sequence and that can be transmitted during cell divisions. Researchers in this field are studying the role of very precise changes in the 3D structure of DNA, imposed by DNA methylation and other biochemical reactions, that impede or facilitate the reading of genes depending on the need of the cells. Many diseases are associated with a disruption of epigenetic mechanisms, such as cancers, cardiovascular diseases, hormonal and metabolic disorders, chronic inflammatory diseases and neuropsychological disorders.  Over the past fifteen years, epigenetics has grown rapidly. It was particularly propelled by research in environmental epigenetics, which is interested in the external causes of the alteration of epigenetic mechanisms. This branch of research has recently attracted considerable attention from the media and researchers in social sciences and humanities because it highlights, at the molecular level, the critical influence of the physico-chemical and psycho-social environment on people’s health. It also sheds additional light on the close relationship between social inequalities and health inequalities. Thus, environmental epigenetics could encourage us not only to conceive biomedical technologies capable of reversing the acquired detrimental variations, but also to develop preventive public health strategies that take into account social justice considerations affecting the health of individuals and populations.  In this thesis, we propose an exploration of the ethical, legal and social implications of epigenetics. We begin by presenting a comprehensive review of the various observations, interpretations and speculations expressed in the social sciences and humanities literature about the epistemological and normative consequences of this young field of research. We then proceed to a three-step analysis of knowledge translation. A first approach, that we call the rhetorical perspective, promotes environmental epigenetics as an advocacy tool for preventive health policies and the expansion of North American bioethics towards a view that includes environmental concerns and social determinants of health (Article 1). A second approach, that we call the dialectical perspective, offers a critical look at the assignment of moral responsibilities based on epigenetic discoveries. It demonstrates the complexity of this endeavor by shedding light on the scientific uncertainties and apparent internal contradictions of this field of study, especially with regards to the notions of epigenetic normality and epigenetic plasticity (Article 2). A third approach, that we call the reflexive perspective, examines the potential influence of the contemporary biopolitical landscape – molecularization of health and biomedicalization of life – on knowledge translation. In this neoliberal ‘regime of truth’, which favors the processes of internalization, isolation, commodification and technologization, it is likely that the clinical translation of epigenetics will be unduly privileged, by default, impeding its translation into important preventive health policies (Article 3). We conclude with a view towards the future of the field of EpigELS and a brief discussion on the partly interpretive nature of the knowledge-to-practice process.	justice distributive , Epigenetics , Bioethics , Biopolitics , Knowledge translation , Distributive justice , Moral responsability , Stigmatization , Public health , Social determinants of health , Environment	en	19325.0
628	Rôle des Smads lors du processus de régénération chez Ambystoma mexicanum	Since wound healing in human is imperfect and associated with fibrosis, understanding how regeneration works would be a great asset to improve patient’s health. During this PhD project, we have published a paper exposing the weaknesses of certain research models when studying wound healing. Those limitations are even more striking when studying regeneration. This publication sets the stage for the use of the axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum) as an excellent model to study regeneration and the importance of TGF- for the process. The multifunctional cytokine TGF-β is involved in healing, scarring, cellular differentiation, growth and migration. This cytokine is associated with the near perfect healing of oral tissues in humans, but is also associated with scarring of multiple tissue types. TGF-β is also associated with epimorphic regeneration in echinoderm and liver hyperplasia.  Previous work had shown that treatment of regenerating axolotl limbs with a specific inhibitor of TGF-β canonical signalling (SB-431542) prevents regeneration (Lévesque et al., 2007). Since canonical signaling goes through Smad2 and Smad3, those two proteins are at the center of the second publication. During limb regeneration, Smad2 is phosphorylated at 6h-48h post-amputation (pa), which corresponds to the cellular migration phase and the beginning of the proliferative phase. On the other hand, Smad3 phosphorylation happens earlier (3h-6h pa), while the total protein expression is lower. Treatment with SB-421543 blocks the phosphorylation of both Smad2 and Smad3. No blastema is formed, but the wound closes at the same rate. Treatment with other inhibitors, SIS3 or Naringenin (specifically targeting Smad3), blocks approximately 50% of Smad3 phosphorylation (as determined by western blotting), but regeneration is not affected. Differential regulation of Smads is essential for proper regeneration to occur. Lastly, we have tried multiple approaches to diminish specifically the activation of Smad2. Using the only axolotl cell line available (AL-1), we have tried inhibition with LNA molecules, long antisense and overexpression of a competitor. None of these approaches specifically reduced the levels of Smad2. In addition, other experiments confirmed that activation of Smad3 during the regeneration process is limited.  The extraordinary ability to regenerate that the axolotl possesses is tightly linked to a differential activation of Smad2 and Smad3 proteins. Smad2 phosphorylation is associated with cellular proliferation and migration, hence blastema formation, while the apparent lack of Smad3 activity might partly explain why these animals do not form scar tissues.

629	Différences de genre dans la dissociation et la détresse péri-traumatique, et associations avec les troubles de stress aigu et de stress post-traumatique chez des victimes d’actes criminels graves	This thesis aimed to contribute to the acute stress disorder (ASD) and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) literature in terms of gender differences among crime victims. Precisely, we were interested in the intensity and presence of peritraumatic reactions namely, dissociation and distress, among men and women victims of violent crimes. Two objectives were pursued. First, we evaluated whether peritraumatic dissociation and distress were significant risk factors for ASD development and if these acute stress reactions’ predictive capacity, differed according to gender. A second objective was to investigate if peritraumatic dissociation and distress significantly predicted PTSD development according to gender. Globally, in this research project, we were interested in determining the impact of gender in the prediction of the above-mentioned relationship . Semi-structured interviews; the Acute Stress Disorder Interview (ASDI) in the first article and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID) in the second article were conducted with 214 victims (125 women, Mage=39.6yrs) to assess ASD and PTSD respectively. Data on peritraumatic variables were collected through self-report questionnaires, the Peritraumatic Dissociative Experience Questionnaire and the Peritraumatic Distress Inventory.  Peritraumatic dissociation and distress were both significant risk factors for ASD in men and women. Women presented higher peritraumatic distress levels compared to men victims. Gender differences were revealed through past potential traumatic experiences, where they have a cumulative impact on ASD risk development for men, but having few past potential traumas could be a protective factor for women. In the second article, findings reveal that acute stress variables were both significantly related to more PTSD symptoms, although no gender differences were identified. An acute stress disorder diagnosis was also confirmed as an important predictor of PTSD in victims of violent crimes.  These results, study limitations, directions for future research as well as clinical implications for ASD and PTSD treatment will be discussed.	victims of violent crimes , post-traumatic stress disorder , acute stress disorder , peritraumatic dissociation , peritraumatic distress , gender	en	19305.0
630	Formation de poudres carbonées dans un plasma de haute fréquence produit à très basse pression dans des mélanges acétylène-argon	Dusty plasmas are plasmas that contain solid particles of nano- or micrometer size. They are widespread in the cosmic environment and act as precursors in the formation of planets and stars. Such plasmas are also used in laboratories for the synthesis of nanocomposites, which have wide technological and medical applications. While a large scientific effort has been invested in the study and control of such plasmas, the initial growth mechanism of powders (i.e. before they reach several tens of nanometers) remains poorly known. This work contributes primarily to expand the fundamental knowledge in the field of dusty plasmas. Our goal is to understand the physical chemistry of high-frequency plasmas magnetically confined in chemically reactive gases. In addition, we aim by examining the kinetics of the precursors in the plasma to understand the mechanisms of nanoparticle formation in the volume and to control their characteristics in a magnetically confined low pressure Ar/C2H2 plasma. This contribution has a direct impact on science and plasma applications. Among the applications related directly to this research, we mention the synthesis of carbon-based nanocomposites for their integration in solar cells and biomaterials. By examining the plasma characteristics (plasma temperature and density, cation and anion density) and correlating them to those of the dust particles, we found that the magnetic field changes the process of the formation of these particles in the discharge at very low pressure. Specifically, it stimulates the nucleation of carbon nanoparticles through several channels, i.e. through the anions and cations. These nanoparticles include two different phases, an amorphous carbon layer and a porous core formed of grains aggregate. These grains are formed of graphite nanocrystals coated with an amorphous layer. Moreover, the radius of the dust particles increases with the magnetic field, which is related to the enhancement of their residence time in the plasma volume.	anions , cations , nanocomposites , dusty plasma , magnetic confinement , low pressure , nucleation , anions , cations , carbon nanoparticles , nanocomposites	en	19301.0
631	Anatomy of smooth integers	The object of the first chapter of this thesis is to review the materials and tools in analytic number theory which are used in following chapters. We also give a survey on the development concerning the number of y−smooth integers, which are integers free of prime factors greater than y. In the second chapter, we shall give a brief history about a class of arithmetical functions on a probability space and we discuss on some well-known problems in probabilistic number theory. We present two results in analytic and probabilistic number theory. The Erdos multiplication table problem asks what is the number of distinct integers appearing in the N × N multiplication table. The order of magnitude of this quantity was determined by Kevin Ford (2008). In chapter 3 of this thesis, we study the number of y−smooth entries of the N × N multiplication. More concretely, we focus on the change of behaviour of the function A(x,y) in different ranges of y, where A(x,y) is a function that counts the number of distinct y−smooth integers less than x which can be represented as the product of two y−smooth integers less than p x. In Chapter 4, we prove an Erdos-Kac type of theorem for the set of y−smooth integers. If !(n) is the number of distinct prime factors of n, we prove that the distribution of !(n) is Gaussian for a certain range of y using method of moments.

632	Développement et évaluation d’approches géostatistiques à l’échelle urbaine pour l’estimation de l’exposition aux particules fines et à l’ozone troposphérique	Air pollution is a major environmental hazard with clearly demonstrable adverse effects on health and the environment. However, the measurement of populations’ exposure to pollutants such as particulate matter and ground-level ozone remains approximate due to the low density of sampling stations for these pollutants. Moreover, intra-urban spatial variation in the spatial modeling of pollutant concentrations has received little research attention. If anything, some studies have combined spatial interpolation and correlation with local factors; however, they do so without examining the effect of the weather regime (e.g., a temperature inversion) on the magnitude of these correlations. In order to overcome these shortcomings, this dissertation aims to evaluate new ways of characterizing the spatial and temporal distribution of fine particles (PM2.5) and ground-level ozone (O3) at the intra-urban scale. In particular, we developed a multivariable geostatistical model called “kriging with external drift” (KED) based on the integration of auxiliary variables into the process of estimating daily PM2.5 and O3 concentrations. Kriging is a form of spatial interpolation of data from measurement stations that are dispersed, while external drift is based on correlations between local conditions (road transport arteries, green spaces, etc.) and the concentration of atmospheric pollutants. In order to take account of temporal variations, especially those related to weather conditions, we designed these models around six synoptic weather classes based on daily meteorological data (such as temperature, wind, relative humidity and precipitation). v The results show that the integration of auxiliary variables (such as vegetation density and local industrial activity areas) in KED partly explains the intra-urban variations of PM2.5 on the island of Montreal, but that this contribution is variable depending on the weather conditions. Thus, when the correlations are very low, a simple spatial interpolation (such as the inverse distance weighting (IDW) method) is more accurate than multivariable interpolation, whereas for other synoptic conditions KED produces the most certain predictions. For this reason, we proposed a hybrid interpolation model (KED-IDW) that can adapt to different weather conditions. We have also shown, particularly in the case of O3, that KED improves the results obtained from ordinary kriging (without auxiliary variables). This dissertation also allowed to evaluate the contribution of a spatial-temporal model—BME (bayesian maximum entropy)—in the estimation of the short-term effect of exposure to O3 on deaths in Montreal. The results suggest that this spatio-temporal model under the determined conditions (e.g., based on data from 12 measurement stations, for a territory of 1 310 km2) does not offer significant improvements to the estimation of the effect of exposure. Overall, this dissertation contributes to the advancement of the empirical spatial modeling of air pollutants, namely by taking into account the adaptation to weather conditions as well as certain predictive meteorological factors. In this context, the dissertation opens up a promising path for improving the estimation of air pollution at the intra-urban scale and the capacity to assess population health risks through better characterization of exposure.

633	La littérature aux limites du lisible : singularités de l’expérience littéraire dans le champ poétique français contemporain	This dissertation focuses on the readability of literature—on the readability of a certain literature: French, contemporary, a literature that is more often than not classified in the poetic field. At first, a simple observation: some books are difficult to read. Sometimes we even get so far as to say they are unreadable; if this judgment cannot provide a rigorous concept to describe the texts, it nevertheless raises a number of questions which are at the heart of this dissertation. For there is nothing unreadable in itself: the unreadable is not a property, but a judgment that translates an impasse in reading. Thus, the verdicts of unreadability have varied causes and consequences. The unreadable is situated: it is difficult to approach it outside of its circumstances, since it refers less to a specific content than to an experience.  The objective here is not to alleviate the misunderstanding that can be felt in front of certain texts, but rather to question the place it occupies in our ways of reading and our relation to literature. This dissertation proposes to reflect on these questions by approaching the works of Jean-Michel Reynard, Christophe Tarkos, Denis Roche, Anne-Marie Albiach, Christian Prigent, Valère Novarina and Pierre Guyotat. These works do not all have the same place in this dissertation. In this sense, the aim is not to exhaust them but to raise a number of questions through them. Different questions according to the works, according to the writers, but which are crossed by a common thread: the literary experience.  From singular situations, the goal is thus to understand certain aspects, certain modalities of the literary experience. The two poles of this experience are writing and reading—related to those are the figures of the writer and the reader, which occupy an important place in this dissertation. Therefore, the perspective is broad, which raises questions sometimes of poietic, centred on the way writers live the creation of their works, and sometimes more of poetic, even politic, which rather refer to the ways in which readers, on their side, experience these radically singular texts.  In short, the objectives of this dissertation are: 1) to study these works from a new angle; 2) through their problematic example, to lay the foundations for a reflection on readability that gives a large place to the writers’ posture and the way they live the creation of their works; and 3) to contribute to studies on creation, reception and mediation of literary works by reflecting on our ways of living (with) literature.	sens , Jean-Michel Reynard , Christophe Tarkos , Denis Roche , Anne-Marie Albiach , Christian Prigent , Valère Novarina , Pierre Guyotat , Literary experience , Readability , Meaning , Singularity and community , Poietic , Poetic	en	19289.0
634	Illuminating biomolécules : shedding light on the utility of labeling using transglutaminases	The development of recombinant molecular biology technologies was a turning point for the biological sciences, which has since evolved into dozens upon dozens of different subfields and contributed to extraordinary advances for humans. At the core of many of these advances are the enzymes produced by these techniques, with efforts to understand their form and function laying the groundwork for their application. One of these continuously advancing subfields rooted in enzymology is biocatalysis, in which chemists and engineers embrace biological components and systems to complement, or even replace, existing methodologies. This thesis seeks to further contribute to the advancement and ubiquity of enzymes to be incorporated into future innovations. To this end, transglutaminase (TGase) is the biocatalyst selected for study. TGases are versatile enzymes, with the bacterial homolog, microbial transglutaminase (MTG) being readily used in industrial processes for years, particularly for food processing. An abundance of efforts seeking to apply TGases to other processes have been made within the last decade. We commence by reviewing the accomplishments, progress, and challenges to developing TGase towards new goals. TGase naturally catalyzes the formation of isopeptide bonds utilizing a glutamine and lysine substrates, and one of its first unconventional applications we investigated was for peptide synthesis. We determined the ability and specificity of one form of TGase for various amino acid-derived substrates, observing the formation of Gly-Xaa and D-Ala-Gly dipeptide products, albeit at a low conversion. MTG exhibits several characteristics that make it an appealing candidate for biotechnological development, such as its independence from a cofactor, little competition for its reverse catalytic reaction, and increased stability relative to mammalian TGases. Therefore, the remainder of this thesis pertains exclusively to MTG. We developed and extensively characterized a one-pot chemoenzymatic peptide and protein conjugation scheme. The presence of sufficient glutathione circumvents the incompatibility of the copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition with MTG owing to the presence of copper. We ultimately utilized this chemoenzymatic conjugation scheme for fluorescent protein labeling. We continue to expand upon combinatorial methods to undertake protein labeling by investigating to what extent metal-free click chemistries can be utilized in combination with MTG. Specifically, the Staudinger ligation, strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition, and tetrazine ligation (TL) were assayed on protein substrates to reveal varying levels of effective conjugation, with the TL being the most promising of the three. The details surrounding the manner in which MTG interacts with its glutamine-containing substrate remains unclear. To address this knowledge gap, we sought to pursue crystallography studies, which required the development a modified purification strategy. We discuss the strategies we investigated and the challenges surrounding such efforts. Finally, we present a conjugation system consisting of MTG as the labeling biocatalyst, the B1 domain of Protein G (GB1) as a substrate, and a small-molecule amine belonging to a recently developed class of fluorophores as a probe. As two components of this system are proteins, enzyme engineering can be applied to further improve their properties. A semi-rational approach was used to generate a 24-member GB1 library to probe the structural determinants of MTG’s glutamine selectivity. Each variant contained a single glutamine at varying positions covering all secondary structure elements, and assayed for reactivity. Eight substitutions resulting in an increased labeling efficiency of at least an order of magnitude were distributed throughout all secondary structure elements, indicating that MTG does not favor one preferentially. In addition, introducing point mutations within MTG’s active site also resulted in increased reactivity towards variant I6Q-GB1. Our results contribute further to understanding the nature of MTG’s glutamine selectivity, while simultaneously demonstrating the potential enzyme engineering has to improve and adjust this system.

635	Qualifications paysagères de la ville : l’espace aérien des toits de New York dans le cinéma américain (1980-2011)	This research takes place in the general context of life in the city today, a life in the city which accompanies a strong interest for the question of landscape and the question of quality of life and urban environment, all while keeping in mind sustainable development of the city. In a specific context in which densification and redevelopment encompass a more intensive and multifunctional use of spaces, it seems appropriate to focus on the issue of flat rooftops of the great North American city, spaces that are traditionally forgotten and underutilized.  Taking into account the current interest in rooftops and the issues about the urban landscape, in terms of social demand, design and research, we took interest in the question of the landscape valorization of the aerial city through the representations of New York City rooftops in contemporary American cinema. Using the discursive constructionist approach as well as the concept of representation and the concept of landscape, we developed a mixed methodology which uses film content analysis and landscape valorization analysis. In total, we analyzed more than 185 films released between 1980 and 2011.  By linking cinematic representations with historical uses of New York City rooftops, we identified three main patterns of New York rooftop landscape valorization: the emblematic New York, the romantic New York and the domestic rooftop. Both multiple and dichotomous, but not homogeneous nor monolithic, these valorizations are rooted in the New York rooftop landscape invention that came together mainly at the end of 19th century and the first half of the 20th century. These landscape valorizations represent a modernized take on the New York rooftop landscape invention and in that sense are different from the major landscape inventions of the last three centuries in the following aspects:  the reduced emphasis on nature, the role of cinema in the process of the invention of landscape and the role of man and their uses of rooftops in that process. The latter, which is the sociological perspective resulting from human presence, uses and movement through the process of landscape valorization, is also one of the key elements of this research as well as one of its two main contributions. The second main contribution being the data collection method which takes into account the factual dimension and the sensory one, thus positioning itself among new trends of landscape study where these two dimensions, rather than oppose, are considered integral parts of the landscape.

636	The practice of persian piano in Iran from 1879 to 1979	Piano, a western musical instrument has a unique historical position in Persian music. Iran has its own music as part of its culture, a classical canon with an enduring repertoire and characteristic techniques handed down from generation to generation with some improvements made along the way. When the first keys were played on a piano in Tehran in the 1870s, the members of the imperial court were the exclusive audience. At the time, Sorourolmolk, the master musician of the Qajar palace during the reign of Nāsseredin Shah Qajar (1848-1896), attempted to change the tuning of piano and play traditional Persian tunes in a way inspired by santur and tār techniques. Thus, the practice of piano in Iran was immediately associated with the music that had already existed for generations. This would eventually become known as “Persian piano.” Later, the educated elite of the society, and students of the first military music school in Tehran (Sho’beh-ye Music-e Dārolfonoun) were among the first practitioners of Persian piano.  This dissertation studies the art of Persian piano in Tehran from its introduction in 1880s until the Revolution of 1979. During this period, Persian piano practice gradually matured, culminating in the compositions and performances of Moshir Homāyoun-e Shahrdār (1886-1969), Mortezā Mahjoubi (1900-1965), and Javād Ma’roufi (1915-1993). Of this group, Mahjoubi is considered the most prominent composer and performer, and is the one credited with establishing Persian piano as a distinctive art form. This study looks at his work, and also focuses a spotlight on Ma’roufi’s style and contributions to Persian piano. With regard to the most notable elements in traditional Persian piano, the dissertation offers a thorough analysis of the techniques and tuning systems linked to the Persian microtone, and explores innovations in the canonic practice of traditional Persian piano.   With the rapid expansion of western classical music in Iran in the twentieth century, the practice of Persian piano based almost entirely on indigenous Persian instrumental techniques, forms, and melodies, no longer held an exclusive place in piano performance. Accordingly the dissertation moves on to the practice of piano in Iran in the twentieth century and finds that Western classical piano co-existed with the Persian style. The study delves into the establishment of the western classical piano in Persian society and presents the major contributors in this field including Emanuel Melik-Aslāniān (1915- 2003). The dissertation places particular emphasis on female keyboard players, their musical education, style of play, and public performances from the Qajar period through the Pahlavi era. Today, promising attempts to revitalize the art of Persian piano are on the rise. This is especially true for Mahjoubi’s style whose outstanding legacy marks a milestone in the evolution of Persian piano practice. Presently, Mahjoubi’s best student, Fakhri Malekpour, is teaching the traditional style of Persian piano in private lessons in Tehran. The effort to awaken interest, and to train a new generation of practitioners just might mean that this unique form of piano art will become more well known and practiced alongside other pianistic trends on into the future.

637	La construction sociale et l’hybridation des logiques marchandes et du système de santé dans l’émergence, le succès et la pérennité des entreprises de technologies innovantes en santé	With the advent of micro-computing in the 1980s, the Internet in the 1990s and the completion of the sequencing of the human genome at the turn of the 21st century, the number of companies developing health technologies has exploded. Nonetheless, hospital practice and day-to-day interactions with health professionals working in different sectors of the Quebec health system and other Canadian provinces reflect a large difference between the number of technologies appearing in conferences and blogs, and those adopted and used in the field. But while the evaluation of technologies and the study of the diffusion of innovations led to an important scientific literature, few studies have so far explored the emergence of innovative health technology companies taking into account the point of view of all the actors involved. It is this lack of knowledge that our study wishes to fill, by asking how an emerging health technology company can be socially constructed by initiating certain competitive actions and why these actions may differ according to the type of company, demands and pressures from economic and healthcare system actors. The research objectives are therefore to define how innovative health technology companies establish themselves by using the effect of their competitive actions while giving them meaning, determining the influence of the type of business and the patterns of social construction activities on competitive actions, sensemaking activities and responses to the pressures of institutional actors, and finally identify the strategies used by entrepreneurs to address the institution that is the health system. In order to answer the questions raised by field observations, this research was organized in three successive parts, exploring three different points of view. The first is that of an external observer to health technology start-ups. The second part is that of the actors around these companies and the third is that of the entrepreneurs themselves. The first part consists of a multiple case study using explanation-building analysis strategy. The study was based on the analysis of press releases (n = 664) and general media articles (n = 627). The sample includes five Canadian companies listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange in the form of four startups that made an initial bid from 2000 to 2003 and a well-established firm. Of these, three were in the health sector, one in the e-commerce sector, while the well-established company was a health electronic infrastructure solutions company. Overall, during the emergence of the company, marketing and symbolic actions, coupled with the use of opinion leaders and high-profile people, were significantly more pronounced with the health-based startups when compared to the firm who was not in the health sector. In the early months of emergence, as communications and signals increased, health-based startups were the only firms to use cognitive and pragmatic legitimacy, relying on cognition rather than personal interest or moral judgment of the actors. In addition, we observed differences in the use of marketing and symbolic actions and also in the use of opinion leaders. This suggests a differential influence of the social construction model and firm type on the level and mix of market actions and sensegiving activities between health and non-health technology companies. The second and third components consist of two sets of semi-structured interviews, where a thematic analysis was used to identify and report themes while organizing and describing the data set thoroughly. For the second part, the sample for semi-structured interviews includes 10 medical specialists, 4 health professionals involved in health technology acquisition, 3 health technology assessment units’ members, and 3 investors in health technologies. We have determined that the acquisition and diffusion of health technologies are increasingly regulated and must respond to increasing pressures from a large number of actors who, conversely, see their agency power diminish. We also found that the pressures to institutionalize practices, as well as the decoupling of the objectives of the health system from those of other actors, are addressed by “political” strategies; the power of key influencers such as investors and medical specialists, as well as mistrust of marketing actions are addressed with “associative” strategies; the pressures arising from the growing need for evidence-based evidence are addressed through “normative” strategies. Finally, the fragmentation of a public health system and the heterogeneity of local procurement processes are approached with “identity” strategies. The third part focuses on how entrepreneurs seize opportunities, create their entrepreneurial organization, and give it legitimacy, and examined the triggers, constraints and pressures involved in this process. The sample for the interviews consisted of 20 entrepreneurs and strategic partners involved in the development and commercialization of health technologies. At each stage, we identified a predominant institutional process, whether it be the decoupling, the influence of the organizational field or the search for legitimation. We found that each stage of the start-up was triggered by situations where the entrepreneur faced barriers and constraints in the form of a misalignment of boundaries, poor performance of competing technologies, and of resource asymmetry. Our findings can help healthcare professionals, decision-makers and evaluators understand the process of adoption and diffusion of health technologies and contribute to the development of procurement procedures through targeted policies and revised processes. For investors, our study allows them to identify the barriers that pace the speed at which new technologies are making their way into clinical practice and the health care system. The results can also provide a framework for developing baseline data to evaluate current and future investments. A better understanding of the differences in health technology startups compared to other startups could help entrepreneurs prioritize competitive actions and better understand perceived intentions and real health needs during the social emergence of the company. For the healthcare system, the results can be used to develop and enrich procurement and evaluation policies and guidelines that will improve access to safe, effective and high quality medical technologies.

639	Cercles citoyens et espace public : la démocratisation organisationnelle à l’épreuve des rodas brésiliennes	"In Brazil, anti-authoritarian movements, particularly those engaged in psychiatric reform, are creating some of the newest innovative democratic forms of social participation. The aim of this research is first to understand how these new participatory schema act on the social relations of power across the mental health network in the city of Campinas in the State of São Paulo. I first problematize the social and economic forces involved in the construction of this network and its ""system of analysis and co-management"". This participatory model of organization requires users, workers, managers and sometimes local elected officials work side by side. Across the different streams of organizational sociology, the user is seen to play a central role in defining the socio-political dimension of the organization. However this is not achieved through participatory schema rather the user arises from the production of political subjectivation and the actual experiments themselves. Using ethnographic data collected during an eight-month period from across the Campinas mental health network, I observe how the transformation of the subjective social relations of power experienced by the actors refers to specific collective configurations commonly known as ""rodas"" (Circle in Portuguese). The term “rodas” refers to small groups of actors who meet to reflect, debate and decide on actions to be taken in relation to mental health practices in the city. These collective configurations allow citizens to give meaning and form to a local democratization project. The study then focuses on how the rodas influence the social relations of power induced by the local organization. In 2012, the Campinas mental health network went through one of the biggest crises in its history. Cuts and the privatization of services led to widespread citizen mobilization. In this context, I identify tensions and strategies within the rodas and their means for participation across the network paying attention to their everyday experiences. The analysis of rodas opens up new avenues of understanding the levers of collective power in an organizational context. Through the sharing of time in a plurality of open spaces, through sharing affect as well as through collective problem-solving of critical events impacting affecting daily life, the rodas act to reduce organisational e hierarchy. This collective effort of constantly renew democratization does not however make it possible to overcome the inequalities of power induced by the organization of services and by Brazilian society. As a form of citizen participatory practice, rodas nevertheless provide collective levers that denounce contradictions and social injustices within and outside the organization. Their practices highlight the possibility of a continuous collective criticism open to social creativity. This research opens a new field of study on citizen participation and innovation in the context of the organization; a field that is all the more promising because it is part of a critical renewal of the sociology of organizations."

640	L’impact de l’utilisation d’un budget de référence sur le niveau de générosité du soutien financier minimal dans les pays de l’OCDE	In the last two decades, many academics have studied factors that have an impact on the generosity level of minimum income protection in OECD countries. Studies have shown, for example, that benefit generosity was positively linked with high GDP, a high level of centralisation of social assistance schemes, and the presence of universal social insurance programs. Likewise, in recent years, academics have shown a rising interest about the budgetary approach based on beneficiaries’ needs as a mean of determining the minimum social assistance benefit level. However, no important study has verified if the use of reference budgets for determining and adjusting social assistance benefits was correlated with a high or low benefits level. This correlation is what this paper attempts to ascertain. The main conclusion of this research is that the simple use of reference budgets is not directly linked with a high level of benefit generosity. However, if a state uses a budgetary model that allows to achieve a decent and reasonable standard of living, it is very probable that the generosity of assistance to the able-bodied poor will be high. The case of Quebec shows moreover that the use of a reference budget aiming to reach a minimum level of subsistence can contribute to a decrease of benefit generosity. The Swedish case, however, demonstrates that the use of a reference budget allowing a decent living standard and social participation has influenced positively the generosity of social assistance benefits. This study also shows that political and economic concerns and pressures have had important, and generally negative, impacts on the generosity level of social assistance benefits over time.

"Drawing both on Deleuze’s critique of “the new Hollywood” and on the metaphysical dialectics of Apollo and Dionysus as expressed in Nietzsche’s ""The Birth of Tragedy"", this essay will look at some of the means through which theater inhabits the movies. Then, it will slightly shift from the usual focus — and shed new light — on the concept of adaptation by delving on the “filming of theater” (as opposed to the more generic “theater on film”). Its starting point will be the 1977 movie ""Opening Night"", shot by John Cassavetes, in which the director (and cinema in general) exploits the middle-age crisis of an actress to create anew for the theater."

642	Revue réaliste des modèles de services de première ligne	Background: It increasingly appears that the sustainability of health systems depends in part on expanding the care provided by primary care teams. There are many examples of successful primary care models in several countries. However, Quebec generally fails to meet its objectives of accessibility, equity and efficiency. There is growing evidence on the importance of nursing care in primary health services, but it provides little actionable advice on how to reform primary care models given the diversity of clinical settings. The complexity of the interventions needed to reform primary care models is a challenge. Objective: This research reports the results of a realist review on optimizing the contribution of interprofessional and nursing teams in primary health care. Method: An analysis of the literature based on the realist review and the logic analysis was conducted to determine the desirable structural characteristics of health care services models that tend to an extended or optimized contribution of interprofessional teams. Results: The realist review helped to develop two analytical typologies to establish coherent operating bases to improve the performance of models of primary health services. Practice implications : These typologies ultimately aim to facilitate the use of evidence for decision makers to support the necessary transformation processes of primary health care in Quebec.

643	Étude in vitro des changements physiologiques des cellules épithéliales du moustique Aedes aegypti en réponse à une exposition aux toxines du bacille de Thuringe	Bacillus thuringiensis var israelensis (Bti) produces four insecticidal toxins used around the world to control disease-borne and harmful dipterans populations: Cry4Aa, Cry4Ba, Cry11Aa and Cyt1Aa. They each present their lethal effect on different dipterans, but combined, they generate a synergistic activity and a reduced resistance is observed. Though these synergies are well documented and supported by toxicity bioassays, little is known regarding the cellular and molecular mechanisms of these synergies. Here, by using freshly isolated midguts from the mosquito Aedes aegypti, an important malaria vector, and glass microelectrodes, we measured the electrical potential of the apical membrane when exposed to these toxins alone or in combination. We observed a depolarisation when treated with Cyt1Aa and Cry4Aa. Toxin mixture assays only revealed a faster depolarisation of the membrane when the above two toxins were combined together, and a variety of responses with other toxin mixtures. Microspectrofluometry using the calcium probe Fura-2 on an immortal cell line from Anopheles gambiae (Ag55) showed massive effect of Cyt1Aa, but very little effect of the Cry toxins alone or in mixture. Microspectrofluometry experiments were also conducted on freshly dissociated cells from Aedes aegypti. Though these experiments are innovative and the results preliminary, it was observed that some cells responded differently to Cyt1Aa and Cry4Ba, showing the various ways these toxins affect cells, by inducing either intracellular calcium change, or by entirely losing the probe, or by cell lysis. The mixture of these toxins is very efficient and almost instantaneous.

However, the molecule is also produced by non-neuronal cells in the body. CD4+ T cells, the main targets of HIV-1, produce it abundantly. ACh exerts its effects on cells via its nicotinic (n) and muscarinic (m) receptors that are expressed on both immune and non-immune cells in the body. ACh is well known to exert anti-inflammatory effects on immune cells. The main receptor that is indispensable for the anti-inflammatory effects of ACh is the α7 nicotinic receptor. Another molecule, secreted by activated T cells and by other cells is SLURP-1 (Secreted Ly6/uPAR-related Protein-1), which acts as an allosteric ligand for α7 and fine tunes the effects of ACh on T cells. Little is known as to how this extra-neuronal cholinergic system (ENCS) is regulated in HIV-infected individuals.  Our results show that the circulating levels of ACh and SLURP-1 do not change significantly in HIV-infected individuals, as compared to the circulating levels in healthy controls. Interestingly, higher levels of these soluble mediators were detected in HIV-infected long-term non-progressors (LTNP) who control the viral replication for more than seven years without any chemotherapy. It is tempting to speculate that the increase in levels of these two soluble mediators of the ENCS present in HIV-infected LTNPs may play a role in their ability to control HIV replication. The results from this study show that an α7 agonist decreased HIV replication, whereas a receptor antagonist increased its replication in vitro in human PHA blasts. Furthermore, hemicholinium (HC-3), a compound that inhibits the ability of the cells to produce ACh, by competing with their uptake of choline, increases the viral replication. The expression of the α7 receptor on peripheral blood CD4+ T cells, but not on monocytes, was significantly reduced (p<0.01) in HIV-infected individuals, and it was not fully restored by antiretroviral therapy (ART). Interestingly, the expression of the β2 adrenergic receptor was decreased significantly (p<0.01) on both monocytes and CD4+ T cells in HIV-infected individuals. These cells respond to norepinephrine via this receptor and secrete ACh.  Overall, the results of this study suggest that HIV causes significant modulation of different components of the ENCS in virus-infected individuals. This system could be manipulated to reduce viral replication and inflammation in these patients.	HIV , Acetylcholine , α7 nicotinic receptor , SLURP-1 , SLURP-1	en	19157.0
645	Détermination judiciaire des faits et erreurs judiciaires : perspective narrative sur le processus judiciaire criminel et la recherche de vérité	This master’s thesis proposes a narrative conceptualization of the criminal justice system. The author employs the narrative theory framework that conceives the adversarial trial as a contest between different stories. This comprehensive theory offers a lens through which the author analyzes and explains multiple aspects of the judicial processing of facts including evidence at trial, fact-finding, appellate review and the law governing these aspects. The concept of “story” allows a broader perspective than the concept of “evidence” which is limited to the trial. This umbrella theory is therefore used to explain, organize and provide a united understanding of various aspects of the judicial system, such as the investigatory process, the laying of charges, the theory of a case, the cross-examinations, as well as how facts are chosen and organized before being presented and processed at trial as “evidence”. At trial, the global perspective of the narrative theory challenges the traditional (or rationalist) atomist approach to evidence, which explains fact-finding as a decision based on the truthfulness or the falseness of each individual piece of evidence adduced at trial. The narrative perspective, rather, suggests a holistic approach – fact-finding is a decision regarding the relative plausibility between two competing stories. Thus, these insights from the narrative theory call into question the traditional assumption that trials lead to accurate findings of fact. After her demonstration of the heuristic value of the narrative theory, the author applies the narrative framework to recent studies on miscarriages of justice. She concludes that the law enables triers of fact to reach only a hybrid truth, halfway between what happened in reality and an assessment of the consistency between the evidence adduced at trial.

646	Mixed Identity and Cultural Transmission : Narratives of Mixed-Blood Women from a First Nations Community	In this master’s thesis, I examine the implications of the Kahnawà:ke membership and residency law on six mixed-blood women from the Kahnawà:ke Mohawk community. With the use of qualitative research methodology, I analyze the participants’ narratives of their experiences with growing up racially mixed. In this context, I explore some of the factors that facilitated or mitigated their sense of cultural identity and belonging. I also explore the question of cultural transmission to the future generation. The findings from this study suggest that Mohawk cultural identity and ways of life are perpetuated intergenerationally in these women’s’ families. The participants make tenacious efforts to re-appropriate their culture and find ways to create their space of belonging. These participants’ detailed accounts add to the Canadian body of research on mixed-race identity and cultural transmission in an Indigenous context.

647	L’engagement paternel et la relation d’activation père-enfant chez l’enfant âgé entre 12 et 18 mois : l’effet modérateur de l’alliance parentale	The conjugal relationship between parents has been studied profusely as to better understand its influence on the socio-affective development of the child. However, a better proxy to conceptualise the level of cooperation and the involvement of the parents in the education of the child is the parental alliance. This alliance could have an important influence on the father-child dyad, or more specifically the activation relationship. The present study is designed to verify the existence of a link between the paternal involvement in regard to its function of openness to the world and the activation score of the child, aged from 12 to 18 months, as well as the possible moderator effect of the parental alliance on this link. Data was collected among 58 father-child dyads. Results show no link between father involvement in its function of openness to the world and the activation score. Furthermore, the parental alliance does not moderate this link. The results also show some differences between boys and girls. Fathers are more engaged with their daughter and boys are more optimally activated than girls.	parental alliance , paternal involvement , openness to the world , father-child activation relationship , 12-18 months , risky situation	en	19123.0

Using different techniques from differential topology and Morse theory, which will be presented in the first chapters, we carefully build these complexes before proving their equivalence. This thesis synthesises and compares three points of view in Morse theory in a document accessible to beginning graduate students.

649	Estimation simplifiée de la variance pour des plans complexes	In a complex design framework, standard variance estimation methods entail substantial challenges. As we know, conventional variance estimators involve second order inclusion probabilities, which can be difficult to compute for some sampling designs. Also, confidentiality standards generally prevent second order inclusion probabilities to be included in external microdata files (often in the form of bootstrap weights). Based on Ohlsson’s sequential Poisson sampling method (1998), we suggest a simplified estimator for which we only need first order inclusion probabilities. The idea is to approximate a survey strategy (which consists of a sampling design and an estimator) by an equivalent strategy for which a Poisson sampling design is used. We will discuss proportional to size sampling and proportional to size cluster sampling. Results of a simulation study will be presented.

650	Classification automatique de textes pour les revues de littérature mixtes en santé	The interest of health researchers and policy-makers in literature reviews has continued to increase over the years. Mixed studies reviews are highly valued since they combine results from the best available studies on various topics while considering quantitative, qualitative and mixed research methods. These reviews can be used for several purposes such as justifying, designing and interpreting results of primary studies. Due to the proliferation of published papers and the growing number of nonempirical works such as editorials and opinion letters, screening records for mixed studies reviews is time consuming. Traditionally, reviewers are required to manually identify potential relevant studies. In order to facilitate this process, a comparison of different automated text classification methods was conducted in order to determine the most effective and robust approach to facilitate systematic mixed studies reviews.   The group of algorithms considered in this study combined decision trees, naive Bayes classifiers, k-nearest neighbours, support vector machines and voting approaches. Statistical techniques were applied to assess the relevancy of multiple features according to a predefined dataset. The benefits of feature combination for numerical terms, synonyms and mathematical symbols were also measured. Furthermore, concepts extracted from a metathesaurus were used as additional features in order to improve the training process.   Using the titles and abstracts of approximately 10,000 entries, decision trees perform the best with an accuracy of 88.76%, followed by support vector machine (86.94%). The final model based on decision trees relies on linear interpolation and a group of concepts extracted from a metathesaurus. This approach outperforms the mixed filters commonly used with bibliographic databases like MEDLINE. However, references chosen for training must be selected judiciously in order to address the model instability and the disparity of quantitative and qualitative study designs.

651	Le géomarketing et la localisation : pour la faisabilité commerciale d'un produit forestier canadien à l’échelle des régions métropolitaines canado-américaines	In the current context of globalization of markets, assessment of market factors may represent the failure or success in today's business world. Due to the free movement of goods and services around the world, the effects of competition and market saturation tendencies become increasingly noticeable nowadays. Synthesis of cartography, geography and marketing, an important ally appears in the scenario of market analyses to guide enterprises. The geomarketing brings a set of spatial analysis techniques on marketing data using, among others, a geographic information system (GIS). This new discipline allows segmenting and qualifying the potential of a market and determine the optimal location according to sociodemographic, behavioral or economic characteristics of the market-study. In definition, geomarketing is a marketing approach based on the analysis of consumer behavior taking into account the notions of spaces and the nuances of market that a commercial action or a marketing campaign can generate on a zone geographical. Among the applications of the geomarketing, the identification of competition, potential markets, optimal locations and development of a distribution network of products or services. All these activities are related to competitiveness, which refers to the ability to occupy a strong position in a market. This research will use geomarketing spatial analysis techniques to target potential markets to an innovative insulation product produced from forest residues. The study proposes a method based on geographic and spatial analysis to determine location and distribution in order to maximize efficiency and market penetration by the product.

652	La valeur propositionnelle des espaces urbains dans l’oeuvre de Georges Perec, Annie Ernaux et Patrick Modiano	This thesis analyzes the urban space representations, as expressed in Un homme qui dort by Georges Perec, Journal du dehors by Annie Ernaux and Dans le café de la jeunesse perdue by Patrick Modiano. It highlights a conflicted and moving parisian imagery during the second half of the XXth century, with one novel from the late sixties, one diary written between the eighties and the nineties and one contemporary novel. This is aiming to show a striking coherence between the studied works. This sociocritical analysis focuses on the otherness suggested by multiple narratives in the city. The changing urban landscapes, which are caused by new types of public transportations or renovated and new neighbourhoods, are related to consumerism. It leads characters and narrators to semantically reinvest in their city. This brings them inevitably to a question: how could the city be radically different? How can they find and suggest its otherness? The thesis deals with the subject’s “shocks” in the city, as expressed by Walter Benjamin, as well as with his ambiguous relationship with the past and collective memory and also with the narrators’ ability to renew their urban experiences.

653	Experimental and theoretical studies on the conformational properties of cis- and trans-4,5-methano-L-prolines	It is well known that 4,5-methano-L-prolines have different conformational properties and characteristics than proline. The flattening of the pyrrolidine ring plays a role in the stability and conformation of L-proline methanologs. Thus, extensive studies have been conducted to analyze the structural differences and folding patterns of cis- and trans-4,5-methano-L-prolines and their oligomers in correlation with the n→π∗ electron delocalization between the adjacent carbonyls of amide and ester groups. In this thesis, the n→π∗ stabilization of each derivative is analyzed, disclosing additional structural properties of 4,5-methano-L-prolines. NMR spectroscopic studies revealed the spatial characteristics of cis- and trans-4,5-methano-L-prolines in correlation to the amide trans : cis isomerization equilibrium in different solvents. In addition, the tendency of diketopiperazine formation from the cis-cis, trans-trans, and mixed trans,cis-4,5-methano-L-proline dimers reflected the importance of the n→π∗ stabilization on the conformation and folding characteristics.	polyproline , trans : cis isomerization , diketopiperazine , Methanoproline	en	19072.0
654	Les céramiques de la glacière Gervaise : le consumérisme chez la classe aisée montréalaise au milieu du XVIIIe siècle	This thesis in Canadian colonial archaeology analyses the ceramics found in the ice cellar of the Gervaise site (BjFj-119) in Old Montreal. The deposit within the cellar, which is divided into three levels, was put in place between 1750 and 1770, thus overlapping the British Conquest of New France in 1760. The property, bought by the master baker Charles Gervaise in 1693 and occupied by him and his family until 1753, was subsequently inhabited by different families of the middling sort. The ceramics assemblage opens a window on the rapidly evolving socioeconomic and political landscape of the time and on the consumption practices of these individuals during this eventful period in Montreal history and more generally in the context of the extension of capitalism in Occident. The study is informed by the methods of description and contextualisation suggested by the archaeology of consumerism, which explores the various relationships between material culture and individuals. The collection from the Gervaise ice cellar offers an original view of well-to-do households at the end of French Regime and the beginning of the British Regime, and challenges the role of some ceramic markers such as local earthenware, creamware, white faience and white stoneware.

655	Mihri Rasim (1885-1954) : l’ambition d’une jeune-turque peintre	Mihri Rasim  (1885-1954) is Turkey’s most important painter and feminist pioneer. The widely shared assumption about her is that she was a marginal, unclassifiable artist, who died in misery and resentful for having dedicated her life to art. Without any real information, authors and art historians obscured their ignorance by elaborating her life story out of her fascinating personality. My dissertation, which is also the first exhaustive art historical study on the artist, is dismantling this myth. Rasim was an ambitious artist and an upstart, Young Turk, who had a strategy to achieve her ambition. From the beginning of her career and for the rest of her life she pursued two goals: she expanded women’s horizon of possibilities and she aspired to be considered, in her own words, “among the talented people”.  In Istanbul at a time when Turkish women could barely leave their harem, she set up the first fine arts school for women. While she was the head of women’s Academy, she introduced the first female nude classes in the history of Turkish arts. She allowed women to receive an art education comparable to European artistic standards and provided them access to a new profession. She created a scholarship for her students at the academy and tried to constitute an association of mutual help for female painters. She also made the portraits of Young-Turk leaders and of their entourage. She used her political connections in Istanbul, and, as she moved from Turkey to Europe to the United-States, she developed her artistic project with new interlocutors and in different contexts but always with the same purposes. She built a network to support her career. In order to achieve this she portrayed great modernist men of the first half of the twentieth century, even controversial ones – Alphonse XIII, Benito Mussolini, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Thomas Edison.  With a feminist approach my dissertation establishes the importance of this cosmopolitan artist of the twentieth century. I am uncovering the details of her life and art, which were disregarded until today. Using original and unpublished archival materials, her elementary biographical facts are clarified. Dates for her works are submitted and identifications of her sitters are made. I propose an innovative approach to examine the painter and her artistic production not only in relation to Turkish plastic arts but also in relation to a more global artistic context. I assess the impact of her actions in her time and ours. My dissertation stands as a testament to the importance of major cultural and political women, and the limits that were and are once again placed upon them.

656	Synthèse de monohalocyclopropanes et étude de carbénoïdes de zinc	This thesis is focused on the development of enantioselective halocyclopropanation methodologies and the study of both the formation and behaviors of zinc carbenoids. Initially, we developed an enantioselective bromocyclopropanation reaction of allylic alcohols by modifying previous conditions described by our group for the synthesis of iodo- and chlorocyclopropanes. To further improve this reaction with particular regard to mitigating wate production, we performed several NMR experiments that elucidated both the active zinc carbenoid structure and the mechanism of its formation. Based on these findings, we developed modified conditions, providing improved yields without the need for excess reagents. Cognizant of a similar mechanistic pathway for previously developed halocyclopropanations, we applied these mechanistic findings towards improving both the iodocyclopropanation and chlorocyclopropanation reactions. Much to our delight, we successfully improved the efficiency of the iodocyclopropantion and characterized the active zinc carbenoid species.  In contrast, the chlorocyclopropanation presented more challenges due to the complex mixture of various organometallic species obtained from the mixing of carbenoid reagents. These results suggested scrambling mechanisms were occuring, which were not really understood until now. In order to avoid those mechanisms, an organic zinc salt was used, providing access to an improved, more efficient chlorocyclopropanation reaction. Finally, we conducted an in-depth investigation into the observed scrambling mechanisms using a wide panel of carbenoids to both understand the causes of such scramblings and to potentially predict when they will occur.

657	Caractérisation de matériaux moléculaires amorphes pour optimiser leur préparation et leurs applications	Amorphous molecular materials, also known as molecular glasses, are small organic molecules capable of being organized in a disordered manner. In addition to sharing some of the useful properties of polymers, they offer additional advantages because they are isomolecular species for which synthesis, purification and processing are facilitated by a relatively low viscosity. However, the usually demanding preparation conditions of these materials and their limited functional lifetime due to their tendency to relax to the crystalline state remain obstacles to their use for certain applications, e.g. opto-electronics, nanolithography, pharmaceuticals. The development of strategies to facilitate the preparation of the vitreous phase and avoid its crystallization is therefore essential for the design of functional amorphous molecular materials. The main objective of this thesis is to establish relationships between the molecular structure of molecular glasses and their properties. To achieve it, various libraries of model compounds, analogues of triazine derivatives that have demonstrated excellent glass-forming ability, are used to i) determine the influence of the nature and the position of the groups on the triazine; ii) explore the influence of hydrogen (H) bonds on the properties of glasses when their structure includes functional groups known to facilitate crystallization and when their preparation conditions are similar to those used in industry; and iii) exploit the amorphous phase in order to study the photoresponsiveness of azobenzenes (azo) in order to optimize their use in different applications. The influence of the various substituent groups on the triazine (headgroup, ancillary and linkers) on the glass-forming ability (GFA), the kinetic glass stability (GS) and the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the compounds is first studied. A classification system based on differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and variable temperature infrared spectroscopy (IR) measurements combined to chemometrics analyses facilitate the rationalization of the roles played by each group. The impact of the H-bonds, the energy of the rotation barrier, and the steric hindrance of the groups is determined, leading to the conclusion that the headgroup is the most influential group and that the presence of H-bonds is not essential to the GFA, but important to obtain a high Tg. The influence of the H-bonds on the properties of glasses approaching those exploited in industry is then explored. Variable temperature IR spectroscopy measurements, DSC studies, and single crystal structure resolution have led to the conclusion that H-bonds impede the crystallization of the compounds even though they are simultaneously functionalized with moieties that promote crystallization (π-π stacking between fluorinated and non-fluorinated stilbene groups). In addition, three similar compounds functionalized with a headgroup presenting a decreasing capability to establish H-bonds (donor, acceptor, none) were vapor-deposited (PVD), a technique used, among others, in the opto-electronic industry, to evaluate their capability to form ultrastable glasses. These PVD glasses all show properties that are similar to those previously reported for ultrastable glasses, including higher density and anisotropy, and are all more kinetically stable than glasses prepared by cooling from the viscous state. However, the PVD glasses prepared with a H-bond donor headgroup are less stable than the others by at least an order of magnitude, suggesting that H-bonds limit the level of kinetic stability achievable by PVD. Finally, a triazine molecular glass functionalized with an azo group is used to study, from a molecular point of view, the perturbations caused by the photoisomerization of the azo. A new IR spectroscopy method was developed to observe a molecular environment gradient along the molecule during photoisomerization, making it possible to support certain hypotheses concerning the resulting macroscopic transport of the material. Triazine-based molecular glass blends are also used as an ideal platform for decoupling the influence of Tg and azo content on the azo photo-orientation, but also on the inscription kinetics and the diffraction efficiency of surface relief gratings (SRGs). This work enables the determination of an optimal Tg range for the inscription of SRGs. Altogether, these new insights will lead to a more rational design of new molecular glasses, which can extend to other amorphous molecular materials.

658	Repenser le droit de marque : essai sur une approche fonctionnelle des marques dans l’économie globale et numérique	Rethinking Trademark Rights: An Essay on a Functional Approach to Marks in a Global and Digital Economy – Trademarks, one of the oldest social institutions, rose to a unique standing in the 20th century to become the symbol of modern globalization as well as a means of expression and activism. Since the 1920s, the evolution of the function of marks and trademark rights is discussed. Rights holders sought to extend their protection beyond the initial boundaries to include the marketing concept of brand through erroneous language and rhetoric of property, ownership and theft. Such propositions have disrupted the fragile and dynamic equilibrium between commercial interests and civil liberties. Looking at History, Semiotics and Marketing, I argue that brands gained prominence, but took off from trademarks. The rationale for the latter and for trademark rights is still fundamentally rooted in the referential function to a source. The protection and the legal construction of trademark rights should only revolve around such a function. I therefore propose to recast trademarks’ legal framework upon this function of origin. Redelineating the concept of “mark” through a functional approach will align the law with the diversity and versatility of trademarks in modern societies: whatever serves a referential purpose should amount to a mark. This will notably offer a coherent scheme to include holograms or domain names, among future and unknown new means of reference. This functional approach will also refocus mark rights on the standard of public confusion. I argue that the law should deviate from the standard of use, and understand marks out of the trade sphere. This rationale would offer a stringent but flexible framework that addresses issues of freedom of expression as well as those arising out of the digital world, e.g. advertisement and hashtags.

659	Étude sur les repères de stagiaires finissants en formation initiale à l'enseignement au secondaire permettant de soutenir le développement de leur compétence éthique	To follow in the footsteps of the movement of professionalisation, the professional ethical teacher is characterized by a professional competence, more precisely by the ethical competence, which is presented in the reference system of professional competence (MEQ, 2001a). Even if the ethical competence comprises an ambiguous character, as it is stated in the ministerial reference, it is marked by a successful obligation, more particularly by the graduating student teachers.  In view of the ambiguity surrounding the meaning of the ethical competence, we have conducted a census of records on this competence in order to verify what it means to be competent on the ethical plan. We have therefore established that the ethical competence has a close link with reflection. From now on, by means of a review on the concept of reasoning, we have put forth the hypothesis that the professional reasoning established by the discourse and by the indicators can support the development of the ethical competence. Therefore, three intentions were specified : to showcase the personal reference points (personal values) and institutional (to target legal and regulatory , norms and theoretical knowledge) which includes the professional reasoning of student teachers the matter of ethical behavior and that would result in the contribution of pratical training in relation to the transmission of these indicators as well as the initial training to the transmission of these indicators. To achieve this, we have carried out two phases of data in which two quality tools were favored in order to collect data of qualitative nature. During the first phase, we conducted partly directed interviews with the student teachers, their cooperating teachers and their supervisor of their respective practice teaching session. Our findings suggest that student teachers make use of their references to support their reasoning in the matter of ethical behavior as well as their personal values and certain professional values since the words to evoke these are not explicit. However the institutionnel references which constitutes the legal and reglementary framework, the norms and theoretical knowledge are slightly present in their discourse. However the feedback of the cooperating teachers and stage supervisors concerning these indicators is confirmed modestly even though it passes principally by feedback. The results concerning the contribution of teaching activities in the initial training suggests that ethical behavior is particularly as a caution. Our results show that professional reasoning, with the aid of discourse and reference points can act as a lever of ethical competence on condition that progressively, the future teachers have been formed in this manner.

660	Le visuel et le sonore en matière de composition musicale : un rapport homologue	Is it possible to treat visual material, in particular theatre, physical gestures, video and dance, as an equal element to sound in musical composition? What strategies are available to us to incorporate, in a relevant way, image and sound? What does the interaction between sound and visual material in the creation and the performance of a musical piece imply? Guided by these questions, I composed seven pieces as part of my Masters, between September 2014 and August 2016. This paper describes the main stages of these pieces and their composition process, which aimed to find solutions and strategies for a homologous relationship between the visual and the sound in the process of musical creation. The first chapter draws a portrait of artists and composers who worked on the relationship between sound and visual. Some strategies of these composers were used during the process of creating a musical composition capable of integrating the visual as an essential element. The second chapter presents the pieces which I have investigated the link between music and video, gesture and dance. The third chapter addresses a series of four pieces composed for the purpose of expressing, through the relation between music and staging, issues related to our daily life. Finally, the last chapter presents conclusions that emerged as a result of my writing process and, in some cases as a result of the performance of the parts.

661	Le roman d’apprentissage à l’ère de la modernité : Foucault, Pirandello, Aragon et le spectacle du siècle	At the crossroads of philosophical, historical and fictional discourses on modernity, this article aims to survey the literary question of contemporaneity’s glare, as posed by the archaeological project of Michel Foucault and recently taken over by Giorgio Agamben. After a demonstration that will directly raise the various issues of this matter, their novelistic remediations will be considered through a comparative analysis of the contemporary’s coming-­of-­age stories that are “On tourne” (“Shoot!”; 1915) by Luigi Pirandello and “Anicet ou le Panorama”, roman (1921) by Louis Aragon. We will see how the formal reflection on literature as a question asked to modernity is inseparable from a theoretical and historical reflection on its conditions and effects.

664	What place for ethics? An overview of ethics teaching in occupational therapy and physiotherapy programs in Canada	Purpose: The recent introduction of master’s level curricula for Occupational Therapy and Physiotherapy training programs in Canada raises both challenges and opportunities to address ethical issues during professional training. This study evaluated the inclusion of ethics content in course descriptions and course calendars in order to develop a preliminary understanding of how rehabilitation ethics is taught in Canadian universities. Method: We reviewed the ethics content in the online curricula of 27 Canadian rehabilitation programs (OT & PT). Courses addressing ethical issues were identified through keyword searches, and were then subjected to both quantitative and textual descriptive analyses. Results: The mean proportion of credits allotted to courses that included ethics terminology was 5.9% (SD=1.4) for OT and 6.5% (SD=4.8) for PT (p=0.69). The most common terms in the course descriptions were ‘ethics/ethical’ followed by ‘legal’, ‘professionalism’, ‘deontology’ and ‘regulatory’. Textual analysis revealed eight course topics, the most frequent being: standards of practice, ethical decision-making, clinical courses and mediation/communication.  Conclusion: With the growing recognition and status of occupational therapy and physiotherapy in the healthcare system, and corresponding shifts in how professionals are being trained, it is crucial to assess and reflect upon the place accorded to and manner of teaching ethics.

665	Validation de la version française canadienne du Perception of Prevalence of Aggression Scale auprès d’un échantillon d’intervenants en protection de la jeunesse	Objective. The objective of this study is to evaluate the construct validity of the French Canadian version of the Perception Of Prevalence of Aggression Scale (POPAS), a self-report questionnaire measuring exposure to workplace violence committed by clients in the health and social services sector. Method. A sample of 310 youth protection workers is utilized to confirm the four-factor internal structure of the instrument. If this structure is not confirmed, an exploratory structural equation model is used. The selected factors undergo Cronbach alpha tests that assess their internal consistency. They are correlated with the French version of the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist Scale (PCLS) and the number of absentee days caused by violence in order to measure convergent validity. There are also correlated with the Felt Accountability (FA) scale to assess divergent validity. Comparison analyses according to work environments assess criterion validity. Results. The confirmatory factor analysis does not corroborate the four-factor structure of the POPAS. The exploratory structural equation model validates a three-factor structure: ‘‘verbal violence’’, ‘‘physical violence’’ and ‘‘violence against oneself’’. The first two possess good internal consistency. The positive correlations between these two factors and the PCLS, as well as between these two factors and the number of absentee days, support the convergent validity of POPAS. However, the absence of a significant correlation between the last factor and the PCLS, as well as between this factor and the number of absentee days, does not support convergence. The lack of correlation between the factors and the FA supports the divergent validity of the POPAS. The differences observed as they relate to work environments also attest to criterion validity. Discussion. The construct validity of the French Canadian version of the POPAS suggests that this instrument allows for an evaluation of the subjective frequency of different forms of workplace violence experienced by youth protection workers. It therefore represents an alternative to the use of official data (i.e. incident reports made to the employer), which poorly reflect the reality of these workers given the underreporting of violent incidents in this sector	POPAS , Type II workplace violence , Construct validity , Psychometric properties , Youth protection workers	en	18930.0
666	Relation entre la phosphorylation de Tau et la fragmentation de l'appareil de Golgi	Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by two neuropathological lesions, senile plaques composed of Abeta peptide and neurofibrillary tangles formed by hyperphosphorylated and aggregated Tau protein. Interestingly, in AD, a fragmentation of Golgi apparatus is noted at early stages of the disease. It was recently shown that the extracellular pool of Abeta peptide can induce a fragmentation of the Golgi. However, several studies indicated that hyperphosphorylated Tau could also contribute to this fragmentation. We therefore examined whether hyperphosphorylated Tau could induce a fragmentation of the Golgi by overexpressing it in HeLa cells. Our results revealed that a Tau mutant mimicking hyperphophosphorylation induced an earlier fragmentation of the Golgi than a non-phosphorylable Tau mutant. We previously demonstrated that Tau can be secreted in the extracellular space, the mutant mimicking hyperphosphorylation being the most secreted. We then examined whether extracellular Tau was able to induce a fragmentation of the Golgi as noted for extracellular Abeta. Interestingly, the mutant mimicking Tau hyperphosphorylation was the sole form of Tau that could induce a Golgi fragmentation when it was present in the medium. We then determine whether the induction of the fragmentation by extracellular hyperphosphorylated Tau was linked to its phosphorylation state and/or to its high amount in the medium. Our results indicate that the Golgi fragmentation induced by hyperphosphorylated Tau was caused by its high levels in the medium. We also investigated which domain of Tau was involved in the induction of the Golgi fragmentation. Our results revealed that the sequence of Tau responsible the Golgi fragmentation is located in its C-terminal where the repeated sequences (MTBD) involved in its association with microtubules are found. However, no alteration of the microtubules was noted in the HeLa overexpressing Tau indicating that the microtubules would not be involved in Tau-induced Golgi fragmentation. This supports the fact that extracellular not intracellular Tau is responsible for the fragmentation of the Golgi. Finally, by examining the trafficking of the VSVG protein, we showed that the Golgi remained functional upon the overexpression of Tau in HeLa cells. In conclusions, our results demonstrated that extracellular tau is the main pool of Tau responsible for its induction of the Golgi fragmentation. The link between extracellular Tau and the fragmentation of the Golgi remains to be elucidated. Knowing that the Golgi fragmentation could become detrimental to neurons, extracellular Tau could be a therapeutic target for AD.

667	Modulation dopaminergique dans le système olfactif	A neural substrate underlying odor-evoked locomotion was revealed in lampreys (Derjean et al., 2010), involving a neural pathway extending from the medial part of the olfactory bulb to the posterior tuberculum. The signal is then relayed to the mesencephalic locomotor region and eventually reaches reticulospinal cells that activate the spinal locomotor networks. Recent research in the lab (Daghfous et al., 2013) shows that the medial olfactory bulb, is under a tonic GABAergic inhibition gating reticulospinal cell responses to olfactory nerve stimulation. Additional modulatory mechanisms might exist in the olfactory bulb of Petromyzon marinus as it also contains dopaminergic fibers.  In every vertebrate studied to date, dopamine plays an important role in olfactory processing. Anatomical (axonal tracers and immunofluorescence) and physiological (intracellular recordings) techniques were used to investigate the dopaminergic modulation of the olfacto-motor pathway. Dopamine immunofluorescence showed scarce innervation of the olfactory bulb that was most abundant in the medial part and in close vicinity to projection neurons and olfactory nerve fibers. Additionally, no dopamine-immunoreactive cell bodies were detected in the olfactory bulb. Synaptic responses of reticulospinal cells to olfactory nerve stimulation were recorded in the isolated brain. Local injection of dopamine in the medial olfactory bulb induces an almost two-fold decrease of the synaptic responses. When GABAA receptor antagonist GABAzine was also injected in the medial olfactory bulb, the effect of dopamine was much more evident and could suppress large bursts of action potentials. However, D1 (SCH 23390) and D2 (Eticlopride) receptor antagonists injection in the medial olfactory bulb failed to alter the amplitude of reticulospinal cell responses to olfactory nerve stimulation, indicating that this modulation is not tonic. To locate the neurons responsible for this modulation, tracer injections combined with dopamine immunofluorescence were performed. Dopaminergic cells projecting to the medial olfactory bulb were found in the dopaminergic nuclei of the posterior tuberculum and the periventricular hypothalamus. Altogether, our results show anatomically and physiologically the presence of a dopaminergic innervation within the medial olfactory bulb that mediates inhibitory effects on olfacto-motor signaling.

668	PKB mediates Insulin-Like Growth Factor 1-induced phosphorylation and nuclear export of Histone Deacetylase 5 via NADPH Oxidase 4 activation in vascular smooth muscle cells	Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), a potent mitogenic and vasoactive factor, has been shown to play a role in the development of cardiovascular diseases. This occurs through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as well as through the hyperactivation of mitogenic and growth promoting signaling pathways and the subsequent alteration in gene expression. Histone deacetylases (HDACs), by their ability to modify the acetylation status of the lysine residues in histone and non-histone proteins, regulate gene transcription. Recent studies have demonstrated that a heightened activation of HDACs, notably HDAC5, is associated with vascular disorders such as atherosclerosis. However, a role of IGF-1 in HDAC phosphorylation and activation has not been investigated. Therefore, in the present studies, we examined the effect of IGF-1 on the phosphorylation of HDAC5 in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and identified the signaling pathways involved in this process. Treatment of A10 VSMCs with IGF-1 enhanced the phosphorylation of HDAC5 at serine 498 in a time and dosedependent fashion. Pretreatment of cells with AG1024, a selective pharmacological inhibitor of IGF-1R, significantly inhibited IGF-1-induced HDAC5 phosphorylation in A10 VSMCs whereas AG1478, a selective inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), did not have an inhibitory effect on the levels of phospho-HDAC5. Pharmacological blockade of the MAPK pathway with PD98059, UO126, SP600125 and SB203580 had no effect on HDAC5 phosphorylation, whereas inhibitors of the PI3K/ PKB pathways, wortmannin and SC-66 respectively, almost completely attenuated IGF- 1-induced HDAC5 phosphorylation. These findings were confirmed by immunofluorescence localization of phospho-HDAC5 and by siRNA-induced silencing of PKB. In addition, pretreatment of A10 VSMCs with Diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) and apocynin, two NAD(P)H oxidase inhibitors, as well as the antioxidant N-Acetyl-Cysteine (NAC), resulted in an attenuation of IGF-1-induced HDAC5 and PKB phosphorylation. Furthermore, siRNA-induced silencing of Nox4, the main NADPH oxidase expressed in VSMC, inhibited IGF-1 induced HDAC5 phosphorylation. Moreover, IGF-1-induced phosphorylation of HDAC5 resulted in its nuclear export, which was reversed by blockade of PKB by SC-66 or NAD(P)H oxidase inhibition by DPI. In summary, these data demonstrate that IGF-1 induces the phosphorylation and nuclear export of HDAC5 in a Nox4-derived ROS- and PKB-dependent fashion in VSMCs.

669	Analyse de l’impact de la radiothérapie sur l’ultrastructure des capsules périprothétiques en reconstruction mammaire	With around 25,000 cases in 2015, breast cancer is the most common cancer among Canadian women. In term of mortality, breast cancer is second (13.8%), only behind lung cancer (26.5%). As part of the therapeutic approaches, around 70% and 30% of women with advanced and early breast cancer (respectively) will chose to have a total mastectomy. Following a mastectomy, few options of breast reconstruction are offered to the patients. More than 70% of breast reconstructions are implant-based. Among the complications following this surgery, capsular contracture (CC) is one of the most common. CC is defined as the abnormal, and sometimes painful, contraction of the fibrous capsule that normally grows aroung breast implants, resulting in a aesthetic failure and associated with a higher surgical revision rate. Many studies have demonstrated that the incidence of CC was higher among women who had undergone radiotherapy prior to their implant-based breast breast reconstruction procedure. Most of published studies focus on the influence of radiotherapy on capsular tissue at the immune-histological level but no study has described its influence on capsular architecture. As our team recently demonstrated that capsular ultrastructure is influenced by many factors (prosthetic texture, expansion timing). The main purpose was to describe the impact of radiotherapy on periprosthetic capsule ultrastructural features by comparing irradiated and non-irradiated capsules using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). We observed a significant loss of tridimensional texture at the implant-capsule interface in irradiated capsular samples. This feature was also found to be associated with CC. Finally, our results tend to show that radiotherapy impaires the stability of capsules by preventing them to grow withing their surrounding implant texure. In conclusion, the present research project offers the first description of the capsular response following exposiong to radiations. Even though our results do not allow us to conlude to a clear relation between loss of capsular architecture and a higher risk of CC, we think that the impairement of capsular stability might be part of the answer	Breast cancer , Breast implants , Implant-based breast reconstruction , Periprosthetic capsules , Capsular contracture , Radiotherapy , Radiation therapy , Capsular ultrastructure , Scanning electron microscopy	en	18876.0
670	Effets cardiométaboliques de la restriction calorique seule ou en combinaison avec l’activité physique dans le diabète de type 2	Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a chronic disease characterized by high blood sugar that can lead to many complications with potential morbid outcomes. Alarmingly, the worldwide prevalence is increasing at a high rate mainly du to aging and harmful lifestyle habits. In fact, inactivity and poor food choices are at the heart of an obesity epidemic that plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of T2D. Lifestyle modifications thus play an important role in patient care. However, it remains uncertain which therapy between a caloric restriction (CR) alone or a combination of CR plus physical activity (PA) should be encouraged to achieve better reduction in fat mass and in epicardial fat thickness. The latter represents the visceral fat depot of the heart and is emerging as an important marker for predicting and stratifying cardiovascular risk. The objective of this Master’s thesis is to better characterize the independent effects of CR and PA on total fat mass, epicardial fat, and overall cardiometabolic profile of patients with T2D. To achieve this, a randomized controlled 16-week trial was performed, with 73 patients randomized to 1 of 3 groups (Control, CR, or CR+PA), while aiming for a similar caloric deficit in both intervention groups. Results showed that the combination of CR+PA allows a larger reduction of fat mass and epicardial fat thickness. However, these findings did not translate into significant differences in cardiometabolic improvements between groups. These results now need to be validated in larger cohorts with longer follow-ups.

671	Utilisation de lymphocytes T en thérapie cellulaire pour le traitement de la néphropathie au polyomavirus BK chez les greffés rénaux	More than 75% of the population has been exposed to BK polyomavirus and carries latent virus in the uroepithelium without any complications. However, it can reactivates in kidney transplant recipients (KTR) and lead to a nephropathy affecting graft survival. Recipient anti-viral immunity is the cornerstone of BK-virus associated nephropathy prevention and treatment and thus, reduction of immunosuppression is the only well-accepted treatment. Adoptive immunotherapy is a promising solution to this problem, allowing a specific T cell mediated response against this virus without the alloreactive risk. It was demonstrated efficacious for other viral infections in immunocompromised hosts but it has not been used in this specific context. Our objective was to adapt and validate a clinical-compliant protocol to obtain BK-specific T cell lines from viremic KTR and to compare their expansion, differentiation and specificity to ones obtained from healthy donors. Although comparable specificity and differentiation status, cell expansions form KTR were not systematically sufficient for a therapeutic dose. The addition of a stimulation with dendritic cells improved cell expansion in addition to favors a central memory phenotype and refined BKspecificity. Despite polyclonality, T cell lines didn’t demonstrated alloreactivity in a chromium release assay and in vivo. Furthermore, T cell lines could persist and proliferates in vivo. This protocol is ready for a phase I/II clinical trial. This opens the possibility to solve the current conundrum and treat PVAN without increasing rejection risk.

672	Implantation du processus de soins en nutrition	Problem: In Quebec, the use of the Nutrition Care Process (NCP) is limited, organizations apprehend its implantation will be arduous but are motivated to proceed. Objective: To accompany two clinical nutrition services of health facilities in the greater Montreal area in the deployment of the NCP and document the barriers and facilitating factors. Methodology: The Hôpital du Sacré-Cœur de Montréal and the CSSS Champlain–Charles-Le Moyne were recruited. Data collection was accomplished through accompanying sessions throughout the deployment of the NCP. An end of project meeting was held in each area, with nutritionists and heads of departments. The data collected is qualitative. The exchanges were recorded and a logbook was completed. The synthesis was written using a change management model. Results: A total of 18 accompanying sessions were held and five end of project meetings were held. The main obstacles to the implementation of the NCP are largely related to the commitment of nutritionists, training and time constraints. The main facilitating factors are the presentations of case studies with discussion and the manual of the International Dietetics and Nutrition Terminology (IDNT). Discussion: Our health system is increasingly subject to change and leaders will need to optimize resources. The International Confederation of Dietetic Associations suggested adopting the NCP as an international framework for the profession. Implementation strategies for organizational change management principles will facilitate the integration of these important changes. The experience of the two documented environments will be enlightening for other organizations wishing to implement the NCP.

673	Fragmentation et stagnation : enjeux de mobilisation du mouvement LGBTIQ aux Philippines	This Master’s thesis investigates the development of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans, Intersex and Queer (LGBTIQ) movement in the Philippines from the fall of Ferdinand Marcos’ dictatorship in 1986 to the present moment. Since then, the LGBTIQ movement has developed rapidly. It was among the first in Southeast Asia to organise a Pride March and to constitute an LGBTIQ political party. However, despite this dynamism, LGBTIQ communities are still discriminated in the workspace, schools, and the healthcare system. Moreover, they are still the victims of homophobic crimes. To the present day, the movement has not been able to secure political protection for the rights and the safety of these communities. Although the current situation can be attributed to a certain extent to conservatism in the ruling class or the strong influence of Catholicism and homophobia, this thesis argues that the fragmentation and the lack of coherence of the movement iii has itself complicated the formulation and implementation of concrete policies. My analysis of the movement’s development throughout the last 30 years will highlight four fundamental conflicts resolving around 1. the definition of one collective identity, 2. the framing used to conceptualize these issues, 3. the different ideologies underlying the social activists’ actions, and 4. the divergence in organisational modes and strategies. As such, this thesis shifts attention from external factors to internal conflicts within the LGBTIQ movement of the Philippines. My arguments are based on 17 interviews with social activists, conducted between May and October 2015 in Manila. In the first two chapters of this thesis, I review current scholarship on social movements in general and about the Philippines and South East Asia in particular. This review will provide the theoretical foundation necessary to identify and understand the four identified social factors and their role on the fragmentation of the movement. In chapter four, I analyse the fragmentation of the movement based on the social activists’ scales of action, their targets of mobilization, and their mobilization trajectories. In chapter five, I analyze this fragmentation through the identified factors in the literature.

674	L’influence de mitochondries exogènes : changements phénotypiques chez Chrosomus eos	The mito-nuclear interactions are at the center of the mitochondrial functions, such as energy production. Despite their importance, little is known about how the influence of the mitochondrial genome on the nuclear genes expressions. The cybrids (cytoplasmic hybrids) can present phenotype modification (adaptive or not) caused by the mito-nuclear interactions. In this study, different mitotype of Cybrids of the Chrosomus eos species were used as model to further study the interaction between a cell’s genomes. This complex of species has two types of cybrids, the mitochondria of which originates from two different glacial refugia : Atlantic and Mississippian. This set up of this study was a sympatric lake, to minimise the environmental factor. Allopatric population were also separately analysed to supplement past studies. To accomplish these goals, multiple methods were used, assessing also multiple levels of gene expression: Methylation, transcription, protein and enzymatic activity. Differences between mitotypes were observed, but of lesser magnitude then the environmental factor. Thus, this result suggest that the differences associated to the sympatric mitotypes drive a deference in environment colonization, which would create the inter-lake intra-mitotype similarity observed in past studies. To assess the transcription of mitotype, a transcriptomic reference was produced. This reference offers a lot of information and future applications.

675	Les pratiques de conciliation travail-famille des employeurs de choix	"For decades, studies on the work-family practices have been highlighted the difficulties experienced by employees to balance their professional duties with their family life. Progressive organizations with regards to their human resources management also known as ""employers of choice"" attach a great importance to the need of addressing the work-life balance. Our study falls under this framework. Indeed, work-family balance is a challenge of increasing importance in the human resource management strategies of Canadian companies. A review of contemporary research on work-family balance is revealing of the need to address the factors associated with the adoption and the consequences of work-family practices.   In a context in which recruitment and retention are prominent, many organizations are now developing new ways to address the needs of employees to avoid problems such as absteeism, poor performance and low employee motivation. However, despite noticeable efforts and operational strategies, balancing work and family remains a major problem in Canadian companies. Might some solutions be found in the policies and practices of employers of choice? Our study aims to describe the work-life balance practices adopted by employers of choice and propose an analysis of the antecedents and consequences of the implementation of the adoption of work-life balance practices among employers of choice. This study was conducted by analyzing secondary data from the competition among the top 100 Canadian employers in 2013 and 2014. The findings of this analysis show that the most adopted practices by the employers of choice are those relative to leave and work time arrangements. According to our results, the oldest employers of choice and those in the public sector are those that have adopted more work-life balance practices. Moreover, these organizations have a high percentage of part-time employees and relatively high average staff age. In addition, the introduction of work-life balance practices within these organizations allows them to be recognized as the best as far as work-family balance is concerned. This research further describes the work-family practices of employers of choice in Canada. The findings may help business managers better understand work-family practices of those “best” employers as well as their contingency factors and outcomes.

676	Socrate et la conciliation ergon-logos dans les Mémorables de Xénophon	This thesis offers a thematic commentary of Xenophon’s Memorabilia following the ergon-logos conciliation. Surveying, regrouping and analyzing the many and varied occurrences of this theme reveals the extent to which it is deeply rooted in Xenophon’s Socratic philosophy.  The first chapter considers the role Xenophon ascribes to this theme in the general intention that governs the Memorabilia – which focuses on Socrates’ usefulness as an apologetic device –, and reveals a greater philosophical question about the limits of logos, which in reality reinforces the philosophical interest and importance of the ergon-logos conciliation.  The second chapter examines just how significant the ergon-logos conciliation is in Xenophon’s Socratic morality, not only because Socrates himself is, in word and deed, the ideal incarnation of virtue, but also because Xenophon’s moral conception is both intellectualistic and ascetic, which advocates learning and knowledge, as well as self-control, exercise, mentorship, and the virtue of example. The third chapter investigates the role the ergon-logos conciliation plays as a condition to friendship, in turn as its ethical foundation and as a means to acquire friends.  Finally, the fourth and last chapter uses the notion of imposture to illustrate that Xenophon’s Socratic morality also stretches to the technical field.

677	Marx est-il individualiste?	Of the many possible readings of Marx's work, those of Michel Henry and Serge Cantin have the advantage, when compared side by side, to bring out certain tensions that exist between the communitarian and libertarian dimensions of Marx's thought. On the one hand, Michel Henry emphasizes the individualistic aspect of Marxian ontology. Cantin, on the other hand, shows how Marx tends to deny this individuality in favor of an objective process that underlies this individuality, namely, that of life itself. The purpose of this thesis is to present these two opposing views individually and then to have them interact with each other. The guiding question is whether, despite their apparent opposition, some form of reconciliation is possible. It turns out that, apart from a few common point that are brought to light, these two readings do not lend themselves to any significant rapprochement.

678	Les jeux de tarot Visconti-Sforza : une analyse iconographique	The Duchy of Milan in the Quattrocento is marked by the reign of two powerful families in Lombardy, the Visconti and the Sforza. During a time full of territorial conflicts and disputes for the ducal title, art in the International Gothic style became essential to political propaganda. Among the various works of this period that emphasize the power and the hierarchical position of the nobility are the oldest sets of tarot that have survived to the present day: the Visconti-Sforza tarot decks, dating from the first half of the 15th century. Named according to their supposed patrons, the nomenclature is actually used to designate fifteen separate decks, three of which are analyzed in this master’s thesis: the Pierpont Morgan-Bergamo deck (divided between the Accademia Carrara in Bergamo, the Pierpont Morgan Library in New York, and the private collection Casa Colleoni, in Bergamo), the Brera-Brambilla (Pinacoteca di Brera, in Milan) and the Cary-Yale (Beinecke Library, in New Haven). The study of this corpus enables us to unravel the struggle for power between the Visconti and the Sforza, as well as the traditions of the literature and the triumphal processions of the time. Using an iconographic analysis, our goal is to identify the sociocultural context in which these decks were produced. This work's analysis also highlights questions about the attributions, the dating and the patronage of these luxury playing cards.

679	Parcours migratoire de demandeurs d'asile mexicains déboutés par le Canada	This research focuses on the migratory path between Mexico and Canada of disallowed Mexican refugee claimants. Deprived of fundamental rights and freedoms of citizenship, Mexicans live in a constrictive space-time and hold a limited access to mobility. Victims of the failures in the socioeconomic and political systems of Mexico, asylum is often the only option for survival. Once in Canada, Mexican refugee claimants are often confronted with the predominance of asylum criminalization and stigmatization discourse creating a context of massive forced return migrations. Dispossessed of the right to choose where they want to live, Mexican asylum-seekers are facing a double exclusion of space.  In this regard, this study explores Mexican refugee claimants’ migratory path through the lived experience and migratory imaginary surrounding it. It also attempts to understand the reasons behind migration as well as the elements responsible of the initial migratory quest’s modulation and transformation. Thus, it seeks to identify to what extent the Canadian asylum granting process affects the integration and sense of belonging to the host country. This research also raises the difficulties of the reintegration process within the society of origin. Finally, this study seeks to move away from the administrative framework and therefore focuses mainly on lived experience and human consequences of these phenomena, by exploring each person’ specific perceptions and interpretations.  In conclusion, this research establishes that Mexican refugee claimants disallowed by Canada are facing a double rejection of space. Having a priori opted for asylum because of an inability to obtain safety and ensure their integrity, exile then opposes them to a restrictive and punitive grating system that hinders their integration and often leads to their request being refused. When returning, reintegration is often impeded by the continuation of exclusion and persistent discrimination of returnees. The original migratory quest resets itself, it being the search for rights, freedoms and dignity.	asylum , migratory path , forced migration , migratory imaginary , integration , reintegration , Mexico	en	18726.0
680	La conception de la liberté chez les premiers Cyniques	Diogenes of Sinope, the main representative of ancient Cynicism, says in one of his works that « he preferred freedom above everything ». He does not mean here freedom in its political sense, but rather in its moral and individual meaning, which dates back at least to the sixth century BC and perhaps to the very root of the word ἐλεύθερος. Tracing the history of this notion reveals diverse influences on Cynicism, whether the figure of the « free slave » of the tragedians, or the correspondence between nature and freedom of the Sophists and Democritus. To reach self-sufficiency and apathy, the two characteristics of Cynic freedom, Diogenes must submit his body to physical training, it being the only way to break free from the chains of civilization. Socrates, especially in Xenophon and to a certain extent in Plato, had already made physical exercises a condition for acquiring freedom. However, with Socrates the emancipation of the individual ends in gaining knowledge that he deems necessary to virtue. Cynics, for their part, reject virtue-knowledge and limit their philosophical activity to the practice of a rigorous physical asceticism, so that freedom leads directly to virtue and happiness to the point of identifying with it. Therefore, Cynics differ from their Socratic predecessors by not extending their philosophical quest beyond the moment of liberation and thereby make freedom the true hallmark of their philosophy.

681	La construction de l'imaginaire du retour dans «Pays sans chapeau» et «L'Énigme du retour» de Dany Laferrière	"Through what he names his ""American autobiography"" formed by ten novels, Dany Laferrière creates a multifaceted universe dealing with childhood, adolescence, dictatorship, the departure and the return to one’s native land. Both Pays sans chapeau and L’Énigme du retour explore the theme of the return to one’s native land by using a character-narrator whose discursive ethoses, that is the images of oneself created within and by a discourse, are multiplied. While they are rediscovering the country, the narrators present themselves for instance as the reader, the son, the writer, the traveler, the member of an exiled community, the reporter, the stranger, etc. The identitarian mobility of the narrators allows us to connect those novels with the autofiction genre, as well as the study of the settings and the experience of returns in both cases. Furthermore, when the narrators present themselves to the readers as a writer, their literary knowledge is revealed and their vision of the country is enriched by their literary memories.  In this thesis, we propose to study the strategies of representation of one’s native land and to question the possibility of the narrators’ return. To do so, we will attempt to bring out and to define the discursive ethoses that appear crucial in the novels. Then, we will develop the narrative identity of the writer in order to explore the narrators’ literary memories by studying the implicit and the explicit intertexts. Finally, we will bring forward the possibility of returning to one’s native land by writing."

682	Bill Readings : penser le dissensus dans les ‘ruines’ de l’université	This master’s thesis offers a critical interpretation and exploration of the main proposals of Bill Readings’ posthumous book, The University in Ruins (Harvard, 1996). I situate Readings’ provocative thoughts as a translation of Lyotard’s notion of differend into American pedagogical debates within the literary crisis upon the curricula and the so-called “Culture Wars”. The study expands on the dialogue which opposed Readings to Graff, where the latter sought to posit the notion of “Conflict” as the locus of a renewed academic community. In contrast to Graff, the radicalism of Readings’ “community of dissensus” becomes more salient. While renouncing the emancipatory ideals of Modernity, Readings suggested an understanding of education as a space of heteronomous ethics, and pedagogy as an infinite and asymmetrical relationship to others. Finally, I show that the “community of dissensus” maintains as a permanent question the aporetic nature of its identity as well as of the nature of the social bond within the “post-historical” university. By doing so, this work provides an original contribution which underlines a kinship between Readings’ most controversial statements and Mikhail Bakhtin’s dialogism and anthropological ideas.

683	"Le grand écart? 
La vie privée sur internet vue par les adolescents et leurs parents"	The rising popularity of social media platforms among teenagers and the role they are taking as an integrated part of their daily communication has and will continue to raise a number of questions around the concept of security, and more precisely, about online privacy. This research paper aims to explore and compare the perceptions about online privacy in the digital era, first from the point of view of teenagers between 14 and 15 years of age, and then from the point of view of their respective parents. The first step in the data collection process was to ask the students to complete a survey about their online habits and the type of content they publish and share online.  In the second part of the research, face-to-face interviews were conducted, first with the teenager alone, then with the parents. The objective was to get a better understanding of the household’s dynamics and to observe the differences in the perception of online privacy. To begin, the data collected has shown significant discrepancies in the online behaviour of teenage girls versus boys. However, the results did not provide any statistical significance in online behaviour in respect to household regulations regarding the use of online communication tools. Furthermore, though widely influenced by personal experience, the interviews with different family members brought up fairly similar definitions of online privacy. The notion of gradation of values has also been approached in their definitions.	Parents , Internet , Perception , Privacy , Teenagers , Family , Definition , Rules , Social media	en	18677.0
684	The potential role of the multivalent ionic compound PolyP in the assembly of the liquid nature in the cell	Prion-like proteins containing Low Complexity Sequences (LCSs) have the propensity to aggregate and form membrane-less compartments in the cell. These proteins form droplets that have liquid features such as wetting, dripping and fusion. In this study, we demonstrated that the prion domain-containing protein Hrp1 forms droplets of different sizes in the presence of negatively charged polymers via liquid-liquid phase separation, whereas under the same conditions, the prion-like domain PolyQ/N of Hrp1 forms a gel-like material. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that droplets in vivo could be modulated by negatively charged polyelectrolytes found in the cell such as DNA, RNA and polyphosphate (PolyP). My goal was to examine the role of the polyanionic nature of PolyP on the assembly of P-bodies using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a cellular model and fluorescence microscopy. We chose to study processing (P)- bodies, based on previous findings that these cellular subcompartments are formed by liquid-liquid phase separation of component proteins in the cytoplasm. We found that depleting phosphate from the media and deleting vtc4 gene, which is responsible for PolyP synthesis, did not have any effect on P-body formation. In addition, we demonstrated that PolyP and the protein Edc3, a core component of P-bodies, do not colocalize. Our data suggest that PolyP does not affect P-body formation. However, further and complementary studies have to be performed to confirm that PolyP have no effects on other membrane-less organelles.

685	Détermination des concentrations de déoxynivalénol et zéaralénone associées à des maladies chez les vaches laitières	In Quebec, the most common mycotoxins found in the diet of the dairy herd are deoxynivalenol (DON) and zearalenone (ZON). As part of our study, we had two main objectives. The first objective was to quantify DON and ZON mycotoxins in naturally contaminated dairy cows by assessing their presence in the feed, serum and urine of these cows. The second objective was to determine the extent to which these mycotoxin concentrations could be associated with health, production and reproductive problems in these cattle. The study was conducted in two phases. In the first phase, we carried out 60 dairy herds to identify their levels of mycotoxin contamination. In the second phase, we selected 15 herds with the lowest serum De-epoxy-deoxynivalenol (DOM-1) concentrations and 15 herds with the highest DOM-1 concentrations This project allowed us to identify concentrations of DON and ZON at the dietary and urinary levels that were associated with increased risks of reform, abortion, decreased reproductive performance, hypercetonemia, clinical endometritis And lower milk production. The data collected will allow veterinarians and nutritionists to refine their recommendations to dairy producers regarding the management of mycotoxins.

686	Variations génomiques et antigéniques du virus de la grippe porcine (Influenzavirus porcin) sur le territoire québécois	Data about genomic variability of swine influenza A viruses (SIV) in Quebec herds are scarce. Yet, this information is important for understanding virus evolution in Quebec from until 2015. Different clinical samples were obtained from 24 outbreaks of swine flu in which animals were experiencing respiratory disease. Samples including lung tissues, saliva and nasal swabs were collected and virus isolation was attempted in MDCK cells and embryonated eggs. All eight gene segments of the 18 isolated SIV strains were sequenced and analysed. Antiviral drugs resistance against oseltamivir carboxylate (GS4071), zanamivir (GS167) and amantadine hydrochloride was evaluated by neuraminidase inhibition assays (NAIs) and plaque reduction assay. Two subtypes of SIV, H3N2 and H1N1, were identified in Quebec pig herds. Twelve SIV strains were genetically related to trH3N2 Cluster IV and at least 6 different reassortment profiles were identified. On the other hand, 6 Quebec SIV strains were found to be genetically related to the pandemic virus A(H1N1)pdm09 and from which three reassortment profiles were identified. Overall, the trH3N2 was the most prevalent subtype (66.7%) found in Quebec swine herds. The epitope mapping of HA indicated that the H3 subtype was the most variable with a possibility of 21 amino acids (aa) substitutions within the 5 antigenic sites A(5), B(8), C(5), D(1) and E(2). However, the HA protein of the H1 subtype had only 5 aa substitutions within 3 antigenic sites Sb(1), Ca1(2) and Ca2(2). One H1N1 (1/6 = 16.7%) and one trH3N2 (1/12 = 8.3%) were identified as strains resistant against oseltamivir. In contrast, two H1N1 (2/6 = 33.3%) and two trH3N2 (2/12 = 16.7%) strains were found to be resistant against zanamivir. Overall, the SIV resistance against antiviral neuraminidase inhibitor drugs was (33.3%). All strains were resistant against the M2 inhibitor antiviral drug, amantadine. The presence of antiviral drug resistance in Quebec swine herds and the possible emergence of new SIVs strains are public health concerns supporting the surveillance of SIVs.

687	La musique comme outil de préparation mentale chez les athlètes olympiques	The use of music as a mental preparation tool is very common amongst Olympic athletes. However, this practice has received little research attention. Thus, the present study has two objectives: (a) to identify the functions of music in a sporting context and (b) to explore the messages conveyed by the lyrics. To this end, semi-structured interviews were conducted with ten Quebec Olympians practicing technico-artistic sports. In addition, athletes took part in a music task where they listened to the song that most influenced their athletic career and write all the memories evoked by the song. Data analysis by grounded theory demonstrates that athletes use music as a mental preparation tool for two main reasons: (1) to trigger or (2) to regulate psychological processes such as focus, visualization and emotions, which are beneficial to their athletic performances. However, if not used properly music can have a negative effect on these psychological processes and thus impair performance. Furthermore, analysis of the lyrics that most influenced the sport careers of the athletes reveals that the message conveyed by these songs is very similar from one song to another. Practical implications for using music in sport settings and suggestions for future research are discussed.	sport psychology , music , lyrics , olympic athletes	en	18634.0
688	Facteurs associés à la santé mentale positive chez les jeunes adultes de 18 à 29 ans au Canada	Background: Positive Mental Health (PMH) is defined as a state of well-being to feel, to think, and to act so as to expand the capabilities necessary to enjoy life and the challenges it brings. Some studies have examined associations between PMH and certain other health determinants. Few are the ones taking into account a range of factors, especially among young. Objectives. To study the relationships between sociodemographic, individual, family, community factors and PMH in young adults. Methods. The present study is based on data from the Canadian Community Health Survey - Mental Health (CCHS-MH) conducted in 2012. Participants consist of 4242 young adults aged between 18 and 29 years, of which 47% are women and 53% are men. PMH is measured by the Mental Health Continuum-Short Form (MHC-SF). The associations between PMH and 19 sociodemographic, individual, family and community factors are examined using hierarchical linear regression. Results. Among young adults, age, being a man, educational level, main occupation, parental status, coping skills, health perception, physical activity, spiritual values importance, household income, social support are positively associated with PMH. The exposure to stress and violence in childhood, illicit drug use, family mental health, are negatively associated with PMH of young adults. Age has a moderating effect on relationship between social support, educational level and PMH and gender, with coping skills and spiritual values. Conclusion. Results of the present study allow for a better understanding of factors associated with PMH in young adults on sociodemographic, individual, family and community levels. In addition, results could help decision makers develop programs of intervention, of prevention, and of promoting of mental health better adapted to young adults.

689	Réforme des vaches laitières au Québec	There are several ways to increase the profitability of dairy farms. Among them, culling can affect the average herd production and therefore the costs of production, by modifying the herd structure. In order to determine an optimal herd profitability, it is important to quantify the culling rates and to understand the mechanisms leading to the culling of an animal. The main objective of this thesis is to describe culling in Québec dairy herds. Specifically, it aims to quantify the culling rates, to explore relationship between the herd, the culling rate, and the individual culling risk, to determine the causal effect of clinical mastitis on culling, and to identify the decision-making criteria used by producers and farm advisers.  A retrospective longitudinal study was conducted on health and production data from cows in dairy herds from Québec, Canada. Ten years of data, between 2001 and 2010, were used to determine herd profiles and their culling rates, and their potential relationship. Herd influence on individual culling risk and the causal effect of clinical mastitis were explored respectively by contextual analysis and by using a marginal structural model. Shared criteria on culling decisions held by dairy producers, veterinarians and other advisers were identified with the help of the Q-methodology, which provides a means to reveal the decision structure of individuals.  This study quantified an average culling rate of 32% based on ten years of follow-up, with significant variations between herds. Specific herd profiles according to a set of characteristics related to their reproductive and production performances, management and health indicators could not be determined. It is however possible to distinguish herds against certain unique feature taken one by one and to relate it to the culling rate, including herd management, reproduction performances, and milk production. These indicators can be considered as contextual variables in multilevel analyses.  A herd contextual effect is present in the cow culling risk, but limited. It is mainly due to the pressure of heifers coming into the herd. Culling risk due to clinical mastitis, considered in the counterfactual framework of a longitudinal study where exposure is time-varying, is comparable between primiparous and multiparous cows. For this risk, dairy production has less influence in primiparous that in multiparous cows.  Producers and their advisers share a common framework for culling decision-making, referring essentially to cow's udder health and her milk production. Herd culling rate is not involved in the decision to cull a specific cow.	culling , dairy cow , survival , bias , decision-making	en	18586.0
690	Les processus de dissémination et de création des connaissances dans les organisations de santé : le cas du Bureau de transition du Centre universitaire de santé McGill	Health organizations are characterized by the complexity of their activities and a high level of care fragmentation that inevitably result in service coordination stakes. Their main coordination mechanism, knowledge and expertise standardization is an essential, but limited, mechanism. Thus, the challenge still stands for a health organization to promote knowledge utilization at an organizational level. This project evaluates how an organizational structure aiming at mobilization and knowledge utilization in decision making helps to improve the coordination services in a health organization. This research relies on a specific case: the Transition Support Office (TSO) of the McGill University Health Center (MUHC).  The analysis uses a conceptual framework of organizational knowledge creation inspired by the work of Nonaka et al. Data have been collected by observations, documentary and interview analyses. This theory driven evaluation explains how the conversion process of tacit knowledge to explicit knowledge allows the dissemination and creation of new organizational knowledge and contributes to the improvement of service coordination. The evaluation demonstrates the influence of contextual factors on the processes of knowledge creation/utilization. The research shows that it is necessary to otherwise conceptualize the use of empirical data in decision making by highlighting their specific role in the social process of knowledge creation. We propose a new knowledge use typology in decision making. We also show how an organizational structure like the TSO can contribute to the care and service coordination in a health organization. Results also enrich the scientific knowledge on governance and organization transformation.

691	Post-effets et rééducation à la marche chez le sujet hémiparétique	Step length asymmetry is a common characteristic of post-stroke gait, but considered as particularly resistant to conventional gait interventions. A recent novel approach using a split-belt treadmill (SBT) showed promising results in short- and long-term reduction of step length asymmetry post-stroke. However, the underlying mechanisms of this intervention and its effects must be better understood before recommending its use in clinical settings. This project aimed to improve our current knowledge about muscular and biomechanical factors contributing to immediate and long-term changes in step length asymmetry in chronic stroke survivors. The main objectives were to: 1) analyze muscle activity associated with changes in step length after walking at unequal belt speeds on a SBT; 2) test the effects of repeated exposure to SBT walking on step length asymmetry and gait ability during walking over ground; and 3) investigate the muscular contributions and strategies involved in these changes. To attain these objectives, a cross-sectional analysis was conducted followed by a pilot training study. The general hypothesis was that distal lower limb muscles are the main contributors to SBT-induced changes in step length asymmetry in chronic stroke survivors using a SBT protocol where two belts were set at unequal speeds with a ratio of 2:1 for a period of time (split-belt configuration). The cross-sectional study analyzed the immediate changes in muscle activity and step length after six minutes of SBT walking in a group of 16 individuals post-stroke and in 10 healthy controls. The findings confirmed that regardless of the side (paretic or non-paretic) walking on the fast belt during split-belt configuration, changes in muscle activity of the ankle plantar- and dorsiflexors were mainly associated with changes in step length symmetry (paper #1). The pilot training study demonstrated that repeated exposure to SBT protocol reduced step length asymmetry and improved walking speed over ground in 12 individuals post-stroke (paper #2). Improvements persisted at least one month post-training. Findings also indicated that from a therapist’s viewpoint the training protocol was easy to use and practical in a clinical environment (supplementary data paper #2). Paper #3 showed that these consistent improvements in gait parameters were achieved by a variety of muscular contributions and strategies which involved both lower limbs with a predominant contribution on the side that was trained on the faster belt. Large effect sizes were found in the plantarflexor group during late stance of gait for both net joint moments and muscle activity in the training study. These results combined with the findings of paper #1 indicate that overall, step length asymmetry post-stroke can be successfully reduced with repeated exposure to the tested SBT protocol with distal lower limb muscles appearing to be strong contributors to locomotor adaptation post-stroke and long-term changes in step length asymmetry. Larger control trials are necessary to confirm the relevance of the use of SBT protocols and to further understand the role of the distal lower limb muscles in improvements in step length symmetry post-stroke.

692	Les effets du vieillissement sur les réponses auditives et audiovisuelles des neurones du collicule supérieur chez le rat	Age-related physiological changes affect the peripheral auditory structures; this also applies to the superior colliculus (SC) auditory and visual processes. In aged rats, the peripheral hearing sensitivity decreases and at more central regions, particularly the first central node, in the ascending auditory projections, auditory processing of sounds is altered. Furthermore, at the level of the SC, spectral, temporal and directional properties of auditory neurons are also altered during aging. In addition, no systematic directional spatial arrangement is encountered among the neurons of aged rats, implying that the topographical organization of the auditory directional map is abolished in the deep layers of the SC. Moreover, in a condition where SC visual neurons are stimulated with looming concentric sinusoidal gratings (in the presence or in the absence of modulated audio signals), visual deficits in aged animals are particularly marked by a decrease in sensitivity to fast moving visual and audiovisual stimuli during self-motion. Given the links of age-related changes in the peripheral and in the central structures, inevitably, the mechanisms underlying the neuronal audiovisual plasticity, in the low-level (SC), are somehow disrupted. Specifically, in aged animals, the presence of the auditory stimulus when coupled with the visual signal did not enhance the response activity of the visual neurons. This seems to suggest that the mechanism that may serve to amplify the visual signal under weak or ambiguous and noisy conditions thus improving greater behavioral relevance of detecting rapidly approaching visual and audiovisual moving objects during self-motion is altered with aging. Overall, these results show that aging disrupts the SC neuronal activity that enables detection of relevant sensory information in a complex audiovisual environment.	rat , Aging , peripheral auditory system , cochlear nucleus , superior colliculus , spectral and temporal auditory acuity , directional hearing , looming , audiovisual integration	en	18552.0
693	Implication du système immunitaire dans un modèle de sclérose latérale amyotrophique chez C. elegans	Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a complex multifactorial pathology characterized by the progressive spread of motor neuron degeneration. Unfortunalety, the underlying disease mechanisms remain unclear. By using the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, we were able to investigate genetically and pharmacologically some factors involved in TDP-43 or FUS proteotoxicity. Dominant mutations in these structurally and functionally similar DNA/RNA binding proteins, are causative for familial ALS. We have constructed transgenic C. elegans models expressing human TARDBP or FUS genes - encoding respectively TDP-43 and FUS - only in GABAergic motor neurons. In these transgenics animals, the expression of mutant TARDBP or FUS alleles results in early the motor deficits leading to age-dependent paralysis accompanied by neuronal protein aggregation. Using transgenic strain expressing GFP in GABAeric neurons, we found an increased rate of neurodegeneration in TDP-43 and FUS mutants. With these models we investigated the potential role of the innate immune system as a modifier of these phenotypes. Our results highlight a prevalent role for the worm’s innate immune system, and specifically the TIR-1/Sarm1 pathway and associated downstream kinases in neurodegeneration. We used GFP fluorescence linked to NLP-29 promoter to indicate Sarm1 pathway activation in the entire worm. Interestingly, activation of the TIR-1/Sarm1 pathway occurs in a paracrine manner in non-neuronal cells, suggesting that a danger signal operates extracellularly likely through a membrane receptor. In a past few years, a number of studies have highlighted the prominent role of microRNAs in diseases such as ALS. Traditionally seen as post-transcriptional regulators, what makes them powerful antiviral tools is that they can act at other levels and in particular as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) ligands, also involved in ALS. In addition to the biomarker potential of these small molecules, we investigated their role in the neurodegeneration observed in ALS. As a result, in the a second section of this study, we used worms mutant for several proteins involved in the biogenesis of microRNAs and found that they were involved in the process of TDP-43A315T-independent paralysis and neurodegeneration. Moreover, the microRNA let-7 seems to be a signal molecule involved in the non-cell autonomous trans-neuronal and trans-cellular spread of motor neuron degeneration. Finally, bio-statistical analyzes predict the possibility that let-7 binds to the vi TOL-1 receptor, the single ortholog of TLRs in C. elegans. Thus microRNAs may be prime targets for ALS therapeutic intervention.

694	Filling the gap : cities and the fight against homelessness in Canada	Homelessness is a challenging and fascinating area of public policy; it is new, very complex, poorly defined and poorly understood. From the mid-1990s to mid-2000s, chronic homelessness was growing throughout Canada, yet federal and provincial governments failed to respond to it in any meaningful way. In the absence of federal or provincial leadership, local groups across the country have come together to fight against what was increasingly called a crisis of homelessness.  The scale of chronic homelessness is very similar in big cities across Canada, yet facing the same problem, local actors in Canada’s four biggest and most important cities – Vancouver, Calgary, Toronto and Montreal – came together to form different models of governance of homelessness. In other words, there are very different producers of social protection for the chronically homeless, the other 1%, in each of these cities.  There are two main differences in the local governance models: the role of the local government and the centralization or fragmentation of the model. In Vancouver and Toronto, the local government is highly involved in governing homelessness and has made significant political and financial investments, whereas in Montreal and Calgary the local government plays a much smaller role. Further, the governance of homelessness is centralized in one single body or agency in Calgary and Toronto, whereas it is divided among a number of actors in Vancouver and Montreal. I ask what explains these very different models of governance of homelessness, and I consider the theoretical and practical consequences this has for social protection in Canada. I conclude that the role of the local government in the governing coalition is determined by its housing related powers and the local political commitment to homelessness. In Vancouver and Toronto, there are either significant local housing related powers, a strong political commitment to homelessness, or both. In Montreal and Calgary, there are comparatively few housing related powers and the political commitment to the issue is relatively weak.  The fragmentation or centralization of the governing coalition is determined by the organization of local social forces in each city. In Vancouver and Montreal local social forces are strong and organized, but divided, making the governance of homelessness fragmented. In Calgary, local social forces are dominated by the private sector whereas in Toronto, local social forces are poorly organized and the city is a strong and somewhat domineering actor. This explains the centralization of the governance of homelessness in these two cities.  Despite their commitment and creativity, none of the local governance models has been successful at significantly reducing homelessness. No one level of government alone can solve homelessness, and the absence of the federal government from policy discussions regarding housing and homelessness has been enough to limit the local level successes.  These conclusions both confirm and challenge existing theories of welfare state. On the one hand, it confirms the argument that the evolution of the welfare state has mirrored the evolution of federalism, and that there is increasingly a new human or social capital paradigm of social policy. It challenges this literature, however, by highlighting the role that is played by the local level in the production of social protection. Studies of homelessness and the welfare state should pay careful attention not just to federal and provincial governments, but to the local level as well.

695	Influence du monde affectif et interpersonnel de l’individu dans la relation entre la dépendance, l’automutilation et ses fonctions	The objective of this thesis is to shed light on what may lead a dependent person who fears abandonment to engage in self-injury. Psychological models of object relations and attachment have shown that self-injury is empirically associated with fear of abandonment via dependency and attachment anxiety. However, the nature of this relationship has yet to be thoroughly explained. Having defined and contextualised self-injury, a theoretical explanation is proposed through object relations, attachment and experiential avoidance functions of self-injury, all with the goal of better understanding what can influence a dependent individual to self-injure. This thesis suggests that individuals who are dependent and afraid of being abandoned might use self-injury to regulate negative emotions associated with their perception of abandonment, separation or rejection. Theoretically, this influence of self-injury could occur through intrapersonal and interpersonal functions, such as affect regulation, self-punishment and interpersonal influence, as well as autonomy avoidance. These functions might serve to protect internal representations of dependence and thus, reduce subjective feelings of abandonment.  To test these theoretical proposals, 58 outpatient participants completed, among other measures, the Depressive Experiences Questionnaire (DEQ), the Inventory of Statements About Self-Injury (ISAS) and the Revised Diagnostic Interview for Borderlines (DIB-R). Results showed a relationship between anaclitic neediness and self-injury frequency, which was explained by mediator effects of both affective and interpersonal problems. Furthermore, this type of dependency was found to be specifically associated with marking distress, anti-dissociation, interpersonal influence and autonomy avoidance functions of self-injury. These findings suggest that anaclitic neediness favours the experience of affective and interpersonal difficulties, which in turn increase the frequency of self-injury. Results also suggested that self-injury associated with this type of dependency might serve to regulate internal affective states, to influence the interpersonal environment and to avoid autonomy. Affect regulation and self-punishment functions were endorsed by the majority of individuals who self-injured, regardless of their level of dependence. While these two functions are associated in theory to dependency issues that underpin self-injury for some individuals, analyses indicated that these functions also contribute to self-injury behaviour in people who do not fear abandonment specifically.

696	Teatralidades y políticas de la memoria y el cuerpo: Patricia Ariza y Nohora Ayala (1995-2013)	The political tension that developed in Colombia since the 40s, between  conservative ideologies and, the divergency in the official liberal party and dissident liberal party, brought out a feeling of disagreement that collapsed when Jorge Eliecer Gaitan, leader of dissident party, was killed in Bogota on 9 April 1948. This event, well known as The Bogotazo, unchained violent protests, murders, assaults, harassment, terror and unrest throughout the country. As a result, in the subsequent years the liberal guerrillas were formed and over a decade the conflict ensued in  more than 200,000 murders in the country and thousands of rural migrants in the cities. Later, some leaders formed the communist guerrillas who perpetuated the armed conflict in the country, some of them are known today as FARC, the oldest group of guerillas in the world and the most powerful in Colombia,  and ELN. Actually, the FARC are in the final negotiation for peace in Havana, Cuba. This violent historical context has produced a staggering statistics of victims (Basta ya!, 2013),  in which the artists and activist dramatists, Patricia Ariza and Nohora Ayala propose  a new aesthetic  that questions the violent actions of the country from women’s perspective. Their theatrical productions are part of the Collective Creation in the Teatro La Candelaria, where the research is faced with the aesthetics of the scene and confronted with the deconstruction of reality counted, telling or testimonials. This dissertation examines six plays by Ariza and Ayala whose political and bodily liminalities deconstruct dominant ideas of history, while illuminating  the complex networks surrounding  the women and the Antigones produced by the country. I explore the materiality of  non-absent bodies (victims of forced disappearance) which exposes  the deterritorialization of dispossessed bodies. The  first chapter of the thesis discerns recent theoretical approaches to the concepts of  representation, theater, performance and political theatricality which I have found pertinent for my examination of the work by Ariza and Ayala. At the same time, I elaborate on the notions  of the body without organs and of dispossessed bodies in order to shed light on  the epistemological break between the material present body and dispossessed bodies of the disappeared.  In the second chapter, I analyze three plays by Patricia Ariza: Antigone (2006), Mujeres en la Plaza (2009) and Somma Mnemosyne (2013), which evince an exercise in artivism and engagement with the political history of Colombia. The third chapter presents three plays of Nohora Ayala: Fémina Ludens (1995), Piel (2010) and Rosas Secas (2012), where the body is part of a radical practice of questioning colombian historical memory. Finally, the concluding chapter examines the role of political and corporeal theatricality in engaging spectators’ critical participation in the work of Ariza and Ayala.

697	Propriétés anionophores et antibactériennes de sels d’imidazolium et benzimidazolium	The emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria is a serious problem that our health system faces. One recently proposed strategy to effectively and irreversibly kill these multi-resistant microorganisms is to directly target the integrity of their membrane, using small molecules able to induce an electrolyte imbalance. Moreover, the same molecules may find applications in the treatement od diseases originating from the dysfunction of ion transport, such as cystic fibrosis. Herein we present different imidazolium and benzimidazolium salts N,N-disubstituted with both antimicrobial and ionophoric potential. We first performed  mechanistic studies where different structural changes have been made to the imidazolium and benzimidazolium salts to observe how these modifications modulate the efficiency of the anion transport in artificial membrane liposomes. We were able to conclude that the species formed of two aromatic arms phenylethynylbenzyl arranged symmetrically on either side of an imidazolium cation, induced a better transport of chloride anions, through a membrane of liposomes at the micromolar range. In addition, monocations imidazolium and benzimidazolium flanked with an bis(trifluorométhylsulfonyl)amide anion led to faster ionophore activity. Moreover, based on these results we presented the first example, to our knowledge, for an anions and cations benzimidazolium-based transporter, acting as well in liposomes as in bacteria. Secondly, the best anionophore agents were analyzed in more complex bacterias and human red blood cells membranes to study their bactericidal potential and innocuity. Among all the benzimidazolium salts studied, we identified one compound, which presents interesting antibacterial properties as a result of its ability to induce an electrolytic imbalance and to disrupt the integrity and the potential of the bacterial membranes. At the same time this antibacterial agent presented a low toxicity to human cells in bacteriostatic range concentrations.

698	Occupants' quality of life experience with sustainable work environments : using a mixed-methods approach to develop a humane and sustainable framework for assessing the indoor environmental quality in office buildings	This research studies perceived Quality of Life (QoL) and Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) of occupants’ in the work environments of sustainable office buildings certified under the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) system (green buildings) and in conventional office buildings. QoL is defined in this research in terms of perceived health, comfort, and productivity. The quality of indoor environments is important because people spend most of their time inside buildings, and in contemporary society, much of the time spent in work environments is in office buildings. In this era of growing concerns about sustainability and the increased awareness of buildings’ negative impacts on occupants, green buildings have been promoted as sustainable solutions to these issues. LEED is the most popular rating system for measuring the performance of green buildings in North America. However, the literature review indicates that there are user complaints about the IEQ of LEED-certified office buildings. LEED-certified buildings are assessed based on technical measures of building performance. This assessment way may create a gap between measured and perceived performance from the user perspective. This raises the question of whether buildings certified with the LEED criteria are humane from the QoL experience of occupants in office buildings. Hence, this research is therefore to propose a new framework that takes into account not only sustainable but also humane factors for evaluating work environments. The study uses a mixed-methods approach – using both quantitative and qualitative methods and proceeds in three phases to comprehensively study occupants’ perceived QoL experience in two LEED and one conventional office building. Phase I uses observations to document the physical work environment and users’ behavioral interactions with the environment. Phase II uses interviews to describe the occupants’ QoL experience, explore the possible IEQ factors shaping their QoL, and to define the constructs of a humane work environment. Questionnaires were distributed concurrently to measure the relationship between occupants’ perceived QoL and IEQ factors that are derived from the literature. Phase III uses focus groups to converge and focus the results of the study. The results are analyzed separately and triangulated using an integrative mixed-methods analysis to interpret, corroborate, conclude, and increase the validation of the findings.  The study compared occupants’ perceived QoL in «green» and «conventional» office buildings and revealed 32 quality factors (30 IEQ factors and two others) that influence the QoL experience in office work environments. Also the constructs of what composes a humane work environment based on occupants’ viewpoints have been identified. A new comprehensive, sustainable, and humane framework for assessing IEQ in work environments is developed. This framework guides the relationship between IEQ in work environments and occupants’ QoL as an environment-behavior system.

699	Relations sociétés-nature et stratégies intégrées de conservation et du développement : cas de la Réserve de Biosphère Intercontinentale de la Méditerranée	The thesis falls within the overall framework of research on the relations of societies with their territories, in connection with the integrated strategies of conservation of biodiversity and sustainable development. While the first protected areas were created on a segregated basis, they are now part of integrative models that are more subtle than expected. The object of the study is a critical perspective of the processes of planning and management of protected areas that generate stereotyped development models. In naturally heterogeneous and dynamic contexts, the overall objectives of conservation policies struggle to integrate representations of nature, interests and local practices. How then can these strategies be adapted to a convergence of mutual interests, with a socio-cultural reappropriation of the conservation, well-being of human populations and development at the local level?  The Talassemtane Natural Park, part of the territory of the Mediterranean Intercontinental Biosphere Reserve (RBIM), is subject to the challenges of integration between local, national and transnational. The exploration of methodologies presenting certain attractiveness in the study of the complexity of socio-ecosystems has made it possible to highlight the socio-cultural basis of local populations through which the use of spaces and natural resources passes. The construction of relationships with nature derived from them, anchored in the historical dynamics of societies, reveals the one-dimensional logic of systemic nature-culture reasoning. The implementation of strategies for the conservation and multiple and sustainable use of natural resources requires the integration of all social groups, their cultural and spiritual values of spaces and resources, their endogenous knowledge and practices.

700	Les maisons de disques à l’ère des médias sociaux et des services musicaux en ligne : étude de cas de quatre maisons de disques québécoises	During the last decade, music recording and production tools, social media, and platforms for  selling and listening to music in streaming have radically transformed the industry of recorded  music. The decline of  album sales and  new models  of music production, distribution, and  promotion have directly  affected the traditional  actors of the music  industry such as record  labels. While some predicted that these changes would bring an end to the records labels at the  benefit of self-production and self-promotion, others suggested that independent record labels  could become an essential part of this new environment, provided they adapt to it and develop  new services  and an  expertise that  meet the artists’ needs. This master thesis  explores the visibility of independent  Quebec music artists  on  the  social web and  the  role  record  labels  plays in it. In this multiple case study, four independent Quebec music labels were selected.  In-depht interviews were conducted with the Web project managers of these music labels to  discuss their perception  and  their  usage  of  Web  platforms,  as  well  as  the strategies they  employ to increase the visibility on the Web of the artistes they represent. Observational data  of the Web activities of the four music labels were also collected.	music , multiple case study , social media , music labels , web platforms for music listening , music streaming services	en	18413.0
701	À la rencontre des esprits brésiliens : la construction des relations avec l’au-delà chez les adeptes du Santo Daime au Québec	The Santo Daime, an Amazonian Brazilian religion, expanded into the Belle Province almost twenty years ago. This syncretic religion, stemming from indigenous traditions, Afro-Brazilian religions, Catholicism, European esoteric currents and Spiritism, is intrinsically connected to Brazilian culture and more specifically to the Amazon rainforest through the use of ayahuasca, a hallucinogenic substance. The fardados (uniformed members) make contact with the divine thanks to this entheogen called Daime. This thesis examines the expansion of Santo Daime in the province of Quebec through the history of a group we call the Église daimiste québécoise. An ethnography of the Daimista group will help us to explore the mechanisms that are implemented by members to make sense of this culturally distant religion. Inspired by both experiential and phenomenological approaches, this research aims to understand the religious experience amongst Quebec’s Daimistas, in which they build special relationships with the beings of the Astral, the beyond. In that sense, mystical experiences and clairvoyance are two phenomena that we will address as a catalyst of these relationships. By examining how Santo Daime enters into members’ everyday life, we will see that the process of learning the religion establishes an understanding of the language and the symbols of Santo Daime. Along with this apprenticeship, and connecting elements of Santo Daime with the other faiths they have experienced forms an intelligible ensemble that can be integrated into their everyday life. We will see that from this point on, a commitment of the members to the beings of the Astral is possible and that a real disciple (the members) / master (the spirits) relationship can develop.

702	Les célébrants de rites de passage séculiers au Québec : à la recherche du sens perdu	This master thesis aims at making a contribution to ritual studies and the anthropology of secularism. The ethnographic research I present is based in Quebec and centers on new specialists of secular rites of passage, who are ritual makers that practice outside of organized religion. My central objective is to understand how these self-described celebrants creatively contribute to the practice of rites of passage, without relying purely on institutional support or regulation. The focus of this thesis is on birth and wedding ceremonies. I present how these celebrants use ritual innovation and creativity to offer meaningful rites in a social context marked by diversity with respect to different religious sensitivities. Indeed, secular celebrants direct their services toward people who are distanced from institutionalized religion and therefore must satisfy their values, beliefs and worldviews, in addition to elder members of the community that may still adhere to catholic traditions. The results of this qualitative research are based on a sample of ten secular celebrants operating in Quebec and displaying a variety of approaches to ritual making. The primary mode of data gathering is through semi-directed interviews and observational interactions with ritual practitioners. This study demonstrates that the social and spiritual dimensions of the wedding and birth celebrations drive the ritual celebrants, rather than purely economical motivations. Even though ritual makers may develop their practice independently from one another, the most innovative celebrants share traits and participate in a larger emerging ritual paradigm observed by Catherine Bell (2009). This paradigm is characterized by a vision where rites of passage are considered a universal means for the empowerment of the self and the community; rites of passage become a transformational as well as reflexive process for the core ritual participants; the social function of ritual is emphasized toward an ideal of authenticity whereas religious beliefs take a secondary importance; the ritual leader loses authority in favour of the participants; the experiential and participatory component of ritual are strongly invested.

703	Une étude de la relation entre les homicides et la disponibilité des armes à feu dans 150 pays	Objective. This study estimates the relationship between firearms availability and homicides in 150 countries. More specifically, this study compares the predictive validity of three different firearms availability indicators: (1) the percentage of homes owning a firearms; (2) the percentage of persons carrying a firearm; and (3) the rate of firearms per 100 populations. Carrying a firearm is conceptualized as a central dimension of a self-defense culture and it should display a stronger association with homicides than the two other indicators. Methodology. Data comes from the Enquête Mondiale sur l’Homicide, Small Arms Survey and other publications from the United Nations. Descriptive, bivariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to assess the relationship between firearms and homicides. Results. Results show that, in general, the percentage of persons carrying firearms is positively associated with the homicide rate and the proportion of homicides committed with a firearm.  Economic inequalities and corruption within the criminal justice system are both positively associated with homicides. Conclusion. Results do not support the self-defense thesis. Conversely, firearm carrying is associated with high homicide rates, which is in keeping with studies showing that a firearm is the perfect crime facilitator. Hence, technologies developed by forensic and information sciences represent promising avenues to track firearms transactions and support criminal investigations.

704	Analyse des relations entre les pratiques professionnelles réfléchies et le bien-être pédagogique des enseignants du secondaire	This research explores the relations between the well-designed professional practices of high school teachers and their educational well-being. To do this, we conducted an exploratory research, with a qualitative dominance, among eleven female and two male high school teachers from the Greater Montreal Area. We adopted a sociocognitive approach to document their levels of reflection throughout their relations with their students and colleagues and their relations with dimensions of educational well-being among high school teachers. We used two data collection techniques: the Q technique and critical incident technique. To explore these links, we started by examining the change level model of Korthagen and Vasalos (2005), which highlighted the interactions between the specific reflections of six levels of reflection: work environment, schooling-centered behaviors, class management skills, professional beliefs and identify and mission with students. We then explored the concept of the educational well-being of teachers. According to the overall results of our research, the educational well-being of high school teachers is both a dynamic process whose evolution is influenced by what is going on in the work environment, especially in the classroom, and by the teacher’s essential qualities, and a construct based on specific dimensions; three dimensions were used in this study: self-efficacy, commitment and job satisfaction. Educational relations with students seem to be the main source of educational well-being for teachers. Believing in the efficiency of their class management skills and noticing that students are happy to be in their class and are involved in their learning apparently stimulates the commitment and job satisfaction of teachers. Reflections on the characteristics and background of students, including their well-being in the classroom, and professional skills seem to be the aspects of interactions with students that affect the educational well-being of teachers the most. As for interactions between work relations with their colleagues, they seem to have a positive impact on educational well-being, namely through collective reflections on the ordinary situations of professional practices. Lastly, despite certain methodological and conceptual limitations, this study highlights the existence of empirical links between well-designed practices and the educational well-being of high school teachers. It also identifies directions for future research on the reciprocal influences between educational practices and educational well-being, and proposes foresight research ideas.	well-designed practices , pedagogical well-being , sociocognitive approach , work environment , professional skills , professional identity , self-efficacy , commitment , job satisfaction	en	18375.0
705	Le concept de série dans les manuels au niveau collégial : registres de représentation et activités cognitives	At the post high school level, advanced mathematical concepts are difficult to grasp for many students. The series concept is one such advanced concept that students meet for the first time formally in their postsecondary studies (Cégep in the Québec context). This concept has a very large number of applications both in mathematics and in science. However, its own complexity and nature against-intuitive make it very difficult to understand by some students. Among the difficulties to apprehend it, in many cases, we can find the idea that the sum of an infinite number of terms will give a quantity which will necessarily be infinitely large. Given the importance and complexity of this concept, one might expect it to be considered with great attention by the research. However, our literature review shows that there are very few studies focusing on the concept of infinite sum. In this Masters thesis, we will present the results of an analysis carried out on seventeen textbooks used in Cégeps in Quebec. The results of this analysis have allowed us to realize that the textbooks used by the current education rarely make use of the graphic register and that the algebraic register is often favored. Thus, most of the textbooks used in Cégeps rarely use visual representations that could be an important tool that can contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the concept of series and graphics are virtually absent in all the exercises and problems that these books offer. Furthermore, the results of our research show that mathematical and extramathematical applications are scarce, although infinite sums are a key concept in the introduction of other mathematical concepts and they allow modeling several phenomena. Moreover, among the few extramathematical applications that appear in the seventeen textbooks, many are of little use to the understanding of the concept in question since they are artificial (difficult applications to perform in daily life). Finally, our research results reveal that the content of textbooks in connection with the concept of series deserves to be readjusted to allow students a better understanding of this concept.

706	Coreference resolution with and for Wikipedia	Wikipedia is a resource of choice exploited in many NLP applications, yet we are not aware of recent attempts to adapt coreference resolution to this resource, a prelim- inary step to understand Wikipedia texts. The first part of this master thesis is to build an English coreference corpus, where all documents are from the English version of Wikipedia. We annotated each markable with coreference type, mention type and the equivalent Freebase topic. Our corpus has no restriction on the topics of the documents being annotated, and documents of various sizes have been considered for annotation. Our annotation scheme follows the one of OntoNotes with a few disparities. In part two, we propose a testbed for evaluating coreference systems in a simple task of measuring the particulars of the concept described in a Wikipedia page (eg. The statements of Pres- ident Obama the Wikipedia page dedicated to that person). We show that by exploiting the Wikipedia markup (categories, redirects, infoboxes, etc.) of a document, as well as links to external knowledge bases such as Freebase (information of the type, num- ber, type of relationship with other entities, etc.), we can acquire useful information on entities that helps to classify mentions as coreferent or not.

707	La création de sens dans un contexte d’ambiguïté extrême : Bombardier et les performances du programme organisationnel visant à améliorer l’engagement de ses employés	This thesis focuses on a particular organizational socialization tactic, namely organizational programs aiming to improve employee engagement (OPIE). I became interested in how the concept of employee engagement relates to employee participation and involvement in OPIE, specifically in an extremely ambiguous organizational setting characterized by repetitive reorganizations and massive layoffs. To study this phenomenon,  I conducted a naturalistic case study. As an organizational insider, I led a number of observations and interviews at Bombardier, the world’s leading manufacturer of both planes and trains. I looked at how Bombardier employees of various hierarchical levels make sense of OPIE, based upon Karl E. Weick’s sensemaking theories.  The present research project, a unique and non-generalizable case, enabled me to study employee engagement, Bombardier’s OPIE as well as sensemaking of this program, at a moment where employee engagement is tested by the prevailing organizational uncertainty. This research led me to conclude that, in this case, 1) a company can take advantage of organizational socialization tactics; 2) OPIE don’t always improve productivity or engagement; 3) the relationship between a manager and an OPIE can play a capital role in employees’ perception of said program; 4) OPIE can be considered as symbolic organizational rituals; 5) team meetings can be considered as symbolic performances; 6) extreme ambiguity can influence how employees make sense of an OPIE; and 7) symbolic rituals can stabilize organizations in periods of extreme ambiguity.	engagement , organizational socialization , organizational commitment , employee engagement , employee voice , reorganization , organizational change , extreme ambiguity , engagement program , sensemaking , organizational insider	en	18331.0

709	Rethinking compassion fatigue through the lens of professional identity : the case of child protection workers	Compassion fatigue is currently the dominant model in work-related stress studies that explain the consequences of caring for others on child-protection workers. Based on a deterministic approach, this model excludes the role of cognition a priori and a posteriori in the understanding of the impact of caregiving or providing social support. By integrating the notion of professional identity, this article adds a subjective perspective to the compassion fatigue model allowing for the consideration of positive outcomes and takes into account the influence of stress caused by accountability. Mainly, it is argued that meanings derived from identity and given to situations may protect or accelerate the development of compassion fatigue or compassion satisfaction. To arrive at this proposition, the notions of compassion fatigue and identity theory are first reviewed. These concepts are then articulated around four work-related stressors specific to child-protection work. In light of this exercise, it is argued that professional identity serves as a subjective interpretative framework that guides the understanding of work-related situations. Therefore, compassion fatigue is not only a simple reaction to external stimuli. It is influenced by meanings given to the situation. Furthermore, professional identity modulates the impact of compassion fatigue on psychological well-being. Practice, policy, and research implications in light of these findings are also discussed	Compassion fatigue , Identity theory , Professional identity , Child-protection work	en	16448.0
710	La représentation de la collectivité dans la mise en acte du chant choral sénégalais chez les Sérères noon de Saint Pierre Julien Eymard de Koudiadiène	On the modalities of appropriation of Western choral practice among Catholic Sérères noon of Saint Pierre Julien Eymard of Koudiadiène, Senegal, this dissertation tries to demonstrate why and how different syncretisms act on various Senegalese symbolisms. It aims to understand more particularly the importance of the community in the mise en acte of the choral repertoire, and how spontaneous improvisation is built in performance situation in what is called here the plurivocalité linéaire. This dissertation is in this vein to decipher the meaning of that specific practice of choral singing and to point how the acculturation process acts on the cultural identity of Sérères noon. Finally, it aims to identify affects in performance situation of the choral that seems to have a central role for members of the parish of Saint Pierre Julien Eymard, and understand and enhance a musical practice and its social context of integration hitherto little studied systematically.

711	Waiting for Data Journalism	Data journalism has emerged as a trend worthy of attention in newsrooms the world over. Previous research has highlighted how elite media, journalism education institutions, and other interest groups take part in the emergence and evolution of data journalism. But has it equally gained momentum in smaller, less-scrutinized media markets? This paper looks at the ascent of data journalism in the French-speaking part of Belgium. It argues that journalism, and hence data journalism, can be understood as a socio-discursive practice: it is not only the production of (data-driven) journalistic artefacts that shapes the notion of (data) journalism, but also the discursive efforts of all the actors involved, in and out of the newsrooms. A set of qualitative inquiries allowed us to examine the phenomenon by first establishing a cartography of who and what counts as data journalism. It uncovers an overall reliance on a handful of passionate individuals, only partly backed up institutionally, and a limited amount of consensual references that could foster a shared interpretive community. A closer examination of the definitions reveal a sharp polyphony that is particularly polarized around the duality of the term itself, divided between a focus on data and a focus on journalism, and torn between the co-existing notions of “ordinary” and “thorough” data journalism. We also describe what is perceived as obstacles, which mostly pertain to broader traits that shape contemporary newsmaking; and explain why, if data journalism clearly exists as a matter of concern, it has not transformed in concrete undertakings.

712	Mapping Romanzo Criminale : an epic narrative ecosystem?	Romanzo Criminale is one of the few recent Italian media products that has emerged as a societal phenomenon and as a vehicle for the exportation of a national culture. It is a complex narrative which extends in time and space due to its various adaptations and intermedial crossovers. Following the path of complexity, drawing on Edgar Morin’s work, Romanzo Criminale will be thought of as a complex system. As precedent studies on the intertwining of official and grassroots discourses show, Romanzo Criminale becomes a complex world, with its boundaries and internal organization. This paper will show that Romanzo Criminale can be studied as MAPPING ROMANZO CRIMINALE. AN EPIC NARRATIVE ECOSYSTEM? MARTA B O N I a semiosphere (Lotman 2005), or a semiotic space defined by and which encourages the intertwining of texts and audience appropriations, creating an epic process. Some methodological perspectives used for mapping this phenomenon will be discussed, namely Franco Moretti’s distant reading.

713	LE SCRIPT DE LA VIOLENCE CONJUGALE: UNE ANALYSE PROCÉDURALE DES VIOLENCES ENTRE CONJOINTS	Objective. The crime script perspective was developed in criminology to capture the step-by-step accounts of the crime-commission process of any crimes in order to offer a greater range of intervention-points for situational prevention purposes (Cornish, 1994). The main objective of this project is to adopt this innovative approach to provide a detailed description of the step-by-step process of intimate partner violence. Information on the casting (as well as their roles and actions), the crime facilitators and precipitators, and alcohol/drugs, are provided for each step of the crime-commission-process. Once the script is established, pertinent situational measures to prevent intimate partner violence are offered.   Methodology. In order to provide a script for intimate partner violence, a grid was developed to collect data extracted from 333 crime events registered by the Montreal Police Department (Service de police de la ville de Montréal). Data were organized according to the three main phases of the crime-commission-process: (1) the preparation; (2) the commission; and (3) the conclusion of the event. At each step of the script, interactions between actors were carefully analyzed in order to understand the escalation process and the severity of the outcome (i.e. severity of injuries). Data were used to induce the script of intimate partner violence and chi-square analyses were conducted to identify factors associated with the risk of severe injuries.   Results.  The intimate partner violence script consists of eight steps: (1) initial context; (2) moving to the location of the intimate partner aggression; (3) acquiring a weapon; (4) attacking the victim; (5) reaction of the victim (counter-attacking or submission); (6) counter-attack from the aggressor or the ending of the violence episode; (7) ending of the altercation (police arrives on the scene or the suspect escapes); and (8) dealing with the parties (arresting the suspect or offering services to the victim).   Some steps such as “acquiring a weapon” or “moving to the location of the aggression” are not always required. At the outset of the event, the risk of severe injuries is increased when victims are under medication and when she is in a couple with the aggressor. Risk of severe injuries is also augmented when one of the parties moves toward the scene of the aggression. During the altercation, intoxication of both parties and using a knife are generally associated with severe injuries. At last, as suggested by the escalation thesis, counter-attacks from the victim lead to severe injuries.   Conclusion. Based on the present findings, the following situational measures would either prevent the frequency and/or the severity of intimate partner violence episodes: (1) install physical barriers (e.g., install new locks and alarms); (2) improve guardianship and natural surveillance (e.g., police presence and neighborhood watch); (3) reduce provocations (e.g., separate parties and limit alcohol availability).

714	Effects of radiation therapy on the structure and function of the pelvic floor muscles of patients with cancer in the pelvic area : a systematic review	Purpose Radiation therapy (RT) is often recommended in the treatment of pelvic cancers. Following RT, a high prevalence of pelvic floor dysfunctions (urinary incontinence, dyspareunia, and fecal incontinence) is reported. However, changes in pelvic floor muscles (PFMs) after RT remain unclear. The purpose of this review was to systematically document the effects of RT on the PFM structure and function in patients with cancer in the pelvic area. Methods An electronic literature search using Pubmed Central, CINAHL, Embase, and SCOPUS was performed from date of inception up to June 2014. The following keywords were used: radiotherapy, muscle tissue, and pelvic floor. Two reviewers selected the studies in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Statement (PRISMA). Out of the 369 articles screened, 13 met all eligibility criteria. The methodological quality was assessed using the QualSyst scoring system, and standardized mean differences were calculated. Results Thirteen studies fulfilled all inclusion criteria, from which four were of good methodological quality. One presented strong evidence that RT affects PFM structure in men treated for prostate cancer. Four presented high-level evidence that RT affects PFM function in patients treated for rectal cancer. Meta-analysis was not possible due to heterogeneity and lack of descriptive statistics. Conclusion There is some evidence that RT has detrimental impacts on both PFMs’ structure and function. Implications for cancer survivors A better understanding of muscle damage and dysfunction following RT treatment will improve pelvic floor rehabilitation and, potentially, prevention of its detrimental impacts.

715	Pelvic-floor-muscle-training adherence “modifiers” : a review of primary qualitative studies : 2011 ICS State-of-the-Science Seminar research paper III of IV	Aims  This review aims to locate and summarize the findings of qualitative studies exploring the experience of and adherence to pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) to recommend future directions for practice and research.   Methods  Primary qualitative studies were identified through a conventional subject search of electronic databases, reference-list checking, and expert contact. A core eligibility criterion was the inclusion of verbatim quotes from participants about PFMT experiences. Details of study aims, methods, and participants were extracted and tabulated. Data were inductively grouped into categories describing “modifiers” of adherence (verified by a second author) and systematically displayed with supporting illustrative quotes.   Results  Thirteen studies (14 study reports) were included; eight recruited only or predominantly women with urinary incontinence, three recruited postnatal women, and two included women with pelvic organ prolapse. The quality of methodological reporting varied. Six “modifiers” of adherence were described: knowledge; physical skill; feelings about PFMT; cognitive analysis, planning, and attention; prioritization; and service provision.   Conclusions  Individuals' experience substantial difficulties with capability (particularly knowledge and skills), motivation (especially associated with the considerable cognitive demands of PFMT), and opportunity (as external factors generate competing priorities) when adopting and maintaining a PFMT program. Expert consensus was that judicious selection and deliberate application of appropriate behavior change strategies directed to the “modifiers” of adherence identified in the review may improve PFMT outcomes. Future research is needed to explore whether the review findings are congruent with the PFMT experiences of antenatal women, men, and adults with fecal incontinence.	pelvic floor muscle training , adherence , qualitative research , review	en	16371.0
716	Lire à l’ère du numérique « Le nénuphar et l’araignée » de Claire Legendre	This article is both a reflexion on the impact of digital culture on social sciences and humanities, and a theoretical reading of Claire Legendre’s essay « Le nénuphar et l’araignée », published on 4 February 2015 by Les Allusifs. Our hypothesis is that it is important to think simultaneously about the theoretical aspect of digital culture along with the pragmatic implementation of new research tools developed for and by social sciences and humanities researchers. The latter are tied directly to a new generation of critical editions with new possibilities of data mining or representing an array of data, be it sound, visual, or text based. This article thus offers a preliminary case study for exploring these new possibilities within Quebec literature.	Data mining , Close reading	en	16361.0
717	"Les consultants face aux défis d’implantation de la 
Réforme du Secteur de la Sécurité (RSS)"	Security Sector Reform (SSR) is a growing priority for actors on the international scene. Through this process the beneficiary states are supported in the reorientation of their institutional frameworks, the strengthening of their structures, of their institutional capacity, and of the groups involved in the security sector (African Union, 2013). The implementation of these programs is today more outsourced towards the private sector, among others, the consultants. The interest of these external actors is that they offer donors a solution to quickly mobilize teams of technical experts with the necessary soft skills. However, our knowledge of the results of SSR programs are limited; furthermore, the study on the contribution and the subcontracting practices to external actors remains a neglected research area (Jackson, 2011). In this sense, the objective of this study is twofold: firstly, we aim to address the empirical research gaps by confronting the major normative principles of RSS as stated in the manuals of international organizations by addressing ourselves directly to consultants, leading players in the implementation of the RSS. Secondly, we aim to identify the challenges that affect the projects and prove decisive, according to the experience of these consultants, to the success or otherwise failure of reforms. Thus, this study will reveal, among other things, project implementation difficulties resulting from the conflicting interests and gaps in coordination of donors, despite the existence of international standards. We also will reveal how the effectiveness of consultants’ missions is compromised because of the particular political interests of the involved parties and willingness, on the part of donors, for immediate and tangible results that lead to conduct programs that are limited to getting internal support for external activities. Finally, we discuss some of the issues characterizing these complex operations and their outsourcing.	consultants , security sector reform , implementation , outsourcing , consultants	en	16336.0
718	Pedagogical Appropriation of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) by West African Educators = Appropriation pédagogique des technologies de l’information et de la communication (TIC) par les éducateurs ouest-africains	This research investigates how and why educators in West Africa, in Mali in particular, pedagogically appropriate information and communication technologies (ICT) and with what effects. Appropriation involves integrating newness into one’s very being and mobilizing it strategically to meet contextualized objectives, often in resistance to the status quo. It is assumed that ICT use is shaped by the values and objectives of users as well as by the local and global hierarchies of the milieus in which they are used. Qualitative research methods and interpretive approaches revealed meanings educators give to their reality and experiences. Interviews were conducted with 31 persons: 23 primary through high school teachers, six university professors, and two administrators. As educators digested ICT, it became part and parcel of their beings and everyday lives. As they adapted it to their milieus, they worked as cultural agents, mediating between ICT and society. The professors in particular expressed desires to use ICT to facilitate and enhance African participation in global debates and scholarly production and to transform how Africa and Africans are projected and perceived. Educators harnessed ICT for its transformative possibilities. The changes apparent in student-teacher relations (more interactive) and classrooms (more dialogical) suggest that ICT can be a catalyst for pedagogical change, including in document-poor contexts and ones weighed down by legacies of colonialism. Learning from the perspectives and experiences of educators pioneering the use of ICT in education in Africa can inform educational theory, practice and policy and deepen understandings of the concept of appropriation as a process of cultural change.

719	L’influence de la perte d’un parent et du deuil chez l’élève de niveau primaire sur sa réussite scolaire	Elementary school achievement is a determining factor for the student’s future academic success. Some elements, like student’s psychological health and parental involvement, might play an important role in school achievement but can be undermined by some life events such as parental loss. Our thesis has focused on a research conducted on 3 students of regular elementary school in Montreal, who lost a parent in the last two years. The research aim was to study the influence of both parental loss and bereavement on elementary school children’s school achievement. Few studies have been conducted on this subject and most of them have examined mainly the influence of bereavement’ psychological consequences on school achievement. In this research, we have adopted a global developmental approach by focusing on the student himself, his parents and his school environment. The research relies on three main concepts: bereavement, school achievement and parental involvement.  The methodology was based on an exploratory qualitative approach and on a content analysis. The participants consisted of 3 bereaved and non-immigrant children, aged between 7 and 10 years old; the surviving parent (2) and their teacher (3). Data had been collected through semi-structured interviews with all participants; children grade reports and school intervention plans. Our findings show that bereavement’ psychological consequences may have a negative influence on school achievement. Moreover, parental loss seems to have a negative influence on student’ family social economic status and on all parental involvement types, including helping at home with homework, collaborating with the school and the community. All those elements may influence negatively school achievement.	bereavement , parental loss , school achievement , parental involvement , elementary school student	en	16323.0
720	The neuroscience of cognitive enhancement : enhanced attention, working memory and visual information processing speed using 3D-MOT	Cognitive enhancement is a domain of burgeoning interest in many domains including neuropsychology. While there are different methods that exist in order to achieve cognitive enhancement, there are few that are supported by research. The current work examines the state of cognitive enhancement interventions. It first outlines the weaknesses observed in these practices and then proposes a standard template for assessing cognitive enhancement tools. A research study is then presented that examines a novel cognitive enhancement tool, 3-dimensional multiple object tracking (3D-MOT), and weighs the current evidence for 3D-MOT against the proposed standard template. The results of the current work demonstrate that 3D-MOT is effective in enhancing attention, working memory and visual information processing speed, and represent a first step toward establishing 3D-MOT as a cognitive enhancement tool.	3D-MOT , Cognitive Enhancement , Perceptual-cognitive training , Brain training	en	16316.0
721	Exposure to Stressful Life Events and Lung Cancer Risk	Objective: To examine exposure to stressful life events in relation to lung cancer risk. Methods: Our research used data from a case-control study conducted in Montreal from 1996 to 2001. Cases were diagnosed with histologically confirmed incident lung cancer at one of 18 Montreal-area hospitals. Controls were randomly selected from the Quebec electoral list and frequency matched to the distribution of cases by sex and 5 year age groups. Data was collected on sociodemographic characteristics, lifetime smoking, and lifestyle factors including 8 stressful life events. Participants indicated the stressful life events they experienced over the past six years, and an appraisal of their level of stress due to each event on a three-point scale. Unconditional logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Each stressful life event was analyzed individually as well as in grouped variables measuring total number of events, loss events and socioeconomic events. Analyses of self-appraised impact scores were also conducted; additionally an external perceived stress score was also employed. Results: 1061 cases and 1422 population controls were included in the analyses. Overall, we observed no association between lung cancer and stressful life events. A decrease in risk for socioeconomic events self-appraised as not very stressful was observed (OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.31, 0.81), which included job loss, increase in debt, and move to another city.  Conclusion: Our results suggest that socioeconomic events, deemed not very stressful, may reduce the risk of lung cancer.

722	Caractérisation du syndrome de chevauchement de l’asthme et de la maladie pulmonaire obstructive chronique	Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are frequent in Canada with a prevalence of 8.4% among Canadians aged 12 and over for asthma and a prevalence of 5 to 15% among Canadians aged 35 to 79 years. Asthma and COPD can coexist in a patient and this Asthma-COPD overlap syndrome (ACOS) affects about 10% to 55% of COPD patients. To better understand this syndrome, two studies were designed and conducted. First, focus groups evaluated how pulmonologists diagnose and treat ACOS, and how they assess its control in routine clinical practice. The pulmonologists reported that the diagnosis must be based on clinical characteristics, pulmonary function tests, and clinical intuition.  They also agreed that the treatment should target the features of both asthma and COPD. The second study assessed the prevalence of adverse events in COPD/ACOS patients on long-acting inhaled anticholinergics (LAAC) and β2-agonists (LABA) in a real-world setting. This study demonstrates that side effects are common among COPD/ACOS patients. Dry mouth and dry throat were the most reported side effects. These results demonstrate that more explicit guidelines for ACOS and a better understanding of the safety profile of long-acting bronchodilators would be beneficial for patients.

723	Évaluation de l’impact des services en téléobstétrique du RUIS McGill offerts à une population de femmes inuites avec grossesse à risque élevé habitant sur la côte de la baie d’Hudson au Nunavik	Health care accessibility to the population located in a remote region of Quebec represents a challenge for the Ministère de la santé et des services sociaux. Solution such as telemedicine has been used to mitigate this issue. Therefore RUIS McGill has developed a teleobstetric program helping Inuit women in Nunavik with their risky pregnancy. This thesis’s objective is to understand the impact of the RUIS McGill teleobstetric program on the mother and her new born health plus the cost and utilization of health services following its implementation in the Inuulitsivik Health & and Social Services Centre located on Hudson Bay Shore. Inuit women at high risk pregnancy and their children in the region of Nunavik's Hudson Bay, who are far away from specialist in obstetric, are targeted. The teleobstetric program provides access to the RUIS McGill obstetricians located in Montreal. A quasi- experimental design was used to examine three hypotheses about the mothers and their children health, the use of health services and their costs. The teleobstetric program became operational in 2006, providing the ability to be a before-after study with two groups of women, those who delivered before 2012 (pre-test) and those who delivered after 2006 (post-test). The data collection took place, in its entirety, through paper medical records of the participants allowing the analysis of 47 cases for the pre-test and 81 cases for the post-test. Variance and covariance’s analysis, logistical regression and the non-parametric Mann-Witney test has allowed to conclude that the pre-test and post-test are different for only two variables which is the weight at birth, lower in the post-test and for the blood pressure of the mother at birth, higher in the post-test. For all other variables based on the three hypothesis of this thesis, results show no significate difference between pre-test and post-test, illustrating that the same level of quality has been conserved after the implementation of the teleobstetric program. Based on results, this thesis recommends reviewing and modifying the program’s objectives; sharing telehealth communication terminals with other specialties; undertaking an assessment of the cost-based program; strictly monitor the use of the program to maximize efficiency and potential; establishing a dashboard; and undertaking a comparative evaluation study in a comparable teleobstetric service.

724	La résistance à l’insuline en insuffisance rénale chronique et le risque de développer un diabète de type 2 : un cercle vicieux	Chronic renal failure (CRF) is characterized by multiple homeostasis imbalances such as insulin resistance. However, few studies addressed the underlying mechanisms of the insulin resistance in CRF. Moreover, it is not known if the insulin resistance in CRF could lead to type II diabetes in predisposed patients. In 5/6th nephrectomised Sprague-Dawley (CD) rat model of CRF, we observed a correlation between the severity of the renal injury, evaluated by the serum creatinine level, and the hyperglycaemia, evaluated by the serum fructosamine level (R2 = 0.6982, p < 0.0001). However, this hyperglycemia is not observed on fasting. During a glucose tolerance test, we noticed an increase of the glycaemia in CRF rats (AUC 1.25 fold, p < 0.0001) comparing to controls. Insulin secretion of CRF rats was not significantly higher (AUC ≈1.30 fold, N.S.) during glucose challenge. Interestingly, despite more increase in insulin levels in CRF rats following a glucose bolus, the peripheral tissues did not show any increase in blood glucose uptake suggesting a defect in expression and/or function of glucose transporters in these rats. Indeed, we observed decreased expression of glucose transporters in the liver (≈0.60 fold, p < 0.01) and muscles (GLUT1 0.73 fold, p < 0.05 and GLUT4 0.69 fold, p < 0.01). Accordingly, there was a significant reduction in the insulin-dependent glucose uptake in the muscles of CRF rats compared to controls (≈0.63 fold, p < 0.0001). Since muscles are responsible for the majority of insulin-sensitive glucose transport, downregulation of GLUT4 could be associated with the insulin resistance observed in CRF. The modulation of the expression of several glucose transporters may contribute to insulin resistance in CRF, but other mechanisms could also be implicated. Despite this important perturbation of glucose transport, we did not observed any case of type II diabetes in our CD rat model. In a rat model of metabolic syndrome, the Zucker Leprfa/fa, CRF causes a strong hyperglycemia on fasting (1.5 fold, p < 0.0001). Furthermore, CRF Zucker showed an exacerbated glycemic response (AUC 1.80 fold, p < 0.0001) during glucose challenge. A strong insulin resistance in muscle was measured as the usual insulin dose (2mU/mL) was not enough to stimulate glucose uptake in Zucker rats with CRF. The same modulation of glucose transporters in the peripheral tissues was observed in both rat models. As opposed to CD rats, ≈30% (p < 0.05) of CRF Zucker rats’ showed presence of glucose in their urine. CRF by itself won’t lead to type II diabetes. However, when insulin resistance is already present when developing CRF, it could precipitate the onset of type II diabetes among these patients.

725	La perturbation du locus Nr2f1-K12 entraine une différenciation gliale précoce dans un nouveau modèle murin de mégacôlon aganglionnaire	Hirschsprung disease is a congenital intestinal motility disorder characterized by an aganglionic segment in the distal colon. A genetic screen performed via random insertional mutagenesis in mice allowed identifying the Spot line, whose homozygotes suffer from an aganglionic megacolon. The analysis of mutant embryonic intestines revealed a decreased proliferation rate and a delay in migration of the enteric neural crest cell (eNCC) progenitors, secondary to their early glial differentiation, resulting in failure to properly colonize the intestine. Sequencing of the Spot genome indicated that the transgene was inserted into the K12-Nr2f1 locus on chromosome 13, a region devoid of genes associated with the disease, and disrupted in addition a highly conserved non-coding sequence. K12 is an uncharacterized long non-coding RNA (LncRNA) gene antisense to the Nr2f1 gene, which is involved in gliogenesis in the central nervous system. Sequencing of the eNCC transcriptome revealed an overexpression of Nr2f1 and short forms of K12 in Spot, and luciferase assays showed repressive activity of the conserved element. We observed the expression of K12 in the eNCC and its subcellular localization in transcriptionally active zones of the nucleus. With the recent emergence of LncRNA regulators and supposing that the regulation of Nr2f1 is done by its antisense K12, these data allowed us identifying two new candidate genes associated with a premature glial differentiation leading to aganglionic megacolon.

726	Valeur diagnostique des micro-éveils autonomiques comme substitut aux éveils cérébraux dans l'apnée du sommeil	The general adult population has a high prevalence of sleep breathing disorders, of which obstructive sleep apnea is the most common, yet many cases remain undiagnosed. Although overnight laboratory polysomnography, called type 1 recording, is the most effective diagnostic tool, it is expensive and time-consuming. To overcome these disadvantages, several portable home (type 3) recording devices have been developed. However, they do not measure brain activity (with EEG). This study presents a comparison between type 1 and type 3 recordings. All apnea, hypopnea, and RERA respiratory events were analyzed, as well as cerebral arousals (EEG arousals) and autonomic arousals. Autonomic arousals are defined by increased heart rate following a respiratory event. To enrich the analysis, the following respiratory outcome measures were included: 4% oxygen saturation index (ODI), apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), respiratory disturbance index with apneas + hypopneas + RERAs including EEG arousals (RDIe), and RDI including autonomic arousals scored as an increase of 5 bpm (RDIa5). The objective of this study was to determine the proportion of respiratory events associated with autonomic arousals and the impact on RDI detected with type 1 compared to type 3 recordings. The hypothesis is that respiratory events with autonomic arousals will have a greater impact on RDI using type 3 compared to type 1 recordings. This study included 72 subjects who underwent type 1 full polysomnography recording and 79 different subjects underwent type 3 ambulatory recording. The following analyses were performed: 1) percentage of events associated with only autonomic arousals in type 1 and type 3 studies; 2) frequency of migration from lower to higher AHI severity category when accounting events associated with only autonomic arousals; 3) Bland-Altman (B-A) for agreement between AHI, RDIe, and RDIa5 (type 1) and AHI and RDIa5 (type 3) and; 4) Pearson correlations and intraclass coefficient correlation (ICC) for agreement between AHI, RDIe and RDIa5 (type 1) and between AHI and RDIa5 (type 3). The use of the RDIa5 criterion increased the number of AHI scoring events by 49% for type 1 recordings and by 51% for type 3 recordings. These results show that autonomic arousals have a similar impact on RDI data using both type 3 and type 1 recordings. We conclude that RDIa5 is a suitable and reliable criterion for type 3 recordings.	RDI , sleep apnea , hypopneas , autonomic arousals , EEG arousals , AHI	en	16266.0
727	Identification of patients at risk of poor outcomes following hip or knee arthroplasty	Total joint arthroplasties (TJA) are commonly performed procedures for patients afflicted with hip and knee osteoarthritis (OA), and although successful, these surgeries can yield suboptimal results in a non-negligible proportion of patients. In order to improve surgical outcomes, patients at risk of poor results could be targeted with focused interventions. However, the evidence regarding the ability to identify which patients are at risk of poor outcomes is scarce. The objectives of this memoir were 1) to systematically review the literature of preoperative determinants of medium-term patient-reported pain and physical function after total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and 2) to develop clinical prediction models allowing the individual identification of patients at risk of poor outcomes following THA and TKA.   Systematic literature searches targeting studies evaluating all studied determinants of pain and function following THA and TKA were performed in four important databases until April 2015 and October 2014 respectively. Moreover, retrospective data from 265 patients having undergone THA at the Hôpital Maisonneuve-Rosemont from 2004 to 2010 was used to develop a preliminary prediction algorithm (PA) to identify patients at risk of poor surgical results. Finally, prospective data from 141 patients recruited at their inclusion on a preoperative waitlist for TKA in three hospitals in Québec City, Canada and followed 6 months postoperatively was used to develop a clinical prediction rule (CPR) to identify patients at risk of poor outcomes  Twenty-two (22) studies evaluating determinants of poor pain and function after THA with moderate-to-excellent methodological quality found that preoperative levels of pain and function, higher body mass index (BMI), greater medical comorbidities, worse general health, lower education level, lower OA radiographic severity and contralateral hip OA were consistently associated with poor THA outcomes. Thirty-four (34) studies evaluating determinants of poor pain and function after TKA with moderate-to-excellent methodological quality identified preoperative levels of pain and function, greater medical comorbidity, lower general health, greater levels of depression and/or anxiety, presence of back pain, greater pain catastrophizing and greater socioeconomic deprivation as consistently associated with worse outcomes.   A preliminary PA consisting of age, gender, BMI and three items of the preoperative Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) was able to identify patients at risk of suboptimal outcomes (worst quartile of the postoperative WOMAC score and perceiving their operated hip as artificial with minor or major limitations) on an average±standard deviation (SD) of 446±171 days after THA with a sensitivity of 75.0% (95% CI: 59.8 – 85.8), a specificity of 77.8% (95% CI: 71.9 – 82.7) and a positive likelihood ratio of 3.38 (98% CI: 2.49 – 4.57). A CPR consisting of five items of the preoperative WOMAC was able to predict the identity of patients awaiting TKA at the highest risk of poor outcomes (worst quintile of the postoperative WOMAC score) six months postoperatively with a sensitivity of 82.1 % (95% CI: 66.7 – 95.8), a specificity of 71.7% (95% CI: 62.8 – 79.8) and a positive likelihood ratio of 2.9 (95% CI: 1.8 – 4.7).   This memoir led to the identification of a list of determinants of pain and disability following TKA and THA with the highest level of evidence to date. Moreover, two clinical prediction models with good predictive capabilities were developed in order to allow the identification of patients at risk of poor outcomes following TKA and THA. These findings could help target the patients most likely to benefit from interventions aimed at diminishing their risk profile and improving surgical outcomes of hip or knee arthroplasties. External validation of these rules is warranted before clinical implementation.

728	L’exploitation d’un modèle de levure présentant une déficience de l’absorption des anthracyclines révèle qu’une protéine de Caenorhabditis elegans, OCT-1, est un transporteur fonctionnel d’anthracyclines	Anthracyclines such as doxorubicin (DOX) or daunorubicin (DNR) are used for treatment of a wide variety of cancers from lymphomas to breast cancer going through some leukemia. Still today, several people think that anthracyclines enter cells through passive diffusion, but these same people believe that the p-glycoprotein is involved in efflux of anthracyclines. We think that there is a transporter responsible for uptake of anthracyclines by cells and we want to develop a yeast model that would allow us to determine if protein from another eukaryote organism could be able to transport DOX into yeast cells. In order to do that, we gathered a group of mutants that are already known to be resistant to other positively charged molecules such as bleomycin and NaD1 and determined their ability to take up DOX. The simple mutants sam3Δ or dur3Δ showed no or slight decrease of DOX compared to parent. If the double mutant sam3Δdur3Δ showed rather significant uptake decrease, it is the agp2Δ that showed the grater decrease in DOX uptake as a resistance to its lethal effect. We used that mutant to express a protein from the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, OCT-1 (CeOCT-1). The results showed that this protein was able restore back the uptake of DOX that was compromised in agp2Δ and was also able to increase the sensitivity of the parent to its lethal effect. This leads us to believe that CeOCT-1 is functional transporter for DOX and goes against the dogma wherein anthracyclines enter the cells through passive diffusion.

729	Réussite et sélection au premier cycle universitaire au Québec : une analyse multiniveau	The objective of this thesis is to study the forms of academic selectivity and the factors of success in undergraduate programs in Quebec. Based on different writings on the subject, this thesis presents the various determinants of academic success and selectivity in Quebec university programs. From a methodological point of view, this study uses an administrative longitudinal database of the University of Montreal consisting of two generations of cohorts of undergraduate students. Empirically, we first analyzed the differentiation of undergraduate programs in selectivity to derive an aggregate indicator of selectivity. Then we studied the individual success factors by controlling the effect of the R score in a multilevel model.   The explanatory analysis brings up two main original findings on success factors; one on the R score and the other on the gender. The R score influences the chances of student success, but inversely with the level of selectivity. In programs where the entry selection process is the most demanding, graduation rates are the highest and the link between the R score and the final gradin is very low. Moreover, being a male tends to reduce the chances of success rate, but this negative effect disappears when the R score and the program are both considered in a multilevel model. If female students do better at the undergraduate level, it is mainly because they previously had better school performance and that they are not in the same programs as their male counterparts.

730	Entre contestation et résignation : l’expérience de profilage racial de jeunes racisés ayant reçu des constats d’infraction dans le cadre du contrôle de l’occupation de l’espace public montréalais	This memoir explores the real-life experience and the construction of the experience of racialized youths who have received statements of offense for having occupied the Montreal public space.  Using the Sociology of experience theorized by Dubet (1994), the profile and the living conditions, the presence in public areas, the reasons and nature of the statements of offense, the strategies implemented for racial profiling along with its consequences on the racialized youths all must be apprehended. Based on a qualitative perspective, the research method was founded on 10 semi-structured interviews where 9 young men and 1 one young lady  between the ages of 18 and 30 who have had encounters with the police concerning the control of the public space in Montreal. Essentially based on the mixed approach of Miles and Huberman (2003), the corpus analyze helped to understand heterogeneity of the experience of racially profiled youths questioned.  It was possible to distinguish two types of racial profiling experience: the protesters and the resigned.  If the interactions with law enforcement create treatments that are perceived to be discriminatory, the experience is constructed according to the nature of the interaction, the maturity level and the age group of the youths and comes in submission or contest strategies. The results of the research demonstrate otherwise the relevance of the youth's accompaniment at the level of realization of their rights and the protestation of the received infractions.	discrimination raciale , intervention sociale , racialized youths , racial profiling , sociology of experience , public space , typology , racial discrimination , social intervention , advocacy	en	16228.0
731	La construction des attitudes envers les Roms : le cas français	Representing between 10 and 12 million individuals in Europe, the Roma population faces discrimination and social exclusion. 40% of Europeans refuse to have Roma as their neighbors, while 70% of them do not even have direct contact with them in their lives. Based on these observations, this study analyses how attitudes towards Roma are constructed. I propose to investigate this mechanism in two similar environments, but where local integration policies towards Roma diverge, making the conditions of intergroup contact differ. The analysis is premised on two scientific assumptions: that the integration of migrants is a local public policy issue; and that intergroup contact structures attitudes between majority and minority cultures. Thus, from semi-structured interviews in the French communes of La Courneuve and Ivry-sur-Seine, I empirically test four dominant theories in the field of intergroup relations: contact theory, the halo effect, the impact of local immigrants integration policies, and media influence.

732	Économie comportementale : retrouve-t-on un effet d’ancrage dans la LNH ?	Economic analysis, by its nature, involves observing, qualifying and quantifying economic data with the ultimate goal of making forecasts. In this masters thesis, I am interested in factors that could bias a forecaster's behavior – with special focus on phenomena, like the anchoring effect, that have been proposed in behavioral economics. At a fundamental level, the anchoring effect states that an agent's ability to accurately forecast may be affected by placing unwarranted emphasis on certain economic variables. To study this effect, I analyze how the salaries of National Hockey League (NHL) players are determined by the players' characteristics and past performance. From the results, it would appear that NHL general managers are generally sensible and rational when it comes to using historical data to make decisions about player salaries. However, there is a persistent anomaly regarding the draft position of a player. Although one would not expect the draft position to be very important after eight years of experience in the NHL, the analysis shows that it is remains a significant determinant of player salary. Behavioral economics and more specifically, the anchoring effect, helps explain why this might be so.

733	Validation de l’échelle de mesure de la conscience de l’environnement d’affaires	Employee business awareness is defined as individual nonmanagerial employee realization, perception or knowledge of the employing organization’s business environment as demonstrated when involved in decision making or problem solving that affects the business. This study delineates the context of this construct, applies accepted scale development procedures, and provides construct and nomological validity evidence supporting the developed measure. The initial set of items for the measurement scale was generated from interviews conducted with employees in participatory work settings (Gauvreau-Jean, 2008). The initial 40-item scale was then tested with a sample of 508 workers within a manufacturing company. Scale reduction resulted in a scale covering four dimensions of the construct. Its content adequacy was then challenged by two focus groups and two expert assessments (Lessard, 2014).  Finally, the construct and nomological validity of the modified scale (which included 24 items) was tested with 330 front-line employees from four companies. The initial four-dimensional structure was supported, scale and factor reliabilities were high, and hypotheses relating employee business awareness to work characteristics, supervisor-rated contextual performance and affective organizational commitment were supported. The development of the 24-item employee business awareness scales may illuminate questions relating to employee participation and organizational effectiveness. Another survey completed by supervisors (n=43) tested the extra role performance of the frontline employees.	employee business awareness , scale development , validity , decision-making , autonomy , information processing , contextual performance , organizational commitment	en	16207.0
734	Hyperactivations frontales en mémoire de travail dans le trouble cognitif léger	Recent studies have shown greater task-related activation in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) compared to healthy older adults. It has been suggested that these hyperactivations reflect compensatory processes of brain plasticity in the early phase of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Functional compensation processes could emerge in response to a loss of structural integrity in brain regions typically required for the task. In this masters dissertation, I examined this hypothesis in MCI using a working memory task that incorporated a parametrical variation of difficulty level as well as functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Multiple regression analyses were used to identify areas of the brain in MCI in which functional activation varied as a function of neural injury as measured by hippocampal volume. Parameter estimates from these areas were then extracted and used for further correlational analyses with performance and structural volumes. Results indicate that MCI participants with high neural injury hyperactivated a subset of regions in the right frontal lobe. Furthermore, the level of activation was negatively correlated with the volume of frontal and parietal regions. These results indicate the presence of compensatory hyperactivations associated with a working memory task in persons with MCI.

735	La notion de l’explosion de la coopération et ses implications chez Kim Sterelny	The concept of cooperation is often used in the field of ethics and of politics to illustrate and understand the alignment of associative behaviors between human beings. In connection with this concept, our research will concern the first question to know if Kim Sterelny (2003) manages to produce a theoretical model allowing him to explain the origins and mechanisms of the human cooperation. Our research also concerns the second question of knowing if he manages to use this model to counter the massive modularity thesis. As such, this work will deal successively with the subjects of the problem of cooperation, of the theory of group selection, of the ecological trigger of hominid cooperation, of the notions of coalition, of enforcement and of commitment and finally of the massive modularity thesis. By the examination of these subjects, we wish to demonstrate that Sterelny manages only to supply a likely sketch of the origins and of the development of the human cooperation and that his criticism of the massive modularity thesis does not manage to counter the latter.

736	La réaction de Gorgias au Poème de Parménide : élaboration d'une rhétorique comme fuite de l'ontologie	The main objective of this master’s thesis is to closely examine the arguments that Gorgias develops in his Discourse on the not-being, in which he defends the impossibility of knowledge. There are three arguments in this discourse: a) nothing exists; b) even if something exists, nothing can be known about it; c) even if something can be known about it, knowledge about it can't be communicated to others. These arguments do not only attack the parmenidean’s thesis of correspondence (between mind and being); they also present themselves as a justification of the art of rhetoric. As a matter of fact, without knowledge, we are unable to establish a strong difference between truth and falsehood, and therefore we are left alone with our desires and interests. It is in such a context that rhetoric becomes, literally, the only legitimate art (or technique).	Gorgias , Rhetoric , Philosophy , Ontology	en	16194.0
737	La distribution des zéros des fonctions L	The Katz and Sarnak philosophy states that the distribution laws of zeros of $L$-functions follow the distribution laws of eigenvalues of random matrices. The zeros near the central point would reveal the symmetry type of our family of $L$-functions. Once the symmetry has been identified, it is conjectured that many statistics associated to the zeros would be predicted by the eigenvalues of the corresponding group of random matrices. This thesis will study the low-lying zeros of the family of elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}[i]$. Brumer computed the symmetry type of the family of elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$ in 1992. New challenges arising from this generalisation over number fields of his work will be revealed in this thesis.

738	Bidirectional Helmholtz Machines	Efficient unsupervised training and inference in deep generative models remains a challenging problem. One basic approach, called Helmholtz machine, involves training a top-down directed generative model together with a bottom-up auxiliary model used for approximate inference. Recent results indicate that better generative models can be obtained with better approximate inference procedures. Instead of improving the inference procedure, we here propose a new model, the bidirectional Helmholtz machine, which guarantees that the top-down and bottom-up distributions can efficiently invert each other. We achieve this by interpreting both the top-down and the bottom-up directed models as approximate inference distributions and by defining the model distribution to be the geometric mean of these two. We present a lower-bound for the likelihood of this model and we show that optimizing this bound regularizes the model so that the Bhattacharyya distance between the bottom-up and top-down approximate distributions is minimized. This approach results in state of the art generative models which prefer significantly deeper architectures while it allows for orders of magnitude more efficient approximate inference. Moreover, we introduce a  deep generative model for semi-supervised learning problems based on BiHM models.

740	L'hepcidine : un possible lien entre l'inflammation chronique et le métabolisme du fer dans les maladies rénales chroniques félines	The role of inflammation in the development and progression of feline chronic kidney disease  (CKD) is not well characterized. Hepcidin, a recently discovered acute phase protein (APP) contributes to the development of anemia in human patients with CKD. The objectives of our study was to compare plasma APP including hepcidin, iron status, and erythropoietin (EPO) concentrations between healthy and cats with naturally occurring CKD.   Eighteen healthy control cats and 38 cats with CKD were prospectively recruited. Complete physical examination along with hematology, biochemistry, plasma amyloid A (SAA), haptoglobine (HAP), EPO, iron, TIBC and ferritin were performed using routine laboratory analyses and commercially available feline ELISA-assays. Hepcidin-25 concentration was assessed with a human ELISA kit (DRG® Diagnostics).  We found that mean SAA and hepcidin concentration were significantly higher and mean total iron and TIBC were significantly lower in the CKD group (P < .05). There was a significant positive correlation between creatinine and APPs (SAA and hepcidin; P < .05). Increase in SAA and hepcidin was also significantly associated with decrease of TIBC and PCV in the CKD group. The 14 (37%) anaemic cats with CKD had significantly and lower iron, TIBC, consistent with functional iron deficiency (P < .05). There were no patients with an iron profile suggestive of a true iron deficiency. There was no association with survival.  In conclusion, our data suggest that feline CKD is a pro-inflammatory state, having significant impact on iron metabolism. With further validation, hepcidin may help better characterize these interactions.	Erythropoietin , Ferritin , anemia , Hepcidin	en	16145.0
741	Saint-Domingue Refugees and their Enslaved Property : Abolition Societies and the Enforcement of Gradual Emancipation in Pennsylvania and New York	This thesis explores the role of abolition societies in the enforcement of gradual eman-cipation in the north of the United States in the late-eighteenth century. More specifically, it focuses on the refugees from Saint-Domingue who brought their slaves in the state of Penn-sylvania and New York, and how abolition societies adapted their strategies to cope with the massive arrival of hundreds of these refugees in the 1790s. The first section discusses the gradual end of slavery in the north following the American Revolution, starting with Pennsyl-vania in 1780, and the emergence of abolition societies, especially the Pennsylvania Abolition Society (PAS) and the New-York Manumission Society (NYMS). In addition, this section considers the strategies of anti-slavery activists to promote and protect gradual emancipation and limit the movement of slaves within and without their respective states. The second sec-tion presents a case study of Saint-Domingue refugees coming with their slaves and how they interacted with residual slavery in New York and Pennsylvania. It also illustrates how maneu-vers employed by West-Indian slave owners in order to keep their slaves often failed as a re-sult of the intervention of abolition societies.

742	La cinématographie-attraction à Montréal à la lumière de la législation (1896-1913)	Cinématographie-attraction / kine-attractography has for a long time been associated with the origins of cinema. But in 1978, an academic controversy created a rift in cinematic historiography and these works were subsequently deemed to be a separate object of study, one distinct from institutional cinema. This thesis will focus on kine-attractography in the setting of Montreal from the use of the Lumière Cinematograph projector in 1896 to the founding of the Quebec Board of Censorship in 1913. The legislative context surrounding these new forms of ‘amusement’ will be discussed (bills were modified or created to address legal questions). This thesis will investigate these events within the relevant historical, geographical and cinematographic contexts. It will then consider three aspects of kine-attractography that differ from those in cinema: manufacturing (which includes the way cinematic works were financed, shot and later modified), exhibition (the matter of where and how these works were shown) and reception (the ways these works were evaluated or judged). We will discuss how kine-attractography was initially overseen by diverse groups of people (from those who financed or shot the moving pictures, to the owners of ‘amusement’ theatres, to the policeman or fireman who was present at each projection), and then subsequently overseen by recognized institutions, government representatives included. We will explore the issues which accompanied its institutionalisation relative to these various groups by studying articles and ads in Montreal’s newspapers, legal texts, official pronouncements, diocese speeches, catalogues published by manufacturing companies, and the moving pictures themselves.	cinématographie-attraction , attractions , exhibition , catalogues , licences , kine-attractography , early cinema , institutionalization , moving pictures , amusement , manufacturing , exhibition , reception , legislation , film lecturer , the Sunday law , consumption	en	16134.0
743	Les relations interethniques dans la Grande Guerre ; regards sur le mythe du soldat canadien-français opprimé	The First World War inevitably brings back painful memories in the province of Quebec. Quebeckers have a negative recollection of the war, viewing themselves as victims. Events related to the Great War such as the conscription crisis, the Easter riots and the inhospitality expressed by the Canadian Forces towards French Canadians are emotionally-charged memories that have nurtured this conception. When writing about the war, Quebeckers depict themselves as the scapegoats of English Canadians and present this notion as a truth. Integrated in both the historiography and popular beliefs, the idea of the oppressed French Canadian has never been questioned. This thesis aims at re-examining this idea by surveying contemporary sources: the Anglophone press and testimonies from soldiers. Its objective is to reassess the attitude and perception of Canadian Anglophones towards French Canadians, and more broadly the nature of interethnic relationships in the army during World War I, both on the home front and on the battlefield. It presents a reinterpretation of the victimisation that is deeply ingrained in the remembrance Quebeckers have of the conflict.

744	Les grandes surfaces suivi de La logique du seuil ou la problématique de l’altérité dans Autoportraits de Marie Uguay et Nombreux seront nos ennemis de Geneviève Desrosiers	This memoir focuses on two poetry collections from Quebec: Marie Uguay’s “Autoportraits” and Geneviève Desrosiers’ “Nombreux seront nos ennemis”. These can be characterised as “intimist” as they bring to the forefront the poetical narrator’s close observations of his daily life. My two-part project includes a research on Uguay’s and Desrosiers’ view of “intimism” as well as a poetry collection inspired by their work. My research concentrates on the threshold’s logic and on the narrator’s troubled relationship with the various representations of alterity. In the two studied poetry collections, the “I” indeed occupies a reclusive position from which it does not have to face alterity.  The poems that form the second part of this project testify to the resourcefulness in which the narrator spreads out in order to avoid his humdrum existence. The monotony of daily life is seen as a trap or a form of imprisonment. Consequently, only a thin frontier separates dreams from reality in these poems. The contrast between the “I”’s actual positions and his fancied destinations plays a major role in the text’s aesthetic. Several wishes are laid upon the table, amongst them a new departure. The poems therefore express the narrator’s longing but attempt to avoid the dangers of a classic “intimism” which are an exaggerated sensitivity or narcissism.

745	La gouvernance métropolitaine du transport collectif dans la région montréalaise : le cas du SRB Pie-IX	Montreal talks to have a rapid bus service for ten years. In 2015, work to produce the first draft of the section called SRB Pie-IX just beginning. How to justify delays in carrying out several years while other cities get there in less than 3 years? Several elected officials and Montreal organizations denounce a problem of governance of public transit. It’s is not easy to grasp the significance of this concept so often invoked to justify, among others, the difficulties to realize metropolitan projects. Some point to the government's responsibility, others argue the poor distribution of roles and responsibilities or regrets too many players in the metropolitan area. Governance is a concept both blurred and complex that seeks to establish the conduct of public affairs like the management of metropolitan public transit. However, the transit system involves a multitude of stakeholders with conflicting interests. The 'good governance' would be to establish a fruitful collaboration that goes beyond the limits of institutionalized stakeholders to achieve metropolitan scale projects, such as the project SRB Pie-IX.

746	La face cachée de la dune : communautés fongiques du sol: dynamique, succession et interactions avec la végétation d’un écosystème dunaire côtier aux Îles de la Madeleine, Qc	Coastal dunes provide several key ecosystem services, such as erosion mitigation and protection of the littoral by forming a barrier against wind and wave action. These ecosystems also importantly contribute to water filtering, groundwater replenishment, maintenance of biodiversity, and have a cultural, aesthetic and recreational importance. Dune ecosystems are highly dynamic and characterized by stark ecological successional gradients. The sequence of plant communities along the gradient extends from upper beach to the foredune stabilized by pioneer species such as beach grass, which facilitates the establishment of other herbs, shrubs and eventually, trees. Plant growth and survival can be limited by environmental factors such as wind, salinity, drought and nutrient deficiency, and is therefore strongly linked to the presence of soil microorganisms. Soil fungi in particular are important plant symbionts and major regulators of organic matter decomposition, nutrient cycling and soil structure. Hence, they are key drivers of soil and vegetation dynamics, as well as important contributors to dune stabilisation. Still, the diversity and structure of soil fungal communities, as well as the mechanisms responsible for their ecological dynamic, remain incompletely understood.    In this thesis, I aimed to characterize fungal communities along a successional and edaphic gradient in a coastal dune in order to improve our understanding of soil dynamics in sand dunes ecosystems. I performed a comprehensive sampling of soils and aboveground vegetation at over 80 sites on a relic foredune plain. Soil fungi were characterized using high-throughput sequencing. A general description of soil fungal communities across dune zones was produced and, in addition to a taxonomic description, I assigned putative roles to all fungal genera to determine how variations in fungal community can be translated in functional changes. I recorded high level of fungal diversity (over 3400 operational taxonomic units) and described distinct communities along the successional and edaphic gradient. These results demonstrated the presence of taxonomically and functionally diverse communities across the dune sequence, including in the barren foredunes.  I also investigated the links between plant and fungal communities across the edaphic and successional gradient. These results showed a clear increase in plant species richness, as well as in the diversity of nutrient-acquisition strategies (belowground trait related to plant nutrition: arbuscular mycorrhizal, ectomycorrhizal, ericoid mycorrhizal, nitrogen-fixing or unspecialized). I also found a very strong correlation between aboveground vegetation and soil fungal communities, which both responded to soil physicochemical properties. Soil pH importantly shaped plant and fungal communities, and could act as an important environmental filter along this relic foredune plain. The coordinated changes in soil microbial and plant communities highlight the importance of aboveground-belowground linkages and of positive biotic interactions during ecological succession in nutrient-poor environments. Finally, I compared the ectomycorrhizal fungal communities associated with four co-occuring tree species in the forested zone of the relic foredune plain. High ectomycorrhizal fungal richness was observed across the four hosts, with a total of 200 ectomycorrhizal operational taxonomic units, mainly belonging to the Agaricomycetes. Network analysis did not detect modules (i.e. subgroups of interacting species), indicating a low level of specificity in these ectomycorrhizal associations. In addition, there were no differences in ectomycorrhizal diversity or community structure among the four tree species.  To conclude, I was able to describe diverse communities and distinct community structures across the dune sequence, for both plants and fungi.  Succession however seemed less pronounced in fungal communities compared to patterns observed in plants. These results fueled a reflection on the potential and perspectives, as well as the limitations, of high-throughput sequencing approaches in the field of microbial ecology.

747	Facteurs de risque de développement de troubles intériorisés : études en Imagerie par Résonance Magnétique structurelle	Several risk factors for the development of internalized disorders such as anxiety, depression, and bipolar disorders have been identified in the literature. The two most important risk factors include adversity during childhood (i.e. abuse, neglect and harsh parenting) and parental risk (i.e. the presence of an internalized disorder in one or both parents). These risk factors have been linked to anatomical changes in several brain structures, which are similar to those observed in internalized disorders. Thus, in the presence of these risk factors, anatomical abnormalities may predict the appearance of internalized disorders in asymptomatic individuals. In the few studies that have investigated the influence of these risk factors in a youth population, participants often had comorbidities and/or were medicated, which makes the observed anatomical changes difficult to interpret. This work has focused on these two risk factors (i.e. adversity during childhood, in the form of harsh parenting, and the parental risk) and their link with the anatomical cerebral substrates, in asymptomatic and un-medicated adolescents. A first study examined the link between harsh parenting, levels of anxiety symptoms, as measured longitudinally from birth, and neuroanatomical differences in adolescents (see Chapter 2). A second study examined the link between parental risk of developing anxiety disorders, and neuroanatomical differences in adolescents (see Chapter 3). A third study looked at the link between parental risk for developing depressive disorder or bipolar disorder, and neuroanatomical differences in adolescents (see Chapter 4). Results show differences in volume and/or cortical thickness of several key cerebral structures involved in emotional processing and regulation. This is the case of the prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, the amygdala, hippocampus and striatum. These results suggest that some neuroanatomical differences in internalized disorders may be present before the disorder emerges, and represent neuronal markers denoting the risk of developing the disorder. The theoretical implications and limitations of these three studies are discussed in Chapter 5.	FreeSurfer , Adversity , Parental risk , internalized disorder , Anxiety , FreeSurfer , MRI	en	16055.0
748	Imagerie Musicale Involontaire : caractéristiques phénoménologiques et mnésiques	Involuntary Musical Imagery (INMI) is a widely prevalent musical phenomenon. It can be defined as a type of musical mental imagery that becomes accessible to consciousness without any effort or intent and that is not pathological. The best known form of INMI is the “earworm”, which usually presents as a short excerpt of music running repetitively through one’s mind and which is difficult to get rid of. The goal of the present thesis is to build a better understanding of the cognitive mechanisms at play, because, although the phenomenon is discussed abundantly in the popular literature and media, the scientific inquiries are recent and an integrated model has yet to be proposed. In the first study, experimental induction was attempted and the characteristics of INMI episodes’ mental images were assessed. In the laboratory, catchy songs (versus proverbs) were presented repeatedly to participants who had to sing them back (or reproduce the proverbs’ prosody) as accurately as possible. Participants then left for four days with a recording device, singing their INMI episodes as similarly as possible to their mental imagery and describing their timbre. The experiment was repeated two weeks later. Twelve out of the eighteen participants in the experimental group reported INMI episodes of the induced songs, which confirms the effectiveness of the induction procedure. The sung productions were then analyzed for key and tempo and were compared to the original versions. Produced tempi and, to a smaller extent in the case of non-musicians, keys were close to the originals, for both the induced and other INMI episodes. Described timbre was generally a simplified version of the original (one instrument and/or voice).  Three studies then addressed the link between INMI potential and memorability. In a preliminary study, 150 francophone hit songs were evaluated online by 164 participants, as to their familiarity, liking and INMI potential. They were then divided into high and low INMI potential song groups and were used as stimuli in a typical free recall/recognition task, first with Francophones (for whom the songs were familiar) and then with non-Francophones (for whom the songs were unfamiliar). Globally, high INMI potential songs were better recalled and recognized than low INMI potential songs. A final study investigated the impact on the previous results of the timbre variability between songs, by asking a single female singer to make vocal recordings of the stimuli and repeating the experiment. The previously observed difference between high and low INMI potential songs on the recognition task disappeared, suggesting that timbre plays an important role in INMI potential. In conclusion, we suggest that mental phenomena and cognitive mechanisms applying to other involuntary thoughts and memories can also apply to INMI. Depending on the context, memory retrieval of the songs can happen as the result of short-term memory rehearsal, short and long-term priming or cuing from stimuli in the environment or thoughts. The biggest difference between INMI and other types of involuntary memories is repetition. We suggest that the nature of music, which is defined by repetition at a micro- and macro-structural level, explains this discrepancy.

749	Le sommeil comme marqueur du déclin cognitif dans la maladie de Parkinson	Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized principally by its motor symptoms. However, non motor symptoms are frequent in PD and are associated with a poorer prognosis; these include sleep disorders and cognitive impairments. Indeed, prospective studies have shown that over a 10 year period, up to 90% of PD patients will develop dementia. Therefore, identifying clinical risk factors or markers of dementia in PD is essential, notably for early diagnosis, but also to facilitate the development of preventive therapeutic approaches. There is increasing evidence for a relationship between sleep and cognition in normal and pathological aging. Electroencephalographic (EEG) events during non rapid eye movement (N REM), including sleep spindles and slow waves (SW), may contribute to brain plasticity, learning, and memory processes. However, very few studies have investigated the relationships between sleep changes and cognitive decline in PD. The objective of this thesis is to examine whether specific sleep EEG markers are associated with increased likelihood of developing dementia on prospective follow up assessment in PD patients. The first study evaluated baseline N REM sleep SW and spindle characteristics in PD patients according to their cognitive status (presence or absence of dementia) at follow up (mean 4,5 years), along with a group of healthy controls. Compared to PD patients who remained dementia free and controls, PD patients who developed dementia at follow up showed lower baseline spindle density, amplitude, and frequency. Lower spindle amplitude in posterior cortical regions was associated with poorer visuospatial abilities in demented PD patients. SW amplitude was lower in both PD groups at baseline, regardless of dementia status at follow up. The second study examined EEG spectral markers of dementia across three states of consciousness (N REM sleep, REM sleep, and wakefulness) in PD using power spectral analysis. PD patients who developed dementia at follow up showed lower N REM sleep sigma power in parietal areas compared to both PD patients who remained dementia free and controls. During REM sleep, PD patients who converted to dementia showed, at baseline, higher power in delta and theta bands and a higher EEG slowing ratio (increased slow to fast frequencies ratio) compared to PD patients who remained dementia free and controls. In both PD groups, higher slowing ratios in temporal and occipital regions during REM sleep were associated with poor performance on visuospatial tests. Finally, PD patients who later developed dementia showed lower dominant occipital frequency as well as higher delta and slowing ratio during wakefulness compared to PD patients who remained dementia free and controls. This thesis suggests that specific EEG alterations during sleep and wakefulness, mainly in posterior cortical regions, can identify PD patients who will later develop dementia. Sleep spindle activity, as well as REM sleep and wake EEG slowing, could thus serve as additional markers of cognitive decline in PD.

750	Evaluation use within a humanitarian non-governmental organization’s health care user-fee exemption program in West Africa	Evaluation of humanitarian action (EHA) is increasingly deployed as a means to enhance accountability, transparency, and efficiency of humanitarian programs aimed at reducing health inequities and promoting global health. EHA has become a vital tool for program stakeholders, funding agencies, and policy-makers seeking to render practice and decision-making more evidence-based. However, considerable uncertainty remains about evaluation use (EU), as EHA is frequently conducted without being used. Moreover, conditions that influence EU vary across contexts and their applicability in humanitarian non-governmental organizations (NGOs) remains unclear. Program evaluators, stakeholders, and policy-makers in humanitarian contexts have little guidance to support long-term EU, given that few studies have documented EU and its conditions over time. The aim of the present qualitative thesis is to shed light on these issues by documenting EU and the conditions influencing it over a 29-month period within an evaluation strategy embedded into a humanitarian NGO’s health care user fee exemption program. To facilitate access to care, the exemption program subsidized the health service fees of mothers, children under five, and indigents in health districts of Niger and Burkina Faso—West African Sahel regions where food crises and poverty have engendered high rates of malnutrition, morbidity, and mortality. Initial evaluation of the exemption program in Niger led to development of the evaluation strategy subsequently integrated into the same program developed in 2008 in Burkina Faso. The thesis consists of three articles. The first presents an evaluability assessment (EA), a preliminary step undertaken to determine whether an EU evaluation was feasible. Results showed the evaluation strategy’s logic was coherent and plausible, data was accessible, and evaluation strategy stakeholders deemed an EU study to be useful. The second article documents how stakeholders engaged in EU and how it served them and advanced the NGO’s mission. Results showed that stakeholders used findings instrumentally, conceptually, and persuasively, but used evaluation processes only instrumentally and conceptually. The third article identifies the conditions stakeholders saw as influencing EU over time. Key influential conditions were users’ attitudes toward evaluation, stakeholders’ interactions and communications, and evaluators’ skill in producing and sharing evaluation-based knowledge tailored to users’ needs. This thesis furthers knowledge on EU in the humanitarian action context and provides practical recommendations for stakeholders of NGOs.

751	Justice envers les enfants et légitimité politique en éducation	Few deny that children have fundamental interests of their own and that they are the direct subjects of considerations of justice. Yet, the work of the most influential theorists of justice contains no systematic discussion of the moral and political status of children. My dissertation contributes to filling this important gap by considering four main questions. (1) What does the liberal state owe children as a matter of basic justice? (2) Which types of educational policies are morally legitimate? (3) To what extent (if at all) is it morally permissible for parents to deliberately shape their children’s values? (4) What criteria should govern the teaching of controversial moral issues?   This thesis consists of four articles. The first, “Political Liberalism and Children’s Education”, examines the questions of the grounds and implications of political liberals’ often-undefended claim that the state should refrain from adopting educational policies designed to promote a particular conception of the good life. I defend the thesis that the ground for this commitment is solely parent-centric, and not children-centric. Against the charge that political liberalism is thus ‘bad for children’, I argue that political liberals have the resources to advance a robust agenda of political interventions in children’s education.   The second article, “On the Permissibility of Shaping Children’s Values”, considers the question of whether parents have a right to enroll their children into a comprehensive doctrine and, as such, to deliberately shape their children’s worldview. The paper expands and amends the case against the anti-perfectionist account of legitimate childrearing and develops a novel argument in favor of the permissibility of comprehensive enrolment. It also proposes a crucial and as yet overlooked distinction between comprehensive enrolment and comprehensive education.   The third article, “Common Education and the Practice of Liberal Neutrality: The Loyola High School Case”, focuses on the legitimacy of specific educational policies. I defend three main claims. First, it is in principle legitimate for the liberal state to favor a strong common schooling system. Second, the widespread view according to which neutrality as an educational approach is both impossible and undesirable is based on an implausible understanding of liberal neutrality. Third, there are nonetheless strong reasons, including reasons of justice for children, to accommodate most religious parents and schools.   The fourth article, “Which Moral Issues Should be Taught as Controversial?”, challenges the dominant ‘epistemic criterion’ for determining what issues should be taught ‘as controversial’ in schools and, more generally, the way in which the philosophical debate on this topic has been framed in recent years, both from a substantive and a methodological point of view. I defend an alternative way of approaching the issue, which is sensitive to the plurality of educational aims and to a larger set of moral considerations that, I argue, are essential to good normative policy analysis.

752	Algorithmique et complexité des systèmes à compteurs	One fundamental aspect of computer systems, and in particular of critical systems, is the ability to run simultaneously many processes sharing resources. Such concurrent systems only work correctly when their behaviours are independent of any execution ordering. For this reason, it is particularly difficult to ensure the correctness of concurrent systems.  In this thesis, we study formal verification, an algorithmic approach to the verification of concurrent systems based on mathematical modeling. We consider two of the most prominent models, Petri nets and vector addition systems, and their usual verification problems considered in the literature.  We show that the reachability problem for vector addition systems (with states) restricted to two counters is PSPACE-complete, that is, it is complete for the class of problems solvable with a polynomial amount of memory. Hence, we establish the precise computational complexity of this problem, left open for more than thirty years.  We develop a new approach to the coverability problem for Petri nets which is primarily based on applying forward coverability in continuous Petri nets as a pruning criterion inside a backward coverability framework. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by implementing it in a tool named QCover.  We complement these results with a study of well-structured transition systems which form a general abstraction of vector addition systems and Petri nets. We consider infinitely branching well-structured transition systems, a class that includes Petri nets with special transitions that may consume or produce arbitrarily many tokens. We develop mathematical tools in order to study these systems and we delineate the decidability frontier for the termination, boundedness, maintainability and coverability problems.	formal verification , computational complexity , algorithmics , Petri nets , vector addition systems , well-structured transition systems , reachability problem , coverability problem , infinite branching	en	16025.0
753	Faulkner revisited : narrating property, race, gender and history in William Faulkner's Go Down, Moses, Toni Morrison's Song of Solomon and Gloria Naylor's Mama Day	My thesis explores the formation of the subject in the novels of Faulkner’s Go Down, Moses, Toni Morrison’s Song of Solomon, and Gloria Naylor’s Mama Day. I attach the concept of property in terms of how male protagonists are obsessed with materialistic ownership and with the subordination of women who, as properties, consolidate their manhood. The three novelists despite their racial, gendered, and literary differences share the view that identity and truth are mere social and cultural constructs. I incorporate the work of Judith Butler and other poststructuralist figures, who see identity as a matter of performance rather than a natural entity.  My thesis explores the theme of freedom, which I attached to the ways characters use their bodies either to confine or to emancipate themselves from the restricting world of race, class, and gender. The three novelists deconstruct any system of belief that promulgates the objectivity of truth in historical documents. History in the three novels, as with the protagonists, perception of identity, remains a social construct laden with distortions to serve particular political or ideological agendas. My thesis gives voice to African American female characters who are associated with love and racial and gender resistance. They become the reservoirs of the African American legacy in terms of their association with the oral and intuitionist mode of knowing, which subverts the male characters’ obsession with property and with the mainstream empiricist world. In this dissertation, I use the concept of hybridity as a literary and theoretical devise that African-American writers employ. In effect, I embark on the postcolonial studies of Henry Louise Gates, Paul Gilroy, W. E. B Du Bois, James Clifford, and Arjun Appadurai in order to reflect upon the fluidity of Morrison’s and Naylor’s works. I show how these two novelists subvert Faulkner’s essentialist perception of truth, and of racial and gendered identity. They associate the myth of the Flying African with the notion of hybridity by making their male protagonists criss-cross Northern and Southern regions.  I refer to Mae Gwendolyn  Henderson’s article on “Speaking in Tongues” in my analysis of how Naylor subverts the patriarchal text of both Faulkner and Morrison in embarking on a more feminine version of the flying African, which she relates to an ex-slave, Sapphira Wade, a volatile female character who resists fixed claim over her story and identity. In dealing with the concept of hybridity, I show that Naylor rewrites both authors’ South by making Willow Springs a more fluid space, an assumption that unsettles the scores of critics who associate the island with authenticity and exclusive rootedness.

754	Pratiquer l’égalité entre les femmes et les hommes au sein des organisations : étude de cas des ONG au Mali	This thesis analyzes practices with regard to equality between women and men within eight Malian non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that have received Canadian funding. Official development assistance has been radically transformed since the 1950s, and one of these transformations has been the important role played by NGOs since the beginning of 1990s, following the implementation of structural adjustment policies and the end of the state’s monopoly on public aid for development projects. The changed role of NGOs in official development assistance has created dependency and these donors impose conditions. Our results show that the donors require efforts to foster gender equality for the beneficiaries of the programs, but paradoxically do not require that NGOs do the same in their personnel practices. By analyzing the composition of the staff of eight Malian NGOs, our results show that 34 % of the staff are women, while 66 % are men. These results demonstrate that there is a significant gender imbalance. However a closer analysis shows that equality between women and men in the organization and management of staff differs from one NGO to another. The practices are highly dependent on the willingness as well as the values of the managers. Our research brought out several explanations for this disparity in the level of women’s employment. The reasons often mentioned were: 1) the need for competent staff; 2) family-work balance; 3) the sociocultural context; 4) the interpretation of the Muslim religion about the place of women in society. In fact, our results showed that under the influence of donors, NGOs have become professionalized; our analyses also show that the impact of professionalization is different on women and men and it has been made at the expense of women. Some managers, both male and female, prefer to recruit men because they believe the men are more competent. Our results confirm the theory of the glass ceiling which highlights the fact that women have difficulty accessing positions of responsibility. Our results also showed that in Mali both the sociocultural context and religion play major roles in social relationships, and especially in women’s place in society.

755	Rôles de deux corécepteurs impliqués dans le maintien des cellules T mémoires CD8+ et la maturation des cellules dendritiques	Antigen presentation by dendritic cells induces the proliferation and differentiation of naïve T lymphocytes into effector and memory T lymphocytes. This recognition is due to the interaction of the T cell receptor (TCR) with the cognate peptide-MHC complex presented on the surface of dendritic cells. However, additional signals are required from co-receptors on both cell types to ensure optimal T cell activation. Following the elimination of the antigen, most of the effector T cells will die with a small population of T cells remaining that will continue to differentiate into memory T cells which protect the organism against reinfection. The signals that control the maintenance of memory T cells are poorly understood. To dissect the role of the 4-1BB costimulatory molecules in the maintenance of CD8 memory T cells, we hypothesized that the phosphorylation state of the TRAF1 adaptor protein that binds to 4-1BB, modulates the maintenance of CD8 memory T lymphocytes. Thus, we have demonstrated by mass spectrometry that TRAF1 preferentially associates with TBK1 when it is not phosphorylated. We also have shown that the presence of TRAF1 is required to stabilize the interaction between TBK1 and 4-1BB after T cell activation. Furthermore, OT-I TRAF1-/- CD8 T cells reconstituted with a phospho-deficient TRAF1 mutant (S139A) and differentiated into memory CD8 T cells induced the activation of the NF-ĸB signaling pathway, in contrast to cells expressing a phospho-mimetic form of TRAF1 (S139D). Together, these results highlight the importance of the phosphorylation state of TRAF1 downstream of 4-1BB in T cells. In the second part, we evaluated the role of the neuropilin 1 coreceptor in the maturation of dendritic cells. To this end, we hypothesized that the interactions of neuropilin-1 with its ligands contribute to the function of dendritic cells. We have demonstrated that the absence of neuropilin-1 has no effect on the maturation of dendritic cells in the presence of LPS. However, the presence of VEGF (a neuropilin-1 ligand) inhibits the maturation of dendritic cells derived from the bone marrow. Our study further demonstrated that VEGF inhibits the expression of costimulatory molecules, the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and TLR4 signaling pathways mainly MAP Kinase and NF-ĸB. Contrary to the results with wild-type cells, VEGF is not able to affect maturation, cytokine secretion and TLR4 signaling in NRP1-Lyz dendritic cells when neuropilin-1 is deleted. Thus, our results demonstrated that VEGF inhibits the maturation of dendritic cells in a NRP1-dependent manner. Finally, analysis of neuropilin 1 partners shows that NRP1, VEGF and TLR4 are found in the same complex. Our results show that VEGF, in the presence of neuropilin-1 is able to interact with TLR4 and inhibit the maturation of dendritic cells. However, in the absence of the neuropiline1, VEGF is not able to recruit TLR4 to reduce the expression of costimulatory molecules. These studies on coreceptors could be important in the development of novel vaccine therapies.	TRAF1 , Nrp1 , T cells , dendritic cells , coreceptor	en	15991.0
756	Exploration génétique de l'hypothyroïdie congénitale par dysgénésie thyroïdienne	Congenital hypothyroidism by thyroid dysgenesis (CHTD) is a common disorder with prevalence at birth of 1 in 4000 live births. CHTD is the consequence of a failure of embryonic thyroid to differentiate or to migrate to its anatomical location (front of the neck), which leads to a total lack of thyroid (athyreosis) or an ectopic thyroid (lingual or sublingual). The most common category is ectopic thyroid diagnosis (up 85%). Most cases of CHTD have no known cause, but are associated with severe deficiency of thyroid hormones (hypothyroidism). The clinical diagnosis of hypothyroidism is usually possible only when permanent brain damage is already present. On the other hand, biochemical screening on the second day of life allows initiating replacement therapy from the second week of life, pre-empting severe intellectual deficit associated with the congenital hypothyroidism. Even with early treatment (an average of 9 days), loss of IQ, which is not exclusively due to the severity of hypothyroidism, can still be observed. Molecular markers may identify patients at risk for intellectual deficit (by e.g., genes involved in neuronal migration and the thyroid during development). These patients might benefit from early intervention to stimulate their neurocognitive development. Cases of CHTD are mainly non-syndromic and sporadic (in 98% of cases, there is no other affected in the family), have a discordant rate of 92% in monozygotic twins, and a female and ethnic (Caucasian) dominance. Germline mutations in thyroid-related transcription factors have been identified in only 3% of patients with sporadic CHTD, and linkage analysis has excluded these genes in rare multiplex families with CHTD. In addition, non-penetrating mutations among close relatives (for Nkx2.5 gene) suggest that modifying genes as germline variants de novo copy number (CNV) and / or somatic mutations are associated with CHTD. To respond to this research questions, we used two different approaches: 1) a candidate gene approach studying FOXE1, the only gene involved in ectopic thyroid in the mouse model and, 2) an approach using next generation sequencing techniques (NGS) to find genetic variants that could explain this pathology using a cohort of mostly sporadic CHTD. Variants and genes discovered by these two different approaches have been validated and their functional impact on the thyroid gland was evaluated by several experiments.

757	Influence of frequent nightmares on REM sleep-dependent emotional memory processing	Existing literature suggests that REM sleep plays a role in the associative integration of emotional memory, and that attributes of dreams during REM sleep, particularly their bizarre and emotional nature, either reflect or even influence this associative and emotional function. The consequence of frequent nightmares on this process is unknown, although, the experience of a nightmare suggests an associative restriction imposed by intense negative emotion, consistent with research showing that negative affect tends to restrict cognitive flexibility in wake. This is consistent with existing theories of nightmare function, largely purporting that nightmares reflect temporary failures in emotion regulation.  The first objective of the thesis was to conceptually replicate prior research portraying REM sleep as enabling increased associative access to emotional memory. The use of a daytime nap allowed us to assess the effects of REM sleep, compared to both NREM sleep and waking, on participant performance on a novel task measuring Associational Breadth (AB). Results showed that only those subjects awakened from REM sleep responded with atypical emotional word associations, suggesting that REM is specific in its capacity to broadly integrate emotional memory traces (article 1). Further, REM dream reports were more bizarre than both NREM dreams and waking daydreams, and more emotionally intense than NREM dreams; these attributes are thought to reflect the hyper-associative and emotional nature of REM sleep (article 2).  The second objective was to clarify whether and how REM sleep-dependent emotional memory processing is altered in frequent nightmares sufferers. Using a similar nap protocol, our results showed that NM participants had higher baseline AB in response to emotional cue-words, contrary to predictions, but nonetheless corresponding with anecdotal reports of heightened creativity. Following REM sleep, both NM and CTL groups showed similar changes in associative access to emotional cue-words, with negative AB being restricted and positive AB being broadened; one week later, the NM group alone maintained this altered pattern of emotional semantic access (article 3). This finding suggests that, over time, nightmares may interfere with REM sleep-dependent emotional memory integration. Regarding imagery, the NM participants had heightened bizarreness, and positive, but not negative, imagery in their daydreams, but not their dreams (article 4), mirroring our AB finding that the NM group had significantly higher emotional associativity in wake, although patterns of associativity following a REM sleep nap did not differ between groups. Overall, findings support a role of REM sleep in the associative integration of emotional memory. However, our findings regarding nightmare sufferers are not entirely consistent with views that nightmares are associated with dysfunctional emotional memory processing. Although they did show a prolonged priming effect suggestive of inadequate emotion regulation, they also showed heightened semantic associativity and vivid positive imagery in wake. We therefore propose a novel Environmental Sensitivity framework for the study of nightmare sufferers, claiming that an increased sensitivity to a range of environmental contexts, not only negative contexts, underlies the unique symptoms and imaginative richness seen in frequent nightmare sufferers. Although further empirical research exploring potentially adaptive traits or sensitivity to positive contexts in nightmare sufferers is needed, the possibility that these individuals may benefit especially from supportive environments, and may have heightened creativity and semantic associativity, is particularly relevant when considering prognosis and treatment approaches.

758	Obligation des États de coopérer en droit international des cours d’eau transfrontaliers :  état du droit et étude du cas Chinois	The principle of international cooperation has been one of the cornerstones of international law. However, the existence of an obligation to cooperate in international law is still controversial. Like air, water is fundamental to life. As a flowing resource, the use of water in any one place is affected by its use in other places. It always marks the interdependence between human beings. The New York Convention includes expressly a general obligation to cooperate which is one of the three fundamental principles. We should then look into the practices of the states in order to find out the answer to one question : what obligation to cooperate needs to be imposed ? To answer this question, we start with a positive study of the normative content of the obligation to cooperate.  We notice that the incorporation of the obligation to cooperate in the principle of sovereignty is a clear trend in international law which has already evolved from the law of coexistence to the law of cooperation. If the law of coexistence is composed of the obligations of non facere, then the law of cooperation is mainly about the positive obligations of facere, among which, the obligation to cooperate is probably the most important one. However, there is no panacea for the management of transboundary rivers in the world, every basin having its own cooperative regime. In order to evaluate the depth and breadth of the cooperative regimes, we study five parameters : the scope, the substantive rules, the procedural rules, the institutional arrangements and the dispute settlement mechanisms. Four models of cooperation are thus identified : the consultative mechanism (Indus River Basin), the communicative mechanism (Mekong River Basin), the coordinative mechanism (Rhine River Basin) and the joint action mechanism ( Senegal River Basin).   As the most important developing upstream country in the world, China has been criticized for its unilateral approach in the development of transboudary waters. However, we can not neither ignore its recent efforts in establishing the cooperation with its neighbors. An analysis of China’s practice serves not only to reveal its interpretation of the general obligation to cooperate, but also helps us to better understand different aspects of this obligation to cooperate in international law. In order to explain the reasons behind the Chinese choice of mode of cooperation, then we introduce a constructivist analysis which is more explanatory than descriptive. We argue that the identities of China determine its choice of cooperation in the field of transboudary waters.   Our study comes to the conclusion that despite the fact that most of the concerned rules are genarally accepted by the international community, the obligation to cooperate is still coming into being in customary international law. The modes of application of the obligation to cooperate are actually the result of the evolving process of social construction which varies according to cultural, historic or economic differences, in other words, according to the identities of states. Mainly due to its different view of sovereignty, China has adopted a consultative mechanisme of cooperation in its own style. However, we have reason to expect that China, with the evolution of his identities as a rising superpower in the world, rather than searching for a hegemonic control and adopting a unilateral strategy in the utilization of transboundary waters, would opt for a more cooperative and participative strategy in the near future.

759	Les contrats et les droits fondamentaux : perspective franco-québécoise	The meeting of contract law with fundamental rights is at the center of numerous contemporary legal debates, notably with regard to the place of the religious in society, the commodification of the body, or respect for human dignity. This encounter has prodded a reflection from numerous jurists. The aim of this study is to bring a modest contribution to the discussion, through a comparison of French and Québec law. The exigencies of respect for fundamental rights is evolving in the two legal systems. Because fundamental rights instruments play a larger role in our laws, their authority in contractual matters is becoming ineludible. Indeed, it should be noted that fundamental rights have not reached their full extent in this field. They emerge within contracts, because from revisiting to re-writing, Québec and French contract law are increasingly influenced by the obligation to comply with fundamental rights.  However, this evolution in France and in Quebec is accompanied by a requirement that fundamental rights be allowed social admission. From that point on, we can see power over fundamental rights being asserted within contacts, that power evolving from medical contracts to work contracts towards becoming inescapable for their enforcement. Yet, the danger inherent in such power over fundamental rights calls for serious deliberations on the limits that must be set upon it, both with regard to the dignity of the human person, and in relation to its legitimacy.	contracts , fundamentals rights , French Civil Code , Civil Code of Quebec , European Convention on Human Rights , Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen , Canadian Charter of rights and freedoms , Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms , Dignity of the human Person	en	15969.0
760	The carrier’s exemption from liability in the Hague, Hamburg and Rotterdam Rules : an examination from the perspectives of fairness and clarity	The international trade is usually connected with the carriage of goods by sea. The campaign in pursuit of uniform rules governing such carriage was launched in the late nineteenth century and has led to the emergence of the Hague Rules, the Hamburg Rules and the Rotterdam Rules. The carrier’s entitlement to exemption from liability, which triggered much controversy contributing to the development of the international shipping rules, has been regulated in three different ways in the aforementioned three Rules. The principal question addressed in the present thesis is whether they are sufficiently satisfactory. Another question, which is to be dealt with if none of them proves to be the case, is what a better way could be like. Two criteria, namely fairness and clarity, have been chosen in answer to the aforesaid questions. The research contained in the present thesis aims to give a thorough evaluation of the existing regimes regarding the carrier’s exemption from liability and some improvement suggestions in this respect.	carrier’s exemption from liability , the Hague Rules , the Hamburg Rules , the Rotterdam Rules , fairness , clarity	en	15968.0
761	Molecular characterization of extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistance in Escherichia coli in pigs on-farm and from clinical cases throughout Quebec, Canada during 16 years	Development of multidrug resistance in Escherichia coli is an important problem in animal and human medicine. Further, emergence and spread of determinants for resistance to third generation extended-spectrum cephalosporins (ESCs) such as the critically important cephalosporins in human medicine (e.g. ceftriaxone and ceftiofur) among isolates is a public health concern. Thus, the objectives of the present thesis were (1) to study the dynamic of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) phenotypes as well as virulence and AMR gene profiles in E. coli from pigs receiving a feed medicated with chlortetracycline and penicillin G following weaning and to study the effect of feed supplementation with a clay mineral, clinoptilolite, on this dynamic; (2) To investigate the mechanisms leading to an increase in the prevalence of blaCMY-2 conferring resistance to ceftiofur in pigs receiving medicated feed but which had not received ceftiofur, and to examine the effect of feed supplementation with a clay mineral on this phenomenon; and (3) to investigate the temporal characterization of clinical isolates of ceftiofur-resistant E.coli from diseased pigs in Quebec, Canada from 1997, when ceftiofur resistance was first reported, to 2012.  In the initial study, prevalence of resistance to 10 antimicrobial agents, including ceftiofur, increased over time in E.coli isolates from weaned pigs. A late increase in the frequency of blaCMY-2, the gene encoding resistance to ceftiofur, and the presence of virulence genes iucD and tsh were observed in the isolates. Feed supplementation with clinoptilolite was associated with an early increase but later decrease in the frequency of the blaCMY-2 gene in isolates. Concurrently, a later increase in the frequency of the blaCMY-2 and the virulence genes iucD and tsh was observed in the control pig isolates, being significantly greater than in the supplemented pigs at day 28. Diversity among the blaCMY-2-positive E. coli isolates with respect to AMR patterns was observed. Certain clonal lineages of E. coli became predominant with time. The clonal lineage of phylotype A predominated in the supplemented group, whereas the clonal lineages of phylotype B1 which often possessed the ExPEC-associated virulence gene iucD, predominated in the control group. The blaCMY-2-carrying plasmids of incompatibility (Inc) groups, I1, A/C, and ColE were observed in transformants. In ESC-resistant E.coli clinical isolates from diseased pigs in Quebec, from 1997 to 2012, blaCMY-2 was the most frequently detected β-lactamase gene, followed by blaTEM and blaCTX-M and clonal analysis showed high diversity. E. coli isolates with identical PFGE patterns were found in multiple farms in the same year and also in different years. Resistance to gentamicin, kanamycin, chloramphenicol, and the frequency of blaTEM and IncA/C significantly decreased over the study time, whereas the frequency of IncI1 and multidrug-resistance to seven antimicrobial categories significantly increased over time. Emergence of blaCTX-M-positive, extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli isolates was observed in 2011 and 2012 from distinct clonal lineages and multiple farms.  Taken together, this work gives some insight into the spread of ceftiofur resistance in E.coli isolates from pigs. Results reveal that in weaned pigs receiving medicated feed on one farm in which an increase in ceftiofur resistance was observed, the blaCMY-2-positive E.coli resistant to ESCs belonged to several different clonal lineages with diverse AMR patterns. The blaCMY-2 gene spread both horizontally and clonally in E. coli. Feed supplementation with clinoptilolite and time period after weaning influenced the clonality and the prevalence of blaCMY-2 gene in E. coli. In ceftiofur-resistant E.coli strains isolated from diseased pigs in farms throughout Quebec over a 16 year period, several different pathogenic clonal lineages were observed, although none was persistent or predominant over the study time. The results suggest that blaCMY-2 gene spreads both horizontally and clonally on and between farms. Furthermore, blaCMY-2 was the major β-lactamase gene in these isolates. From 2011, we report the emergence of blaCTX-M in distinct clonal lineages.

762	La spiritualité dans le cinéma transnational. Une théologie pour le 21e siècle autour des philosophies du cinéma de Gilles Deleuze et de Stanley Cavell	This research is based upon two fields of interest. For spirituality, a concept very much to the fore in this troubled 21st century in search of fresh yardsticks. And for cinema, aka the 7th Art, a beacon on the cultural scene, with its insights in today’s issues and questionings. In this era of cultural homogenization, itself the result of economic globalization, this thesis probes “transnational cinema” for fresh answers. Transnational films cross the global space while keeping their local roots and own artistic identity. Very often one will find these works featured in the big film festivals, such as Cannes, Berlin or Venice. Focusing on today’s questionings and issues, many of these movies appear to be bearing a spiritual imprint, with non-discursive methods. They promote openness to others. The goal of this thesis is to describe, through an analysis of a dozen transnational films, how new concepts defining ways to live a spiritual life today can be found. Further the thesis will underline why this spirituality is linked with ethics. To reach that goal, the thesis relies strongly on the works of philosophers Gilles Deleuze (France) and Stanley Cavell (USA). Both have been judged to have complementary approaches for this research, and have made a strong mark on cinematographic studies in the last decades. Deleuze has developed his philosophy on what distinguishes cinema from the other arts. Cavell has focused his thoughts on the importance of cinema for its viewers. Finally, this thesis is in the form of a theology, or theologic-philosophic thought, not linked to a religious tradition and in synchronicity with its times.

763	L'image principale de profil, symbole de l'individu connecté	Since the beginning of the century, a new type of images is becoming more and more common in the public space built on the Internet : the profile’s main picture, these images network sites’ users are using to symbolize their self. It’s generally a picture of the Internet user’s body, which leads to a practice already existing. The first step of this essay is a sociohistorical perspective allowed by noticing that profile’s main picture are often self-portraits. It is then possible to establish a continuity between the practices of past centuries and what is visible on the Internet nowadays. The study of self-produced body images shows a gradual spread of their use from the wealthy to the lower strata of society until the mid-twentieth century. They were used mainly to show social status. After falling into disuse, this type of image is now used by one out of three persons worldwide. The observation of a particular Internet web site has allowed the collection of hundreds of main profile’s pictures. Their analysis has the following conclusions: If the main use of these images is to symbolize a presence in areas not accessible to sensitive body, these images still show elements that can be used to infer a social position and are substantially identical to the images produced before the Internet. Then, the study of these images shows that there is a real continuum in the way someone’s intimacy is revealed proving that the border between the public and the private does not exist on the Internet. Finally, these images show a lack of canon on their production and a multiplicity of ways of staging that suggest they have become meaningful symbols in the communication that can be established between strangers on the Internet.

765	Augmentation de l’absorption intestinale à l’aide de promédicaments se liant aux gangliosides GM1	In order to increase the bioavailability of poorly permeable drugs, a biomimetic approach was investigated. This approach replicated the internalisation of the cholera toxin using GM1 ganglioside receptor on the intestinal cells. The proposed technology was to synthesize a prodrug consisting of a low permeability therapeutic molecule and a GM1-binding peptide. The hypothesis of this work was that the peptide part of the prodrug will enhance the intestinal absorption of the therapeutic molecule and that the complex will be metabolised rapidly after absorption. Prodrugs were synthesized and stability, affinity and permeability tests were developed and performed.  The results of this study demonstrated the possibility of synthesizing prodrugs from a GM1-binding peptide and a drug demonstrating poor bioavailability. Stability, affinity and permeability tests were successfully optimized and implemented. The initial in vitro study highlighted promising binding properties of the peptide and one of the prodrugs. However, stability tests showed partial metabolism of the prodrugs in plasma and instability of the stock solutions. Moreover, results of permeability tests were inconclusive. Future studies will involve the preparation of other prodrugs using the same approach and the investigation of the peptide's internalisation mechanism.

766	Évaluation d’un programme de formation en matière d’agression sexuelle envers les enfants pour les communautés autochtones du Québec	Child sexual abuse (CSA) is a major issue affecting the well-being of indigenous communities. For this reason, the Marie-Vincent Centre of Expertise, in partnership with indigenous stakeholders, has created a training program on the topic of CSA specifically tailored to the needs of Québec’s indigenous communities. From 2013 to 2015, 161 professionals took the training. In order to evaluate this training, two distinct data collection phases were conducted. As part of the first data collection phase, participants completed a reaction questionnaire and a knowledge assessment questionnaire. Interviews with four subgroups of participants were conducted in the second phase of collection. The overall satisfaction with the training was high and the participants’ knowledge level significantly increased from 54% to 87% (t(125) = 16.4, p < 0.001, ηp2= 0.68). Furthermore, interview results show an integration of training contents in the participants’ professional practice. Participants mentioned that the training influenced the way they interrogate children. Being more aware of potential signs and symptoms of CSA was credited to the training. Changes in attitudes were also found, particularly in the importance of reporting abuses. Finally, an improved inter-sectoral collaboration was attributed to the program in at least one community.

767	Music'Oriente : appréhender l'expérience d'un stage de musiques cubaines à Santiago de Cuba	This thesis aims to identify the parameters of the experience of a group of tourists who participated in the 2014 edition of the Music’Oriente workshop, which focused on learning Cuban music in Santiago de Cuba. Our research is specifically concerned with the various strategies used by the participants to optimize their experience. The music-tourism relationship in this field requires a different perspective than that for a classic performance pattern which places the tourists in the audience and leaves most of the musical practice to natives. When considering the tourists’ experiences in the musical workshop, our perspective reveals that not only is the tourists’ appreciation of the musical performance important but also their attribution of meaning to their own music-learning approach in the context of travel abroad. By putting the tools of ethnomusicology, philosophy, social psychology and anthropology of tourism into action, and by using the concepts of experience (Dewey c2005) and flow (Csikszentmihalyi 1990), this thesis aims to highlight that the process of optimization requires participants to constantly negotiate their relationship to the known and the unknown to achieve the highest number of benefits of immersion in a foreign context. Through this research, we hope that our theoretical contribution, focused on the tourists' agency and process of constructing meaning, will lead to a deeper understanding of the experiential dimension of musical practice in a tourism context.

768	Expérience précaire du monde et représentation de la poésie dans La fissure de la fiction et Désâmé de Patrice Desbiens	Diverse pieces of modern and contemporary poetry offer representations of a lyrical subject’s attitude towards the act of writing. Studying such an issue in the works of Patrice Desbiens offers a distinctively interesting perspective, especially in the case of some of his publications from the 1990s and the 2000s wherein such representations appear quite clearly. Yet the treatment of the act of writing in his work has received very little research attention. The aim of this Master’s thesis is to shed further light on how Patrice Desbiens’s works deal with representations of writing and poetry. The thesis focusses on two of his published works, La fissure de la fiction (1997) and Désâmé, (2005), with greater emphasis placed on the former, as it is in my own perspective a key piece in his poetic legacy. To begin, my work puts forth the concept that the protagonists in La fissure de la fiction and Désâmé are both characterized by precariousness, but in different ways. In La fissure de la fiction, the character of the poet is understood from the perspective of an ironic revival of the literary curse myth. The meaning this myth confers to the main character of this poetical story is also discussed. Secondly, the thesis argues that the coherence and the plausibility of the universes of La fissure de la fiction and Desâmé are undermined. In light of these analyses, one can envision the role of a poetry which, ultimately and despite everything, bears a consolatory character. It does so in spite of, or perhaps precisely because of, its grotesque aesthetic, sometimes comic, sometimes tragic, in which it is written.

769	Catherine Tekakwitha et la peinture missionnaire : stratégies de conversion en Nouvelle-France au 17e siècle	This thesis concerns the art developed by Jesuits living with the Mohawk people in the 17th century. By the analysis of the works of two painters, Father Jean Pierron and Father Claude Chauchetière, we define the sociocultural and political environment that influenced their artistic production. These artists share in common the experience of working exclusively with the Mohawk indigenous community, in two consecutive decades. Pierron’s art can be characterized by didactic illustrations aimed towards a secular indigenous audience. We have determined that this painter indicates an ideological transition, in particular by the representation of eschatological theme, the utilisation of imagery in didactical purposes, and by the integration of a few elements of writing into his illustrations. We think that this heralds the apostolic and artistic practices of the generation to follow. The art of Chauchetière reflects the continuation of Jesuit perceptual change by placing the Aboriginal as the hero of the narrative, but also by the introduction of a new character to the heart of hagiographic literature, the character of Catherine Tekakwitha. We can nevertheless observe that a transition takes place with respect to the use of the image, which transforms from a didactical status to that of worship.

771	BROMANCE : les paradoxes des stratégies homosociales	"Since the turn of the 21st century, the emergence!of!the term “Bromance” is seen as reflecting a significant phenomenon in popular American culture. The concept reflects an evolving definition of a particular kind of friendship between men as portrayed in movies, television and on the Internet. Bromance movies, which are characterized by multiple scenes of declarations of love between men, reflect this new way of approaching the male friendship. Through the various definitions of masculinity in these films, the issue of heterosexuality remains ubiquitous. Despite the weakening of some traditional male stereotypes, it remains no less that the notion of 'real' masculinity persists and is systematically linked to the heterosexuality of males who share a relationship that exceeds the usual friendship, a Bromance. In this context, several strategies are used to prove the masculinity and the heterosexuality of the protagonists. One of them seems to be at the heart of these films and takes the form of a competition between men who dare to perform an act conventionally associated with homosexuality. ""Gay Chicken"" videos on the Internet show men kissing and touching without being disturbed or shaken. It is the ability of a man to stay calm, in control and insensitive to the body of an another man that proves the unshakeable side of his heterosexuality and therefore his masculinity. This spirit of ""Gay chicken"" is found everywhere in the world of Bromance films. Paradoxically, these new 'models' of manhood aim to embody a more flexible, open and sensitive masculinity, while also proving their virility. This ""contemporary masculinity"" blurs the line between what is manly and what is not, between what is feminine and what is not and between what is homosexual and what is not. Homosocial relations within the context of a Bromance become indispensable opportunities to prove to everyone the strength of one’s heterosexuality. This research will focus more specifically on the paradoxes of a ""contemporary masculinity"" which is closely tied to heterosexual orientation, through some films from popular American culture that are associated with Bromance. The objective is to show how these films are significant demonstrations of a new statement of male identity that emerges through homosocial relationships marked by homosexual tensions and subtexts which must be continuously suppressed or invalidated."

772	Étude des mécanismes d’extraction lipidique par le peptide mélittine et la protéine BSP1	Lipid-extracting peptides and proteins (LEPs) bind to lipid membranes, extract lipids in the form of smaller auto-assemblies, and ultimately fragment membranes. In nature, this lipid extraction occurs in many different cell systems and causes various consequences, such as a modification of the membrane lipid composition or the cell death. This thesis focuses on the lipid extraction, or fragmentation, induced by the peptide melittin and the protein Binder-of-SPerm 1 (BSP1) on model lipid membranes. To this end, liposomes of different composition are prepared and incubated with melittin or BSP1. The association to membranes is determined by the LEPs intrinsic fluorescence, while the extraction is characterized by a combination of colorimetric phosphorus assays and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses (LCMS).  Melittin is a cationic antimicrobial peptide, a very common category of LEP found in living organisms. Cationic antimicrobial peptides are interesting to medicine because they directly target membrane lipids. The action of many of these peptides is described by the carpet-like mechanism, by which they adsorb to membrane surface, induce the formation of pores and then cause the fragmentation of the membranes. In this thesis, melittin is used as a model peptide in order to study the mechanism by which cationic antimicrobial peptides fragment lipid membranes. Results show that the phosphocholine (PC) membrane fragmentation is reduced by a gradual demethylation of the ammonium group. Analysis of the fragmented material reveals that PC are preferentially extracted from membranes, due to a local enrichment in PC near melittin in the membrane. Furthermore, a melittin analogue, for which a majority of its cationic residues were neutralized, is used to investigate the role of the cationic character of native melittin. The neutralization increases the peptide affinity for neutral and anionic membranes, reduces fragmentation of neutral membranes and increases fragmentation of anionic membranes. Despite electrostatic interactions between the cationic peptide and the anionic lipids, no lipid specificity is observed in the extraction.  BSP1 is the most abundant protein of the bovine seminal plasma and constitutes another example of important LEP found in nature. Upon ejaculation, it mixes with spermatozoa and extracts membrane lipids, such as cholesterol and phosphatidylcholines. This crucial process modulates the lipid composition of sperm membranes, which would then facilitate egg fertilization. However, a prolonged contact between the protein and spermatozoa could damage the semen. This thesis is looking to deepen our understanding of this delicate phenomenon by studying the molecular mechanism by which this protein fragments lipid membranes. Results of the present work suggest a 3-step mechanism for the extraction: 1) Association to membrane interface; 2) Relocation towards the lipid core; 3) Fragmentation of membranes. BSP1 binds directly to two interfacial PC; a sufficient quantity of PC in membranes is necessary for protein association and fragmentation. This specific binding generally does not lead to specificity in the lipid extraction. The impact of unsaturation of the lipid chains, of the presence of lysophosphatidylcholines, of phosphatidylethanolamines, of cholesterol and of anionic lipids is also studied. The present observations underline the complex relationship between a LEP affinity for membranes and the level of fragmentation it induces. The importance of LEP relocation, from the interface to the hydrophobic core of the membranes, for fragmentation is reiterated. This fragmentation seems to be lipid specific only when a phase separation of the lipids occurs in the membrane, notwithstanding specific LEP-lipid interactions. The prevalence of amphipathic structures in certain LEPs, as well as of the auto-assembled discoidal structures resulting from fragmentation is discussed. Finally, the role of electrostatic interactions between cationic antimicrobial peptides and anionic bacterial membranes is detailed: charged residues lower peptide association to neutral membrane due to an increase of their free energy of solvation.

774	La bioéthique, l’art et le syndrome des ovaires polykystiques: propos impressionniste visant à réhabiliter les corps tabous et les ovaires blâmés	Bioethics pushes human beings to confront and take responsibility for the problems they have created, while art inspires a re-enchantment in order to give a different meaning to what has become mechanical and technoscientific world. Health is not exempt from this rigid world view, and related beliefs are often presented in a paradigmatic and absurd fashion where health becomes the object of a biomedicine’s instrumental and scientific rationality. Following this contextualization, it becomes easier to understand the frustrating journey described by women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in the context of healthcare. Biomedicine conceives PCOS as biological and individual, neglecting the contribution of a more global perspective. In contrast to biomedicine, preventive approaches that seek to improve health status and not simply treat the disease offer a more holistic perspective of care. In this context, art is conceived as a unique way to remember forgotten values: a more humane and greater sensitivity, a relation to health that is respectful of life, a creativity in caring. The process becomes a moral and beautiful gesture that is not an appeal to fight against evil, but to take care of health with love and peace, while opening up new opportunities to improve the quality of life of these women and so produce a greater good.	art , polycystic ovary syndrome , global approach , responsibility , ethics	en	15824.0

When supplementing exogenous E2 as a clinical strategy for hormone therapy, it generates genomic and non-genomic effect simultaneously via binding to the estrogen receptors in the cell nucleus or membrane site. Compared to the genomic effect, it is quite difficult to monitor the E2-induced non-genomic biological behavior because this effect occurs in extremely transient time scale and the bioavailability and accessibility of E2 to target cells is very low due to the hydrophobic nature of E2. As a result, it is indispensable to develop E2 delivery systems to specifically understand estrogenic non-genomic nature. One of strategies is to graft E2 to the hydrophilic macromolecules, e.g. bovine serum albumin (BSA) or poly(amido)amine dendrimer, to maintain E2 interacting with membrane estrogen receptors instead of penetrating into the cell nucleus. However, the instability of those E2-macromolecules systems, either containing free E2 leaching or discrepancies of cellular localizations, led to controversies. Herein, the objective of present thesis is to develop novel E2-functionlized platforms by the principle of bottom-up and top-down approaches for understanding the mechanism of estrogenic non-genomic effect, and further, to explore their potential applications in the biomedicine.  As a bottom-up approach, an activated E2 ligand, 17α-ethinylestradiol-benzoic acid was covalently conjugated onto a phosphorylcholine substituted chitosan polymer (CH-PC-E2) as a prodrug strategy for the fabrication of self-assembled films. Through a series of combined physicochemical and cellular investigations, the relationship between various chemical compositions of chitosan-phosphorylcholine (CH-PC) films and cellular responses was also evaluated. Based on atomic force microscopy (AFM) examination, zeta-potential measurements, surface plasmon resonance (SPR), and quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D) measurements, surface topography, charge, and rheology of CH-PC films with 15, 25, and 40 mol% PC contents were characterized. Moreover, QCM-D measurements indicated that the amount of fibrinogen adsorbed on CH-PC films decreased significantly with increasing PC content. Finally, it was also showed that human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs)  form spheroids on CH-PC25 and CH-PC40 films, but not on CH-PC15 films cultured over 4 days. In addition, the CH-PC-E2 polymer conjugates were prepared and characterized by several techniques, such as 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR), Fourier transformed infrared-attenuated total refraction (FTIR-ATR) and UV/Vis spectra measurements. The hydrogel nature of CH-PC-E2 film as well as its interactions to estrogen receptors was further extensively investigated by QCM-D study. In the cellular study, CH-PC-E2 hydrogel films can significantly stimulate the production of nitric oxide, a protective molecule in the cardiovascular system, in the endothelial cells by a diaminofluorescein-FM diacetate imaging study. The studies above demonstrated the different roles and potential applications of CH-PC-E2 and CH-PC surfaces in the cardiovascular regenerative medicine. As a top-down approach, micropatterned substrates were used for E2 functionalization, which were prepared by photolithography via aligning ~ 2 μm in diameter gold arrays onto a glass substrate. After that, a cell adhesive peptide, cyclic RGD was introduced to the glass surface in order to induce the attachment of cells. Meanwhile, estradiol was covalently immobilized on the gold surface and the process was monitored and validated by combining SPR and QCM-D studies. In the micropatterned substrate-coupled cell ELISA study, a phosphorylation level of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), which is an important non-genomic marker, was significantly elevated by this E2-functionalized micropatterned surface after 1 hour incubation. Furthermore, E2-functionalized micropatterned substrate didn’t proliferate cancer cells indicating the absence of genomic effect stimulation. Based on these results, our E2-functionalized micropatterned substrates can function as an in vitro model for the elucidation of estrogenic non-genomic behaviors.

776	The French Canadian founder population : lessons and insights for genetic epidemiological research	The French Canadian founder population has a demographic history that makes it an important population for epidemiology and genetics. This work aims to explain what features can be used to improve the design and analysis of genetic epidemiological studies in the Quebec population. First we take advantage of the presence of extended genealogical records among French Canadians to estimate relatedness from those records and compare it to the genetic kinship. The kinship based on identical-by-descent sharing correlates well with the genealogical kinship, further demonstrating the usefulness of genomic identical-by-descent detection to capture complex relatedness involving inbreeding and our findings can guide the interpretation of results in other population without genealogical data. Second to optimally exploit the full potential of these well preserved, exhaustive and detailed French Canadian genealogical data we present the GENLIB R package developed to study large genealogies. We also investigate identical-by-descent sharing with simulations and highlight the fact that regional population structure can facilitate the identification of notable founders that could have introduced disease mutations, opening the door to prevention and screening of founder-related diseases. Third, knowing that French Canadians have accumulated segments of homozygous genotypes, as a result of inbreeding due to distant ancestors, we estimate the inbreeding in French Canadian individuals and investigate its impact on multiple health traits. We show how inbreeding depression influences complex traits such as height and blood-related traits. Those results are a few examples of what we can learn from the French Canadian population and will help to gain insight on other populations’ characteristics as well as help the genetic epidemiological research within the French Canadian population.

777	Punishing Local Incumbents for the Local Economy	After decennia of research on economic voting, it is now established that the state of the economy affects voting behaviour. Nevertheless, this conclusion is the result of a focus on predominantly national-level economies and national-level elections. In this paper, we show that at a local level as well, mechanisms of accountability linked to the economy are at work. The local economic context affected voting behaviour in the 2012 Belgian municipal elections, with a stronger increase of unemployment rates in their municipality significantly decreasing the probability that voters choose an incumbent party. Additionally, we observe that voters are not opportunistically voting for incumbents who lower tax rates. Instead, voters seem to be holding local incumbents accountable for local economic conditions. We hence conclude that voters care about economic outcomes, not about what specific policies are implemented to reach these outcomes.	Vote , Élections , Belgique	en	14069.0
778	The Relation Between Civic Education and Political Attitudes and Behavior	It is generally assumed that civic education efforts will have a positive effect on the political attitudes and behaviors of adolescents and young adults. There is less agreement, however, on the most effective forms of civic education. In the present study, we distinguish between formal civic education, an open classroom climate and active learning strategies, and we explore their effect on political interest, efficacy, trust and participation. To analyze these effects, we rely on the results of a two-year panel study among late adolescents in Belgium. The results indicate that formal civic education (classroom instruction) and active learning strategies (school council membership and, to a lesser extent, group projects) are effective in shaping political attitudes and behavior. An open classroom climate, on the other hand, has an effect on political trust. We conclude that there is no reason to privilege specific forms of civic education, as each form contributes to different relevant political attitudes and behaviors.

779	La théorie sociale de la connaissance et la gestion du patrimoine documentaire à l’ère numérique	Memory and knowledge institutions (for example, libraries, archives, museums) face significant challenges in their responsibilities to ensure the long-term preservation of documentary heritage in the digital age. The overabundance of digital information, the potential unrestricted ability to create and produce digital information by individuals and social groups; the lack of storage capacity and ability to disseminate digital information by documentary heritage institutions are only a few of these challenges. Moreover, the approaches and methods used in an analogue environment to identify, manage, preserve and disseminate Canadian documentary heritage have proven to be non-transferable to the digital environment. We suggest that social epistemology can support the development of public policy approach for documentary heritage institutions to identify Canada's documentary heritage in the digital age. We explored this issue and we tried to respond to it through three scientific articles. Our research indicates that existing professional practice and objective knowledge remains persistent and limits the formulation and application of new theoretical frameworks, administrative policies and instruments related to the identification and selection of documentary heritage. To remedy this situation, our research identifies a conceptual framework that can be used to develop public policies on Canada's documentary heritage.

780	LMX à distance : analyse qualitative et développement d’une échelle de mesure	In this research, we define the concept of distance leader-member exchange (distance LMX) and present a valid and reliable scale to measure it. We argue that the notion of distance is not a contextual element but is instead an integral component of the concept, unlike studies that have examined only the impact of distance in LMX relationships (Bligh and Riggio, 2012; Brunelle, 2013). Therefore we believe that our study is original and groundbreaking in the human resource management field. This measurement tool will allow the dyad parties to better adapt to this new working reality and will motivate them to collaborate and develop high-quality relationships. Our study thus offers an interesting contribution to help companies manage their employees and improve performance in cases of remote working. A review of the literature regarding traditional LMX and distance concepts was carried out to provide an accurate definition of the concept of distance LMX. We relied on the psychometric literature to build a measurement scale for this concept. This scale is the result of a qualitative exploratory study conducted among thirty Canadian university professors. For the data analysis we used Nvivo software to analyze the interviews. We present an initial measurement scale for distance LMX composed of 7 dimensions and 27 indicators. To summarize, we propose an approach to better understand the increasingly widespread remote-working phenomenon, and provide a theoretical and practical platform to help researchers better grasp this concept. Our study will surely help supervisors and subordinates understand the importance of developing and maintaining good relationships that will generate positive organizational and personal results.

781	L’idéalisme et le phénoménalisme leibnizien	Many commentators try to read Leibniz either as an idealist or a realist, adding a phenomenalist reading to theses first two analyses. However, those terms are however often used with ambiguities, making Leibniz sometimes an even more complex philosopher. The first purpose of this master’s thesis is to gather and compare all these interpretations in order to clarify Leibniz’s thought. In this study, his writings will be used to defend the following interpretation : Leibniz can be considered as a realist since he develops a theory where monads act as « mind-independent » entities. Nonetheless, these monads are non-extended and without parts. Therefore, we can present an idealistic understanding of Leibniz, for they are the “basic building-blocks” of his metaphysic. Still, clarifications need to be made concerning the body. It can either be “real”, if it is seen as an aggregate of monads. Or, it can be considered a “mind-dependent” phenomenon if seen as the result of monadic perceptions. We will develop, between these two possibilities, an intermediate position stating that bodies are indeed aggregates of monads (matter realism). However they must be considered as phenomena for this same reason (phenomenalism). Corporeal aggregates require the action of the mind which alone can give them unity. On the contrary monads are said to be unum per se. Bodies are therefore phenomena but precisely well founded in the monads that compose them.

782	Rapport à l’espace, rapport à l’autre : constructions des discours sur l’immigration dans la banlieue lavalloise	This master's thesis addresses citizen discourses, regarding ethnocultural otherness in suburban neighborhood of Laval. To do so, I focus on the specific context of the city of Laval to detangle the relations between space and ethnocultural otherness from the perspective of the inhabitants. This research, thus standing at the crossroads of ethnic studies, social geography and urban studies, enables an anchoring of the representation of ethnocultural diversity in both the social and physical spaces of the suburb. Within this framework, the discourses of the Lavallois, coming from two neighbourhoods each characterized by different processes of urban development and ethnic diversification are analyzed. For a majority of our sample, the recent changes in the urban landscape attest of a diversification in the inhabited space that generally evokes a negative response. The presence of ethnocultural otherness in the public and private spaces of Laval is also linked to a perceived degradation of the social bond in their community. At the study's conclusion, I argue that the perception of immigrants is intertwined in the recent urban changes occurring in the city of Laval. As such, immigrants are directly associated with the loss of the idealized suburban branding.

783	Synthèse systématique des écrits : les instruments d’évaluation de la comorbidité psychiatrique présentée par les adolescent(e)s	This dissertation outlines the results of a systematic review of literature regarding comprehensive assessment of comorbid disorders with adolescents. The SR identified 11 instruments capable of assessing comorbid disorders of DSM-IV’s Axe’s I, including every time substance related disorders. Once those instruments identified, a second review took place to identified research that had put those instruments to the test regarding validity and reliability of diagnostics produced: 57 studies were identified. Their methodological robustness was evaluated with the QUADAS-2 and 47 studies composed the final sample. The results are presented by diagnostics (Substance related disorder (mandatory), Generalized anxiety disorder, Major depressive disorder, Conduct disorder, Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, Posttraumatic stress disorder) and by instruments. After analyzing the data collected, it appears that it is difficult to compare the instruments to each other, given the great diversity of scales they contain, as well as the various researches’ design when put to the test regarding their validity and reliability. However, two instruments distinguish themselves by the methodological robustness of the studies who have analyzed them and their excellent global result.  They are the ChIPS and the K-SADS.

784	Perceptions des femmes exerçant différentes formes d'activités sexuelles rémunérées hors rue sur leur pratique	"This research is an analysis of the perception on their activities of eight women of different age groups who have undertaken or are still practicing various forms of remunerated sexual activities in an indoor context. Most common forms of remunerated sexual activities addressed by women in the study include nude dancing with and without contacts, escort services, massage parlours and the phenomenon commonly known as ""sugar daddy"", when women exchange services for remuneration with a particular client. Even though street prostitution was not specifically addressed in the study, two female participants in the sample practiced both indoor and outdoor activities. The term “remunerated sexual activities” has been chosen to ensure a neutral perspective. We wanted to focus on an unbiased approach that encompasses both common views on prostitution, on the one hand, the one that is known to be the abolitionist vision, which maintains that prostitution is a form of exploitation and of sexual violence committed primarily against women, and in that sense, it should be decriminalized for women but criminalize customers and pimps. On the other hand, the “pro-sex work” vision, arguing that ""sex work"" is a choice and it is a job like any other, deserves to be decriminalized completely, even for customers and pimps. Our approach was used essentially to get the subjective visions, that might be more nuanced than what we hear in the writings and debates on the subject, a way of giving a voice to those women we do not hear a lot about.  The theoretical framework that underlies our analysis is the intersection of discrimination. The main sources of discrimination that emerged in our sample were those of age, social and economic status and ethnicity, for one person. Those sources of vulnerabilities increased the probabilities for women to go toward those practices, to stay in it and to return after a break, sometimes to meet their basic needs, to be able to pay for drugs or to reimburse some debts and/or afford luxury. The aim of the study is to discover and understand the perception of women regarding their experience in various forms of indoor remunerated sexual activities. To achieve this, we describe, understand and analyze the path that led women into engaging in remunerated sexual activities; identify and understand their journey and experiences based on their type of practice, more or less intense, more or less varied and more or less extended in time, of remunerated sexual activities and finally, place their perspective on the continuum of the social debate surrounding the phenomenon, whether it is more a way to exploit women versus a form of work like any other or somewhere in between, where we could locate the perspectives of women on a continuum where many of them found their way into more nuanced visions of their reality. A qualitative methodology was used where semi-structured interviews were conducted. It allows to discover nuanced perspectives among them, and for others, to validate their perspective among the polarized visions we often hear in the actual debates and studies, meaning some of them situate their realities more in a form of sexual exploitation and others in a common form of work."

785	Dodecyltrimethylammonium chloride adsorption at the silica/water interface studied by Sum Frequency Generation	Sum Frequency Generation (SFG), an interface specific spectroscopic technique, was used to characterize the changes in the macromolecular structure of the cationic surfactant dodecyltrimethylammonium chloride (DTAC) at the silica/water interface at pH values ranging from 3 to 11. The experimental conditions were selected to mimic conditions common during enhanced oil recovery operations. In particular, silica was studied since it is one of the most abundant mineral components of sandstone reservoirs, and surfactant adsorption was studied at an ionic strength (100 mM NaCl) relevant to hydraulic fracturing fluids. SFG spectra showed detectable peaks with increasing amplitude in the methylene and methyl stretching region when the pH was lowered to 3 or increased to 11, suggesting changes in the surfactant aggregate structure at the silica/water interface at a DTAC concentration above the critical micelle concentration. In addition, changes in the SFG intensity were observed for the water spectrum when increasing the DTAC concentration from 0.2 to 50 mM under acidic, neutral or alkaline conditions. At pH 3, near the point of zero charge of the silica surface, the excess positive charge due to adsorption of the cationic surfactant creates an electrostatic field that orients water molecules at the interface. At pH 7 and 11, which are above the point of zero charge of the silica surface, the negative electrostatic field at the silica/water interface decreases in magnitude with surfactant adsorption due to compensation of the negative surface charge by the positively charged DTAC. The SFG results were correlated with contact angle and interfacial tension measurements at pH 3, 7 and 11.

It is used in the development of novel biosensors that are portable, disposable and inexpensive, aimed at capturing, detecting and in some cases deactivating pathogens. Generally bioactive papers are made by incorporating biomolecules such as enzymes and/or antibodies on to paper. The immobilization of such biomolecules on solid surfaces is widely used for different diagnostic applications such as in immunosensors and immunoassays but due to the sensitive nature of enzymes, their large scale incorporation into paper has faced several difficulties especially under industrial papermaking conditions. The functionalization of paper at large scale is possible because paper can be easily coated with a layer of microcapsules, which have proven to be an efficient immobilization platform for enzymes and to allow. In this study, we developed a generic alginate-based platform incorporating microcapsules that can be applied to current paper production processes to prepare antibacterial bioactive paper with the ability to capture pathogens on its surface and to deactivate them by producing an anti-pathogenic agent. The design of the antibacterial platform is based on constant production of hydrogen peroxide as the antibacterial agent inside the alginate microcapsules. Hydrogen peroxide production is achieved through oxidation of glucose, catalyzed by the enzyme glucose oxidase encapsulated inside the alginate beads. The different steps of development included the entrapment of glucose oxidase inside alginate microcapsules, the reinforcement and surface activation of microcapsules by adding an additional layer of chitosan, investigating the possibility of immobilization of antibodies (human immunoglobulin G as a model antibody) on the surface of microcapsules and, finally, verifying the antibacterial properties of the system against Escherichia coli K-12 (E. coli K-12) as a representative pathogen. During development, certain measurements and observations were made using various analytical methods and techniques such as Bradford protein assay, oxygen electroanalysis, optical and confocal laser canning microscopy (CLSM), matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization- time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS), etc. Appropriate tests were performed to validate the successful modification of microcapsules and to ensure that glucose oxidase is still active after each modification. It was found that the encapsulated glucose oxidase maintained the specific enzymatic activity of 120±30 U/g. Subsequent efforts were made to immobilize glucose oxidase on gold NPs of two different diameters (10.9 nm and 50 nm) to enhance the enzymatic activity and increase the encapsulation efficiency.   The results obtained during this study demonstrate successful modifications on alginate microcapsules and also a successful response of such antibacterial platform regarding deactivation of the pathogen representative, E. coli K-12. The threshold for the enzymatic activity was found to be 1.3×10-2 U/ml for E. coli K-12 growth inhibition of 6.7×108 cells/ml. Further studies are needed to assess the efficiency of immobilized antibody in the capture of pathogens and also to incorporate the platform onto paper and to validate the efficiency of the system once it is coated on paper.

787	Spectroscopie Raman de fibres électrofilées : développement de méthodes et application aux fibres individuelles	Electrospinning is an efficient and versatile technique to produce continuous fibers of typical diameter of a few hundred nanometers from the application of a high voltage on a concentrated and entangled polymer solution. The rapid solvent evaporation and the significant elongational forces involved in the fiber formation process give rise to unusual properties that are interesting for various types of applications, but that are yet to be fully explored. Due to their small size, these materials have been, for a long time, studied into bundles composed of thousands of fibers using conventional techniques such as infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. Our current understanding of their behavior thus relies on a convolution of the properties of the mat and the specific characteristics of each fiber composing it. Recent studies at the individual fiber level have revealed unusual properties, particularly an exponential increase of the modulus with the diameter reduction. The orientation and the molecular structure within the fibers are suspected to be at the origin of these properties, but in a way that is still far from being understood. Establishing clear structure/properties relationships and identifying the parameters that influence them represent significant challenges. However, they are of tremendous importance to fully take advantage of the specific characteristics of electrospun fibers. A key step toward this goal is to develop methodologies that enable fast and in-depth structural analysis on large quantities of individual fibers with a large diameter range.  In this thesis, confocal Raman spectroscopy is used to probe structural characteristics of individual fibers such as their molecular orientation, crystallinity and disentanglement. A new methodology for orientation quantification is first demonstrated theoretically with the objectives of reducing the experimental complexity of the Raman measurements, of extending the variety of materials that can be analysed, and of eliminating recurrent errors brought by the use of the conventional method. The experimental validity and applicability of this new method, referred to as MDP, is then demonstrated. Following this, an efficient protocol enabling the structural study of individual electrospun fibers by confocal Raman spectroscopy is presented, using poly(ethylene therephthalate) as a model system. The limitations of the technique are exposed and experimental strategies to circumvent them are highlighted. Results reveal the large variability of the orientation and of chain conformation from fiber to fiber, showing the importance and the relevance of statistical studies of individual fibers.  Following this, the presence of chains showing a level of entanglement lower in electrospun fibers than in the bulk is demonstrated experimentally for the first time using infrared spectroscopy on bundles of polystyrene fibers. The principal electrospinning conditions promoting this structural phenomenon, which is suspected to influence greatly the properties of the fibers, are identified. Finally, the various methodologies developed in the thesis are combined for an in-depth study of orientation and disentanglement on large quantities of individual polystyrene fibers covering a large diameter range. This last study enables establishing the first structure/properties relationships for these materials, at the individual fiber scale, by clearly exposing the link between orientation, disentanglement and the elastic modulus of the fibers.

789	Group-Based Symptom Trajectories in Indicated Prevention of Adolescent Depression	Background: Adolescent depression prevention research has focused on mean intervention outcomes, but has not considered heterogeneity in symptom course. Here, we empirically identify subgroups with distinct trajectories of depressive symptom change among adolescents enrolled in two indicated depression preven- tion trials and examine how cognitive-behavioral (CB) interventions and baseline predictors relate to trajectory membership. Methods: Six hundred thirty-one participants were assigned to one of three conditions: CB group intervention, CB bibliotherapy, and brochure control. We used group-based trajectory modeling to identify trajectories of depressive symptoms from pretest to 2-year follow-up. We examined associations between class membership and conditions using chi- square tests and baseline predictors using multinomial regressions. Results: We identiﬁed four trajectories in the full sample. Qualitatively similar trajectories were found in each condition separately. Two trajectories of positive symptom course (low-declining, high-declining) had declining symptoms and were dis- tinguished by baseline symptom severity. Two trajectories of negative course (high-persistent, resurging), respectively, showed no decline in symptoms or de- cline followed by symptom reappearance. Participants in the brochure control condition were signiﬁcantly more likely to populate the high-persistent trajectory relative to either CB condition and were signiﬁcantly less likely to populate the low-declining trajectory relative to CB group. Several baseline factors predicted trajectory classes, but gender was the most informative prognostic factor, with males having increased odds of membership in a high-persistent trajectory rel- ative to other trajectories. Conclusions: Findings suggest that CB preventive interventions do not alter the nature of trajectories, but reduce the risk that adolescents follow a trajectory of chronically elevated symptoms.

790	Régulation de l'expression de PPARγ dans l'arthrose	Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common degenerative joint disease. It is characterised by progressive destruction of articular cartilage, synovial inflammation and subchondral bone remodelling. The complete etiology of OA is still not well defined. Several studies have been carried out to elucidate the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in OA development.           The protective effects of Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) in OA have been well documented. It has been demonstrated that PPARγ exhibit anti-inflammatory and anti-catabolic properties. Although many stimuli have been reported to regulate the expression of PPARγ in several cell types. However, little information is available on the exact mechanisms that govern its regulation as well as the expression profile of this recepteur during the course of the disease.            In the first part of this work, we tried to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the alteration of PPARγ expression in OA. Our findings confirm that interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), a proinflammatory cytokine, down regulate the expression of PPARγ in articular chondrocytes. This effect coincided with the induction of early growth response protein-1 (Egr-1) expression. In addition, down regulation of PPARγ expression was associated with Egr-1 recruitment to and concomitant reduction in Sp1 occupancy at PPARγ promoter.           In the second part of this work, we evaluated the expression profile of this receptor in cartilage during the progression of OA. Spontaneous Hartley guinea pig model and anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT) dog model were used to follow the expression of three isoforms of PPARs: PPAR alpha (α), PPAR beta (β) and PPAR gamma (γ) as well as hematopoietic prostaglandin D synthase (H-PGDS) and lipocalin-type prostaglandin D synthase (L-PGDS) two enzymes involved in the production of the natural agonist PAARγ, 15-Deoxy-delta(12,14)-prostaglandin J(2) (15d PGJ2).           Our reultats showed changes in the expression of PPARγ and L-PGDS. In contrast, the level of PPARα, PPARβ and H-PGDS was constant over time. The decrease in PPARγ levels in articular chondrocytes suggest that it may be a contributing factor in OA development in both animal models used in this study. Furthermore, siRNA silencing of PPARγ resulted in an enhanced production of osteoarthric mediators such as matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13) and nitric oxide (NO). Thus, confirming the anti-arthritic role of this receptor. In contrast, unlike the later, there was an increase in the expression level of L-PGDS during disease progression. The overexpression of L-PGDS in human chondrocytes was associated with reduced production of these osteoarthric mediators, suggesting its involvement in repair process.           In summary, our data suggest that the modulation of PPARγ, L-PGDS and Egr-1 expression levels in articular cartilage may be a potential therapeutic approach in the treatment of OA and probably other forms of arthritis.

791	Bases moléculaires et cellulaires d’un trouble neurodéveloppemental causé par l’haploinsuffisance de SYNGAP1	Intellectual deficiency is the most frequent cause of severe handicap in children. A growing body of work indicates that disruption of synaptic genes explains a significant fraction of neurodevelopmental disorders, such as intellectual deficiency and autism. Until recently, the majority of known mutations associated with non-syndromic intellectual deficiency were either X-linked or autosomal recessive. On the other hand, more recent studies suggest that de novo mutations in autosomal genes required for synaptic plasticity may explain an important fraction of cases of non-syndromic intellectual deficiency. Using exome capture and genomic DNA sequencing technics, our laboratory reported for the first time pathogenic mutations in the autosomal dominant gene of SYNGAP1. Pathogenic mutations in SYNGAP1 have been associated with behavioral abnormalities such as intellectual deficiency, inattention, mood problem, impulsivity, and physical aggression. In addition, a subset of these patients show acquired microcephaly, autism and/or specific forms of generalized epilepsy. Syngap1 germline knockout (Syngap1+/-) mice show several behavioral abnormalities, such as locomotor hyperactivity, decreased anxiety-like behavior, enhanced startle reactivity, lack of social memory, a propensity toward isolation, deficits in cued fear conditioning, and impaired reference and working memories. Thus, Syngap1+/- mice might represent a reliable experimental model to study the pathological effects of Syngap1 haploinsufficiency on neuronal circuit development. On the other hand, it is important to first establish whether mutations in Syngap1 found in human lead in fact to protein haploinsufficiency.   SYNGAP1 codes for a Ras GTPase-activating protein. Its haploinsufficiency results in an increased level of Ras activity and ERK phosphorylation, abnormal dendritic spine morphogenesis, and an excess of postsynaptic AMPA receptors in excitatory neurons. Specifically, it has been suggested that prematurely increased insertion of AMPA receptors into excitatory synapses could explain some of the phenotypes observed in Syngap1+/- mice. Conversely, the role of Syngap1 haploinsufficiency in GABAergic circuits is unknown. The aims of my thesis project are: 1), to identify the impact of human mutations on SYNGAP1 function; 2) to determine whether SYNGAP1 plays a role in GABAergic circuit development and function, and 3) to reveal how Syngap1 haploinsufficiency specifically in GABAergic circuits affects cognitive behavior. We reported the first missense mutations (c.1084T>C [p.W362R]; c.1685C>T [p.P562L]), as well as two novel truncating mutations (c.2212_2213del [p.S738X]; c.283dupC [p.H95PfsX5]) in SYNGAP1 in humans. These mutations are de novo, except c.283dupC, which was inherited from a mosaic parent. In this study, we confirmed that patients with these mutations in SYNGAP1 showed, among other phenotypes, behavioral disorders associated with intellectual deficiency. Biolistic transfection of wild-type Syngap1 cDNA in pyramidal cells from cortical organotypic cultures significantly reduced neural activity-dependent pERK levels. In contrast, plasmid constructs expressing W362R, P562L or the previously described R579X mutations had no significant effect on pERK levels. These experiments suggest that these mutations in SYNGAP1 result in a loss of function, most probably disrupting brain development via a mechanism of haploinsufficiency.  Several studies suggest that the cognitive deficits associated with Syngap1 haploinsufficiency may arise from alterations in the developmental trajectory of glutamatergic excitatory neurons. Whether and to what extent Syngap1 haploinsufficiency affects the synaptic network development of GABAergic cells, thus contributing to excitation/inhibition imbalance and cognitive abnormalities, remains elusive. Therefore, we examined the involvement of Syngap1 in the development of GABAergic circuits. To this goal, we generated conditional knockout mice where one Syngap1 allele was removed specifically in GABAergic interneurons derived from the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE)  (Tg(Nkx2.1-Cre);Syngap1flox/+ mice). In organotypic cultures, we found that reduction of Syngap1 specifically in GABAergic interneurons resulted in alterations of their axonal arborisation and synapse density. Moreover, miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSC) and optogenetically-evoked IPSC (oIPSC) recordings in acute brain slices showed a significant reduction in cortical inhibitory neurotransmission in Tg(Nkx2.1-Cre);Syngap1flox/+ mice. Furthermore, we compared the performance of young adult Syngap1+/-, Tg(Nkx2.1-Cre);Syngap1flox/+ mice and their respective control littermates in several behavioral tests. Contrary to Syngap1+/- mice, Tg(Nkx2.1-Cre);Syngapflox/+ mice were not  hyperactive, and did not demonstrate any anxiety-like behavior. They, however, showed the same impairment in working and social recognition memory, indicating that Syngap1 disruption in MGE-derived GABAergic neurons recapitulate at least some of the cognitive deficits observed in Syngap1+/- mice.  All together, my PhD work first, demonstrated that human mutations in the SYNGAP1 gene associated with intellectual deficiency likely cause Syngap1 haploinsufficiency, and second, revealed for the first time a significant role of SYNGAP1 in the regulation of the development and function of GABAergic interneurons.

792	Biochemical and functional characterization of the tumor suppressors BRCA1 and BAP1	Ubiquitination is a post-translational modification that plays major roles in regulating a plethora of cellular processes. In this thesis, I will discuss the biochemical and functional characterization of two functionally related proteins, BRCA1 and BAP1, both of which are important tumor suppressors. BRCA1, an ubiquitin ligase that catalyzes the attachment of ubiquitin to target proteins, is mutated in breast and ovarian cancers. BRCA1 roles in maintaining genomic stability following DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) by promoting the homologous recombination repair pathway is well established. However, how BRCA1 is regulated following genotoxic stress that does not directly involve DSBs is still not fully elucidated. We showed that BRCA1 is downregulated, through proteasomal degradation, following exposure of the cells to the DNA helix distorting agent UV or the DNA alkylating agent Methyl Methanesulfonate (MMS), two DNA damaging agents that do not directly generate DSBs. BRCA1 downregulation is reversible and is independent of the PI3 kinase related kinases, ATM, ATR or DNA-PK which constitute primary responders that are rapidly activated by DNA damage. We proposed that BRCA1 downregulation prevents the untimely recruitment of BRCA1 and associated factors to DNA damage sites that are not DSBs, thus coordinating the DNA damage/repair response.   The deubiquitinating enzyme BAP1 was initially identified as an interacting protein that regulates the function of BRCA1. BAP1 is also known to interact with the Polycomb group proteins ASXL1 and ASXL2. However, the importance of this interaction was not fully understood. We showed that BAP1 forms two mutually exclusive complexes with ASXL1 and ASXL2. These interactions are critical for BAP1 binding to ubiquitin and stimulation of its deubiquitinase activity towards histone H2A. We also identified cancer-derived mutations of BAP1 that abrogate its interaction with ASXL1 and ASXL2 and deubiquitinase activity, which provide a direct mechanistic link between H2A deubiquitination and tumorigenesis.   Elucidating how BRCA1 and BAP1 are regulated will lead to a better understanding of their roles as tumor suppressors and this will in turn help establishing improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to treat cancer.

793	Impact des cavines sur le phénotype invasif et inflammatoire des cellules souches mésenchymateuses	The evolution of an initiated tumor cell into a solid tumor requires at each stage a favorable microenvironment for its survival and growth. The tumor microenvironment is compared to a chronic inflammation site with a cellular and molecular complex composition. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have important roles in tumor microenvironment. They migrate to tumor sites where they maintain the inflammation, angiogenesis and tumor development by activating multiple signaling pathways. One of the major pathways that contribute to inflammation is the NF-B signaling pathway. The initiation of this pathway comes from the cell membrane and caveolae. Our hypothesis is that one of cavins, proteins associated to caveolae, modulates the inflammatory phenotype and migration in MSC treated with TNF-. We suggest that this process is modulated by a NF-B signaling pathway. Indeed, we observed an up-regulation of the expression of the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and a decrease in the expression of IκB which suggest that activation of the NF-B pathway is involved in the MSC treated with TNF. We found that the TNF- induced migration in the MSC, and the knockout of Cavin-2 significantly increased migration of MSC treated with TNF-. The silencing of Cavin-2 considerably increased tubulogenesis of MSC treated with TNF-. At the molecular level, knockout of Cavin-2 showed a very strong amplification of protein expression of COX-2 in the MSC in response to TNF-. In these same cells where Cavin-2 was repressed and treated with TNF-, the peak of phosphorylation of pIB is more intense and the phosphorylation curve is sustained in time. These observations allow us to assert that Cavin-2 has a repressing role on the expression of COX-2. Collectively, our results show that the gene encoding Cavin-2 can be proposed as tumor suppressor gene. This study allowed us to identify new therapeutic targets: Cavins proteins.

794	Mécanismes d'action des cellules stromales mésenchymateuses dans le traitement de la réaction du greffon contre l'hôte	Graft versus host disease (GvHD) is a very serious side effect of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). This disease results in high mortality and devastating symptoms. Treatments for GvHD include a lot of pharmaceuticals, including corticosteroids, but these are immunosuppressive and their adverse effects cause a lot of damage to the patient and hinder the healing process. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) represent a potential alternative or addition to the GvHD treatment regimen. These cells do not seem to carry the secondary effects associated with classical treatments. A number of studies have been registered concerning MSC. In spite of the spike of interest, the mechanism of immunomodulation deployed by MSC remains to be elucidated. Our objective is to better characterise this mechanism. We have used a simple in vitro model to simulate GvHD. This model is based on the stimulation of CD4+ T cells by allogenic dendritic cells. The measure of the proliferation of the stimulated lymphocytes serves as an indicator of the reactivity. According to the results obtained by CRISPR genetic engineering, MSC exert this immunomodulatory effect on T cells mainly by the secretion of IDO1 enzyme. These MSC are also able to induce T cells to become inhibitory, a process independent of the secretion of IDO1. However, these inhibitory T cells would not correspond to conventional Treg cells.

795	Lymphatic vessel function in atherosclerosis	Atherosclerosis is driven by the accumulation of cholesterol in the arterial wall, which triggers an inappropriate immune response in which macrophages play an important role. It has now been shown that the lymphatic vessels play an important role in reverse cholesterol transport (Martel et al. JCI 2013). The overall objective of my Master internship was to better characterize lymphatic dysfunction associated with atherosclerosis, studying closely the physiological and temporal origin of this pathological feature. Our approach was to study, from the initiation of atherosclerosis to the progression of the atherosclerotic lesion, the physiology of the two main components that form the lymphatic vessels: the lymphatic capillaries and collectors. Using a mouse model that closely resembles human atherosclerosis (Ldlr-/-; hApoB100+/+) we have demonstrated that lymphatic dysfunction is present before the onset of atherosclerosis, and that this dysfunction is primarily associated with a defect in the collecting vessels, thereby limiting the lymph transport from peripheral tissues to the blood. In addition, we have clearly demonstrated, for the first time to our knowledge, the presence of the LDL receptor on lymphatic endothelial cells. Our subsequent work shows that this reduction in lymph flow could be due to the absence of the LDL receptor, and that lymphatic transport can be restored by systemic injections of VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) –C. These results suggest that the functional characterization of the pumping capacity of the collecting vessels would be a prerequisite for the understanding of the interactions between the function of the lymphatic system and the progression of atherosclerosis. Altogether, our work unveils new potential therapeutic targets for the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis.

796	The nuclear pore complex and its transporters : from virus-host interactors to subverting the innate antiviral immunity	Viruses interact with cellular factors in order to successfully replicate and propagate in host cells. Germain et al. (2014) performed a proteomics analysis to elucidate viral-host interactors of hepatitis C virus (HCV). They found that the majority of host factors did not have an effect on viral replication, suggesting that these host proteins may be beneficial to the virus by affecting other cellular processes such as evading the innate antiviral immunity. To test that hypothesis, 132 virus-host interactors were selected and silenced by RNAi for their effect on inteferon-beta (IFNB1) production as a readout of the innate antiviral response. 53 were found to modulate the response with enrichment in the gene ontology (GO) terms related to nucleocytoplasmic transport and the nuclear pore complex. An interesting point is that the genes associated with these terms (CSE1L, KPNB1, RAN, TNPO1, and XPO1) were previously elucidated as HCV NS3/4A interactors by Germain et al. (2014), as well as positive regulators of the innate antiviral response. Although it is surprising that a cytoplasmic-replicating virus like HCV would interact with proteins associated with the nucleus, we proposed that viruses interact with these proteins for their benefit to interfere with the innate immune response. The innate antiviral response requires the nuclear translocation of IRF3 and NF-κB p65 for the production of type I interferons. As it is unclear which transporters or nucleoporins are involved, 60 genes associated with the nuclear pore complex and nucleocytoplasmic transport were studied for their effect on the nuclear translocation of IRF3 and NF-κB p65 via a microscopy-based RNAi screen during a 10-hour viral infection time course. Overall, the study revealed that many of these proteins are involved in the trafficking of these transcription factors during a viral infection, and can affect the production of IFNB1 at different levels of the innate antiviral response. The study also suggests that the effect of these transport factors on the immune response may be an evasion mechanism for viruses such as HCV.

797	Sexage et phylogénie, à partir des gènes CHD (-Z et -W) et COX-1, des oiseaux de proie du Québec et de perroquets d’attrait vétérinaire	Knowing the sex of a bird is important for many disciplines, notably for veterinary, ecological and evolutionary studies, not to mention for bird breeders who need to form pairs for reproduction. For many species of birds, juveniles and adults do not display a sexual dimorphism. The use of DNA, derived from a sample of blood, muscle, feathers or feces, is a rapid method to determine a bird’s sex. However, this method must be validated for each species, and ideally, standardised. The first objective of this work was to develop a method of sexing birds by sequencing portions of their CHD gene, for birds of prey and parrots seen in veterinary clinics in Quebec. A second objective was to identify the species being sexed, first of all using the mitochondrial gene COX-1, and second of all using the CHD-Z and CHD-W sequences used for sexing. The third objective of these studies was to evaluate the sequences obtained (CHD-Z, CHD-W and COX-1) for performing phylogenetic studies. DNA was extracted from 27 species of parrots, 34 species of birds of prey, from one species of crow (Corvus brachyrhynchos) and from the chicken (Gallus gallus). A PCR amplification was performed for partial exons 23 and 24 of the CHD gene. Sequencing this amplicon resulted in simple CHD-Z sequences for a male and overlapping CHD-Z and CHD-W sequences for a female, allowing sexing of the bird. In order to obtain distinct CHD-W sequences, a sub-cloning was performed for females of each species. In this fashion, partial sequences of the CHD gene, both -Z and –W, were generated for the species studied. A phylogenetic study was performed using COX-1, CHD-Z and CHD-W sequences and the site “Clustal-Omega”. The method of sexing birds by sequencing was found to be standard and efficient. The COX-1 gene permitted a better resolution of closely related species, while the CHD-Z gene was the most useful for estimating deep phylogenetic relationships.

798	L'oxygénothérapie hyperbare dans le traitement de la paralysie cérébrale : arnaque ou traitement approprié?	Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO) consist of subjecting a patient to elevated atmospheric pressure while the patient breathes 100% oxygen. This approach is considered the accepted treatment of choice for a number of medical conditions with success. In certain other conditions, the efficacy is still yet to demonstrated. In the case of cerebral palsy, the utilization of HBO has raised a number of controversial issues in the studies conducted. It has yet to convince the members of the scientific community at large. This unfortunately has been interpreted as negative despite the positive reproducible evidence. Until now, the Canadian government has had reservations concerning the efficacy of this treatment for cerebral palsy. Elsewhere, in the United States and in Quebec there is a certain interest. Specific events in the eyes of some, lead us to believe that the reticence to recognize Hyperbaric oxygen therapy as an effective treatment of cerebral palsy is more based on politics and economics rather than on the science that is available to support its use.

800	Continuité et discontinuité dans les trajectoires de soins de personnes ayant une problématique complexe de santé : Perceptions d’ergothérapeutes – une étude exploratoire	Since the creation of a health system financed by public funds and managed by the Ministry of Health, the Quebec health network has undergone numerous changes. For example, changes were made in early 2000 in order to improve the accessibility and continuity of healthcare available to Quebecers. Despite the concern of the Ministry to improve continuity of care, problems persist for people with complex health problems. Indeed, individuals struggling with comorbidity – e.g., with both physical and mental health problems – are more likely to experience discontinuities in their health care trajectories (i.e., discontinuity in their access to care), constituting an inadequate response to their needs. To understand the experiences of occupational therapists that serve such clients, an exploratory study was conducted. The purpose of this research was to explore perceptions of occupational therapists about continuity and discontinuity in the care trajectories of these clients. Occupational therapists identified the reasons which, in their opinion, explained the discontinuities in the trajectory of care individuals with complex health problems, and some of the negative consequences of these discontinuities; they also noted ways to improve the continuity of care for these clients. Taking into account the perceptions of occupational therapists is important in order to improve care for people with complex health problems.	ergothérapie , phénoménologie , continuity of care , discontinuities , care trajectories , complex health problems , comorbidity , occupational therapy , holism , phenomenology	en	13816.0
801	Contributions de la maternité à l'état de santé de femmes vivant avec le VIH	The reality of women living with HIV (WLHIV) and who desire to have a child raises a wide range of public health issues and health promotion. To date, studies have mainly focused on epidemiological and biomedical dimensions of motherhood in the context of HIV. Indeed, few studies have taken into consideration the experiences and needs from the perspective of WLHIV and, in particular, the importance and meanings they attach to motherhood. The project of maternity contributes to their meaning of life and to the transformation of their relationship to HIV infection and self-transcendence experiences. This perspective has not been sufficiently explored in the field of health promotion strategies. The general objective of this thesis, based on feminist theories of social construction of motherhood, representations of risk and adaptive coping strategies to HIV, is to analyze the experiences of motherhood in Montreal WLHIV. In terms of methodology, this thesis is based on a secondary analysis of qualitative interviews conducted with 42 French-Canadian, African and Haitian WLHIV who were recruited in one hospital and several community centers. These interviews focused on their daily experiences related to HIV, their social issues, their family and their interpersonal relationships. Data were analyzed and interpreted according to grounded theory principles with an interjudge reliability. A typological analysis was also performed to identify the maternity models present in the discourses, taking in to account two complementary types of analysis: the “relational method centred on the voice” and that of “the logic of action”.  Three scientific papers have been submitted presenting the results of the analysis. The first article describes the presence of three ideological models of motherhood according to some socioeconomical and ethnocultural characteristics (personal growth, social achievement, self-fulfillment and completeness) and their impact on HIV management (HIV treatment strategies, disclosure, children care). The second article examines how women, according to their ideological model of motherhood, appropriate information and advices originating from health professionals and construct the biological risk associated with maternity in the context of HIV infection. In addition, this article investigates the strategies used to achieve their reproductive project in compliance or not with the biomedical guidelines. The third article describes how the maternity project, according to the motherhood models, helped them to transform their perceptions of HIV infection, to find meaning to life in spite of the infection status and to experiment self-transcendence experiences (preserving a status, a role and a social image, transforming their relation to death, facilitating the acceptance of their infection status, giving new orientations to their life). In order to link the data presented in the three papers, an integrative theoretical model is proposed.  Impacts of this study on research and intervention in health promotion as well as knowledge translation propositions are outlined.

802	Le rôle des états prothrombotiques dans l’AVC du jeune adulte	Background: Despite extensive workup, more than 30% of ischemic strokes in young adults remain idiopathic. The role of some prothrombotic factors (PF) in arterial thrombosis remains unclear in previous studies. This may be due to small sample sizes, heterogeneous characteristics of populations studied, or analyzing individual PF with low prevalence. Methods: We conducted a case-control study using a retrospective cohort (2002-2011). From a hospital database, we identified patients with ischemic stroke at age ≤50 years. We excluded patients with incomplete baseline investigation or antiphospholipid syndrome, and those without prothrombotic testing. We compared the prevalence of each PF, as well  as the presence of ≥2 PF (primary analysis) between cases with idiopathic stroke and controls with defined stroke etiology, before and after adjusting for non-prothrombotic risk factors. By subgroup analysis, we compared the presence of ≥1 PF between cases with versus without patent foramen ovale (PFO), between cases or controls with PFO with versus without migraine,  as well as between women (cases versus controls), including oral contraceptives among PF. Results: 502 young ischemic stroke patients were identified. We excluded 108 patients. We analyzed 184 cases and 210 controls (Mean age : 39.2 y-o, 51% male). Prevalence of individual PF did not differ between cases and controls : protein S (0.6%), protein C (3.4%), antithrombin (1.2%) deficiencies, mutant prothrombin (2.5%), factor V Leiden (4.6%), and total anticardiolipin (titers 15-40 units GPL or MPL; 3,3%).  There was no association between the presence of ≥2 PF and idiopathic stroke, before (p=0,48) and after adjusting for non-prothrombotic risk factors (p= 0,74). No differences were observed between subgroups for the presence of ≥1 PF. Conclusion: There is no association between prothrombotic risk factors (analyzed individually or as a group) and idiopathic ischemic stroke in the young, even in those with a PFO or with migraine.

803	L’intégration des jeunes immigrants : une analyse des politiques à la jeunesse orientées vers la population immigrante au Québec	This thesis focuses on the integration of young immigrants in Quebec, as it analyses their inclusion within public policies framework of the province, namely the integration of immigrants and Quebec’s youth policies. In short, our aim is to see how public policies in Quebec address the integration of young immigrant. A brief literature review enables us to observe lots of issues faced by young immigrants in the province, especially at school and on the labour market. The policies presented in this paper describe the different challenges young immigrants who are born of immigrant parents are facing in the province. They propose integration means for young people of immigrant origins.   In this work which is in nature both exploratory and qualitative, we use naturally a qualitative approach. It facilitates the study of policy documents mentioned above relatively to our research question. The literature review is the primary tool upon which the dimensions of integration of immigrants in Quebec; such as French, educational values and employment, are analyzed as specific issues raised by the policy documents. Our findings enable us to observe several results regarding the young people targeted in this study.  The main findings of the study show that these policies focus on French as essential factor of integration. Consequently, the government invests heavily in teaching this language to young immigrants. Other findings show that a vast majority of young newcomers to Quebec in recent years are familiar with French; as they are selected on this basis. However, this majority is not integrated in the labour market. The policies suggest that all interventions towards the youth should focus on creating favorable employment conditions for their integration, while downplaying their migration trajectory as well as their experience from their origin country. These are nevertheless considered necessary for integration.	Jeune immigrant , Immigrant youth , Youth , political integration	en	13785.0

Specifically, my aim is to examine the possibility of all things considered judgments concerning beliefs for which there is a conflict between reasons of distinct kinds (epistemic reasons and pragmatic reasons). This inquiry will mostly concern epistemic instrumentalism, the position holding that one's beliefs are instrumental to one's own objectives and thus, that the rationality of beliefs must be an instrumental rationality. It appears that this position has been the aim of a few criticism in the recent years and my goal is to evaluate the strength of such criticism. If epistemic instrumentalism ends up being a viable thesis, we can expect that there may not be any incommensurability between reasons for belief of different kinds."

805	Les vidéos de gay bashing : des agresseurs à YouTube	This research will study the rise of gay bashing videos since 2013. We define gay bashing videos as videos documenting verbal or physical attacks against individuals perceived by the abusers as being gay, lesbian, bisexual, transsexual or queer. We will however concentrate our study on videos showing attacks against men. These videos can be recorded by the abusers themselves or by witnesses. This rise in gay bashing videos will be situated within a comeback or anti-LGBT feelings and laws in some of the countries where the videos come from and also within anthropological and socio-historical theories about the sources and motivations behind homophobic violence. The corpus will consist of three videos coming from Russia ((«Putin’s Crackdown on LGBT Teens in Russia»), Lybia («Gay torture and violent in Lybia») and the United States («Attack at gay pride event in Detroit») The analysis of the videos will be made in three steps: 1. The analysis of the form and content of the videos. 2. The analysis of their circulation and the different users circulating them online. 3. The analysis of their reception with a particular attention given to the users’ comments on YouTube. We will show how gay bashing videos are creating a rupture with a certain vision of YouTube and other social medias as liberating and sites of self-expression (especially for LGBT people) and how they transform them as sites of humiliations that are tripled by the recording of the event and its circulation on the web. We will then see how the circulation of those videos by different groups and users transforms them according to different political agendas and ideologies, to finally question ourselves, by following the Humiliation Triangle from Donald Klein, on the ambivalent role of the witness (physical or virtual) whose presence is necessary for a humiliation to take place. Finally we will focus on videos of gay bashing testimonies made by the victims themselves who narrate their trauma in front of the camera thus reviving the logic of avowal that we can find in coming out videos. This research will also be an opportunity to develop new methodological and theoretical tools for the study of new medias.	gay bashing , homophobie , humiliation , YouTube , homophobia , new media , queer theory	en	13775.0
806	La confrérie des Dames de la Sainte-Famille de la paroisse Notre-Dame de Montréal (1724-1760) : un lieu élitaire au féminin ?	When it was about of New France's elitism, historians have tended to erase the women from their writings; this concept has long been associated with the male world. The decision to exclude the feminine gent is not surprising when we know that the definitions attached to the elitism, primarily come from the profession as well as the places of people in the institutions or in the structures of power. At that time, most of women haven't held a decisional function; they were maintained, ''thanks'' to patriarchy in the domestic sphere. Despite these findings, the memory is still interested in the relevance of a feminine elite definition. So, we try to show that women in New France also had elite gathering places. To achieve this, we study the journey of the main Officers of the Holy Family Ladies’s brotherhood (Montreal) between 1724 and 1760. In order to know their socio-economic status, this memory is used to know some characteristic elements: the socio-professional status of their fathers and husbands, the amounts of dowries and préciputs in their marriage contracts, the age at first marriage, the births and the infant mortality. These varied indicators show that actually the majority of these ladies came from an elitist environment. To consolidate this conclusion, the memory analyzes the behavior of these women in connection with the distinct characteristic of elites : the networking. Networking is particularly interested in the practice of godmothering ; who are the Officers' sponsors, who are the godmother of their children and from whom are they the godmothers. This last part of memory come to confirm the elitist dimension of Officers of the Holy Family.

807	Les Violettes rouges suivi de L'échec du système des genres dans La Maladie de la mort de Marguerite Duras	The creative writing project titled Les Violettes rouges depicts a young woman seeking vengeance in the nineteenth-century American West. It is a novel that replays and transgresses the codes of the western genre, as its vengeful cowboy protagonist is actually a woman named Lou. Freer than the archetypal western heroes, Lou takes what she desires in what is said to be “masculine” and “feminine”. Through her physique she embodies a powerful and sensual vector of violence. Lou’s acts of rebellion shake the white man’s hierarchical and unjust systems. Through theories of various feminist thinkers and questions of sexual and gender identity, the essay titled L'échec du système des genres dans La Maladie de la mort de Marguerite Duras explores the impossible encounter between the male and femal protagonists in Duras’s novel. The failure of the system both dual and double separating man and woman is expressed through a series of veils and veilings, of blindspots, through a fugitive feminine and, ultimately, through a power reversal. Here, the double and hierarchical definition of gender is questioned since it renders any meeting between the novel’s male and female characters, as well as between the “masculine” and the “feminine”, sterile.

808	Expériences sensibles et suprasensibles, à travers Le bain de Diane de Pierre Klossowski	The present thesis seeks to address, in a reading of the text Le bain de Diane by Pierre Klossowski, the specific modalities through which literature aims to understand the complex ties between concepts of 'immanence' and 'transcendence'. To do so, I begin by introducing the concepts necessary for such an undertaking ⎯ reading authors such as Plato, Apuleius, Pierre Hadot, Gilles Deleuze and Michel Foucault, all of whom have contributed to the concept of the 'demon' as described in Klossowski’s work ⎯ and by introducing the concept of 'simulacrum', a key concept in Klossowsi’s writing. By tracing the creation and representation of these concepts in various texts and then identifying them in Le bain de Diane, I attempt to demonstrate the importance of literary figuration in our complex relationship with concepts of the 'sensitive' and the 'suprasensitive'.

809	Changements corticaux et sous-corticaux des événements du sommeil lent au cours du vieillissement	As demonstrated by recent advancements in the field of neuroscience, sleep is an active and dynamic state in which cohesive neural oscillations organize brain functions. Sleep spindles and slow waves are hallmarks of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and are used as markers on the electroencephalogram to characterize the underlying neural activity. Because of their implication in sleep and cognitive processes, these oscillations are particularly relevant in aging research, as functional challenges to sleep and memory are well known among this population. Normal aging not only reduces the characteristics of NREM sleep oscillations, but it also modifies anatomical and functional measures of brain integrity. Local regulation of NREM sleep oscillations have recently been described, yet few evidence is currently available on this process in aging. The present work aims to characterize the relationship between sleep neurophysiology, normal aging and regional brain activity with the assessment of the topography and hemodynamics of NREM sleep oscillations throughout adulthood. In a first study, sleep spindle density, duration, amplitude and frequency will be assessed in three age groups in relation to brain topography using electroencephalography. In a second study, hemodynamic responses to slow wave events and their modulation by amplitude will be assessed in two age groups using electroencephalography combined with functional magnetic resonance imaging. Our results can be summarized as follows: 1) age effects on sleep spindle characteristics showed an intriguing dichotomy between anterior and posterior cortical areas; 2) hemodynamic variations related to slow waves were observed in a wide array of cortical and subcortical regions in older individuals. These results suggest the functional reorganization of neural activity during NREM sleep throughout adulthood, support NREM sleep oscillations as useful and sensible biomarkers of brain aging, and promote further research on age-related changes in synaptic plasticity, cell restoration and sleep maintenance.

810	L'apport des personnages virtuels simulant différentes dispositions affectives à l'évaluation des intérêts sexuels	Penile plethysmography is considered the most objective method to assess adult men's sexual interests. However, a growing number of researchers underline the poor correspondence between the stimuli used during this type of assessment and reality. It is proposed to try to overcome this issue by using computer generated virtual characters that present a variety of affective dispositions during plethysmographic assessments. These stimuli have never been used in the assessment of child molesters' sexual interests. This thesis is composed of two articles that aim at supporting the use of this type of stimuli during plethysmographic assessments. In order to reach this goal, men who have or not engaged in sexual contact with children were recruited so that they could be compared.  A first empirical study is bipartite. On one hand, it aims to determine in a student sample whether the affective dispositions simulated by the virtual characters represent what was intended. Its second goal is to determine the ability of the charcarters to generate a sexual arousal profile representative of non-deviant men. The second experimental study focuses on comparing profiles of erectile responses recorded to the virtual characters and determining their ability to discriminate individuals according to their group membership.  Overall, results support the use of these stimuli during plethysmographic assessments. They demonstrate that the virtual characters simulate intended affective dispositions as well as their ability to generate profiles of sexual arousal and deviance differentials representative of group membership. This research project presents the advantages of using virtual characters that simulate varying affective dispositions in the assessment of child molesters' sexual interests and proposes interesting avenues in terms of assessment and treatment with this population.	penile plethysmography , virtual characters , affective dispositions , affordances , child molesters , deviant sexual interests	en	13735.0
811	Analyse de maillages surfaciques par construction et comparaison de modèles moyens et par décomposition par graphes s’appuyant sur les courbures discrètes : application à l’étude de la cornée humaine	This thesis comprises three parts. The first two parts concern the development of methods for the construction of mean geometric models and for model comparison. These approaches are applied to the human cornea for the construction of atlases and a robust biometric study. The third part focuses on a generic method for the extraction of information in a mesh. This approach is based on discrete differential properties for building a graph structure to extract features using a semantic description.  Conventional anatomical atlases (paper or CD-ROM) are limited by the fact they generally show the anatomy of a single individual who does not necessarily represent the population from which they originate. To address the limitations of conventional atlases, we propose in the first part of this thesis to construct a 3D digital atlas containing the average characteristics and variability of the morphology of an organ, especially that of the human cornea. Several issues are addressed, such as the construction of an average cornea and the comparison of corneas. Currently, there are few studies with these objectives because the matching of corneal surfaces is a non-trivial problem. In addition to help to develop a better understanding of the corneal anatomy, 3D models of normal corneas can be used to detect any significant deviation from the norm, thereby allowing for an early diagnosis of diseases or abnormalities using the shape of the cornea.  The second part of this thesis aims to develop a method for recognizing a surface from a group of surfaces using their 3D acquisitions in a biometric application pertinent to the cornea. The concept behind this method is to quantify the difference between each surface and a given surface and to determine the threshold for recognition. This threshold depends on normal variations within the same subject and noise due to the acquisition system. The surfaces are randomly trimmed and pierced ; moreover, there is no common landmark on the surfaces. Two complementary methods are proposed. The first method consists of the computation of the volume between the surfaces after performing geometrical matching and the use of this volume as a criterion of similarity. The second approach is based on a decomposition of the surfaces into spherical harmonics using the coefficients as shape descriptors to compare the two surfaces. Each result of the proposed methods is compared to the most recent method described in the literature, with the benefits and disadvantages of each one described in detail. A cascading methodology using both methods to combine the advantages of each method is also proposed.  The third and final part of this thesis focuses on a new method for decomposing 3D triangulated meshes into graphs. We use discrete curvature maps as the shape descriptor to split the mesh in eight different categories (peak, ridge, saddle ridge, minimal, saddle valley, valley, pit and flat). Next, an adjacency graph is built with a node for each patch. Because all categories of patches cannot be adjacent in a continuous context, intermediate junctions are added to ensure the continuous consistency between patches. These graphs are used to extract geometric characteristics described by patterns that allow for the detection of specific regions in a 3D model or recurrent characteristics. This decomposition method, being generic, can be used in many applications to analyze geometric models, especially in the context of the cornea.	surfaces , geometric modeling , meshes , corneas , anatomical atlas , corneal biometry , corneal topographer , differential geometry , discrete curvatures , shape descriptor	en	13715.0
812	Les historiens français et britanniques devant la responsabilité de l’échec des négociations tripartites de 1939 : étude historiographique de 1961 à 2011	In 1939, France and Great Britain realized that stopping Hitler’s aggression in Europe would require a common front. Such an endeavour brought them to consider the Soviet Union as a possible ally. Despite four months of negotiations, the three countries could not reach any agreement. This failure was dramatic since on 23 August, a non-aggression pact was signed between Berlin and Moscow and, one week later, Germany invaded Poland. The Second World War had started. Since the 1990s, many historians argued that Western historiography about these failed negotiations has been influenced by Cold War propaganda and the idea that the Soviets never had the intention of allying with Western Europe. However, after a more careful look at studies published between 1961 and 2011 by French and British historians, this thesis demonstrates that, since 1961, in both Great Britain and France, the interpretations of the Soviet Union’s role in those negotiations were more free of ideological presuppositions than is often claimed. The publication of Taylor’ The Origins of the Second World War and the controversy that followed radically changed the nature of the debate and allowed the emergence of theses strikingly similar to those argued currently. These suggest that the Soviet leaders prioritized allying with the Entente at least until the end of July and that France and, most notably, Great Britain’s foreign policy caused the failure of the tripartite negotiations.	1939 , France , relations internationales , 1939 , origin of the Second World War , historiography , USSR , France , Great Britain , international relations	en	13709.0
813	Développement d'une méthode de quantification des varicosités synaptiques et asynaptiques établies par les neurones dopaminergiques	Dopamine neurons (DA) of the Substantia Nigra compacta (SNc) and Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA) are able to develop axon terminals that are either synaptic or non-synaptic in terms of their structure. No method other than electron microscopy was previously developed to quantify synaptic and non-synaptic axonal varicosities established by DA neurons. The main objective of this project was to develop a method for the quantification and analysis of synaptic and non-synaptic terminals established by cultured DA neurons. We hypothesized that synapses should be visualized by the colocalisation of presynaptic proteins such as synaptotagmin 1 (SYT1) and postsynaptic markers like the postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95).               To perform this, we prepared primary DA neurons cultures from neurons obtained from the ventral mesencephalon of TH-GFP transgenic mice. We then used immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy to localize markers of the pre and postsynaptic compartments. Images were quantified using the Image-J software.                Our results show that the majority of axon terminals established by DA neurons contain the presynaptic marker SYT1. However, only a minority are associated with the postsynaptic marker PSD95, compatible with previous in vivo results. In comparison, glutamatergic neurons from the cortex establish a majority of terminals associated with a postsynaptic marker.                Our results validate the establishment of an experimental strategy allowing quantification of the proportion of synaptic and non-synaptic contacts established by DA neurons, a technique that we plan to use to explore the molecular mechanisms of synapse formation by these neurons.

814	Bougainville, Lévis, Vaudreuil : trajets dans les historiographies de la guerre de Sept Ans	Very popular since the 1980s, studies on collective memory have stimulated interest in historiography and especially in the construction of heroic figures. The thesis follows this trend in studying how a multinational historiography treated three French officers of the Seven Years’ War’s North American theatre. We observe how Vaudreuil, Bougainville and Lévis have fared at the hands of historians from Great Britain, France, the United States and English and French Canada, from the eighteenth century to the present. The purpose of the study is to isolate the varying perspectives from which historians of different times and national allegiance have examined the three figures. In the end, the three men were seen to incarnate three contrasting, variously interpreted postures. Since historians were particularly sensitive to what they saw as national conflicts, they judged their heroes accordingly. Vaudreuil, the Canadian-born governor of Canada, thus became the champion of his “country”; Bougainville, French-born future navigator and protagonist of the Enlightenment who wrote disparagingly about the colony, was judged on these opinions; while Lévis, a Frenchman who was more discreet in his writings, was evaluated above all as the victor of the battle of Sainte-Foy in 1760.

815	Constitution de l’univers discursif de la prostitution au Québec : enjeux autour de la sexualité dans les médias québécois à la lumière du projet de loi C-36	This thesis aims to explore how discourses around sexuality were created and circulated in the Québec media following the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision to strike down the prostitution laws in December 2013 (Canada (Attorney General) v. Bedford, 2013 SCC 72). Using discourse analysis and drawing on feminist theory in order to conceptualize sexuality in regards to sex class systems and sexual dynamics, the thesis addresses rival discourses in a time frame that follows the striking down of the laws up until when Bill C-36 was introduced by the Conservative government. Media discourses and the regulating systems that they entail (privileged voices, oriented coverage, framed debates etc.) all help create certain ideas around sexuality whilst simultaneously normalizing them. With the input of numerous social agents (politicians, women’s groups, academics, prostituted women and lawyers), the rival discourses set around morality and choice in sexuality fed a public debate built on a similar antagonism to that of the feminist “sex wars”. This thesis understands these discourses framed within the debate of prostitution as constitutive of current understandings of sexuality and sex class systems.

816	Rôle du facteur de transcription Gfi1b au cours de l’hématopoïèse précoce	Growth factor independent 1b (GFI1b) is a transcription factor implicated in the regulation of hematopoiesis. It is highly expressed in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and throughout the differentiation of erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages. Using a CreLox system, we have generated mice in which GFI1b is conditionally deleted in megakaryocytic lineages. These mice exhibit a strong proliferation of immature megakaryocytes, which are unable to produce platelets. We were unable to confirm the results of a previously published study from our group, which reported an increase of hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow using a different mouse model. However, in agreement with this publication, an increase in the circulating HSC pool can be detected in our GFI1b knockout mice. A preliminary analysis of the molecular role of GFI1b suggests that this transcription factor might be implicated in the circadian regulation of HSC mobilization in the blood. Finally, our experiments on the biological effects of the deletion of GFI1b in the adult murine hematopoietic compartment allowed us to better understand the role of GFI1b in hematopoiesis, and to confirm the major contribution of GFI1b to the development of megakaryocytes and the production of mature platelets.

817	La Lanterne d’Arthur Buies : analyse du discours pamphlétaire et de sa réception dans le milieu journalistique	La Lanterne, written in Montreal by Arthur Buies from 1868 to 1869 and inspired by Rochefort’s La Lanterne, diverges from newspapers published at that time, when the clergy - who controlled most of them - imposes upon Catholics obedience to the authorities. By publishing La Lanterne, Buies opposes French-Canadian newspapers not only through his criticisms towards them, but also through his choice to write it as a pamphlet, a literary genre that confronts the standards from that period by being written in a style close to spoken language and essentially based on denunciation. Although not officially censored, the polemist is under pressure from the clergy and the conservative press, which affects his project of turning his newspaper into an organ for the youth. Reconstructing the history of La Lanterne and analysing the text, in comparison with the 1884 reedition, allow us to identify the expression of Buies’ ambition, in opposition to the more discreet signs of the difficulties he had to face while writing his journal. The polemist portrays himself in interaction with his opponents and his readers. Thus, the study of the response La Lanterne received from other newspapers shows there was little reaction and that those who wrote about it discredit the publication. Buies was in fact struggling with the absence of a true interlocutor. Our analysis of the literary dimension of La Lanterne brings a better comprehension of Buies’ goals and the tools he intended to use to transform the press - and, by that, the Canadian youth. By looking at the response Buies received, we also want to highlight how the French-Canadian journalistic community worked and understand the part Buies played in it.

818	L'anticipation syndicale des restructurations d'entreprise : une étude de cas dans le secteur de la fabrication et l'emballage de verre	Over the last few years, market globalization has radically changed business activity and production across the world. Hence forward, firms have turned advantageously to company restructuring in order to remain competitive. Traditionally, company restructuring consisted in job cutback on unprofitable sites, but today various forms coexist such as site closures, relocations, mergers and acquisitions (Rouleau,2000) and (AgirE,2008). Consequently, company restructuring represent an important issue for union action when trade unions are faced to cope with complex multi-dimensional, multi-level and multi-stakeholders processes. Union response to restructuring processes always develops in a context of power asymmetry where temporal and spatial dimensions of company restructuring are driven by employers. Therefore, trade unions respond and adapt their own strategies around this new economic reality. Union anticipation of company restructuring activities appears to be an innovating strategy by allowing unions to alleviate or better still, prevent negative consequences of restructuring activities. The objective of this research is to examine the factors impacting on anticipation of restructuring to determine for unions the conditions associated with a successful approach. To this end, two analysis models have been retained. The first model, Levesque and Murray`s Union Power Resources (2003), describes unions anticipation of restructuring in terms of its capacity of action at the local level. The second analysis model, AgirE (2008), explains the importance of allowing time and space to the union for anticipating company restructuring.   The independent variables of this analysis model are the following: firm characteristics, territorial characteristics and employer`s restructuring strategy.  This research has been undertaken as a case study. It has been carried out on a critical case of union anticipation which took place during years 2004-2005 in a Quebec manufacturing plant. Interviews were conducted with the plant`s union representative, with one former manager and with two important community stakeholders.   Results of our research unequivocally demonstrate that the capacity of action of the local union is a key factor which allowed to explain why a strategic and operational anticipation of internal restructuring was possible in this glass manufacturing and packaging plant. Despite firm characteristics unfavorable to union`s involvement, the local union was successful in establishing its own sphere of action which allowed the firm to avoid a potential medium to long term plant closure.   Territorial characteristics favorable to concerted action among the various stakeholders in the territory where the plant is located have proved to be a critical factor in the union`s anticipation of the plant`s restructuring activity  Key words:   (1)Anticipation, (2) Company restructuring, (3) Globalization, (4) Manufacturing sector,  (5) Quebec, (6) Strategy, (7) Union	anticipation , Company restructuring , Globalization , Manufacturing sector , Strategy , Union	en	13649.0
819	Le Verre de Charlemagne : rencontres méditerranéennes	The so-called ‘Cup of Charlemagne,’ today in the Musée des Beaux-Arts of Chartres, was kept for centuries in the treasury of the nearby church of the Madeleine de Châteaudun. The enamelled and gilt glass can be dated and localized to Syria at the end of the twelfth or beginning of the thirteenth century; its gilt copper base was added towards the end of the thirteenth century, in France. A number of gilt and enamelled glasses similarly circulated around the Mediterranean during this period, and the roles these objects played in forging relationships between East and West are here demonstrated to be various and complex.  The current project thus aims to retrace the journey taken by the Cup of Charlemagne across continents and across the centuries, with the aim of demonstrating the importance of the object’s double identity as a product of both East and West. Thus, the means by which the Syrian glass was integrated into its new use context in France will be given particular attention. The origin and technique of enamelled and gilded glass in general will first be treated, then the creation of the Cup of Charlemagne in particular, before turning to the historical context for the transfer of this astonishingly fragile glass across the Mediterranean. The study will probe the ‘Christianisation’ of such Islamic objects, and will treat the various metamorphoses they withstood once having reached Western Europe. A variety of other enamelled glasses that similarly reached Europe in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries will be considered alongside the Cup of Charlemagne to enrich and flesh out its history.

820	Effets cellulaires de l’activation de ligases de l’ubiquitine par la protéine lysosomale LITAF	LITAF (lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor-alpha factor), a lysosomal protein, possesses two PPXY motifs which are able to interact with a specific subgroup comprised of three ubiquitin ligases. These ligases play a role in the ubiquitination and degradation of several cellular proteins in lysosomes and proteasomes. The aim of this study was to show that LITAF activates these ligases and to investigate the consequences of the activation of these ligases on their substrates. To do so, in vivo and in vitro ubiquitination assays were conducted in the presence of LITAF and the appropriate ligases and substrates. Activation of the ligases was measured by their self-ubiquitination rate and activation of their substrates was measured by their ubiquitination and degradation rates. Our results show that the activity of the ligases is increased in the presence of LITAF and that ubiquitination and degradation of the substrates are partially increased. Thus, LITAF might play a role in the regulation of ubiquitin ligases. The importance of these results lies in the fact that expression and intracellular localization of LITAF are affected in several pathologies. Our results bring new insights into the physiological role of this protein and could partly explain how the altered expression of LITAF affects cellular balance.

821	La communauté du dehors : imaginaire social et représentations du crime au Québec (XIXe-XXe siècle)	Quebec society, like all societies, has its own legendary crimes and criminals. Yet if these famous faits divers have been recently made into historiographical re-enactments, the cultural and historic manner in which they are transformed from local news reports into national myths – what we call mecanisms of “ légendarisation ” –, is practically unknown. It is this mutation that this thesis examines : drawing from four famous crimes of the 18th and 19th centuries (the Seigneur of Kamouraska’s murder [1839] as well as the crimes committed by “ La Corriveau ” [1763], by the “ docteur l’Indienne ” [1829] and by the “ brigands du Cap-Rouge ” [1834-1835]), our analysis recollects their two-hundred-year-long genealogy into collective memory. Through this collective memory, a complex discourse system arises for each crime : by intertwining newspaper reports and stories from oral and written traditions, social imagination manufactures great antagonist figures, incarnations of evil and avatars of the devil from ordinary criminal acts. This vast antagonizing process is in fact dependent on a whole epoch – the 19th century – where, in the western world, “ crime ” was suddenly placed at the heart of all social and political preoccupations. This era seemingly created a literary craze for crime, as well as a whole arsenal of specialized notions, ideas and technologies designed to understand, mesure and eliminate criminality. During the Lower Canada period, the phenomenon spreads across this side of the Atlantic. In the wake of this movement, the great criminals who impacted the collective mind are made to become especially rallying imaginary enemies : figures of a radical otherness, they become the foil against which Quebec society, from the 19th century onwards, instituted itself.

822	Representations of curanderismo in Chicana/o texts	My dissertation focuses on representations of curanderismo in Chicana/o texts. A healing tradition, a worldview, a system of beliefs and practices of diverse origins, curanderismo addresses medical, religious, cultural, social and political needs of the Mexican American people on both individual and communal level. In my discussion of literary texts (Rudolfo Anaya’s Bless Me, Ultima, Pat Mora’s selected poems, Cherrie Moraga’s play The Hungry Woman: A Mexican Medea) and of the 2014 academic course on curanderismo at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, which I approach as a cultural text, curanderismo reflects complex, often ambiguous ways of representing Chicana/o search for self-identity, self-affirmation and self-empowerment, growing out of a long history of subjugation and discrimination. In the texts under analysis curanderismo assumes the role of a powerful metaphor of the possibility of bringing together a variety of values, attitudes, concepts and notions with the ultimate aim of celebrating the potential of the Chicana/o self.

823	Changements démographiques et inégalités éducatives à Ouagadougou	The relationship between the family size decline and children human’s capital investment has been well-studied for several decades. In most developed and emergent countries, several studies showed that the reduction in family size seems to increase the investment in the children’s education, arguing the dilution effect of each additional child on family resources. More recently, empirical studies shows this reduction tends also to improve substantially schooling levels in Sub-Saharan Countries, mostly in urban areas. Nevertheless, little is known about the distribution of these potential benefits neither how that may affect existing educational inequalities, particularly in the context of urban sub-Saharan Africa. Our study focuses on exploring the demographic dimension of educational inequalities in the context of Ouagadougou, Capital of Burkina Faso, where the fertility transition is actually ongoing. More precisely, this study seeks to understand the effect of reduction in family size on intra-family inequalities in education and secondly, on the reproduction of educational inequalities over time and generations. For that purpose, we developed on one hand a conceptual framework to understand the mechanism by which reduction in family could influence on education inequalities. Secondly, we have undertaken empirical analysis to test our hypotheses. The empirical results are presented in three scientific papers, which based on data from the Demographic Surveillance System and Health and Dentrend project.  Findings from the first paper suggest that the relationship between the family size and education has shifted over time, according to the socioeconomic context. Indeed, the generations that are grown in a socioeconomic context where formal education was not valued in the labor market and the economic contributions of children were substantial as farm laborer, the relationship was very low, positive, and not statistically significant. By contrast, for recent generations, we observed that the relationship is negative and highly significant. In addition, the results of this paper also suggest that the family of origin impacts on the women’s reproductive behavior. Those whose original family was not poor and well-educated have smaller families. In turn, their children are also more educated. That suggests a potential leverage effect of the reduction in family size on the intergenerational transmission of socioeconomic disadvantages, particularly in terms of education. The second paper takes a look at intra-family inequalities in education in Ouagadougou. Do all the children in a family benefit equitably from the improved conditions brought about by limiting their number? The results suggest that generally smaller families allow more investment in children’s education. Nonetheless, oldest girls are less educated than their peers. The deficit remains even after considering only monogamous family households or after controlling the composition of the sibling. The absence of the mothers at home eased by the reduction in family size and the men’s failure to share household chores could explain this situation. Unfortunately, we were unable to control for economic activity of mothers. Finally, in the last paper, we evaluated the net impact of having been fostered in the past on the education of young adolescents (16-20 years old), comparing those who have been fostered to their sibling who has never been fostered. In this article, contrary to previous studies, we have considered the heterogeneous aspect of fostering by differentiating by sex, the mother's relationship with the host household and the age at the time of fostering. The results show a negative impact of child fostering on education, even after controlling for the endogeneity problem. However, this negative effect is greater on girls. The life’s conditions of fostered girls in host household could explain this differential effect. Finally, in the third and final article, we examined the effect of having been entrusted the education of children, comparing those who have been entrusted to other members of their siblings who have never been entrusted. In this article, contrary to previous studies, we have considered the heterogeneous aspect of fostering by differentiating by sex, the mother's relationship with the host and the ages at which the child has been entrusted. The results show that having been given in the past adversely affects the schooling of children. However, after considering some interacting variables, this negative effect remains strong and significant only for adolescent girls. These girls seem to fit the profile of additional hands for household chores, which are needed due the demographic deficits consequent to the reduction in family size in urban areas.

824	"The plant ovule omics : an integrative approach for 
pollen−pistil interactions and pollen tube guidance studies 
in solanaceous species"	In flowering plants, the ovary is the female reproductive organ that interacts extensively with the male gametophyte during pollen tube (PT) growth, guidance, reception, discharge and gamete fusion. The process begins when numerous ovule-expressed genes are activated when pollen lands on the stigma. To explore the ovular signals that have a great impact on successful pollen–pistil interactions, especially the secreted molecules that mediate species-specific signalling events, ovule mRNA expression and protein secretion profiles were studied in Solanum chacoense, a wild diploid potato species. Solanum chacoense has undergone extensive interspecific hybridization with sympatric solanaceous species that greatly facilitates the study of species-specific pollen–ovule interactions and evolution. In this project, three ovule conditions were studied: wild-type mature ovules, slightly immature ovules at two days before anthesis (2DBA), and frk1 mutant ovules that lack an embryo sac (ES). RNA-seq was performed on S. chacoense ovules to provide a scaffold assembly comprising 33852 CDS-containing sequences, then to provide read counts for differential gene expression analyses on three ovule conditions as well as on leaf. Compared to wild-type ovules, 818 genes were downregulated in frk1 ovules. A subset of 284 genes was concurrently under-expressed in 2DBA ovules, suggestive of their specific involvement in late stages of ES maturation (female gametophyte (FG), FG6 to FG7 developmental stage), as well as in PT guidance processes, as neither frk1 nor 2DBA ovules attract semi in vivo-grown PTs. Of these 284, 21% encoded cysteine-rich peptides (CRPs). Using de novo assembled ovule transcriptomes of two close relatives, S. gandarillasii and S. tarijense, an orthology survey was conducted on these CRPs, revealing their highly polymorphic nature among species and rapid evolution. Interestingly, novel cysteine motifs unique to this family were also uncovered. As compared to parallel studies in Arabidopsis, S. chacoense was found to possess a highly divergent ES transcriptome, in terms of both functional categories and individual ortholog similarities. Although glycosylation is not required for micropylar guidance cues to attract PTs in Arabidopsis, Torenia or maize, glycosylated ovule extracts from S. chacoense showed enhanced PT guidance competency by 18%. This is the first time a positive regulation between glycosylation and ovular PT guidance has been observed. As a complement to the transcriptomic approach, a proteomic approach using secreted proteins from the ovule (secretome) was employed to identify proteins involved in pollen–pistil interactions. Ovule exudates were collected from mature ovules (PT attracting) and immature ovules at 2DBA (PT nonattracting), using a novel tissue free-gravity extraction method (tf-GEM), which efficiently reduced the cytosolic contamination to less than 1%. Through mass spectrometry analyses, a total of 305 ovule-secreted proteins (OSPs) were identified, of which 58% were considered ovule-specific when compared to secretome studies conducted in other plant tissues. The secretion of 128 OSPs was upregulated in mature ovules vs. immature ovules. These OSPs were considered as candidate proteins involved in late ovule maturation and PT guidance. This study demonstrated that the ES maturation from FG6 to FG7 stages influenced the secretion status of 44% of ovule secretome. Surprisingly, the majority (83%) of these proteins were not regulated at the RNA level, vindicating this novel approach in the study of PT guidance as a robust complement to transcriptomic studies. Among all identified guidance-related ovular signals from the transcriptomic and proteomic approaches described above, we focused on the evaluation of the involvement of CRPs in ovular PT guidance of S. chacoense, due to the implication of various CRPs in pollen–pistil interactions and, especially, in PT guidance. A total of 28 CRPs were present in PT attracting ovules while being low or absent in nonattracting ovules, at the mRNA and/or protein secretion levels. Of these, 17 CRPs were expressed in bacteria and purified in sufficient amount for PT guidance assays. However, while ovule exudates were shown to induce PT chemotropism in the bead assay, refolded candidates did not show guidance competency. Since the use of eukaryotic protein expression systems might lead to better refolding and higher protein activity, the remaining candidates will be expressed in both yeast and plant-based expression systems and tested for their ability to attract PTs in a semi in-vivo assay, in order to lead us toward the isolation of PT guidance chemoattractants in solanaceous species like S. chacoense.

825	Essays on education and family planning	Human capital is an important factor of growth and development. According to UNICEF, human capital consists in giving to each child the opportunity not only to survive, but also the necessary conditions to develop and realize its potential. Based on household surveys in 21 countries in West and Cen- tral Africa, UNICEF estimate that nearly 32 millions children who have the official school age are not enrolled in school. Further, 17 millions school chil- dren are at high risk of exclusion. Regarding child Health, poor indicators also characterize this region. Indeed, according to WHO, the child death is increasingly concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa where children are over 15 times more chance to die before age five than children in developed regions. Economic difficulties appear as the first explanation of the obstacles to im- proving the well being of children both on the supply side and the demand side. This thesis ties together three essays on the link between armed conflict, education and child mortality and also on the relationship between fertility and children’s education in urban areas. The first chapter identifies the link between armed conflict and children out- comes. Using nationally representative household surveys, I exploit temporal and geographical variations of the 1999–2011 Ivorian political instability to identify its causal effect on children’s schooling and child mortality. The re- sults show that individuals who lived in conflict areas and who reached the official age to be enrolled in school within the period of the instability have a 10% lower probability of being enrolled in school. Students who spent their school years during the conflict and who lived in an affected area experienced a lag in schooling attainment of more than a year. Older students or those who were likely to be in high school during the conflict underwent a loss in schooling attainment of nearly two years. In addition, results show that the Ivorian armed conflict increased the mortality of children under five by at viii ix least 3%. My results also suggest that the deterioration of living conditions and the limitation of health service use during the conflict contribute to ex- plain these adverse effects. Robustness tests including a placebo tests suggest that the results are not driven by preexisting differences across conflict and non-conflict areas. The second chapter investigates the intra-urban disparities toward child quantity- quality trade-off by focusing on the case of Ouagadougou (the capital of Burkina Faso). In this city, at least 33% of the 2 million inhabitants live in informal settlements. This subpopulation lacks social infrastructure and has extremely low education attainments. Through a two-step control function approach, we investigate disparities in the Child Quantity Quality trade-off between formal and informal settlements in this city. We focus on differences in families’ behavior towards schooling in the two settlement types through children educational attainment. We find evidence of a child quantity and quality tradeoff in both settlements. By adapting long’s (2009) group com- parisons multiple testing procedures, we find that the trade-off is more acute in informal settlements. Moreover, if we assume that the endogeneity of the number of children is essentially due to the reverse causality, the results sug- gest some evidence that in the formal settlements parents take into account the children schooling in the decision of their number of children but its not the case in the informal ones. Additional results suggest the existence of settlement-specific unobserved heterogeneity, such as school quality and set- tlement peer effects. In term of policy recommendations, these results show that efforts to keep children in school should not be directed only toward rural areas. In addition to reducing schooling costs in some urban areas, particularly informal areas, and special emphasis should be put on raising awareness about the benefits of education for children and familiesÕ welfare. Finally, from the methodological point of view, our results show the impor- tance of accounting for unobserved heterogeneity among subpopulations in implementing policies, and analyzing the impact of those policies. Given the negative relationship between family size and children’s education, the third chapter explores the role of the types of contraceptive methods in birth spacing in urban areas. By distinguishing women from formal and informal settlements types, it investigate intra-urban disparities in the link between the type of contraceptive method and birth spacing in Ouagadougou x (Capital of Burkina Faso). The results show that both modern and tradi- tional methods increase birth spacing and decrease the probability that a next birth occurs in less than 24 months after the precedent one. Taking into ac- count the unobserved invariant characteristics do not significantly affect the magnitude of the coefficient for modern contraceptive use in both settlement types. However, in the informal settlement type, considering women fixed effect increase significantly the magnitude of the effect of traditional meth- ods. Traditional norms, the perception of family planning and the role of woman partner might contribute to explain this difference of behaviour be- tween the two settlement types. Therefore, to improve contraceptive use and their effectiveness, it is essential to prioritize actions depending to the type of subpopulation even in urban areas.

826	La controverse autour du code des personnes et de la famille au Mali : enjeux et stratégies des acteurs	"The objective of this thesis is to analyze and understand the dynamics surrounding the controversy following the adoption of the Code of Persons and Family in Mali in 2009. It is particularly interested by the main issues, that is to say, the questions at the root of this controversy and the strategies implemented by different social actors (Islamic organizations and their allies, on the one hand, and women's organizations and theirs, on the other) in order to influence the process. In addition to the “why” and the “how” of this controversy, our research focuses on the understanding of the process assessment made by the actors involved, the feeling that animates them at the end of this long process, their appreciation of their experience, and their vision of the future.    To investigate this issue, we have chosen collective action protest's approach, which inspired both theories of collective action, and those of social movements and protest dynamic. In order to analyze the stakes of this controversy, the strategies used by the actors and their assessment of the process, we opted for a qualitative approach. In addition to the gray literature, newspaper articles, audio and audiovisual materials on the subject, our field work during four months in the Malian capital has allowed us to make several interviews with the actors involved in this process. Stretching from 1996 to 2011, namely for sixteen years, the redaction of the Persons and Family Law in Mali was a long, complex, unusual and controversial process. Our research findings reveal that several issues, notably those social, were at the heart of this controversy:  ""duty obedience"" of the wife to her husband, legalization of religious marriage, gender ""equality"" with regard to inheritance, and recognition of the illegitimate child were the questions that have generated the most debate. If during the whole process, questions related to gender equality, respect for women and children’s rights were the arguments defended by women's organizations and their allies, those relating to the respect of religious (Islamic), societal or sociocultural values of Mali were, on the contrary, put forward by Islamic’s organizations and their allies.   Thus, if the discourse of women's organizations focused mainly on the ""respect of gender equality"" in accordance with international commitments signed by Mali, the discourse of Islamic organizations has, however, focused on the ""respect of Islamic and socio-cultural values"" of Mali. As for communication channels, women's CSOs have focused on traditional channels like press, radio, conferences, among others. Islamic CSOs have also used these channels, but they have distinguished themselves from women's CSOs by using also sermons. Generally organized in mosques and other spaces designated for that purpose, these sermons have consecrated the victory of Islamic CSOs. Islamic radios have also played an important role in the transmission of their messages.  Concerning the strategies of action, the collective action that changed the situation in favor of the Islamic OSCs (resending the code for a second reading, inclusion of their ideas) was the meeting of August 22nd, 2009 in Bamako, preceded by protest marches in the national capital and all regional capitals of the country. As for women's CSOs, they have only carried out some classic (or usual) actions like petitions, advocacy-lobbying, conferences and debates, to the point that some observers spoke of ""inaction strategy"" on their part. The analysis also revealed the use of unusual strategies of threats and intimidation by some actors of Islamic camp towards to the supporters of the code. If each group of actors has formed alliances with local actors, women's CSOs are the only ones to recognize alliances with external actors. Today, if most members of Islamic CSOs don't hide their satisfaction with their ""victory"" and present themselves like ""savior of the Malian nation"", most members of women CSOs, meanwhile, say that they are very ""disappointed"" and ""indignant"" against the adoption of the current code. They don’t understand why from a ""progressive code "", Mali ended up with a ""retrograde and discriminatory code"" towards women.   The thesis confirms the difficult reconciliation of customary law, Islamic law and modern law, but it also suggests the idea that the law remains an expression of power relations and domination. Finally, our research confirms the now unavoidable influence of religious actors on the public policy making process in Mali."	actions collectives , protestations , alliances , Mali , Family law , issues , collective actions , protest , alliances , communication strategies , organizations of women's civil society , organizations of Islamic’s civil society , Mali	en	13576.0
827	Effet de la classe ou expériences scolaires? : étude sur l'élaboration et la variation des aspirations scolaires réalistes des étudiant(e)s canadien(ne)s au regard des études universitaires	This thesis investigates the social phenomenon of the elaboration and adjustment of realistic educational aspirations for high school graduates during the ten-year period preceding graduation. Its aim is to determine which factors most affect realistic edu-cational aspirations in the light of two major sociological concepts: Pierre Bourdieu’s concept of habitus and Raymond Boudon’s concept of rationality. In short, this thesis explores the manner in which factors linked to educational experience (the baseline for rational calculating) and to sociocultural heritage (habitus) may affect the cons-truction of so-called realistic educational aspirations and their adjustment The analyses are done in two distinct parts. The first part consists of logistic regres-sion analysis using cross-sectional data drawn from the Youth in Transition Survey (YITS). The aim of this analysis is to identify the main factors that enter into consid-eration during the construction of educational aspirations for Canadian students ap-proaching high school graduation. The second part, also using YITS data, examines this phenomenon with a longitudinal perspective in order to identify which factors affect aspirations throughout Canadian students’ educational experience. This is done using generalized estimating equations (GEE) regression.  The results show that young students, predictably, use rational calculation when con-structing and adjusting realistic educational aspirations, but also that such a calcula-tion is highly influenced by the habitus, especially by the parents’ education level (institutionalized cultural capital). Moreover, the students’ calculation proves to be significantly constrained, when assessing the risks of following different educational aspirations, by the self-reported overall high school average and additional grades in the first years of a postsecondary studies.

828	Role of histone methylation in the regulation of COX-2, iNOS, and mPGES-1 gene expression in human chondrocytes: Implication for Osteoarthritis	Osteoarthritis (OA) is a disabling disease classified as the most common form of arthritis worldwide. It is characterized by cartilage degeneration, synovium inflammation, and subchondral bone remodeling resulting in a loss of joint function. These structural and functional changes are due to numerous factors.  Cytokines, prostaglandins (PG), and reactive oxygen species are the major mediators implicated in the pathophysiology of OA. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a major pro-inflammatory cytokine that plays a crucial role in OA. IL-1 induces the expression of Cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2), microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), as well as their products prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and nitric oxide (NO). These are critical mediators of the inflammatory response during OA causing pain, swelling, and joint tissue destruction.  The activation of these pro-inflammatory genes results from different changes at the level of chromatin known as epigenetic modifications. Epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation and histone modifications play a crucial role in gene expression. Among these modifications, histone methylation/demethylation is the most critical one. Histone methylation/demethylation is mediated by two types of enzymes: histone methyltransferases (HMT) and histone demethylases (HDM) which can either activate or repress transcription. It is therefore necessary to understand the molecular mechanisms which underlie the regulation of COX-2, mPGES-1, and iNOS expression.   The objective of this study is to investigate whether histone methylation/demethylation can modulate COX-2, mPGES-1, and iNOS expression in IL-1 induced OA human chondrocytes.   We demonstrated that histone H3 lysine K4 (H3K4) methylation by SET-1A contributes to IL-1-induced COX-2 and iNOS expression in human OA Chondrocytes. We showed also that LSD1-mediated demethylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) contributes to IL-1β-induced mPGES-1 expression in human OA chondrocytes.  We found that levels of SET-1A and LSD1 expression are elevated in OA cartilage as compared with normal cartilage. Our data demonstrates, for the first time, the implication of histone methylation/demethylation in COX-2, mPGES-1, and iNOS regulation suggesting that these mechanisms could be a potential target for pharmacological intervention in the treatment of the pathophysiology of OA.

829	Études fonctionnelles de deux nouvelles protéines centrosomales, NPHP5 et Cep76, et leurs implications dans les maladies humaines	Centrosomes are small organelles that regulate diverse cellular processes such as polarity or mitosis in mammalian cells. They are composed of two centrioles surrounded by a pericentriolar matrix. These centrosomes are the major microtubule organizing centers. Moreover, they promote the formation of cilia, protrusions on the surface of quiescent cells that are critical for signal transduction. A wide variety of human diseases such as cancers or ciliopathies are linked to a malfunction of centrosomes and cilia. Therefore the aim of my research is to understand the mechanisms necessary for the biogenesis and function of centrosomes and cilia. First, I have characterized a novel centrosomal protein called nephrocystin - 5 (NPHP5). This protein is localized, in interphase cells, in the distal region of centrioles. Its depletion inhibits the migration of centrosomes to the cell surface during the early stage of cilia formation. NPHP5 interacts with CEP290 via its C-terminal region that is essential for ciliogenesis. It also interacts with calmodulin, which prevents its self-aggregation. I have demonstrated that the Cep290- and CaM-binding domains as well as the centrosomal localization domain of NPHP5 are separable. Moreover, I have shown that NPHP5 proteins with pathogenic mutations can no longer interact with CEP290 and are not localized to centrosomes, rendering these proteins non-functional. Finally, using a pharmacological approach to modulate the downstream events in the ciliogenic pathway, I showed that cilia formation can be restored even without NPHP5. On the other hand, I studied the role of NPHP5 in the assembly and trafficking of the BBSome into the cilium. The BBSome consists of eight different subunits that assemble into a functional complex of which little is known about the spatiotemporal regulation of its assembly process. I have previously shown that NPHP5 favored the formation of cilia and its dysfunction contributes to the development of nephronophthisis (NPHP). Although the NPHP and BBS syndrome (BBS) are ciliopathies that share common clinical features, molecular basis of these phenotypic similarities is not understood. I found that NPHP5, located at the base of the cilium, contains two separate binding sites for BBSome. Furthermore, I demonstrated that NPHP5 and his partner CEP290 interact dynamically with the BBSome during the transition from quiescence to proliferation. Depletion NPHP5 or CEP290 leads to the dissociation of at least two subunits of BBSome forming a sub-complex that can still traffic into the cilium. I have shown that the transport of cargo to the ciliary compartment through this sub-complex is only partially altered. Finally, I have also focused my research on another centrosomal protein poorly characterized. The centrosomal protein of 76 kDa (Cep76) was previously involved in the maintenance of a single duplication of centrioles per cell cycle, and interacts with the cyclindependent kinase 2 (CDK2). Cep76 is preferentially phosphorylated by cyclin A/CDK2 on the single site S83. This event is essential to suppress centrioles amplification in S phase. I have demonstrated that Cep76 inhibits amplification by blocking the phosphorylation of Plk1 at the centrosome. Moreover, Cep76 can be acetylated at the K279 site in G2 phase, which negatively regulates its activity and phosphorylation on the site S83. These studies will improve our understanding of the biology of centrosomes and cilia and could lead to development of new diagnostic and therapeutic applications.

833	Shelley’s editing process in the preface to Epipsychidion	"Prefaces are often disregarded by readers who, more often than not, start without taking time to peruse them first. Sir Walter Scott knew this perfectly well, and he wrote about it, very wittily, in ""A PostScript Which Should Have Been a Preface"", the last chapter of his novel Waverley written in 1814: ""most novel readers, as my own conscience reminds me, are apt to be guilty of the sin of omission respecting the same matter of prefaces"". Scott refers to novel readers but poetry readers are also ""guilty of the sin of omission"", maybe even more so in so far as they may wish, understandably enough, to read only poetry and not a prose introduction. Many critics include prefaces in their analysis, but most of the time only as a means of interpreting the work they precede. Thus critics limit the role of prefaces simply to introductory materials and exclude any other potential interpretation. It is sometimes forgotten that the very presence or absence of a preface is already pregnant with meaning.

834	Jürgen Habermas et la théorie de l'agir communicationnel : la question de l'éducation	The Theory of Communicative Action (1981), by the German theorist Jürgen Habermas, is among the most important works of sociology and social philosophy of the 20th century: its universal character, which aims to develop a comprehensive theory of the Western modern society, benefits from a well-established reputation in a variety of academic fields from social sciences (philosophy, sociology, anthropology, political science, law, history, ethics, etc.). However, to date, Habermas's theory has only inspired a limited number of studies in education in terms of the nature and aims of the educational activity or the theoretical characterization of institutionalized education in Modernity : thus, how does the theory of communicative action allow us to better understand the foundations of education’s historical, social and political development in Europe and North America? As a theory of society based on a communicative reinterpretation of the concept of rationality, how does Habermas's theory, as a prolongation of the educational and philosophical traditions at the sources of the Western modern school, can inform us about the mechanisms of the pedagogical relationship between teachers and students? In proposing a series of considerations to answer these questions, this thesis is both a study of the relationship between the philosophical and sociological thought of Habermas and a strong critic of his perspective : the central issue that remains unanswered from the philosopher is the child's status in such a rationalistic system that, despite its emancipatory and liberating ideals for the social actor, perpetuates a form of denial of childhood present in the rationalist tradition from Plato to Kant. How can we then reflect on contemporary education regarding Habermas's theory? How, finally, can we conceptualize education with and against Habermas?

835	L’usage par les travailleurs étrangers temporaires des ressources proposées par le droit du travail : une contribution aux études portant sur l’effectivité du droit	In Canada, the number of temporary foreign workers has been steadily increasing since 2003. Temporary foreign workers have neither political citizenship nor permanent residency; their professional mobility is restricted and their length of stay limited and predetermined.  Formally, these workers can benefit from the protection of labour law despite their migratory status. Many studies have however shown that “low-skilled” temporary foreign workers are generally less likely to report the violation of their labour rights. Does labour law constitute a useful buttress for these workers?  Using a mixed methodology involving a field study with key actors, this study pursues two objectives. On the empirical level, it allows to shed light on the impact of the singular employment system of these workers on their mobilization of labour law’s protections. Such mobilization is neither contingent nor predetermined; it depends on the constraints and on the opportunities arising from the employment system. Our research also reveals that strategies elaborated by actors who are not, from a legal perspective, parties to the employment relationship, also have a significant impact on the way these workers take advantage of labour law's ressources ; such impact largely depends on the power these actors have in the employment system.  On the theoretical level, this study is situated in the broader field of studies concerning the effectiveness of law. It purports to distinguish between the study of the effects of the law and the analysis of its use. It elaborates an analytical framework addressing the relationship between the law and its recipients.

836	"Ablation laser femtoseconde de verres métalliques de Cu_x Zr_(1−x) : une étude par
dynamique moléculaire"	Laser ablation of CuxZr1−x (x = 0.33, 0.50 and 0.67) metallic glasses along with crystalline CuZr2 in the C11b structure was investigated using a molecular-dynamics scheme combined with a two-temperature model (MD-TTM). The ablation threshold (Fth) was determined for each of the 4 samples leading to the facts that Fth is lower for samples containing a larger amount of Cu atoms since their cohesion is weaker than Zr atoms’ in all the targets. For x=0.33, Fth is lower in the crystal than in the glass because the electron-phonon coupling is weaker in the latter, which implies that the energy is transferred more slowly from the electronic system towards the ionic system for a-CuZr2 than for c-CuZr2 . The velocity of the pressure wave generated by the laser pulse grows with increasing fluence for the crystalline sample as opposed to amorphous samples in which the pressure wave velocity is essentially constant with increasing fluence. This is explained by the fact that the shear modulus grows with increasing pressure in the c-CuZr2 and is constant in the glassy samples. Finally, the heat-affected zone (HAZ) was caracterized by the melting depth and the plastic deformations after the laser pulse. The lower melting temperature for amorphous samples causes the melting depth to be more important in them than in the crystal. In the metallic glasses, plastic deformations were identified as shear transformation zones (STZ) which merge and coalesce at higher fluence. No plastic deformation has been observed in c-CuZr2 other than some light deformations near the melting front, essentially caused by residual strains. In summary, this study allows a better understanding of the laser ablation of metallic glasses and the collateral damages associated with it.	Two-temperature model	en	13487.0
837	La réclamation en dommages punitifs et son effet sur l’assurance responsabilité : analyse de la faute intentionnelle et de l’atteinte illicite et intentionnelle	Claims for punitive damages have proliferated over the years before the courts. For such claim to be granted, it is required to demonstrate an unlawful and intentional interference with any right or freedom protected by the Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms. Liability claims can be covered by insurance. However, the Civil Code of Québec specifically provides that the insurer is never bound to indemnify the insured’s intentional fault. Does this mean that the insurer has no obligation towards its insured when punitive damages are sought? The question is thus whether the concept of intentional fault and of unlawful and intentional interference are concepts that are equivalent or that need to be distinguished. For this analysis, the two concepts will be adressed in depth. The origin of these two concepts, their founding principles and their interpretation will be discussed to ultimately define these terms as precisely as possible. These definitions will then help to compare these two concepts and determine in the end that there are several elements that differentiate these concepts, particularly in regard to the required intent, with the result that they can not be assimilated. This conclusion will have a definite impact on the insurer’s obligations to defend the insured and to indemnify the victim for compensatory damages if punitive damages are also sought. Therefore, the insurer cannot justify its refusal to defend or indemnify solely on the basis of the evidence of an unlawful and intentional interference.

839	Résilience des populations rurales javanaises face à la transition agraire : désagrarianisation, migrations et entrepreneuriat	Java island is part of the most densely populated regions of the world. During the second half of the twentieth century, the Indonesian government established transmigration policies aiming to lower the demographic pressure on the main island. But the intentions behind those policies were various, including the aim to provide cheap labor for the agribusiness to encourage their settlement on the islands surrounding Java. The agrarian transition valued the establishment of large scale intensive agriculture. This contributed to the progressive exclusion of javanese peasants in agricultural production systems, generating a change of values and aspirations inside rural communities. The agrarian transition thus contributed to emphasize the deagrarianization of javanese rural communities, engendering a great surplus of labor on the countryside following the green revolution which took place in the 1970’s. The emergence of entrepreneurship and the migration of workers are amongst the economic resilience strategies developed by javanese peasants to cope with the impacts of the agrarian transition. Remittances resulting from those migrations contribute to the survival of multiple rural communities, in which many members spend most of their time outside the village.	java , transmigration , migration , entrepreneuriat , agrarian transition , green revolution , indonesia , resilience , deagrarianization , remittances , entrepreneurship	en	13464.0
840	Étude d'un nouveau facteur impliqué dans la biosynthèse de la paroi bactérienne : le facteur  ElyC	Bacterial resistance to antibiotics is a major concern for public health. The identification of new bacterial targets for the development of new antibiotics is required. The bacterial cell wall is a good target because the inhibition of its biosynthesis causes the death of bacterial cells. Recent studies from our laboratory have identified many new important factors for cell wall biosynthesis in Escherichia coli. One of these factors renamed ElyC has a DUF218 domain highly conserved across bacterial species. The absence of elyC leads to bacterial lysis at room temperature. Bioinformatic studies indicate that ElyC is a membrane protein with two transmembrane domains and a conserved domain of unknown function DUF218. Given that proteins often act in complexes, we formulated the hypothesis that ElyC interacts with other proteins to play its biological role. The goal of my project is to determine the topology of ElyC and identify its protein partners. The study of the topology has been done by the cysteine modification assay with strains individually expressing ElyC with a cysteine residue at the N-terminal position, in the loop or at the C-terminal position. ElyC protein partners have been isolated by immuno-precipitation and identified by mass spectrometry. The results obtained revealed that ElyC is a membrane protein in E. coli and that it is involved in the bacterial envelope assembling, in the electron transport chain and in the oxidative phosphorylation. They also confirmed the existence of a link between ElyC and oxidative stress. However, the results for the determination of the topology remain to be clarified.

841	Theory and numerical integration of subsurface light transport	In image synthesis, reproducing the complex appearance of objects with subsurface light scattering, such as wax, marble and skin, greatly contributes to the realism of an image. Unfortunately, this added realism comes at a high computational cost. Models based on diffusion theory aim to reduce this computational cost by simulating the physical behaviour of subsurface light scattering while imposing smoothness constraints on the incident and outgoing light fields. An important component of these models is how they are employed to hierarchically evaluate the numerical integral of lighting over the surface of an object. This thesis will first review the existing literature on realistic subsurface lighting simulation, before investigating in more depth the application and extension of modern diffusion models in image synthesis. In doing so, we propose and evaluate a new hierarchical numerical integration technique that uses a novel frequency analysis of the incident and outgoing light fields to reliably adapt the sampling rate during integration. We realize our resulting theory in the context of several state-of-the-art diffusion models, providing a marked improvement in their efficiency and accuracy.

843	Peter Pan contre le héros victorien : la poétique du recyclage dans le Cycle de Kraven de Xavier Mauméjean	Cycle de Kraven, from French author Xavier Mauméjean, establishes a referential network based on a systematic recycling of historical and literary elements. In order to fully understand how this narrative cycle works, one needs to look into these exacerbated referential dynamics which depends on a poetics of recycling. This manifests itself through the borrowing of multiple historical and literary referents, modified at various levels throughout the story. Through the notion of recycling, works on the recovery of history through uchrony and studies on the steampunk genre – being Kraven's primary aesthetic – this dissertation looks into the effects this recycling has on the story's working, as well as on the reader himself. Indeed, through its impressive blending of genuine and fictional references, Cycle de Kraven bemuses the reader who finds himself or herself exploring a intertextual universe where history and fiction may hardly be differed from one another. A study on the paratext concludes this analysis of Cycle de Kraven since elements such as the preface, the footnotes and the purchase order form contribute to the befuddlement of readers.

844	La texture et la granulométrie de la moulée influencent les concentrations d’acide propionique et butyrique de même que la prévalence d’Escherichia coli dans le tractus gastro-intestinal du porc d’engraissement	Natural approaches, such as dietary modifications, are now being considered to replace antimicrobials for the control of bacterial infections in pigs. The objectives of this study were to assess the effect of feed size and texture on intestinal Volatile fatty acids profiles and concentrations, E. coli populations, and on growth performance. Fattening pigs (n=840) received one of six different diets: mash feed 500, 750 and 1250 µm and pellet feed 500, 750 and 1250 µm. Weight gain of pigs was monitored for each diet formulation over the fattening period. At the slaughterhouse, caecal and colon contents from 165 pigs were sampled for enumeration of E. coli by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and for acetic, propionic and butyric acid quantification. The yccT gene was used to enumerate total E. coli. A decrease in feed conversion associated with pellet texture and/or 500 µm particle size was observed for each diet formulation. In addition, caecal and colon propionic acid concentrations and caecal and colon butyric acid concentrations were lower for pigs receiving pellet rather than mash feed. Moreover, caecal (p=0,0208) and colon (p=0,0006) butyric acid concentrations were higher for pigs receiving a feed with a 1250 µm rather than 500 µm particle size. For total E. coli enumeration, caecal (p=0,01) and colon (p=0,04) yccT gene copies were higher for pigs receiving pellet rather than for those receiving mash feed. Taken together, results showed that mash feed is associated with favourable intestinal changes (VFA levels) and with a reduction of E. coli in the pig.

845	Variabilité des souches de Escherichia coli provenant de divers poulaillers au Québec	Rep-PCR genomic fingerprinting, which uses repetitive intergenic DNA sequences, was investigated as a mean to identify signature pattern of chicken fecal Escherichia coli populations and evaluate their changes over time. The (GTG)5 primer was used to generate DNA fingerprints from 522 isolates originating from 7 chicken houses just prior to, and five days after, thinning. The DNA fingerprints were analysed by using the Jaccard band-matching algorithm. Jackknife analysis of the resulting similarity coefficients revealed that between 73% and 93% of the isolates could correctly be grouped in their house of origin. A dendrogram constructed by using Jaccard similarity coefficients grouped the isolates in 42 clusters with approximately half of them in the same cluster. Out of the 6 largest clusters, containing 80% of all isolates, 4 consisted mostly of isolates coming from only 1 house. These clusters could represent signature clusters identifying specific houses. A comparison of the number of clusters present before and after thinning for each house revealed a substantial difference in the behaviour of the fecal E. coli. For some houses, there were few clusters represented both before and after thinning, with a high number of new clusters appearing after thinning whereas in other houses, the contrary was observed. Our results suggest the presence of a signature subpopulation in some chicken houses and a variable response of the E. coli population to the effect of thinning.

847	Impact of male partner responses on sexual function in women with vulvodynia and their partners: a dyadic daily experience study	Objective: There is a paucity of research investigating the role of interpersonal variables in vulvodynia—a prevalent, chronic, vulvo-vaginal pain condition that negatively affects many aspects of women’s sexual health, emotional well-being and intimate relationships. Cross-sectional studies have shown that male partner responses to painful intercourse are associated with pain and sexual satisfaction in women with vulvodynia. Partner responses can be solicitous (attention and sympathy), negative (hostility and frustration), and facilitative (encouragement of adaptive coping). No research has assessed the influence of daily partner responses in this population. Further, there is limited knowledge regarding the impact of partner responses on sexual function, which is a key measure of impairment in vulvodynia. Methods: Using daily diaries, 66 women (M age = 27.91, SD = 5.94) diagnosed with vulvodynia and their cohabiting male partners (M age = 30.00, SD = 8.33) reported on male partner responses and sexual function on days when sexual intercourse occurred (M = 6.54, SD = 4.99). Drawing on the Actor-Partner Interdependence model (APIM), a multivariate multilevel modeling approach was adopted. Results: A woman’s sexual functioning improved on days when she perceived greater facilitative and lower solicitous and negative male partner responses, and when her male partner reported lower solicitous responses. A man’s sexual functioning was poorer on days when he reported greater solicitous and negative responses. Conclusions: Findings suggest that facilitative male partner responses may improve sexual functioning whereas solicitous and negative responses may be detrimental. Partner responses should be targeted in psychological interventions aimed to improve the sexual functioning of affected couples.

848	Women with provoked vestibulodynia experience clinically significant reductions in pain regardless of treatment : results from a 2-year follow up study	Introduction   Provoked vestibulodynia (PVD) is a prevalent genital pain syndrome that has been assumed to be chronic, with little spontaneous remission. Despite this assumption, there is a dearth of empirical evidence regarding the progression of PVD in a natural setting. Although many treatments are available, there is no single treatment that has demonstrated efficacy above others.   Aims   The aims of this secondary analysis of a prospective study were to (i) assess changes over a 2-year period in pain, depressive symptoms, and sexual outcomes in women with PVD; and (ii) examine changes based on treatment(s) type.   Methods   Participants completed questionnaire packages at Time 1 and a follow-up package 2 years later.   Main Outcome Measures   Visual analog scale of genital pain, Global Measure of Sexual Satisfaction, Female Sexual Function Index, Beck Depression Inventory, Dyadic Adjustment Scale, and sexual intercourse attempts over the past month.   Results   Two hundred thirty-nine women with PVD completed both time one and two questionnaires. For the sample as a whole, there was significant improvement over 2 years on pain ratings, sexual satisfaction, sexual function, and depressive symptoms. The most commonly received treatments were physical therapy, sex/psychotherapy, and medical treatment, although 41.0% did not undergo any treatment. Women receiving no treatment also improved significantly on pain ratings. No single treatment type predicted better outcome for any variable except depressive symptoms, in which women who underwent surgery were more likely to improve.   Discussion   These results suggest that PVD may significantly reduce in severity over time. Participants demonstrated clinically significant pain improvement, even when they did not receive treatment. Furthermore, the only single treatment type predicting better outcomes was surgery, and only for depressive symptoms, accounting for only 2.3% of the variance. These data do not demonstrate the superiority of any one treatment and underscore the need to have control groups in PVD treatment trials, otherwise improvements may simply be the result of natural progression.

849	Fragilisation de la santé mentale et suicidalité chez les infirmières novices : mesures de prévention organisationnelles	The first months of novice nurses’ job is very stressful and can be experienced by them with difficulty. Following the deaths of some Quebec nurses, including a novice nurse, in the last five years, it is appropriate to ask whether the work related stress does not contribute to the risk of suicidality (suicidal thoughts, suicidal ideation, suicide attemps, completed suicides) of novice nurses. Therefore, the aim of the work is to propose, on the basis of established knowledge about the organizational factors that can contribute to the suicide of novice nurses, suicide prevention measures to the attention of managers. With its central concepts : work organization, the sources of suffering and defensive strategies, the framework of the psychodynamics of work of Dejours (1993) was selected to guide and structure the integrative literature review; the latter being composed of 26 empirical studies, seventeen theoretical writings and one book. From this review, it appears that the organization of work can be a source of suffering for novice nurses. The latter also face several organizational sources of suffering (high workload, stress at work, lack of support, etc.) and, although novices can deploy some adaptation strategies, these suffering undermine their mental health and help to increase their risk of suicide. In this spirit, an organizational prevention program of suicidality among novice nurses is proposed to the attention of managers, which includes several organizational measures that can be implemented in Quebec’s health care organizations.	suicidality , novice nurse , mental health	en	13138.0
850	Les issues périnatales des femmes avec prééclampsie récidivante : une étude rétrospective	OBJECTIVE: To assess whether a recurrent preeclampsia compared to the preeclampsia that occurred at the first pregnancy was more at risk of preterm delivery at < 37 weeks of gestation. Secondary outcomes were intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and maternal morbidity.  STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective cohort study including 383 women with preeclampsia who delivered at Sainte-Justine Hospital in Montreal (Canada) from 2001 to 2011. Among these, 128 women developed a recurrent preeclampsia in their subsequent pregnancy.   RESULTS: Among women with a recurrent preeclampsia (n = 128), no significant differences were found in the rates of preterm delivery and IUGR between the first and the subsequent pregnancy. Women with a recurrent preeclampsia were more at risk of chronic hypertension (p = 0.001) and gestational diabetes (p = 0.02) in their second pregnancy. Furthermore, women with recurrent preeclampsia had, at their first pregnancy, a higher rate of severe preeclampsia (p < 0.001), eclampsia and adverse criteria (p = 0.007), than women who experienced a single preeclampsia (n = 255). The Relative Risk to experience a recurrent preeclampsia at the second pregnancy, if a woman had the above criteria at the first pregnancy, was 1.60 (95%CI 1.17 - 2.18).  CONCLUSION: Recurrent preeclampsia was not associated with a higher rate of preterm delivery. Women who experienced a severe preeclampsia, an eclampsia or adverse criteria in a first pregnancy were more at risk to have a recurrent preeclampsia in the subsequent pregnancy.

851	Les sources de plaisir issues d’oeuvres d’art contemporain dans un contexte muséal	Today, the educational role of museums in society as a whole is indisputable. Museums of contemporary art are important learning environments where a significant proportion of visitors can experience pleasure during their visit. Given the necessity of improving our understanding of this phenomenon, the present Master's level research has allowed us to identify, within the framework of the most recent research by A.M. Émond and C. Dufresne-Tassé entitled Le grand public et l’art contemporain: du rejet au plaisir, sources of pleasure which could emerge amongst visitors from the general public during a visit to the Montreal Museum of Contemporary Art. To do so, we analyzed 30 discourses of visitors from Émond and Dufresne-Tassé’s study. Our research favours the qualitative approach, being simultaneously exploratory, empirical and fundamental. Our results have demonstrated the existence of pleasures which emerge as a function of three broad categories (Museum Object, Visitors Themselves, General Impression) which can be subdivided into eighteen subcategories. We have described each of these categories and subcategories of pleasure with the aid of examples extracted from visitors' discourses. We believe that with our findings on the identification and importance of pleasure, educational sectors of art museums could benefit from our research in the development of educational strategies for a non-specialist public viewing contemporary art.

853	Career Officers and Political Appointees in American Diplomacy: Contending for Diplomatic Positions through Boundary Work	"American diplomacy has long included a larger contingent of non-career appointees than is found in many other countries' diplomatic corps. Since the 1950s, successive White Houses have allocated about 30% of ambassadorships to individuals outside the diplomatic profession (so-called ""political appointees""). These political appointments are a source of controversy within the career Foreign Service and in the national media. While news reports and academic studies remain focused on the formal boundary between career and non-career diplomats, this paper calls attention to the symbolic boundary determining the legitimacy of participants in American diplomacy. I argue that, in their attempt to secure their access to diplomatic positions, career members of the Foreign Service and political appointees compete for the social recognition of their respective ""boundary work"", that is to say, the symbolic boundaries that they respectively produce through their discourse and practices and that differentiate between legitimate and illegitimate diplomats. On the one hand, career diplomats try to protect their dominant position through turf claims establishing restrictive distinctions, based on quantitative and qualitative criteria, between legitimate and illegitimate political appointees. On the other hand, political appointees try to carve out a place for themselves by promoting less restrictive selection criteria for diplomatic appointments while at the same time downplaying the formal distinction between career and non-career practitioners. Methodologically, the paper builds on interviews with members of the Foreign Service and political appointees as well as on written primary sources."	American Diplomacy	en	13085.0
854	Is Breast Asymmetry Present in Girls with Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis?	Study Design Cross-sectional descriptive study.  Objectives To characterize breast asymmetry (BA), as defined by breast volume difference, in girls with significant adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS), using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).  Summary and Background BA is a frequent concern among girls with AIS. It is commonly believed that this results from chest wall deformity. Although many women exhibit physiological BA, the prevalence is not known in adolescents and it remains unclear if it is more frequent in AIS. Breasts vary in shape and size and many ways of measuring them have been explored. MRI shows the highest precision at defining breast tissue.  Methods Thirty patients were enrolled on the basis of their thoracic curvature, skeletal and breast maturity, without regard to their perception on their BA. MRI acquisitions were performed in prone with a 1.5-Tesla system using a 16-channel breast coil. Segmentation was achieved using the ITK-SNAP 2.4.0 software and subsequently manually refined.  Results The mean left breast volume (528.32 ± 205.96 cc) was greater compared with the mean right breast volume (495.18 ± 170.16 cc) with a significant difference between them. The mean BA was found to be 8.32% ± 6.43% (p < .0001). A weak positive correlation was observed between BA and thoracic Cobb angle (0.177, p = .349) as well as thoracic gibbosity angle (0.289, p = .122). The left breast was consistently larger in 65.5% of the patients. Twenty patients (66.7%) displayed BA ≥5%.  Conclusions We have described BA in patients with significant AIS using MRI. This method is feasible, objective, and very precise. The majority of patients had a larger left breast, which could compound the apparent BA secondary to trunk rotation. In many cases, BA is present independently of thoracic deformity. This knowledge will assist in counseling AIS patients in regards to their concerns with BA.

855	Analysis of scoliosis trunk deformities using ICA	This paper describes a method for analyzing scoliosis trunk deformities using Independent Component Analysis (ICA). Our hypothesis is that ICA can capture the scoliosis deformities visible on the trunk. Unlike Principal Component Analysis (PCA), ICA gives local shape variation and assumes that the data distribution is not normal. 3D torso images of 56 subjects including 28 patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis and 28 healthy subjects are analyzed using ICA. First, we remark that the independent components capture the local scoliosis deformities as the shoulder variation, the scapula asymmetry and the waist deformation. Second, we note that the different scoliosis curve types are characterized by different combinations of specific independent components.

856	Évaluation du rôle du récepteur CD36 comme cible thérapeutique potentielle dans le traitement de la maladie cardiaque ischémique	Ischaemic heart disease, the most common cause of heart disease, is still today a leading cause of mortality in industrialized countries. An inflammatory cardiometabolic response to acute changes elicited by energetic substrate shift in the ischemic heart is amplified once the oxygen supply is reinstated. Resulting deleterious alterations include increased myocardial accumulation of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) and their oxidation at the expense of glucose, thus enhancing reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Peripheral tissues such as the adipose tissue can affect the extent of myocardial injury by releasing bioactive substances such as adiponectin and NEFA into the circulation. CD36 is the main facilitator of the entry of NEFA in the heart or adipocytes and constitutes an important metabolic target especially during an ischaemia-reperfusion (I/R) stress. It was previously reported by our group that a selective synthetic ligand of CD36 exerts potent protective effects on the vasculature. However, no study has reported the in vivo cardioprotective effects of selective CD36 ligands. Thus, this project aimed to evaluate the role and possibly cardioprotective effects of selective CD36 receptor ligands on myocardial I/R injury.  CD36+/+ and CD36-/- mice were pretreated with EP 80317, CP-3(iv) or vehicle for 14 days prior to undergoing a transient occlusion of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery. Our first study showed that EP 80317 exerted potent cardioprotective effects as shown by reduced lesion area and ameliorated cardiac function following in vivo myocardial I/R injury. Furthermore, EP 80317 reduced total myocardial NEFA uptake, as assessed by in vivo metabolic cardiac imaging, in agreement with reduced levels of circulating NEFA. Reduced lipolysis revealed by palmitate radiotracer infusion and increased expression levels of adipogenic and anti-lipolytic genes further support an effect of EP 80317 in preventing deleterious fatty acid mobilization from adipose tissue. Our second study investigated the cardioprotective mechanisms of a new generation of ligands with increased affinity towards CD36. This study showed that CP-3(iv) is also endowed of potent cardioprotective effects as shown by reduced infarct area and improved myocardial function following myocardial I/R injury which is mediated by an adiponectin metabolic and anti-oxidative signaling pathway. Indeed, main signaling pathways regulating adiponectin secretion and antioxidative genes were shown to be increased in adipose tissue following myocardial I/R and CP-3(iv) treatment. Myocardial protein kinase B or Akt activation along with reduced ROS generation and cell death signaling further support a cardioprotective role of CP-3(iv) in MI/R.  In conclusion, work from this thesis support that CD36 signaling by EP 80317 and CP-3(iv) may constitute a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of ischemic heart disease. These synthetic CD36 selective ligands provoke salutary effects on ischaemic myocardium by means of an ameliorated metabolic profile in the first hours of reperfusion. EP 80317 reduces deleterious NEFA levels and their uptake into the heart in time of excess, while CP-3(iv) increases beneficial adiponectin level and its cardioprotective effects.

857	Conception et évaluation d’un nouveau système de transfection ciblée, basé sur l’utilisation du système E/Kcoil	Pharmaceutical industry often employs polyethylenimine (PEI) for large scale protein production processes by transient transfection of mammalian cells. PEI condenses plasmid DNA (pDNA) by spontaneously forming positive nanoparticles known as polyplexes. Condensed pDNA is favoured for cell surface binding, internalization and protection from intracellular nucleases. While most of the cells efficiently uptake polyplexes, only 5 to 10% of captured pDNA reaches the nucleus for transgene expression. This suggests that polyplexes are hampered in their ability to route and to translocate to the nucleus necessitating large amounts of polyplexes to achieve high expression levels.  By contrast, many viruses can efficiently transduce cells with only one or a few viral genome copies. Viruses have evolved to exploit cellular internalization and routing properties to express their own genetic material. We hypothesized that less pDNA would be used in an optimized transfection process if we exploited the internalization and routing properties that viruses use. DNA binding proteins could be used as an alternative to PEI to transfect mammalian cells. However, their usage is marginal due to the large protein quantities required to bind pDNA for transgene expression. If less pDNA is used less binding protein is needed.  In this study, we used the E/Kcoil system to target a membrane receptor to deliver pDNA in mammalian cells. The Ecoil and Kcoil are two repeated heptapeptides which interact with a high affinity and specificity to form coiled-coil structures. We fused the Ecoil with a recombinant pDNA-binding protein. The Kcoil was fused to a stably-expressed membrane receptor in HEK293 cells.  We discovered that low sulfation of the cell surface reduced non-specific binding of the pDNA:protein complex and permitted targeted binding via the E/Kcoil interaction. We demonstrate how to use recombinant pDNA-binding protein and the E/Kcoil system for targeted transgene delivery. This newly developed system provides a new transfection method, with reduced pDNA-binding protein quantities needed to achieve transgene expression.

858	Genetic Landscape of Joubert syndrome in French Canadians	Joubert syndrome (JBTS) is a primarily autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a distinctive mid-hindbrain/cerebellum malformation, eye movement abnormalities (oculomotor apraxia), irregular breathing, developmental delay, and ataxia. Over the past decade, over 20 causal genes have been identified, all of which have an important role in the structure and function of the primary cilia.  Thus, JBTS joins an expanding category of diseases termed “ciliopathies”.  Though JBTS was first described in affected siblings of a French Canadian (FC) family in 1969, the underlying genesis basis of the disorder was unknown in the overwhelming majority of FC cases at the onset of this doctoral project in 2010.   We identified a total of 43 FC individuals with JBTS from 35 families.  We observed a clustering of the affected families in the Lower Saint-Lawrence region of the province of Quebec, suggesting the presence of a founder effect. The aim of this doctoral project was to characterize the genetic landscape of JBTS in the FC population, and we hypothesized the presence of a founder effect in novel JBTS gene(s).  Therefore, we initially used a homozygosity mapping approach.  However, we did not identify any shared regions of homozygosity amongst affected individuals, suggesting the presence of genetic and/or allelic heterogeneity. We therefore primarily used a whole exome sequencing approach in our JBTS patients, a strategy that is better suited for the study of genetically heterogeneous conditions.   Our work has resulted in the identification of two novel JBTS genes: C5orf42 and TMEM231. In total, we have identified causal mutations in C5orf42 in 14 families (including the original JBTS family described in 1969), and TMEM231 in 2 families.  Though the function and cellular localization of C5orf42 was not known at the time of the publication of our manuscript, our genetic findings combined with subsequent animal and cellular work establish the important role of C5orf42 in ciliary structure and function, particularly at the ciliary transition zone.  TMEM231 had been previously shown to localize to the ciliary transition zone and interact with several JBTS gene products. We also identified deleterious rare variants in one JBTS patient in the ciliary gene CEP104, implicating CEP104 as a strong candidate JBTS gene. We identified causal mutations in 10 JBTS genes, including CC2D2A in 9 families and NPHP1 in 3 families. Definite causal mutations were identified in 32 of 35 families (91% of cases). We documented a complex founder effect in the FC population with multiple recurrent mutations in 4 different genes (C5orf42, CC2D2A, TMEM231, NPHP1).   Prior to the start of this research endeavor, the underlying genetic etiology of Joubert syndrome was unknown in all 35 families.  Now, a definite molecular diagnosis has been identified in 32 families, and a probable molecular diagnosis in the remaining 3. Therefore, our work has resulted in the unraveling of the genetic basis of JBTS in the French-Canadian population using WES, and reveals the presence of a complex founder effect with substantial locus and allelic heterogeneity.

859	Préconditionnement ischémique et exercice : de la réadaptation à la performance	Physical activity is an integral part of medical recommendations for preventing and treating coronary heart disease. By following a structured training program, is it possible to improve response to exercise and provide heart protection at the same time? This is suggested by certain studies on ischemic preconditioning (IPC) induced by a maximal exercise test. The same physiological mechanisms induced by IPC are also observed when a pressure cuff is used to create cycles of ischemia/reperfusion on skeletal muscle. This is known as remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC). At the other end of the physical activity spectrum, athletes have used RIPC during warm-ups to improve performance. The following research projects were developed to study these premises. The first trial addressed the effects of RIPC on short supra-maximal exercise. The subjects (N = 16) performed an alactic test (six seconds of supra-maximal exercise) followed by a lactic test (30 seconds of supra-maximal exercise) on a cycle ergometer. The subjects were randomly assigned to an RIPC or CON intervention before the exercise. The RIPC procedure involved four cycles of ischemia using a pressure cuff inflated to 50 mmHg above systolic blood pressure at the arm. The results of the project show that RIPC intervention does not significantly improve performance typical of the anaerobic system, despite a slight increase in maximal power output in favour of RIPC in the 30 second Wingate test (795 W vs. 777 W)  and in the 6 seconds test (856 W vs. 847 W).  The aim of the second clinical trial was to study the effects of RIPC during eight minutes of moderate exercise (75% of ventilatory threshold) and intense exercise (115% of ventilatory threshold) on the kinetics of O2 uptake. Our results showed a significant acceleration in the kinetics of O2 uptake during the RIPC intervention compared to the CON intervention for the two exercise intensities (value of 1 during moderate exercise: 27.2 ± 4.6 seconds compared with 33.7 ± 6.2, p < .01 and intense exercise: 299 ± 4.9 seconds compared with 33.5 ± 4.1, p < .001) in amateur athletes (N= 15). This means a reduction in the oxygen deficit at the onset of exercise and more rapid achievement of the steady state.  The third project involved performing a systematic review and meta-analysis on ischemic preconditioning (IPC) induced by an exercise test in coronary patients. Our literature search identified 309 articles, 34 of which were included in the meta-analysis, which represents a batch of 1,053 patients. Our statistical analyses show that in subsequent exercise, patients' time to 1 mm ST segment depression is augmented by 91 seconds (p < .001); the maximum depression decreases by 0.38 mm (p < .01); the double product at 1 mm ST segment depression increases by 1.80 x 103 mmHg (p < .001) and the total time of exercise increases by 50 seconds (p < .001).   Our research projects have promoted the advancement of knowledge in exercise science by the use of a cuff as a stimulus to the RIPC before sports performance. We evaluated the effect of the RIPC on different metabolic pathways and we concluded that the method could accelerate the kinetics of oxygen consumption and reduce the range of oxygen deficit. In addition, we have established clinical parameters for assessing the IPC induced by a stress test for coronary patients.

860	Rendre possible l’engagement en familiarité dans les CHSLD : les savoir-être d’une pratique de design centrée sur l’usager	The phenomenon of an aging population brings with it a whole host of diverse challenges. Some of these challenges are of a general nature, such as those related to economics, while others are much more specific, such as the conditions and procedures needed to ensure that vulnerable individuals receive adequate care and services. For instance, a symposium entitled “Providing a quality experience for users and loved ones: personalization of care and social services,” held during the fall 2014 Entretiens Jacques-Cartier, aimed to examine personal user experiences pertaining to the delivery of health care services and the organization of social services. This meeting’s initial hypothesis underscored the need for a more balanced power dynamic with caregivers or in the delivery of care. This hypothesis is based on the concept of user capabilities, achieved through the adoption of practices which enable professionals to provide personalized care. Further exploration of this particular issue is at the core of this doctoral thesis. This research aims to examine the conditions which would allow people living in long-term care facilities to engage with their environment in a way the sociologist Laurent Thévenot categorized as “familiar engagement.” Familiar engagement refers to realities in which people are able to rest on an accustomed dependency with the things and people that surround them. In other words, this type of engagement refers to a relationship with one’s environment which allows individuals to take part in their usual habits, and where they feel at home and at ease in their surroundings. As Thévenot’s analysis shows, this type of engagement requires the  conception of a world which allows people to frame their actions around reference points which are personally relevant to them. Thus, this research aims to better understand the role of designers in the conception of nursing homes where this type of pragmatic engagement is made possible. The guidelines for the development of residential facilities able to satisfy these criteria are largely in line with the expectations surrounding the development of user-centered design, experience design, and empathic design. That being said, despite the efforts put forth towards this initiative, self-identification with one’s environment remains an unresolved problem. Our hypothesis is that the evolution of user-centered design is too often restricted by methodological or procedural issues. Development in this direction has been done to the detriment of the precise examination of the virtues needed by designers in order to be able to seriously take on the issues associated with the goals of this design approach. More specifically, this research identifies the qualities of long-term care facilities’ experience whose design allows for familiar engagement. For our study, we analyzed the findings and judgments of living environment evaluation teams concerning the quality of living environments of the long-term care facilities in the Montreal area. Through this survey, five qualities have been identified: welcomeness, conviviality, flexibility, thoughtfulness and stability. Finally, as a reflective essay, a portrait of virtues is suggested as a way for designers to implement facilities that share those qualities. The dissertation also presented a reflexive tool for a virtuous design practice and pedagogy.	design social , social design , moral sociology , long-term care facilities , user centered design , empathic design , ageing	en	13013.0
861	Évaluation de l'acquisition de la résistance à la colistine chez Escherichia coli O149 chez le porc	Post-weaning diarrhea is an important swine disease in Québec mainly caused by Escherichia coli O149. The most frequent treatment used is neomycin, but due to antimicrobial resistance to this antibiotic, veterinarians often use colistin sulfate (CS). CS binds the lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and causes a displacement of divalent cations causing pore formation in the membrane, leading to cellular death. The two component system PmrA/PmrB is the most frequently associated with CS resistance in E. coli by adding à L-Ara4N group to the LPS, increasing its charge, reducing affinity for CS. The main objective of this study was to investigate the genetic polymorphism in pmrA/pmrB genes in E. coli strains acquired in vitro and in an infectious model of post-weaning diarrhea in piglets. For the in vitro assay, we used swine clinical E. coli strains resistant to neomycin isolated from 2008 to 2011. We created 22 mutants resistant to CS. MIC was determined by standard double dilution method and compared to the EUCAST breakpoint. By sequencing the genes pmrA and pmrB, we identified seven new genetic polymorphisms, 3 were in PmrA: A80V, N128I, S144G and 4 in pmrB gene: V87E, D148Y, D148V, T156M. For the in vivo assay, we followed the experimental infection ETEC:F4 E. coli strain and commensal E. coli isolates through a post-weaning infectious model. Sequencing of pmrA and pmrB showed two polymorphisms G15R and T156M, respectively. Many E. coli strains acquired in vitro and in vivo resistance to colistin without mutation in pmrA/pmrB suggesting other(s) mechanism(s) of resistance to this antibiotic.

862	Gastric stability and oral bioavailability of colistin sulfate in pigs challenged or not with Escherichia coli O149: F4 (K88)	The aim of the present study was to investigate the in vitro gastric stability of colistin sulfate (CS) and its antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli and to study the impact of ETEC O149: F4 (K88) infection in pigs on CS intestinal absorption. The stability profile of CS was evaluated in a simulated gastric fluid (SGF). Antimicrobial activity of CS and its degradation products were examined in a 96-well polystyrene microplate model. The effect of experimental infection with ETEC O149: F4 on CS intestinal absorption was determined by quantification of CS systemic concentration using a validated LC–MS/MS method. A rapid degradation of CS accompanied by an increase in CS antimicrobial activity by comparison with non-degraded CS (P < 0.0001) was observed in SGF. Additionally, CS levels were not quantifiable in systemic circulation using a highly sensitive method and concurrent oral challenge did not affect CS absorption in an induction model of subclinical post-weaning diarrhea (PWD).

863	Mesure de la génération de thrombine et son application pour la surveillance pharmacothérapeutique de l'héparine de faible poids moléculaire chez le chien	Dalteparin is an anticoagulant used to prevent and treat thrombotic disorders in dogs. Measurement of anti-factor Xa (FXa) activity is currently used for monitoring therapy, but remains a non-functional test. The aim of this study was to investigate if a thrombin generation (TG) assay could be used for the in vitro evaluation of the effects of dalteparin on canine plasma, as well as for monitoring the pharmacodynamic effects of dalteparin administration in healthy dogs. Normal TG parameters were assessed in plasma from 25 adult beagles and 11 client-owned healthy dogs. Pooled plasma was spiked with dalteparin to obtain 9 final increasing concentrations. TG, anti-FXa activity and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) were measured for each concentration. 24 healthy beagles were randomized across four equal groups. À single SC dose of 50 U/kg, 100 U/kg or 150 U/kg of dalteparin was given and compared to a placebo group. Platelet poor plasma (PPP) was collected over 24 hours and assed by TG, anti-FXa activity and aPTT. In vitro results showed that dalteparin exerted a concentration-dependent anticoagulant effect on TG parameters and TG and anti-FXa activity were more sensitive than aPTT to detect these effects. The pharmacodynamics study showed a time, dose and time*dose interaction that significantly affected TG and anti-FXa parameters. TG can be employed to measure the pharmacodynamics effects of dalteparin at different doses in healthy dogs.	pharmacodynamie , in vitro , anticoagulation , anti-FXa , daltparin , thrombin generation	en	12836.0

La relation entre l’avortement et le suicide : une recension systématique"	The Relationship Between Abortion and Suicide: A Systematic Review Geneviève Bloch-Torrico Since 1988, there have been an increasing number of abortions and suicides among Canadian women. Given the controversy on the mental health outcomes for women who procure elective abortions, a systematic review was conducted to determine the relationship between abortion and suicide. After the application of methodologically based selection criteria and extraction rules to minimise bias, the sample of 19 studies was selected for further review. The sample consisted of 2,842,655 female participants, 7 measures of effect from 10 countries; all were observational studies published in English. Nine studies examined abortion, seven considered suicide and three had other focal points (rape, substance use and risks specific to orphaned and abused youth). Studies included females of reproductive age who had an abortion or were preparing to do so. Elective abortion was the only intervention investigated; the outcome variables were completed suicide, attempted suicidal and suicidal ideation. Quality assessment was effected for measures of attempted suicide and suicidal ideation. The results suggested that women who had undergone an abortion experienced a statistically significant increased risk of completed or attempted suicide. The findings concerning suicidal ideation remained tentative due to variability in measurement. The strongest estimates of increased risk occurred when abortion was compared with term pregnancy and when the outcomes involved substance use and experiences of violence. This review offered the only qualitative estimate of suicide risks associated with abortion available in the current literature. Results revealed a moderate to highly increased risk of suicidal behaviours correlated with elective abortion. Evidence-based findings should inform the delivery of abortion and suicide prevention services.

865	L’encadrement parental des devoirs en lecture d’élèves de 1re année du premier cycle du primaire	The goal of education systems across the world and particularly in Quebec is to prepare students to meet challenges of the future and to help them continue learning throughout their lifetime. In this regard, reading is an important aspect in a child’s development and in developing their ability to relate to the world around them.   Reading is a tool for learning, communication and creativity, and it can be a source of pleasure. Most daily activities involve reading. Thus, it is necessary to perform a task, to learn or to play. Students learn to read in order to better integrate into the academic and social life and to learn in different disciplinary contexts  In an effort to consolidate learned material and to instill good work habits, teachers assign reading assignments for students to complete at home. Research demonstrates that parents’ involvement in their child’s school life, especially in the form of homework supervision, can have a positive effect on their academic success.  This study examines how the parents of grade one students help children with their homework, namely with reading. The sample comprises 17 parents of grade one students. We have chosen a semi-structured interview approach in order to gather the comments and perceptions of parents on homework sessions.   According to findings, all parents interviewed help their children with homework, more so women than men, and a homework routine is established. Homework supervision is mostly done in a pleasant context. Most parents support their child by staying close to them, advising them, encouraging them, and making sure they finish their assignment. Most parents also consider they have the necessary resources to help their children with homework. For reading assignments, parents listen to their child read aloud and correct them when they stumble or make a mistake. In addition, even if parents trust their child’s reading abilities, most will ask questions to ensure comprehension. With regards to the effects of homework, all parents believe that homework facilitates academic success and that supervision has a positive effect on reading. These findings cannot be generalised, however, it would be interesting to follow up this research with a related study on the perceptions of students and teachers.

866	L’évaluation du raisonnement clinique des résidents en hématologie par l’approche de concordance de script	The practice of hematology, like any other profession, requires the acquisition of adequate judgment. Based on cognitive psychology theory, the script concordance test (SCT) has been developed and validated as an instrument capable of evaluation clinical judgement in various medical specialties. The goal of this study was to examine the usefulness and the psychometric qualities of the SCT in hematology. We constructed a SCT composed of 60 questions and we administered it to 15 junior residents (R1 to R3 in internal medicine), 46 senior residents (R4, R5 and R6) and 17 hematologists from across Canada. After item optimization, the test comprised 51 questions. Its internal consistency measured by Cronbach alpha was 0.83. The test was able to discriminate between residents according to their year of training. Questions containing an image (n=10) seemed to offer a stronger discriminative potential. Scores obtained by the senior residents correlated moderately with those obtained on a conventional hematology exam made of multiple choice questions and short-answers (Pearson r: 0.42; p=0.02). The SCT was completed in an average of 36 minutes and was well received by participants. The SCT is a useful and valid evaluation instrument in hematology. It may be used during training to monitor resident progression. It may also be combined to other evaluation tools and used for summative purposes or in continuing medical education.

867	Conséquences d’une restriction de croissance intra-utérine sur la réactivité aortique chez le rat en fonction de l’âge et du sexe biologique	Background. Vascular tone is regulated by several mechanisms and several exogenous and endogenous stimuli such as circulating hormones and the vasoactive compounds released by the endothelium. Many studies have shown that pre-menopausal women are less likely to develop cardiovascular diseases and that this is due to the protective effects of estrogenic hormones on the cardiovascular system. In addition, some studies have shown that the stiffening of arteries that is associated with aging is different in men and women and that intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) predisposes to the development of cardiovascular disease in adulthood differently in men and women. We wanted to investigate whether aortic vascular reactivity depends on sex, age and intrauterine environment and whether aortic stiffness is different between males and females. Methods. Thoracic aortic rings from 5-, 12- and 20-week old male and female control and IUGR rats with intact endothelium were mounted in isolated organ baths. The contraction to increasing doses of phenylephrine (PE) with or without L -NAME and the dilatation to increasing doses of carbachol (Cbc) or sodium nitroprusside (SNP) were recorded in order to evaluate the vascular reactivity of the aorta and to compare the different groups. Thoracic aortic rings from male and female rats aged between 13 and 17 weeks were used to assess arterial stiffness. Results. In male rats only, maximal contraction to PE in absence or presence of L-Name increased at the age of 20 weeks in controls and at the age of 12 and 20 weeks in IUGR. In females, maximal contraction in the absence of L-Name was not affected by age or IUGR. However, maximal contraction to PE in the presence of L-Name increased after puberty. The effect of L-Name was stronger in females. Maximal relaxation in response to Cbc was reduced in IUGR groups. However, no difference was observed with SNP and no difference in stiffness was observed between males and females. Conclusion. L-Name experiments suggest that NO has a more important role in females and PE results suggest that males are more responsive to vasoconstrictor stimuli while growing up and this is even more pronounced when they are growth restricted. The difference in maximal contraction between males and females is not due to a difference in arterial stiffness.

868	Impact de l’expression de l’isoforme p35 de la chaîne invariante humaine chez des souris déficientes en CD74 endogène	The invariant chain (Ii; CD74) is a type II membrane protein which plays a key role in antigen presentation as well as acting as a receptor for the cytokine MIF (macrophage migration inhibitory factor). In the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Ii assists the folding of MHC II and prevents the loading of nascent polypeptides in the peptide-binding groove. Di-leucine-like motifs contained in the Ii cytoplasmic tail target the MHC II-Ii complexes in the endocytic pathway. Once in low pH-endosomes, Ii is degraded allowing the binding of a high affinity peptide which is then presented on cell surface to CD4+ T cells. In Ii deficient mice, MHC II displays a “floppy” conformation typical of empty molecules or is loosely bound with peptides. The transport is aberrant leading to decreased surface expression of MHC II and defective antigenic presentation. Also, the lack of Ii restricts the peptide repertoire and impairs thymic selection of CD4+ T cells. Moreover, Ii regulates B cells maturation and Ii deficient mice display reduced numbers of mature follicular B cells (FO). The human minor p35 isoform (Iip35) does not exist in mice and displays a 16 amino acids N-terminal cytoplasmic extension containing a di-arginine (R-x-R) motif causing ER retention and acting as dominant in heterotrimeric complexes with Iip33. Upon binding to MHC II, the retention motif is masked, which allows the complexes to egress from the ER.  The physiological role of the R-x-R motif is poorly understood. To shed light on Iip35 function, we generated transgenic mice expressing Iip35 and analyzed the conformation and traffic of MHC II, the thymic selection and the development of B cells as well as the antigenic presentation.  Our results showed that Iip35 generates an MHC II in the right conformation and increases MHC II surface expression. Also, Iip35 targets MHC II into endosomes where high affinity peptides bind to the groove. We also showed that Iip35 diversifies the peptide repertoire and fully restores thymic selection of CD4+ T cells as well as the TCR levels on these cells. Then, Iip35 ensures presentation of the Ii-dependent antigen ovalbumin but does not totally rescue the presentation of superantigens. Interestingly, thymic selection of the iNKT cells is fully restored showing that Iip35 assists with lipids presentation by CD1d. Finally, Iip35 allows B cells to develope into FO B cells but does not support marginal zone (MZ) B cells maturation. This result suggests that MIF stimulation is not a prerequisite for FO B cells development. Altogether, these results showed that Iip35 is functional and has most of the CD74 functions. However, it cannot replace the endogenous Ii regarding the MZ B cells maturation suggesting that Iip35 could have regulatory functions by modulating the development of some cells.

rapid prototyping in artisanal jewellery making and its impact on the perceived value
of jewellery"	Since the Industrial Revolution, technology has transformed the world of manufacturing. Nowadays, new technologies, such as rapid prototyping, are breaking through in areas that once belonged exclusively to the domain of handicraft, such as jewellery making, by providing quicker and easier means of fabrication.  The methodology of this research uses a mixed approach to answer the two research questions: - ‘How does rapid prototyping technology influence the practice of jewellery making and its outcome? In what way?’ - ‘How does the use of rapid prototyping technology influence potential users appreciation of a piece of jewellery? In what ways?’ During this qualitative research, data were gathered during interviews with three different jewellers as well as with two focus groups composed of potential consumers. The results revealed that the use of RP is useful in overcoming some limits of the handmade techniques regarding geometry, marketability and finesse of details. On the other hand it creates distance between the hand of the jeweller and the created object, thereby denaturalising the practice. The technology was found to be regarded as a less authentic means of making jewellery as compared to hand made: the use of machines recalled mass production and the feature of reproducibility was perceived as something that decreased the emotional potential of a piece of jewellery.  This research provides a better understanding of the use of rapid prototyping technology in jewellery making and its implications. It will hopefully inspire the development of ways to better integrate the technology with the manual practice.	design de bijoux , Jewellery design , rapid prototyping , jewellery making , craftsmanship	en	12725.0
870	L’or bleu, une ressource à redéfinir : la conciliation du droit à l’eau et de ses enjeux	Formerly considered as an inexhaustible resource, there is presently a global fresh water shortage.In this context, it is essential to verify if and how we can assure adequate protection of the water supply and how such a protection could be put in place. Using a juridico-political approach, the purpose of this thesis is to reinforce the existence of a human right to water and to analyze water management problems through various trade agreements and water governance structures, internationally and in Canada. Our analysis reveals the evolution of a human right to water in international law but its enforceability is preconditioned to the recognition of this right by States. Our observations highlight an international tendency toward privatizing water resources, a tendency that should be revised to ensure the realization of a right to water for all.

871	Cross-sectional dependence in idiosyncratic volatility	This paper introduces a framework for analysis of cross-sectional dependence in the idiosyncratic volatilities of assets using high frequency data. We first consider the estimation of standard measures of dependence in the idiosyncratic volatilities such as covariances and correlations. Next, we study an idiosyncratic volatility factor model, in which we decompose the co-movements in idiosyncratic volatilities into two parts: those related to factors such as the market volatility, and the residual co-movements. When using high frequency data, naive estimators of all of the above measures are biased due to the estimation errors in idiosyncratic volatility. We provide bias-corrected estimators and establish their asymptotic properties. We apply our estimators to high-frequency data on 27 individual stocks from nine different sectors, and document strong cross-sectional dependence in their idiosyncratic volatilities. We also find that on average 74% of this dependence can be explained by the market volatility.	High frequency data , Idiosyncratic volatility , Factor structure , Cross-sectional returns	en	12689.0
873	Articulated Model Registration of MRI/X-Ray Spine Data	This paper presents a method based on articulated models for the registration of spine data extracted from multimodal medical images of patients with scoliosis. With the ultimate aim being the development of a complete geometrical model of the torso of a scoliotic patient, this work presents a method for the registration of vertebral column data using 3D magnetic resonance images (MRI) acquired in prone position and X-ray data acquired in standing position for five patients with scoliosis. The 3D shape of the vertebrae is estimated from both image modalities for each patient, and an articulated model is used in order to calculate intervertebral transformations required in order to align the vertebrae between both postures. Euclidean distances between anatomical landmarks are calculated in order to assess multimodal registration error. Results show a decrease in the Euclidean distance using the proposed method compared to rigid registration and more physically realistic vertebrae deformations compared to thin-plate-spline (TPS) registration thus improving alignment.

Looking beyond short-term implications, the consequences of the military intervention of 2003 are the most significant. The failure of the process of institutional reconstruction gave birth to a weak, dysfunctional and corrupt state; a fertile ground for the establishment and the proliferation of terrorist and criminal movements. In this working paper, the author attempts to identify the ‘’profound reasons’’ of the current drama while taking into account the impacts of the multiple transformations that have affected state structures since the fall of the Baathist regime in April 2003.

876	L’architecture de paysage moderne du campus de l’Université de Montréal	The campus of the University of Montreal is based on a highly significant association of buildings and landscape design that contributes to our understanding of the evolution of the use of space in the campus environment. For a number of historical reasons, the open spaces of the 1960s deserve particular attention. In the context of unprecedented expansion experienced by the university at the time and the simultaneous coming to age in Québec of the disciplines of landscaping and planning, open spaces on the campus became, for the first time in the history of the university, the focus of serious reflection. This article describes the context influencing the planning principles applied by La Haye and Associates, one of Québec’s leading urban planning firms, in designing these open spaces for the campus. We trace the strengths and shortcomings of modern thinking about open spaces – on the one hand, the innovative approaches used in planning and design, and, on the other, the overemphasis placed on car related needs, at the expense of safety and opportunities for social interaction.

877	Rancheros y el Estado mexicano : la construcción del honor a través del poder	This research aims to examine a cattle ranchers’ society in a community located in north Jalisco: Colotlán. I will study its relationship with the environment, its economy involved in national and international markets, its political configuration (considering its links with the state) and its symbolism, that includes their work ethics. My analysis has allowed me to identify different forms of relationship among peers and the values, the affective dimensions, and the representations that derive from them. I propose the existence of a certain type of social formation that can be called “honorable society” due to the importance of the traditions that concern their main economic activity, as well as its identity founded on moral values and rules linked to honor. I analyze the connection of power with politics and the way political power is built, the existing links between honor and power, and how people build honor through power. This society has suffered the increasing impact of modernizing practices and ideologies, with attempts at institutionalization through national and state interests.   Relying on a methodology that combines research in historical archives and extensive fieldwork, this thesis aims to contribute to the studies of cultural identities, in which honor occupies a central place in the context of the relationship between rancher communities and the state.

878	Etude du rôle de la réponse UV sur le contrôle de la réparation par excision de nucléotides (NER) des dommages à l’ADN : rôle des voies MAPK et de l’ADN polymérase eta	The UV-response is a complex cellular response to UV irradiation, which allows cellular adaptation and protection against deleterious effects of UV. This specialized response involves numerous molecular and signaling events from plasma membrane and from the nucleus represented, among others, by Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) pathway activation and translesion synthesis respectively. More particularly, the exact role of these events on the removal UV-induced DNA damage by nucleotide excision repair (NER) in human cells is poorly understood and documented. By using a sensitive flow cytometry based-NER assay, presented and validated in this thesis, to quantify the removal of UV-DNA damage, it was unexpectedly found that Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) signalling, originating from the the plasma membrane, does not regulate the efficiency of UV-induced DNA damage repair in human cells. Indeed, MAPK inhibition with pharmacological inhibitors, expression of short-hairpin RNA or dominant negative mutant, all together, substantiate fully the lack of effect of this signalling pathway on UV-damage removal by NER in human primaries and tumorous cells. Surprisingly, the same NER assay, applied to quantify the removal of UV-induced DNA damages as a function of the cell cycle, has shown a requirement of functional translesion synthesis polymerase eta (Pol η) for efficient UV-DNA damage repair in human cells uniquely during S-phase, where its function is required for the bypass of UV DNA damage. This observation, originally made in fibroblasts from xeroderma pigmentosum variant syndrome (XP-V) afflicted patients, was further confirmed in normal human cells, by abrogation of endogenous Pol η expression or by complementation with Pol η in XP-V cells. All together, the data presented here, indicate that MAPK signaling play no role in NER-mediated UV-damage removal, but highlight a role for UV-DNA damage tolerance response, as translesion synthesis, in regulation of NER efficiency. More particularly, these observations establish a potential link between the S-Phase Repair (SPR) of UV-DNA damages and replicative stress, revealed by a deficiency of Pol η or ATR. This SPR defects seen under acute replicative stress conditions could impact tumorogenesis or chemotherapy outcomes. Moreover, SPR defects, seen in XP-V cells could be controlled by replicative stress, and also reflect a protective coordination to reduce high risks of genetic or chromosomal aberrations that may occur during DNA replication upon UV exposure.

In the frame of an exploratory qualitative research, twelve semi-directed interview are carried out with members of the staff working directly with the clientele of such Accommodation centre. The originality of this thesis is to give a voice to the staff in direct interaction with the residents and to collect the concerns they have in mind while they perform their activities. The qualitative analysis of the content of these interviews allow expose many concerns of the staff in regard of différent elements of the environnement such as the Center as an organisation, the resident and the end of his life, the peers of the last, the associates of the staff such as families and co-workers, as much as much toward themselves in regard of their knowhow and how to be. Nonetheless, certain component limit its range such as : the choice of volunteers as participants, their small number particularly regarding the males staff and, the effect of social desirability that could have drawn the presentation of an improved vision of the reality. This thesis contribute to the advance of the knowledge in bioethics, demonstrating that the recourse at Ricœur's ethical thinking constitute a pertinent to use for the comprehension and analysis of the institutional functioning, the quality of life of the residents in end of life, as much as for the intervention of staff in their interventions in their accompaniment toward the residents and their families. In leaning on Ricœur's components of small ethics to set the bases of a program of end of life in Accommodation centre, this thesis shows also that the reference to Ricœur can constitute a valid resource to elaborate a response to the ministerial directive taking in account the staff's recommandations.

880	Impact de la nouvelle loi sur le contrat du travail (dite «loi de 2008») sur les stratégies de gestion des multinationales étrangères en chine	China's economic growth observed over the past three decades has been accompanied by some significant social changes. Until 2008, the labor law inherited from the socialist era and unsuited to the market economy, benefited economic growth rather than workers. The new Labor Contract Law (2008) aims at correcting this situation by balancing the labor relationship in the context of a more equitable sharing of wealth. The objective of this M.A. thesis is to understand how foreign companies in China contend with this institutional change. Does it impact their management and their location strategy? This issue is addressed by studying the case of one foreign company that has been based in Shanghai for the last 10 years. The first observed effect is a professionalization of human resource management within the firm. The increase in operating costs (to which the new law contributes in part) has also led to the relocation of manufacturing operations to cheaper area in central China. The specific expertise acquired in Shanghai is the major reason prohibiting a relocation to another country.

881	Agrégation de tensioactifs anioniques à une interface solide-aqueux induite par l'oxydation d'une monocouche auto-assemblée de ferrocenylalkanethiolates	The redox-induced pairing from aqueous solution of a homologous series of sodium n-alkyl sulfate (6, 8, 10 and 12 carbon atoms) to self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of ferrocenyldodecanethiolates on a gold surface (Fc(CH2)12SAu) is investigated by spectroscopy of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) coupled with the cyclic voltammetry (CV). The SPR technique is used to monitor in real time the adsorption of surfactant in function of the applied potential. It quantifies the adsorbed layer thickness and surface coverage to determine the organization of anionic surfactants on SAM. CV is used to characterize the oxidation of ferrocene group in the presence of sodium n-alkyl sulfates that associate with SAM through matching between the ferrocenium and sulfate group.   Binary mixtures of alkylesulfates of different compositions are used to determine the structure induced by a redox reaction. The effect of the length of the hydrocarbon chain on the amount of anionic surfactants adsorbed and the relative affinities of matching the ferroceniums alkyl sulfate anions are reported in this thesis. These electrosensitive surfaces allow the detection of amphiphilic molecules and the understanding the behavior of binary mixtures of surfactants. Thus, this work will result in progress on the electrochemical modulation organizing materials on solid substrates based on the ion-pairing.	sulfate n-alkyle de sodium , Self-assembled monolayers , sodium n-alkyl sulfate , cyclic voltammetry , surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy , atomic force microscopy	en	12545.0

The Iroquoians at Droulers produced scrapers, arrowheads, drills, whetstones and manos, and also shaped tools with crystal quartz. Among the 3595 lithic objects, we find 18 tools and 1085 pieces of debitage in crystal quartz, which compose over 30% of the total lithic assemblage. Cristal quartz was worked during Québec prehistory, but never to this extent. This thesis is about the chaîne opératoire of crystal quartz and its uses throughout prehistory of Québec and among prehistoric Iroquoians.

883	Les traversées d’une tradition : identité culturelle et remédiation de la chanson populaire au Québec	This work, which mainly takes the form of an argumentative text, represents the written part of this master’s thesis and follows a process of reflection on a film production, from its conception to its reception. It exposes the results of a creative process through various stages and accompanies the creation part, Les Saisons Lyriques, which is a documentary film. These chapters are intended as a tool for any film artist wishing to do audiovisual experimentation that raises the question of how the choice of the film media is effective to carry and convey a subject. In this thesis, the subject is incidental and serves as material to show why the documentary film is a reliable way of expression to translate an idea and produce the desired effect, even when there is interaction between one media and another. This study will help to evaluate subsequent levels at which media can be found working in the service of another. Although the subject is secondary, it is appropriate in this context in that it concerns an artistic object broadcast by various kinds of media: the song. The latter, representing the subject of specific study, is surrounded by a more elaborate topic: the transformation of Quebec's cultural identity through the remediation of the popular song.

884	Patient-specific model of a scoliotic torso for surgical planning	A method for the construction of a patient-specific model of a scoliotic torso for surgical planning via inter- patient registration is presented. Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) of a generic model are registered to surface topography (TP) and X-ray data of a test patient. A partial model is first obtained via thin-plate spline registration between TP and X-ray data of the test patient. The MRIs from the generic model are then fit into the test patient using articulated model registration between the vertebrae of the generic model’s MRIs in prone position and the test patient’s X-rays in standing position. A non-rigid deformation of the soft tissues is performed using a modified thin-plate spline constrained to maintain bone rigidity and to fit in the space between the vertebrae and the surface of the torso. Results show average Dice values of 0.975 ± 0.012 between the MRIs following inter-patient registration and the surface topography of the test patient, which is comparable to the average value of 0.976 ± 0.009 previously obtained following intra-patient registration. The results also show a significant improvement compared to rigid inter-patient registration. Future work includes validating the method on a larger cohort of patients and incorporating soft tissue stiffness constraints. The method developed can be used to obtain a geometric model of a patient including bone structures, soft tissues and the surface of the torso which can be incorporated in a surgical simulator in order to better predict the outcome of scoliosis surgery, even if MRI data cannot be acquired for the patient.

885	Collaborer : un jeu d’enfant? : regards des parents de familles vulnérables sur les relations famille-école	Parents in vulnerable families encounter both personal and social problems that further complicate their ability for effective parenting; this, leading to incidences that may affect their child’s development (Léveillé, Chamberland et Tremblay-Renaud, 2007). Therefore, there may be an increase of school-based and social interventions seen within these families. It is strongly recommended that parents be encouraged to actively participate in available programs as well as academic and social intervention strategies (MSSS, 2003). Participating in these programs can be quite challenging for these parents. The objective of this research is to develop a better understanding of the parents’ point of view with regards to the professionals who participate in the decision making process for their child’s academic development as well as their own place in the decisions making process. In order to meet this objective, a sub sample of 19 parents was used to evaluate the AIDES initiative. Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with the participants. An analysis of the results identified three dimensions that are influencing the parents’ level of satisfaction: the parents’ position within the decisions making process, the quality of the relationship with the professionals and whether the needs of their child are met.

886	Caractérisation des nanoparticules polymériques par la technique d'ultracentrifugation analytique	The use of nanoparticles (NPs) in numerous industrial fields is becoming more common, which increases their propagation in the environment. Their generally unknown persistence, mobility, bioaccumulation and toxicity all contribute to increased risks to human health and to ecosystems. Unfortunately, their characterization and quantification are complex analytical challenges due in large part to their dynamic nature (small size, high reactivity and instability). The objective of this study was to characterize polymeric nanoparticles (Allosperse®), which are intended for the dispersion of the nanopesticides using analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC). To achieve this goal, the sizes of various metallic nanoparticles (nAg, QD), metallic oxides (nTiO2, nZnO) and polystyrene nanoparticles (nPS) were first determined by AUC using different detectors (absorbance, fluorescence and interference). In the case of polymeric nanoparticles, a number of preliminary tests were carried out in order to optimize the speed and duration of the ultracentrifugation, the number of scans and the concentration of the NPs for the determination of their hydrodynamic diameter (dh). The analysis indicated that the AUC was able to measure the sizes of the smallest nanoparticles. In addition, evaluations of the behavior of these nanoparticles between pH 4-8, ionic strengths from 0 to 500 mM, in the presence and absence of natural organic matter (NOM) showed that they had a dh of about 7.0 nm with small increases at low pH or for large ionic strengths or hardness. These results strongly demonstrated a high physical and chemical stability of allosphères, which implied that they would have a high mobility in soils. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) were used to validate the results obtained by the AUC.	pH , Polymeric nanoparticles , Characterization , pH , Ionic strength , Hardness , Natural organic matter , Mobility , Soil , Analytical ultracentrifugation	en	12494.0
887	Le panasiatisme en Asie : une construction de l’identité asiatique et japonaise, 1900-1924	"Research on the development of Pan-asianism outside Japan has long been neglected by historians. This thesis is an attempt of decompartmentalization of Pan-asianism to better understand its emergence in Asia and its role in the construction of an Asian identity between 1900 and 1924. This will be done by examining the speech of five actors of this ""ideology."" Using a Global History perspective, it demonstrates how Pan-asianism in Asia is part of a network of contacts and circulation of ideas in the early 20th century which was mainly influenced by two concepts in its definition of Asia: the yellow race and the Asian civilisation. Other than trying to better understand the relationships between Pan-asianism in Asia and Japan, this master’s thesis also explores the similarities and differences between them, especially the creation of an identity and a perception of Japan as a model of modernization and leader of the continent that spreads in Asia through Pan-asianism’s rhetoric."

888	Les stratégies organisationnelles de gestion des rumeurs sur Internet : une analyse ventriloque	In this thesis, we analyze the strategies organizations develop to manage and fight against rumors through the Internet and the social media. The objective is to mobilize a ventriloquial approach to analyze how various authority figures are used by the organizations and the consumers to lend weight to their respective positions through their online interactions. As we show, organizations use a multitude of authority figures to convince their consumers. At the same time, they position themselves as subjected to agencies that are contextual to the rumor they are facing. Similarly, Internet users stage concerns that are supposed to drive their positions. As we show, dialogues between organizations and Internet users reflect different relations between these two parties. Indeed, organizations do not all interact in the same way with Internet users. This analysis is based on data collected from organization websites and social media such as Facebook and Twitter.

889	Le «recours en oppression» : quelles attentes raisonnables pour les créanciers ?	Creditors feature prominently in the corporate governance of Canadian business corporations and significantly contribute to their funding. Creditors perform in exchange for a promise to be paid later, so that they are in an agency conflict with other stakeholders of the corporation, especially managers. The main procedural route for litigation in corporate law, the oppression remedy helps curb some aspects of the agency conflict by granting courts broad powers to remedy oppressive conduct. This judicial intervention is expressed through the theory of reasonable expectations, which states that the court must not only protect the legal rights of the parties but also their reasonable expectations. The case law shows that creditors have reasonable expectations toward the information provided by the corporation, its assets and the decision-making process of managers and directors. It also suggests a reasonable expectation with respect to changes in the sharing of risks arising from an unforeseeable event.

890	L'Approximation diophantienne simultanée et l'optimisation discrète	Given a (lower or upper) bounded function $f:\mathbb{N}^k \To \Real$ by a mathematical expression. The problem to find the extremal points of $f$ on any bounded set $S \subset \mathbb{N}^k$ is well-defined from a classical point of view. Nevertheless, from a computability theory perspective,  it should be avoided the possibility of pathologies when this problem has infinite Kolmogorov complexity. The main constraint is that the order relationship between  computable reals is not effectively solvable. We solve this problem by means of a structure containing two algorithms. The first one allows to evaluate the cost function while the second one transforms each value of the cost function in a point in an infinite dimensional vector of a space. We develop three particular cases, one of them corresponding to the Rauzy approximation method. Finally, we make a comparison between the best simultaneous Diophantine approximations obtained by the Rauzy method (our optimization-oriented version of it) and our tetrahedral method, that is one of the main achievement of this work.

891	L'efficacité du cadre légal particulier de la négociation collective visant les pompiers municipaux québécois : le cas des pompiers de Montréal	The particular legal framework of collective bargaining for Quebec’s municipal firemen, despite the fact that it submits to some principles of the general collective bargaining system provided by the Labour Code, presents some particularities that could affect its efficacity and contribute in establishing difficult and conflicting labour relations. This thesis will mostly consider the difficulties associated with this particular legal framework which prohibits strikes, in all circumstances, to the firemen and provide, as an alternative, the resort to compulsory arbitration. The analysis of Montreal firemen’s labour relations can’t allow us to qualify this particular legal framework as an inefficient alternative to the general collective bargaining system. But still, this thesis may show the limits of a legal framework when some external factors, like the public character of the employer or the particular nature of the job, seem to play a major role in the conflicting labor relations implicating firemen.

892	Los disfraces de la disidencia en la música cubana alternativa	My research aims to understand how the main economic issues (food and energetic deficiencies), social issues (inequalities and racism) and cultural issues (stagnation and censorship) which have been occurring in Cuba since 1990, are reflected in the music of a certain number of bands.  The goal of this study is to determine whether these artistic expressions are mirroring the society of this period, since they contemplate aspects of public interest that are concealed in the official discourse. This analysis will examine the discursive strategies of lyrics from certain musical productions, which represent a rich and complex range. In addition, this study aims to understand if music can be considered a space of civil society in a context that prevents the free formation of social actors.  This study focuses on the work of five artists who cultivate very different musical genres: trova (Frank Delgado and Carlos Varela), rap (Krudas Cubensi and Los Aldeanos) and punk (Porno Para Ricardo). The analysis will focus mostly on the lyrics, which are considered as literary texts. A significant corpus of songs will be selected and systematically and transversally analyzed, in an attempt to highlight the effects produced and their significations, both explicit and symbolic. I will also refer to their live performances and their aesthetics. This study intends to highlight the literary and musical productions of artists who are not well known or in Cuba. One of the goals is to show how, in a political context dominated by authoritarianism and censorship, forms of expressions that are capable of communicating subversive and dissident messages may still exist.	censorship , racism , emigration , generation , identity , Carlos Varela , Frank Delgado , Los Aldeanos , Krudas Cubensi , Porno Para Ricardo	en	12448.0
893	Investigation de l'implication des neurones GABAergiques exprimant la parvalbumine dans les déficits cognitifs associés aux délétions du gène Cacna1a	Loss-of-function mutations in the CACNA1A gene, which encodes the α1 subunit of voltage-gated CaV2.1 channels, result in episodic ataxia (EA2) and epilepsy in humans. These conditions are rarely associated with overt cognitive deficits. We recently investigated 16 patients from 4 non-consanguinous families carrying different CACNA1A loss-of-function mutations and revealed that the majority of them had moderate to significant neurocognitive impairment. Targeted deletion of Cacna1a selective to forebrain GABAergic interneurons (INs) in mice leads to a selective synaptic impairment of parvalbumin-positive (PV) fast-spiking basket cells that is sufficient to induce generalised epilepsy. We therefore, propose that a selective impairment of perisomatic inhibition resulting from PV-INs synaptic dysfunction in neocortical orbitofrontal circuits might also contribute to the cognitive deficits associated with Cacna1a deletions. In this study, we examined the effects of CaV2.1 channel ablation in PV neurons that are thought to be critical for cognition. To this end, we generated mutant mice carrying a targeted heterozygous Cacna1a deletion restricted to PV neuronal populations (PVcre; Cacna1ac/+); this mutation occurs post-natally. Using an electrophysiologic approach combined with optogenetics, we demonstrated that this selective mutation significantly impairs perisomatic inhibition of pyramidal cells in the orbitofrontal cortex. We assessed the behavioral and cognitive abilities of these mutants with different behavioral tests and discovered that they present impulsivity and reduced cognitive flexibility.  In conclusion, our work suggests that loss-of-function mutations in Cacna1a are associated with cognitive impairments, which are partly attributable to disrupted perisomatic inhibition in orbitofrontal circuits.

894	Les impacts urbains des évènements sportifs internationaux : les cas du parc municipal Américo Renné Giannetti à Belo Horizonte (Brésil) et la Coupe du monde de 2014	"Mega sporting events have become an important global phenomenon. Host countries and cities use these events to promote an image of global development. Such events often lead to major urban renewal projects. The nature of the impact of such development project on local populations remains unclear. In light of these processes, this study had the objective of  identifying and analyzing differing local perspectives on the revitalization of the Américo  Renné Giannetti Municipal Park in Belo Horizonte (Brazil), within the context of spatial  transformations of the city for the 2014 World Cup. We begin by situating this research within  the literature that examines urban redevelopment in relationship to mega events. This literature suggests that, through the practices of urban entrepreneurialism, certain urban areas, such as parks and historical districts are transformed into ""products"" to be consumed by a very specific audience. In order to understand whether a similar type of process is under way in Belo Horizonte, we conducted a study of the history and contemporary transformation of the Municipal Park. Based on field observations, interviews with people who frequent the park, as well as interviews with individuals involved in the park management, we examine the social role that the park plays in Belo Horizonte. The analysis of different visions of the project leads us to conclude that the revitalization of the park for the World Cup responds to the interests of the private sector, particularly tourism. In this context, the social impact for the local population is inevitable. While the redevelopment of the park responds to the need of certain citizens, the alteration of the space leads to exclusions and reaffirms segregation in urban areas."

895	Les considérations environnementales dans l'arbitrage d'investissement sous l'égide du CIRDI	International arbitration is one of the most frequently used methods to resolve disputes related to foreign investment. Several international investment agreements include provisions relating to arbitration under the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes established by the Washington Convention of 1966. Arbitral tribunals are called to resolve disputes concerning the conduct of host States vis-à-vis foreign investors. Their decisions have major consequences on the public interest, specifically when it comes to protecting the environment. The growing development of environmental law and its encroachment on investment protection has triggered a series of disputes that are no longer confined to questions of nationalization or breach of contracts as before, but often revolve around State public policy measures that involve sensitive issues such as, inter alia, hazardous waste management, access to clean water, urban sprawl, protection of biodiversity. The role of ICSID tribunals and their decisions is therefore critical in the development of investment law and the debate on investment protection and environmental regulation.  This study aims to analyze the role of environmental considerations in ICSID arbitral awards. Specifically, it seeks to display the main arguments retained by international tribunals and to identify the major trends in international investment arbitration vis-à-vis environmental measures.

896	L'influence thérapeutique de la perception de justice informationnelle et interpersonnelle sur les symptômes de stress post-traumatique des victimes d'actes criminels	Following a crime, the need for information is fundamental for victims (Baril, 1984). Police officers play an important role in the transmission of information to victims given that they are the first actors encountered by victims in the legal system and usually the ones with which they have more interactions (Laxminarayan, 2013). Also, how victims perceive the contacts they had with the police can have a significant impact on their psychological recovery (Herman, 2003). This study aims to measure the therapeutic impact of victims’ interactions with police officers and the dissemination of information given to them on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Thus, the measuring instrument used was l’Échelle modifiée des symptômes du trouble de stress post-traumatique (Guay, Marchand, Iucci et Martin, 2002) which is a french adaptation of the Modified PTSD Symptom Scale-Self Report (MPSS-SR) elaborated by Falsetti, Resnick, Resick et Kilpatrick (1993). It was administered to participants (n=188) to evaluate the presence of PTSD in terms of frequency and severity of the symptoms. The study shows that information is an important aspect of fair treatment which in turn affects PTSD symptoms. Finally, the results will be discussed in a broader perspective on the theories in victimology about fairness perception, the issue of secondary victimization and on the implications for policies on victims' rights.

897	Programme expérimental «Bouger à l’heure juste» pour améliorer le statut pondéral d’adultes en surpoids	While the prevalence of obesity is a global problem, the avenues to better use exercise (Ex) is of great interest. Ex can reduce appetite and energy intake, also called Ex-induced anorexia. Recent studies from our laboratory have shown the importance of the timing of Ex to decrease the energy intake. However, none certify that the timing of Ex maximizes body mass reduction in natural context. Therefore, the crossover design aimed to determine if there is an ideal Ex timing to optimize body weight and adiposity lost, in comparing the effect of two programs with a specific timing of Ex on the anthropometric profile of overweight adults. Eight volunteer adults from Montreal (18-45 years) overweight or obese participated and completed the study. In a random order, they performed two four-week Ex (2 x 15 min. Ex intervals daily) programs : 1) Ex before meals (ExMeal) vs 2) Ex at any time, except in the hour prior to the meals (MealEx). Weekly consultations at the University of Montreal included : anthropometric measurements, standardized questionnaires on physical activity and diet, and monitoring of trainings done in a natural setting. The Mann-Whitney U tests analysis focussed on changes that occured between ExMeal and MealEx programs (p = 0.05). Anthropometric changes, Ex practice within and outside of the program, and caloric intake (caloric content, and % of energy from carbohydrates, proteins and lipids) were similar between the ExMeal and MealEx programs (p > 0.05). However, the ExMeal program was associated with 2,8% more calories from proteins (p = 0.05). Furthermore, exploratory analysis showed that it is especially the sequence of events that was related to a reduction in anthropometric parameters, with a decrease in the percentage of fat and a greater compliance in the first month compared to the second month, regardless of the Ex program performed. While several prior studies validated the anorexigenic effect of acute Ex, the longer-term effect on the anthropometric profile was not confirmed with this pilot study. Factors such as the adiposity status, the structure of the program, the duration of the Ex sessions, and the fact that the program took place in a natural set up, made it more difficult to improve the anthropometric profile.

898	Les assassinats ciblés, facette méconnue de la guerre israélo-palestinienne	This goal of this thesis is to analyse the impact and effectiveness of the Israeli targeted killing policy within the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. To this end, three different approaches will be used; military, legal and political. Our hypothesis supports that the policy impedes the resolution to the conflict and is divided into three sections. First of all, Israeli targeted killings impede the conflict resolution because they, in turn, generate retaliations against Israel. Secondly it is a clear violation of international rights, including those of the Israelis. Finally, the policy is a serious obstacle to the settlement of the conflict due to the violent and distrustful atmosphere it arouses. In the conclusion, it is said that, although the policy does not prove to be an effective measure to fight terrorism, neither does it create an escalating cycle of violence. Secondly, the policy is a violation of the international legal system; however it can still be justified by some of the articles present in the same law texts. The Israeli Supreme Court has ruled that some of the operations could be legal. Thirdly, it is effectively detrimental to the resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict because the ambiance it creates exacerbates tensions. In conclusion, the myriad of impacts the policy has on the conflict make it ineffective.

899	Insights from youth workers regarding young people's engagement in out-of-school-time youth development programs	The objective of this exploratory study was to better understand young people’s engagement in out-of-school-time youth development programs from the perspective of frontline youth workers. Qualitative interviews were carried out with six youth workers to this end. A number of obstacles to engagement were identified, the majority of which are external to youth. Positive dispositions towards youth by youth workers were found to be key in overcoming some of these obstacles, although program content and structure, as well as group climate also play an important role. The key dimensions of engagement the interviewees raised led to an elaboration of a current model of engagement found in the literature, making it more holistic. Implications for the training of youth workers and the structure of youth programs are discussed.	Youth engagement , OST programs , Youth development , Youth workers	en	12393.0

Some survive with chronic health problems that impair the functioning of several organs. Some must deal with minor, moderate or severe physical or intellectual disabilities and are technology-dependent. This has huge consequences for the actors (the child, his parents, his family, members of the healthcare team and professionals), the institutions and the whole society. By focusing on the decision-making trajectory of parents of children with a complex medical condition, we wanted to understand how parents make decisions about their child to improve support for parents decision-making. The complexity of Edgar Morin is the main theoretical basis of the research. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 25 parents (15 mothers and 10 fathers). Key results include the multiplicity of types and decisions objects and the multisystem influence decision-making patterns. The results also show how influences change accross decision-making trajectory for these parents. The results allow us to propose some benchmarks that could improve support for parents exposed to complex decisions about their seriously child.

901	Écologie et implications trophiques de la cyanobactérie Lyngbya wollei dans le fleuve Saint-Laurent	Harmful proliferations of the filamentous cyanobacterium L. wollei forming conspicuous benthic mats on the bottom sediment have been reported with increasing frequency in the last 30 years in rivers, lakes, and springs in North America. It is a known producer of neurotoxins and volatile organic compounds (geosmin, 2-methylisoborneol) thus exerting socioeconomic and public health impacts. Lyngbya wollei is also considered a poor nutritional source for invertebrates because of its robust sheath and toxin production. Proliferation of L. wollei in St. Lawrence River (SLR; Quebec, Canada) was first noticed in 2005. We deemed important to determine its distribution over a 250 km stretch of the SLR to elaborate predictive models of its presence and biomass based on chemical and physical characteristics. Lyngbya wollei was generally found downstream of the inflow tributaries draining farmlands. As enriched waters flowed slowly through submerged vegetation, dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) concentration dropped but dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) remained high, leading to a low DIN:TDP ratio. Models identified DOC (positive effect), TP (negative effect), and DIN:TDP (negative effect) as the most important variables explaining L. wollei distribution. The risk of L. wollei occurrence in the SLR was correctly forecasted in 72%-92% of all cases with an independent data set. We then examined if hydrodynamic conditions, namely currents generated by waves and river flow, control spatial and temporal variations of L. wollei biomass in a large river system. We measured L. wollei biomass together with meteorological, physical, and chemical variables over three years at 10 sites along a gradient of exposure to current and wind in a large (148 km2) fluvial lake of SLR. Wave exposure and current velocity controlled spatial and temporal biomass variations. Biomass increased from May to November and persisted during winter. Interannual variations were primarily controlled by river flow (water level) with spring discharge dislodging mats from the previous year. As anticipated under climate change scenarios, drops in water level and rising storm intensity may lead to an increase in the areas colonized by L. wollei, together with more frequent episodes of mat disruption and beach fouling. Additionally, we evaluated the relative importance of L. wollei with respect to macrophytes and epiphytes. We assessed the influence of the spatial scale in structuring environmental variables and biomass of these benthic primary producers (PP). We also test to which extent their biomass reflected the nature of patches based on ecogeomorphology or the river continuum. To address these two questions, we used a nested design at 3 spatial scales within the SLR: 1) along a 250-km-long upstream-downstream river stretch, 2) among three fluvial lakes located within that river stretch and 3) within each fluvial lake. Environmental factors (conductivity and TP) and spatial structure together explained 59% of the variability in biomass of all three benthic PP. Spatial variability of biomass was best explained by conductivity (+) for macrophytes, DIN:TDP ratio (+) and water extinction coefficient (+) for epiphytes and DOC (+) and NH4+ (-) for L. wollei mats. Within-lake structure was the most important spatial component for all benthic PP, suggesting that local effects, such as enrichment by the inflow of tributaries, rather than upstream-downstream gradients, determined the biomass and composition of benthic PP. Therefore patch dynamics represents a general framework which adequately covers the spatial variability and wide variety of environmental conditions experienced by aquatic organisms found in large rivers. Finally, we investigated the ecological role of L. wollei mats in aquatic ecosystems, especially as a food source and shelter for the amphipod Gammarus fasciatus. We offered amphipods a choice between mats of L. wollei and either chlorophytes or an artificial mat made of acrylic wool in laboratory experiment. Moreover, we reconstructed in situ amphipod diet using mixing model (δ13C and δ15N). Gammarus fasciatus selected the substratum offering the best light refuge (Acrylic > Lyngbya = Rhizoclonium > Spirogyra). Presence of saxitoxins, tissue elemental composition and epiphyte abundance had no significant effect on substratum choice. Lyngbya wollei and its epiphytes constituted 36 and 24% of the in situ diet of G. fasciatus whereas chlorophytes, macrophytes and associated epiphytes represented a less important fraction of its diet. Benthic cyanobacterial mats should be considered a good shelter and food source for small omnivorous invertebrates such as amphipods.

902	Identification des indices comportementaux reliés à la présence d'intérêts sexuels déviants chez les agresseurs sexuels d’enfants	Revisions proposed for the pedophilic disorder (DSM-5; APA, 2013) included a criterion based on a minimum victim count to diagnose pedophilia when child molesters do not acknowledge having sexual attraction towards children, and phallometric evaluation of their sexual interests is not available or invalid. It was also proposed to divide the diagnostic with subtypes based on the preferred age category or the victims’ age: pedophilic (10 year-olds and younger), hebephilic (11-14 year-olds), or pedohebephilic (both). These revisions generated controversies among researchers and clinicians, and they were not adopted due to the paucity of empirical evidence supporting these propositions. This doctoral thesis aims to answer the main questions that were raised: 1) What indicators should be used when assessing deviant sexual interests among intrafamilial and extrafamilial child molesters respectively?; 2) Are the number of sexual interactions and the period duration of the offenses on the same victim associated with sexual deviance? 3) Do early pubescent child molesters have deviant sexual interests? The first article is a commentary on the DSM-5 outlining the thesis and presenting the preliminary results of the two following articles. The second article aims to answer the first two questions. Intrafamilial child molesters (n = 76) and extrafamilial child molesters (n = 93) are compared on their victim count, victims’ age and gender, the number of sexual interactions and the period duration of the offenses on the same victim, and their sexual interests acknowledged or measured with penile plethysmography. Associations between these indicators and deviant sexual interests are assessed for both groups. The results suggest that: 1) different indicators of deviant sexual interests should be used according to the offenders’ group; 2) repeated sexual interactions on a long period on the same victim suggest sexual deviance among intrafamilial offenders, while there is no association between these variables among extrafamilial offenders. This research is a first step towards using the number of sexual interactions and the period duration of the offenses on the same victim when assessing sexual deviance among child molesters. iv The third article aims to answer the last question. Child molesters grouped according to their victims' age category, pedophilic (n = 75), hebephilic (n = 44), and pedohebephilic (n = 49), were compared on different variables: victim count, victims' gender, criminal history, and sexual interests measured with penile plethysmography and acknowledged. The results show deviant sexual interests in the same proportions among the three groups. As for the other variables, the pedophilic and hebephilic groups do not differ much, but they both differ from the pedohebephilic group. The results highlight the overlap between sexual attraction to prepubescent and attraction to early pubescent children, and support their inclusion in the same diagnostic.	intrafamilial child molester , extrafamilial child molester , sexual interest , penile plethysmography , age of victims , victim count , number of sexual interactions , period duration of the offenses	en	12368.0
903	"Learning and Adjustment Outcomes in Socialized and Unsocialized Newcomers : An Ex-
Post-Facto Comparative Study"	Careers today are becoming increasingly multi-organizational (Howard, 1996), as workers are becoming more mobile and less loyal to a single organization (Fang, Duffy, & Shaw, 2011). Retention is a growing problem, and organizations are more and more preoccupied with the successful socialization and integration of their newcomers. However, best practice research on the subject of newcomer socialization has come up with mixed results over the course of the last 25 years of research. This comparative study sought to explore the differences between socialized newcomers and unsocialized newcomers in terms of organizational socialization process variables. Specifically, in its first objective, this study aimed at comparing these newcomer groups in terms of (1) proximal outcomes (learning of socialization content and role clarity) and (2) distal outcomes (affective organizational commitment, job satisfaction, and intention to quit) of the organizational socialization process, as well as in terms of (3) information network characteristics (network size, status, range, strength, and density), controlling for newcomer proactive strategies. In its second objective, this study sought to explore how the organizational socialization process (relationships between variables) differed between newcomer groups.   The participants were new employees in a large multi-media company (n = 53), all with a tenure of less than one year in the organization. This organization had a sanctioned socialization practice in place, but allowed department managers to socialize their newcomers at their discretion. This resulted in two newcomer groups: those who were socialized by their respective departments (“socialized” newcomer group) and those who were not (“unsocialized” newcomer group). Participants completed a questionnaire measuring proactive behaviors, mastery of socialization content, role clarity, affective organizational commitment, job satisfaction, intention to quit, and information network characteristics.  The results indicated that, with regards to the first objective, socialized and unsocialized newcomers differ in terms of their mastery of socialization content, namely, learning of job/task, group, and organization knowledge was significantly greater for socialized newcomers than for unsocialized newcomers. No differences in distal socialization outcomes or network characteristics were observed. As for the second objective, the organizational socialization process was different depending on the newcomer group. Unsocialized newcomers showed a significant positive relationship between proactive information seeking and network size, as well as between feedback seeking and network status. Proactive positive framing was positively related to job satisfaction and negatively related to intention to quit, and role clarity was related to job satisfaction in unsocialized newcomers. These relationships were not found in socialized newcomers. Instead, socialized newcomers showed significant relationships between learning of socialization content and each of the distal socialization outcomes (affective organizational commitment, job satisfaction, and intention to quit).   Overall, unsocialized newcomers’ adjustment seems related to their proactive strategies, while socialized newcomers’ adjustment is facilitated by a greater mastery of socialization content.  This study’s unique sample offers interesting insights into the different experiences of newcomers not normally found in popular best practice research. Recommendations for research and practice are discussed accordingly.

biphényles polychlorés : l’attention et le traitement visuel à l’étude"	The deleterious impact of environmental contaminants (EC) has been extensively studied in acute exposure and poisoning events. What about the chronic exposure to lower doses on cognitive and sensory development of children? The longitudinal studies of this thesis were conducted in Nunavik. Although geographically distant from industrial centers, the Inuit community is exposed to EC via their transport by atmospheric and oceanic currents and their bioaccumulation in fish and sea mammals. Since traditional native foods, especially beluga meat, are still frequently consumed by this community, a substantial proportion of Inuit infants are exposed in utero to EC. Inuit children are also continuously exposed to these neurotoxic agents during postnatal development. The considerable variation in consumption of traditional food within this community provides an opportunity to investigate the relation between degree of exposure to EC and the effects on cognitive and sensory development of children. Although some deficits have already been related with chronic exposure to environmental contaminants in the literature, this thesis is interested more specifically at these relations in Inuit children living up North. Furthermore, the protocols that were developed for this thesis will evaluate new aspects related to EC, which are the visuospatial attention and the early brain visual processing.  The first part of this thesis was designed to assess the effect of three EC on visuospatial attention with a modified Posner paradigm (M.I. Posner, et al., 1980). This psychophysical task was administered to Inuit children (mean age = 11.2 years) for whom the levels of exposure to mercury (Hg), lead (Pb) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were documented for pre and postnatal periods. In utero exposures to Pb and PCBs were significantly associated with greater impulsivity and inattention, respectively, while current exposure to Pb was significantly associated with longer reaction times. Although no specific effect has been found on visuospatial attention, the results of this study suggest that exposure to EC is associated with decreased in general attentional abilities in children living in Nunavik.  In the second part, early brain processing of visual information was assessed using visual evoked potentials with children from the same community (mean age = 10.9 years). Cord blood Hg level measured at birth was associated with a reduction of the amplitude and an increase of the latency of the N75 component. Prenatal exposure to Pb was associated with a delay of the N150 latency. These results suggest that heavy metal exposure, in particular during the gestational period, is associated with alterations in visual development.   The results presented in this thesis support the hypothesis that the developing brain is vulnerable during a chronic exposure to EC, even at concentration levels below the limits recommended by public health agencies. The results also shed new light on cognitive and sensory deficits associated with EC.

905	La recherche de naines brunes et étoiles de faible masse dans les associations cinématiques jeunes du voisinage solaire	The main objective of this thesis is the identification of low-mass star and brown dwarf members of young moving groups in the solar neighborhood. These associations are typically younger than 200 million years and include stars formed at the same time and in the same environment. The majority of their members with masses approximately larger than 0.3 times that of the Sun have already been discovered, however the less massive, fainter members are still elusive. Their identification will allow us to address several fundamental questions in astrophysics. In particular, uncovering young objects that are still warm because of their recent formation will allow us to probe masses down to only a few times the mass of Jupiter, a mass regime which is still poorly understood. They will allow us to constrain the initial mass function and explore the connection between brown dwarfs and exoplanets, given that the least massive brown dwarfs have physical properties similar to those of gaseous giant exoplanets.  In order to carry through this project, we have adapted the BANYAN I statistical tool to make it applicable to very low-mass objects in addition to bringing several improvements to the tool. We have included the use of two near-infrared color-magnitude diagrams that allow differentiating young low-mass stars and brown dwarfs from older objects, we added the use of prior probabilities to make its results more realistic, we adapted spatial and kinematic models of moving groups using tridimensional gaussian ellipsoids with axes free to rotate, we performed a Monte Carlo analysis to characterize the rate of false-positive and false-negatives, and we revised the structure of its source code to make it more efficient.  As a first step, we have used this new algorithm, BANYAN II, to identify 25 new candidate members among a sample of 158 known young low-mass stars (with spectral types > M4) and brown dwarfs. We have then performed a cross-correlation of two all-sky near-infrared catalogs consisting of ~ 500 million celestial objects to identify approximately 100 000 brown dwarf and low-mass star candidates in the solar neighborhood. We have identified a few hundred promising young association members in this sample with the BANYAN II tool, and have performed a near-infrared spectroscopic survey to characterize them.  The work presented here has led to the identification of 79 candidate young brown dwarfs and 150 candidate young low-mass stars, and a spectroscopic follow-up allowed us to confirm the young age of 49 brown dwarfs and 62 low-mass stars. We have thus boosted the number of known young brown dwarfs by a factor ~ 2, opening the door to a statistical characterization of their population. These new young brown dwarfs represent an ideal laboratory to better understand the atmospheres of gaseous giant exoplanets. We have identified the first signs of a turn-up in the initial mass function of very low-mass brown dwarfs in the Tucana-Horologium association, which could indicate that exoplanet scattering plays a significant role in composing their population. Results from this spectroscopic follow-up has allowed us to construct an complete empirical sequence of spectral types M5-L5 for field dwarfs, low-gravity (β) and very low-gravity (γ) dwarfs. We have performed a comparison of these new data with evolution and atmosphere models, and constructed a set of empirical spectral type-magnitude and color-magnitude sequences for young brown dwarfs. Finally, we have discovered two new exoplanets from a direct-imaging follow-up of low-mass stars discovered as part of this project. The future GAIA mission and the complete spectroscopic follow-up of the candidates presented in this thesis will allow to confirm their membership and to constrain the initial mass function in the substellar regime.

906	Space and time characterization of laser-induced plasmas for applications in chemical analysis and thin film deposition	After decades of development, laser ablation has become an important technique for a large number of applications such as thin film deposition, nanoparticle synthesis, micromachining, chemical analysis, etc. Experimental and theoretical studies have been conducted to understand the physical mechanisms of the laser ablation processes and their dependence on the laser wavelength, pulse duration, ambient gas and target material.  The present dissertation describes and investigates the relative importance of the physical mechanisms influencing the characteristics of aluminum laser-induced plasmas. The general scope of this research encompasses a thorough study of the interplay between the plasma plume dynamics and the ambient gas in which they expand. This is achieved by imaging and analyzing the temporal and spatial evolution the plume in terms of spectral intensity, electron density and excitation temperature within various environments extending from vacuum (10‾7 Torr) to atmospheric pressure (760 Torr), in an inert gas like Ar and He, as well as in a chemically active gas like N2.  Our results show that the plasma emission intensity generally differs with the nature of the ambient gas and it is strongly affected by its pressure. In addition, for a given time delay after the laser pulse, both electron density and plasma temperature increase with the ambient gas pressure, which is attributed to plasma confinement. Moreover, the highest electron density is observed close to the target surface, where the laser is focused and it decreases by moving away (radially and axially) from this position. In contrast with the significant axial variation of plasma temperature, there is no large variation in the radial direction. Furthermore, argon was found to produce the highest plasma density and temperature, and helium the lowest, while nitrogen yields intermediate values. This is mainly due to their physical and chemical properties such as the mass, the excitation and ionization levels, the thermal conductivity and the chemical reactivity. The expansion of the plasma plume is studied by time- and space-resolved imaging. The results show that the ambient gas does not appreciably affect plume dynamics as long as the gas pressure remains below 20 Torr and the time delay below 200 ns. However, for pressures higher than 20 Torr, the effect of the ambient gas becomes important and the shorter plasma plume length corresponds to the highest gas mass species and the lowest thermal conductivity. These results are confirmed by Time-Of-Flight (TOF) measurements of Al+ line emitted at 281.6 nm. Moreover, the velocity of aluminum ions is well defined at the earliest time and close to the target surface. However, at later times, the ions travel through the plume and become thermalized through collisions with plasma species and with surrounding ambient gas.

907	Parodies satiriques et documentaires expressionnistes : la représentation critique de la célébrité dans l'œuvre cinématographique de William Klein	Satirical parodies and expressionist documentaries: The Critical Representation of the Celebrity in the Films of William Klein.    The films of William Klein are still little known. His filmography includes thirty titles which appear at first sight heterogeneous, while their sociological, political, economic, and cultural inconsistencies seem questionable. As such, and because the themes of his films, their targets, their production modes and their genres are constantly moving, Klein’s critical position seem ambiguous, inconsistent if not contradictory. Yet, we believe that the political commitment of William Klein is at the core of all of his films and dissipates all discrepancies.  Between 1965 and 1970, while liberalism as the official ideology of the capitalist system is fighting against communism to expand its power around the world, Klein is looking at celebrities as vectors of the political, the economical and the religious powers. While the Cold War, the Vietnam War and the anti-colonial armed struggles are shaking the world, he associates with the counter-culture and youth culture movements and questions the role models advertised in the mass media, and the ideologies they represent.  Portraying the modes of representation that shapes the American Dream and the American Way of Life, William Klein criticises the makes-believes found in the entertainment industry and the political field that aim at shaping our identities, our commercial behaviours and our political opinions. We propose to analyse two fiction films and two documentaries in the course of our argumentation in order to demonstrate how he condemns racism, social inequalities and abuses of power associated with Western imperialism. Qui êtes-vous, Polly Maggoo? (1966) and Mister Freedom (1968) are what we have called after Daniel Sangsue, satirical parodies. Accordingly, Polly Maggoo parodies fairy tales to satirize the fashion industry, while Mister Freedom parodies the superheroes of the comic books to satirize American foreign policies. Based on Jonathan Rosenbaum thesis, we consider Muhammad Ali, The Greatest (1964-1974) and Eldridge Cleaver Black Panther (1970) as expressionist documentaries. The reflexive strategies found in these films are symptomatic of an inter-subjectivity between the filmmaker and his subjects.

908	Supramolecular polymers azo-containing : photo-responsive block copolymer elastomers and homopolymers	Much effort in the area of polymer materials involves the development of new functional materials for specific, often highly sophisticated, applications using simplified methods of synthesis and preparation. This thesis focuses on photo-responsive polymers – i.e. functional materials that respond in various ways to light – that are prepared with the aid of supramolecular chemistry – i.e. a preparation method that relies on the spontaneous selfassembly of simpler molecular building blocks via noncovalent interactions to form the final targeted material. Two types of photo-responsive materials were targeted, namely block copolymer thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs) and photo-responsive homopolymer complexes. TPEs are well-known, even commercial, materials that are typically based on triblock copolymers with a highly flexible middle block and rigid outer blocks that phase separate into isolated domains of the hard, outer block phase within a matrix of the soft block phase, and they have the advantage of being recyclable. For the first time, to our knowledge, we have prepared such materials with photo-responsive properties based on supramolecular complexation between a simpler parent triblock copolymer and a small molecule possessing the photo-responsive functionality via an azobenzene group. Specifically, this involved the ionic complexation of the quaternized form of a block copolymer, poly(dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate)-poly(n-butyl acrylate)-poly(dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate) (PDM-PnBAPDM), synthesized by atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), with methyl orange (MO), a commercially available SO3 --functionalized azo-containing compound. PnBA has a subambient glass transition (-46 °C) and the MO-complexed PDM outer blocks have a high glass transition (140-180 °C, depending on the molecular weight). Simple elasticity tests show that the complexed block copolymers with hard block weight fractions between about 20 and 30% have elastomeric character. AFM and TEM (atomic force and transmission electron microscopies) of spin-coated films show a correlation between the elastomeric character and morphologies where the hard block forms a dispersed minority phase (spherical and/or short cylindrical domains). A continuous hard phase (inverted morphology) is observed for a hard block content of around 37 wt %, which is much lower than found for neutral block iv copolymers due to ionic interactions. Reversible photoisomerization was demonstrated for these materials in both solution and in film form. The synthesis of the PDM-PnBA-PDM block copolymer was then optimized by using the halogen exchange technique in ATRP, along with other modifications to the polymerization recipe. Monodisperse products were obtained for both the macroiniaitor and the block copolymer. Based on a single parent block copolymer, a series of partially/fully quaternized and complexed block copolymers were prepared. Preliminary stretching tests on the MO-complexed block copolymers showed that their elasticity is correlated with the hard block content, which can be tuned by the degree of quaternization and complexation. Finally, a series of homopolymer complexes self-assembled from PDM and azobenzene derivatives bearing three different groups capable of directed interactions with the amino moiety of PDM (OH, COOH and SO3 -) were prepared, where the azo derivative associates with PDM via hydrogen-bonding interactions, by ionic bonding mixed with hydrogen bonding through proton-transfer (acid-base) interactions, and by purely ionic interactions via ion exchange procedures, respectively. The influence of the azo content and bonding type on surface relief grating (SRG) inscription was investigated. The SRG diffraction efficiencies and grating depths in spin-coated films show that ionic bonding and high azo content leads to more efficient SRG formation.

909	Une méthode dangereuse : comprendre le processus créateur en musique de film, le cas de Norman McLaren et Maurice Blackburn, David Cronenberg et Howard Shore	Norman McLaren’s (1914-1987) animation work evokes a primarily dream-like world. David Cronenberg (1943-), also sometimes known as the “Baron of Blood,” makes fiction films that belong to a singular genre he developed: the “inner horror.” So what can these two filmmakers possibly have in common? They both built a long-term relationship with composers: Maurice Blackburn (1914-1988) for the former and Howard Shore (1946-) for the latter. Though the distinct approaches of these two directors have been widely studied, the weight of the contributions of their respective composers remains largely unmeasured. And this, despite the fact that music seems to play a primary role in these two directors’ process since, in each instance, the composer is involved very early on. This unusually early involvement of the composer, and the ongoing collaboration it entails, are indicative of the central place and role held by Blackburn and Shore’s music in McLaren’s work on the one hand, and Cronenberg’s on the other. This considered, their scores must no longer be seen as direct sound illustration of the films, but rather as essential components of the films, even though such a stance forces us to rethink how we define the role of music in film. Furthermore, from film to film, music and cinema become so intertwined that a singular style of musicalization of the image develops, begging the question: what are the characteristics of this style? From one collaboration to the other, this thesis seeks to establish a poietic of film-music creation; it looks to describe the cinematic and musical creative processes that determine the composition of film music and, beyond that, the musicality of the entire audio-visual complex. Through portraits that investigate the practice and discourse of creators and through the analysis of four soundtracks (A Phantasy by Norman McLaren, Day After Day by Clément Perron, Crash and A Dangerous Method by David Cronenberg), the thoughts and practices of the two composers, who develop similar innovative strategies to solve the problems posed by the works of McLaren (the inseparability of music and image) and Cronenberg (the “transformation of human aesthetics”), are gradually connected. From one duo to another, cinema becomes a musical and cinematic laboratory where each develops a “dangerous method” which forces the analyst to explore new methodological avenues.

910	L'influence des marqueurs identitaires du juge dans les décisions relatives à la garde des enfants dans un contexte post-rupture	The “best interest of the child” is a fundamental concept of family law as it is the decisive criterion in each decision concerning a child. The Civil Code of Québec enumerates, in art. 33 para. 2, the criteria that must be taken into consideration, which are “the moral, intellectual, emotional and physical needs of the child, [his] age, health, personality and family environment, and [the] other aspects of his situation”. Scholars have approached this concept from different angles. While some of them have expressed interest in its origin and evolution, others have articulated their own definition. In this thesis, I chose to explore the concept of the “best interest of the child” by examining the manner in which courts have interpreted this principle in cases related to child custody, and to what extent it is affected by the gender and the age of the decision-maker. Indeed, whenever a child is part of a conflict, regardless of whether it concerns custody or any other matter, his best interest constitutes the central element. Yet the concept of the child's best interest is highly indeterminate: its interpretation is left to the discretion of the judge, who will specify its content according to the law and facts of each case. But once the judge has considered the factual and normative contexts, he can sometimes face a « neutral » situation, for which he could consider sole and shared custody as options. Would it therefore be accurate to assume that the judge’s inclination toward one or the other option of custody is governed by elements other than the law and facts of the case? This is the main question of this study. Based on recognized and well established theories asserting the importance of considering the social context and individual experience of the decision maker in the interpretative process, the proposed hypothesis is that beyond the facts and the law, there are other elements that have a crucial influence on the process of interpretation (and on the content of the decision that a judge renders), most notably the identity profile of the judge (i.e., gender and age, including their underlying values and ideologies). Indeed, and although the values, ideologies, and dominant social characteristics are not sufficient in themselves to explain the judicial outcomes, I nevertheless consider that the impact that the former has on the latter cannot be denied. By examining the cognitive process that governs the reasoning of the decision maker, this thesis aims to identify, through interdisciplinary analysis, human factors and social forces that shape individual experiences and are likely to have an impact on judicial decisions. The objective of this research is not to establish a causal link between the profile of the judge and his/her decisions, but rather to determine whether a correlation can be established between these parameters. Wishing to go beyond traditional perceptions conveyed by the traditional doctrine, this thesis is a contribution to the development of a non-formalist conception of law, as a way of demonstrating the idea that the profile of the judge systematically and consistently frames his decisions.  A study of this kind certainly faces difficulties, in that it confronts the lawyer with concepts and theories that belong to other disciplines, and which therefore may not be familiar. However, the deep understanding of the interpretive process and resulting decisions justify the importance of this kind of research.

911	Design de nouvelles fonctionnelles en théorie de la fonctionnelle de la densité et conception de polymères pour application à la photovoltaïque organique	This thesis is about calculations using density functional theory (DFT) in order to simulate systems in which long range peoperties are important. Particular emphasis is put on excitation energies, especially in the context of applications in photovoltaics. These effects are adressed in two different ways. In the first place, well-established DFT tools are used to simulate systems of experimental interest. Secondly, DFT’s underlying theory will be explored, its limits will be identified and new theoretical developments will be suggested in reponse to them. For the first part of this thesis, numerical calculations using DFT and time- dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) as implemented in the Gaussian software system [1] are done with known functionals on molecules and polymers of experimental interest. In particular, the project presented in chapter 2 explores the use of lateral chains in order to optimize electronic properties of polymers which are already widely used in organic photovoltaics. The results obtained show that a judicious choice of lateral chains can allow good control of the electronic properties of these polymers and can make photovoltaic cells using these polymers more efficient. The project presented in chapter 3 uses TDDFT in order to explore the optical properties of two polymers, poly-3-hexyl-thiophene (P3HT) and poly- 3-hexyl-selenophene (P3HS) as well as a blend of these two polymers, in order to support experimental observations indicating an exciplex formation in the blend. The numerical calculations in the first part of this thesis allow us to make a few very interesting conclusions, however they also emphasize certain limitations of DFT and TDDFT when treating excited states, due to the approximate treatment of long-range Coulombic interactions. So, the second part of this thesis comes back to the theoretical foundations of DFT. To be more precise, in chapter 4, a series of functionals better modelizing long-range Coulombic interactions based on a non-local approach is elaborated. The functionals expand upon the weighted density approximation (WDA) and impose several exact conditions which should be satisfied by the exchange hole. These functionals are implemented in the Gaussian [1] software system and their performances are evaluated with tests on a series of atoms and molecules. The results obtained show that many of these functionals improve upon the WDA and they also provide some insight on the relative importance of satisfying each of the exact conditions.

912	When glaciers vanish : nature, power and moral order in the indian Himalayas	The dissertation presents an ethnographic study that examines knowledge as a situated practice in Ladakh, in the Indian Himalayas. It analyzes the sociocultural implications of two drivers of change at play in Ladakh: one is of socioeconomic origin and linked to the production of Ladakh as a border area, while the other is environmental and driven by climate change. Ladakh, which remained outside the scope of the bureaucratic state during the British colonial administration, found itself refashioned into a strategic border area following India’s independence and successive wars with Pakistan and China. Independence led to the partition of Indian into India and Pakistan in 1947; the dissertation examines the long-term, traumatic events of the partition in Ladakh, tracing connections to current perceptions of climate change. The independent Indian state has produced itself in the region through the taming of its mountains, primarily through infrastructure development and the co-optation of Ladakhi knowledge of the environment by the military apparatus. Far-reaching militarization has restructured Ladakh’s economy, consequently redefining household structure, contributing to village depopulation, displacing the centrality of agro-pastoralist activities and, as the dissertation argues, significantly altering the local population’s engagement with the environment. The increasing rationalization of the outlook on the environment today contributes to the fragmentation of links between the natural and human realms within the local cosmology and the abandonment of related ritual practices. Concurrently, the region is impacted by distinct effects of climate change, in particular glacier recession. The dissertation juxtaposes both the subjective experience of wide-ranging environmental changes and changes in everyday village life with historical facts, showing that local historical events influence perceptions of glacier recession and the depletion of natural resources. The analysis demonstrates that objective phenomena such as glacier recession are interpreted through local realities. Specifically, in the local worldview, a vanishing glacier is a trope for changes in the human condition. Yet, as the dissertation further argues, such cultural framing does not preclude the objectivity of natural history in local cosmology. Moreover, cultural framing and empirical experience, therefore, are shown to be essential to the vitality of local knowledge about the environment and to the performance of associated landscape practices.

913	Aux frontières mouvantes des mouvements sociaux, ou quand les partis politiques s’en mêlent : le cas du souverainisme au Québec	The usual definition of social movement refers to activists and organizations, more or less structured in networks, which developed concerted actions in favour of a claim, more or less defined. Whatever the theoretical background considered, social movement organisations are presented as distinct from political parties. Political parties are playing in the electoral arena and are the main actors of institutional politics. In that respect, political parties and social movements are known to interact, but they are supposed to play in two distinct fields : institutional political representation for political parties and social protests for social movements. Yet, the border between institutional and extra-institutional politics is very permeable. In this article, we argue that, in certain social movement configurations, political parties could be an integral part of the social movements from which they emerge, and could even constitute central actors. Our analysis is based on the sovereignist movement in Québec and the study of its transformation through the last 40 years. We show how the Parti québécois and the Bloc québécois are at the centre of the sovereignist movement and still contribute to the definition of a movement that goes beyond their own organisations.

914	The Forgotten Side of Partisanship: Negative Party Identification in Four Anglo-American Democracies	Early studies of electoral behavior proposed that party identification could be negative as well as positive. Over time, though, the concept became mostly understood as a positive construct. The few studies that took negative identification into account tended to portray it as a marginal factor that went “hand-in-hand” with positive preferences. Recent scholarship in psychology reaffirms, however, that negative evaluations are not simply the bipolar opposite of positive ones. This article considers negative party identification from this standpoint, and evaluates its impact in recent national elections in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States. Our findings highlight the autonomous power of negative partisanship. They indicate as well that ideology has an influence on both positive and negative partisan identification.

915	Facteurs associés à l’alliance thérapeutique chez les patients ayant des troubles psychotiques	This internship report examines the factors associated in therapeutic alliance with patients with psychotic disorders. A literature review based on the factors related to therapeutic alliance and psychotic disorders was performed. Thereafter, a description of the training environment, le Centre d’Hébergement l’Entre-Toit, was performed. A presentation of the methodology used to carry out the five case studies precedes the presentation of the data and the analysis along with the interpretation of those aforementioned data. In the analysis, collected data points out that some dimensions seem to play a role of moderate importance in the creation and maintenance of a therapeutic alliance. On the other hand, some dimensions studied did not provide conclusive results. In addition, it turns out that factors associated with therapeutic alliance do not seem to have the same impact for all persons with psychotic disorders. Based on the results, recommendations are formulated to guide professionals working with clients who have psychotic disorders. These recommendations emphasize important elements in order to achieve the maximum efficiency level of therapeutic alliance between the client and the counsellor. The aim of a better therapeutic alliance is part of an effort to increase treatment adherence and reduce risk of relapse and the risk to commit a violent act .	comportements violents , therapeutic alliance , psychotic disorders , compliance , violent behavior , forensic psychiatry , working alliance	en	12228.0
916	Social Media Use in Medical and Health Professional Education: Role of the Librarian on a Faculty Steering Committee	Objective:  An interprofessional steering committee was created at Université de Montréal’s Faculty of Medicine to examine how social media are integrated in medical and health professional education in universities across the globe, and to propose a strategic plan for integrating social media in the Faculty’s various curricula. This presentation will summarize the steering committee’s work and describe the librarian’s contribution.  Methods:  The Committee’s project leader first conducted a literature search on best practices of social media in medical and health professional curricula. A reference website was then created (mse.med.umontreal.ca) to provide easy access to a large number of the articles and resources reviewed. A steering committee was constituted and 11 meetings were held over a 9-month period. The Committee comprised 18 members and included assistant deans, academic program directors, professors, communication advisors, undergraduate and graduate students and a librarian. An online survey on social media use by students and professors of the Faculty was conducted, ten pilot projects were put forward and a three-year strategic plan was proposed.  Results:  A total of 1508 students and 565 professors participated in the survey. Results showed that both groups had a strong interest in learning how social media could be integrated in academic and professional activities. Participants reported concern with risks associated with social media use and expressed the need for a Faculty policy and guidelines. The librarian’s contribution to the steering committee included: writing posts on the website’s internal blog, assisting in the design of the survey questionnaires and writing the final report’s survey results chapter. She also proposed two pilot projects: creating a social media learning portal and an altmetrics workshop.  Conclusions:  Based on the literature review and the survey results, the Committee affirmed the importance of integrating social media in the various study programs of the Faculty of Medicine. Despite the restricted timeline, this interprofessional steering committee was able to carry out its mandate because of the leadership and expertise of each of its members. As the librarian had the most experience with the use of social media in a professional context, her knowledge was instrumental in assisting the project leader in a group mainly composed of social media non-users.

919	Transcriptional approach to study porcine tracheal epithelial cells individually or dually infected with swine influenza virus and Streptococcus suis	Background: Swine influenza is a highly contagious viral infection in pigs affecting the respiratory tract that can have significant economic impacts. Streptococcus suis serotype 2 is one of the most important post-weaning bacterial pathogens in swine causing different infections, including pneumonia. Both pathogens are important contributors to the porcine respiratory disease complex. Outbreaks of swine influenza virus with a significant level of co-infections due to S. suis have lately been reported. In order to analyze, for the first time, the transcriptional host response of swine tracheal epithelial (NPTr) cells to H1N1 swine influenza virus (swH1N1) infection, S. suis serotype 2 infection and a dual infection, we carried out a comprehensive gene expression profiling using a microarray approach. Results: Gene clustering showed that the swH1N1 and swH1N1/S. suis infections modified the expression of genes in a similar manner. Additionally, infection of NPTr cells by S. suis alone resulted in fewer differentially expressed genes compared to mock-infected cells. However, some important genes coding for inflammatory mediators such as chemokines, interleukins, cell adhesion molecules, and eicosanoids were significantly upregulated in the presence of both pathogens compared to infection with each pathogen individually. This synergy may be the consequence, at least in part, of an increased bacterial adhesion/invasion of epithelial cells previously infected by swH1N1, as recently reported. Conclusion: Influenza virus would replicate in the respiratory epithelium and induce an inflammatory infiltrate comprised of mononuclear cells and neutrophils. In a co-infection situation, although these cells would be unable to phagocyte and kill S. suis, they are highly activated by this pathogen. S. suis is not considered a primary pulmonary pathogen, but an exacerbated production of proinflammatory mediators during a co-infection with influenza virus may be important in the pathogenesis and clinical outcome of S. suis-induced respiratory diseases.

921	"Mental health treatment seeking by military members with posttraumatic stress disorder :
findings on rates, characteristics, and predictors from a nationally representative Canadian military sample"	Objective: The goal of this study was to identify rates, characteristies, and predictors of mental health treatment seeking by military members with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Method: Our sample was drawn from the 2002 Canadian Community Health Survey-Canadian Forces Supplement (CCHS-CF) dataset. The CCHS-CF is the first epidemiologic survey of PTSD and other mental health conditions in the Canadian military and includes 8441 nationally representative Canadian Forces (CF) members. Of those, 549 who met the criteria for lifetime PTSD were included in our analyses. To identify treatment rates and characteristics, we examined frequency of treatment contact by professional and facility type. To identify predictors of treatment seeking, we conducted a binary logistic regression with lifetime treatment seeking as the outcome variable. Results: About two-thirds of those with PTSD consulted with a professional regarding mental health problems. The most frequently consulted professionals, during both the last year and lifetime, included social workers and counsellors, medical doctors and general practitioners, and psychiatrists. Consultations during the last year most often took place in a CF facility. Treatment seeking was predicted by cumulative lifetime trauma exposure, index traumatic event type, PTSD symptom interference, and comorbid major depressive disorder. Those with comorbid depression were 3.75 times more likely to have sought treatment than those without. Conclusions: Although a significant portion of military members with PTSD sought mental health treatment, 1 in 3 never did. Trauma-related and illness and (or) need factors predicted treatment seeking. Of all the predictors of treatment seeking, comorbid depression most increased the likelihood of seeking treatment.

922	The interest rates and performance of MFIs in the MENA region: is there a moral issue?	The high interest rates of microfinance institutions (MFIs) seem to oppose their social mission, and raise a moral issue. We analyse the determinants of the level of interest rates with regard to the financial performance of an unbalanced panel of 66 MFIs in nine countries of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region over the period 2004-2012. We differentiate internal factors (cost of capital, operating expenses and loss provisions) from the external ones (regulation, competition and inflation).The outcomes of a typology from a multivariate analysis upon the relationship between the interest rate and social performance of 53 MFIs in 2008 do not match the classification of MFIs according to Yunus and Weber, which proves irrelevant.	philosophy , ethics , economics , costs , interest rates , MENA , microfinance institutions , multivariate analysis , performance. , philosophy , ethics , economics , coûts , MENA , performance	en	12140.0
923	Éthique et évasion fiscale au Bénin	Tax are generally complex and sometimes unfair. In response to these distortions induced by taxes, taxpayers develop behaviors to reduce their tax. This leads into tax avoidance and even tax evasion. These avoidance strategies amplify the distortion effects of taxation. The objective of the paper is to show that ethics, a set of rules of conduct, could help reducing tax evasion permanently. If tax evasion is not limited, it threatens any collective action of contribution to tax revenue, knowing that the participants do not wish to pay for other.	philosophy , ethics , economics , ethics , optimal tax , tax evasion , Benin , philosophy , ethics , economics , Evasion fiscale , Bénin	en	12139.0
925	Comparaison des réponses physiologiques lors d’un exercice incrémental maximal sur vélo immergé et sur terrain sec : aspects biomécaniques, cardiopulmonaires et hémodynamiques	Water immersion can affect hemodynamic and cardiorespiratory responses during exercise relative to exercise on dry land. However, according to our knowledge, VO2 and hemodynamic responses have never been compared during exercise on immersible ergocycle (IE) and dryland ergocycle (DE) at the same level of external power output (Pext). In this regard, the first study of this thesis has proposed a method to calculate accurately the Pext deployed by participants using a model of IE during chest level immersion exercise, since the Pext from pedalling rate (rpm) in water was still undetermined to date. The Pext expressed in W was calculated by multiplying the total force overcoming the resistance of the water on the system movement (pedaling system and legs) by the velocity (m/s) of the pedal. We favored this approach since it takes into consideration the resistance of water on the lower limbs and not only the pedaling system. The quantification of Pext allowed us subsequently to compare the physiological response of the immersion during exercise on an IE when compared to the same Pext on a DE. The results shown that VO2 (p< 0.0001) and C(a-v)O2 (p<0.0001) were significantly lower during exercise on IE relative to DE. Among hemodynamic variables, stroke volume (p<0.05) and cardiac output (p<0.05) were higher and heart rate (p<0.05) lower during exercise on IE. Because physiological responses were different for the same Pext on IE and DE, we have studied the relationship between various expressions of relative exercise intensity (% VO2max, %HRmax, % VO2 reserve (% VO2R) and %HR reserve (%HRR)) in order to obtain the more appropriate method for exercise intensity prescription when using an immersible ergocycle (IE). The results shown that %HRR vs % VO2R relationship appears to be the most accurate for exercise training prescription on immersible ergocycle (IE). Thus, absolute cardiopulmonary responses (VO2 and HR) during exercise on IE were different to that of DE but relative intensity was found similar at a similar Pext on both immersible and dryland ergocycle. This study offers a new tool to better prescribe, control and individualize exercise intensity on IE in young healthy subjects. Finally, a last study comparing parasympathetic reactivation after maximal incremental exercise performed on IE (immersion at the chest) and DE, showed that short-term parasympathetic reactivation was more predominant on IE (i.e. delta 10 delta 60 and T30, p<0.05). This suggests that, after maximal exercise on IE, parasympathetic reactivation was accelerated relative to recovery after maximal effort on DE in healthy participants. In conclusion, we proposed a method to calculate the Pext on different models of IE from rpm and an equation for the calculation of VO2 during exercise on IE. We demonstrated that during exercise on IE the hemodynamic and cardiorespiratory responses are different from those on DE at the same Pext and a method for exercise prescription and control on IE. Finally, we demonstrated that short-term parasympathetic reactivation was accelerated during post-maximal exercise recovery on IE as compared to that on DE.

926	Concordance entre les interventions de l’infirmière et de médecins spécialistes dans la prise en charge des fractures de fragilisation	Introduction. Osteoporosis is a chronic condition which is usually asymptomatic until a fragility fracture (FF) occurs. These fractures lead to increased morbidity and mortality in patients. Moreover, a major care gap exists in the investigation for bone fragility and initiation of treatment for individuals who sustain a FF. The implementation of a subsequent fracture prevention program managed by nurses could be the key in resolving these problems.   Objectives. The main objective of this project was to determine if a nurse can manage safely and efficiently a fracture liaison service (FLS).   Methods. Clinical decisions of nurses for 525 subjects in a studied FLS between 2010 and 2012 were assessed by two independent physicians with expertise in osteoporosis treatment.  Results. The nurses succeeded in identifying all patients at risk and referred 26.7% of patients to a specialist.  Thereby, they managed 73.3% of subjects with FF. No needless referrals were made according to both physicians. Agreement between each evaluator and the nurses was of >97%. Physicians’ decisions were the same in >96% for each type of decision and AC1 coefficient was of >0.960 (almost perfect level of agreement). All major comorbidities were adequately managed.    Conclusion. High agreement between nurses and physicians’ clinical decisions indicate that the management by a nurse of a FLS is safe and recommended for patients with FF. This kind of intervention could help resolve the existing care gap in osteoporosis care as well as the societal economic burden associated with treatment of FF.	osteoporosis , fragility fracture , nurse , clinical nurse specialist , case manager , management , fracture liaison service , subsequent fracture , prevention	en	12126.0
927	Nanotoxicité des points quantiques : étude in vitro chez les cellules épithéliales alvéolaires humaines A549	Nanoparticles (NPs) are defined as particles with a diameter ranging from 1 to 100 nm. Several studies have suggested or demonstrated that NPs are a health risk factor for workers handling nanomaterials or for the general population using products containing NPs. Nanotoxicology is a new field of research. The particular physicochemical properties of NPs have revealed unexpected interferences of these nanomaterials with components of cytotoxic assays leading to false positive or negative interpretations. Inhalation being one of the most potential risk of NPs exposures, in this project, in vitro experiments were performed with the human alveolar epithelial cell line A549. Quantum dots (QDs) have been selected over other NPs because of their potential applications in medicine as nanovectors or nanoprobes. We have first validated the use of nanocytotoxic assays (LDH and MTS with QDs), and found that LDH assay interacts with components of the cell culture medium. A protocol established to counteract this interference has allowed demonstrating that both short and long term exposures to QDs are cytotoxic. We next addressed the underlying mechanisms of QDs nanotoxicity by determining concentrations of free cadmium potentially released from QDs when interacting with cells. We found that the cadmium assay has several interferences which invalidated the use of this assay. In conclusion, our study has allowed to identify several interferences with that call into question conclusions of published studies which have not examined these potential interferences.

928	Implication des utilisateurs dans le développement des innovations médicales : une analyse sociotechnique de la collaboration et de ses enjeux pour l’organisation des soins	Technological changes have major effects on health care organization. Health professionals and patients – the main users of medical innovations – are key actors in the ongoing development and refinement of new medical technologies. To develop more efficient, safe and user-friendly medical technologies, many propose enhancing collaboration between technology users and developers. This research investigates the premise of involving users in the medical innovation process. The main objective of this research is to better understand the collaboration between users and developers involved in the transformation of medical innovations. Adopting a sociotechnical approach, this thesis by article has three objectives: 1) Describe how the literature defines the objectives, methods and issues of engaging users in the development of medical innovations; 2) Analyze the perspectives of users and developers of medical technologies with regards to their collaboration in the innovation process; and 3) Analyze how users are mobilized in practice in the development of medical innovation. The first objective is addressed by a narrative synthesis of the scientific literature (n=101) on user involvement in the medical innovation process. This synthesis has identified the methods used or proposed, normative arguments conveyed, and the main issues raised by involving users. Analysis of data from three deliberative focus groups and a plenary involving users and developers (n=19) of medical technology were employed to address the second objective. The analysis details their perspectives on various modes of collaboration in the innovation process. The third objective involves a case study of an innovation in electrophysiology at the clinical research phase. This case study is based on a qualitative analysis of clinical studies (n=57), editorials and reviews in medical journals (n=15) covering a ten year period (1999-2008) and semi-structured interviews with key actors involved in the innovation process (n=3). This study provides insight into how users make sense of, appropriate and legitimize medical innovation in the context of clinical research. The overall contribution of this thesis is a better understanding of user involvement in the medical innovation process and how to more effectively align technological development with the objectives of the health system.	medical technology , user involvement , innovation process , sociotechnical analysis , healthcare organization	en	12102.0
929	Understanding the transcriptional control of EIF4E and its dysregulation in acute myeloid leukemia: role of NF-κB	The eukaryotic translation initiation factor EIF4E is a powerful oncogene that is overexpressed in cancers, including the M4 and M5 subtypes of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). EIF4E is regulated at multiple levels; however not much is known about the transcriptional regulation of this gene. My findings show that the nuclear factor kappa-light- chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) is a direct transcriptional regulator of EIF4E. EIF4E levels are induced in primary hematopoietic cells and in cell lines in response to NF-κB activating stimuli. Pharmacological and genetic inhibition of NF-κB suppresses EIF4E levels. NF-κB factors RelA (p65) and c-Rel are recruited to evolutionarily conserved κB sites in the EIF4E promoter in vitro and in vivo following NF-κB activation concurrent with the recruitment of p300 and phosphorylated Pol II. Furthermore, p65 is selectively associated with the EIF4E promoter in M4/M5 AML subtypes but not in other AML subtypes or normal primary hematopoietic cells and thus represents an underlying factor in determining the differential expression of EIF4E in AML. Analysis of gene expression RNA-Seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) suggests that EIF4E and RELA mRNA levels are upregulated in intermediate and poor prognosis AML but not in the cytogenetically favorable group. Additionally, elevated EIF4E and RELA mRNA levels are significantly associated with worst patient survival outcome. Furthermore, 8 new putative NF-κB target genes that may be regulated with a pattern similar to EIF4E in poor prognosis AML were in silico predicted from Chip-Seq data. Finally, 6 new transcription factors that may be implicated in EIF4E gene regulation were predicted from the analysis of ChIP-Seq data from the encyclopedia of DNA elements (ENCODE). Collectively, these findings could offer novel insights into the transcriptional regulation of EIF4E and a novel molecular basis for its dysregulation in AML. Understanding this level of regulation within the context of patient specimens is important for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to target EIF4E gene expression with specific NF-κB inhibitors combined with ribavirin.

930	Regards croisés sur la relation école-famille et la réussite scolaire d’élèves à l’école fondamentale en Haïti	This research analyses the following problematic: school-family collaboration and school success in Haiti. By contrasting cases of diverse social and academic profiles, it examines the points of view of various actors involved in education, as much at the formal as at the informal level: 14 students, 7 teachers, 7 members involved in school leadership, 2 pedagogical counselors, and 6 others involved in schools (priests, psychologists, sociologist, doctor). A multiple-case ethno-biographical approach based on depth interviews allowed for the cross-referencing of these actors concerning the academic course of 14 students found in 8 different schools from both the private and public sectors, and with as many cases of success and of failure among the 14 students. In line with the problematic given at the beginning of this thesis, the participants in our research all confirmed the vulnerability of the Haitian social context and its repercussions on the school system: sociopolitical instability and insecurity, and socio-economic precariousness.  This situation has transformed familiar structures.  The school system, mostly private, is limited in its capacity to absorb students, in its human resources, in its material infrastructures, and in its programs for initial and ongoing training of its personnel. As such, it is a school system that can only support with difficulty the learning of its students. Besides that, the double-language situation (creole-french) found in society and in schools slows somewhat the progress of students.  Over and above what actors evoke as social elements that are at stake here, daily life in school appears, according to their conversations, as a place of resilience for the students, a place that inspires change and one that is key to all future social mobility.  Nevertheless, education is part of a societal project wherein school success should mobilize the collaboration of all actors. There follows a need for a greater mobilization of the young themselves regarding the task of a student, and of shared understanding of parenting among protagonists. Results also show the importance of social synergy around school, one based on the cooperation of all to the benefit of student learning.  In Haiti, school-family collaboration is more complex that in other national contexts.  Here, to begin with, families are the most important financial source of education in the country because of the hegemony of private schools and of the insufficient State support for the functioning of schools. Also, parents of students and their children, even those experiencing academic difficulty, place great trust in the school and have great hope of improving their lot thanks to success in school. However, objective constraints of all kinds prevent the majority of parents from following students academincally at the level of the needs of the students and of the expectations of the school.  Congruent with research in other national contexts, school-family collaboration is shown to be more complicated in the case of parents distant from the school culture, and the most problematic school histories of students are those where parental support and concern seem to be the weakest. In the Haitian context, one fact remains as a major preoccupation: the incapacity of schools to compensate for the precariousness of the lives of students and parents by an efficient mobilization of their capital (commitment of personnel to the success of students; availability of material, pedagogical, and didactic infrastructures, ongoing training of teachers, etc.). We note, too, the differing levels of expectations reciprocally formulated.	School-family relationship , At stake in schools , Students experiencing success , Students experiencing failure	en	12087.0
931	Études génétiques moléculaires des gènes de la polarité planaire cellulaire dans les anomalies du tube neural chez l’Homme	Neural tube defects (NTDs) are among the most common congenital malformations in humans affecting 1–2 infants per 1000 births. NTDs are caused by failure of the neural tube to close during embryogenesis. The most common forms of NTDs in humans are anencephaly and spina bifida. Their etiology is complex implicating environmental and genetic factors. Wnt signaling has been classified as canonical Wnt/ β-catenin dependent or non-canonical planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway. Misregulation of either pathway is linked mainly to cancer or neural tube defects (NTDs) respectively. Both pathwaysseem to antagonize each other. In this study, we investigate the role of Lrp6andANKRD6 as molecular switches between both Wnt pathways as well as CELSR1 as PCP member, in a novel ENU mouse mutant of Lrp6 (Skax26m1Jus) and in human NTDs. For Lrp6, we demonstrate that Skax26m1Jus represents a hypermorphic allele of Lrp6 with increased Wnt canonical and abolished PCP-induced JNK activities. We also show that Lrp6Skax26m1Jusgenetically interacts with a PCP mutant (Vangl2Lp) where double heterozygotes showed an increased frequency of NTDs and defects in cochlear hair cells’ polarity. Importantly, our study also demonstrates the association of rare and novel missense mutations in LRP6 that is an inhibitor rather than an activator of the PCP pathway with human NTDs. We show that three LRP6 mutations in NTDs led to a reduced Wnt canonical activity and enhanced PCP signaling. For ANKRD6: We identified four rare missense mutations in 0.8% of the NTD patients and 2 rare missense mutations in 1.3% of the controls. Notably, when all 6 mutations were validated, only two mutations identified in NTD patients, p.Pro548Leu, p.Arg632His, significantly altered DIVERSIN activity in Wnt signaling assays in a hypomorphic fashion. For CELSR1: We identified one nonsense mutation in exon 1 of CELSR1 that truncates the majority of the protein in one NTD patient and one in-frame 12 bp deletion that removes a putative PKC phosphorylation“SSR” motif in one caudal agenesis patient. We also detected a total of 13 novel missense variants in 12 patients (11 NTDs and 1 caudal agenesis) that were predicted to be pathogenic in silico. Our data confirm an inhibitory role of Lrp6 in PCP signaling in neurulation and indicate that rare missense mutations in LRP6 and ANKRD6 could affect a balanced reciprocal and a highly dosage sensitive antagonism between both Wnt pathways in neurulation and act as predisposing factors to NTDs in a subset of patients. Also, our findings implicate CELSR1 as a risk factor for NTDs or caudal agenesis. Our findings provide additional evidence for a pathogenic role of PCP signaling in thesemalformations and an important tool for better understanding their molecular mechanisms.

932	Études de cas multiples sur l’exercice d’un leadership transformatif par les directions dans trois écoles primaires en milieu défavorisé montréalais	The aim of the present study is to describe how elementary school principals implement transformative leadership in three Montreal elementary schools in disadvantaged areas. Principals were selected by the Une école montréalaise pour tous program, due to their high interest in social justice. We first describe participants’ knowledge about social justice. We then examine their actions to promote transformative leadership, while paying special attention to the context in which these actions were taken. Finally we compare all three principals on their use of transformative leadership. Data was collected in four formats (i.e., direct observation, interviews, questionnaire and official school internal guidelines and documents) using the multiple case method. The data was analysed using content analysis in accordance with the Archambault and Garon (2011a) model. Results showed that the different levels of reflection exhibited by the principals on transformative leadership greatly influenced their attitudes and behaviours, both stated by participants and directly observed, and their knowledge about the subject. However, few transformative leadership behaviours were directly observed during the course of the study. This leads us to discuss the importance of understanding the way in which principals learn and interpret transformative leadership. We hope this information will help schools principals to more easily implement transformative leadership.

933	Contribution du mécanisme d'inhibition présynaptique à l'induction de réactions posturales efficaces suite à une perturbation d'équilibre	Falls are a significant problem among the elderly or persons with a neurological impairment, and reflect a deficit in the nervous mechanisms underlying postural control. Previous research shows that the integration of sensory feedback is a crucial component of postural control and that presynaptic inhibition (PSI) plays an important role in controlling the sensory processing of information. The aim of this study was to identify the contribution of PSI to the induction of effective postural responses following an unexpected balance perturbation. We hypothesized that a decrease in PSI would contribute to the induction of these responses by increasing the influence of sensory feedback onto spinal networks during the perturbation. First we assessed the level of spinal excitability during perturbations, using the soleus H-reflex. Results show that spinal excitability is modulated according to the direction of the perturbation (forward and backward tilts) and that this modulation occurs 75 and 100 ms after tilt-onset in all subjects (p<0.05). To further estimate changes in PSI, spatial facilitation techniques were used. PSI was shown to decrease in both perturbation directions shortly after tilt onset at 75 and 100 ms (p<0.05), suggesting an increase in sensory transmission in the spinal cord. These observations suggest that sensory feedback is critical for the induction of effective postural responses and that impaired sensory transmission or integration, due to CNS lesions or ageing, may lead to certain balance deficits. Identifying patients with such impairments may improve fall risk-assessment and prevention.	Presynaptic inhibition , H-reflex , postural responses , risk of falls , balance	en	12053.0
934	L'astronomie nouvelle de Kepler et la logique de la découverte	This thesis offers a study of the theoretical and empirical reasons involved in the elaboration of a new astronomy by Johannes Kepler (1571-1630) as displayed in his work Astronomia nova (1619).  The thesis consists of two parts: the first part deals with Kepler’s actual writings, whereas the second part uses the notion of abduction in order to interpret with logic that process of discovery and justification. The first part begins with an analysis of Kepler’s project and its philosophical, metaphysical and theological foundations as displayed in his first work piece, Mysterium cosmographicum. Then follows a review of Kepler’s own words regarding the nature and status of astronomical hypotheses as proposed through a study of his treatise entitled Apologia pro Tychone contra Ursum. A careful study of philosophical, mathematical and scientific sources that have influenced Kepler for his new astronomy is then proposed prior to a detailed analysis of the scientific arguments and different demonstrative steps that are presented in Astronomia nova.  The second part aims at enlightening the debate on abduction first by looking at three traditional approaches (Plato, Aristote and Epicurus) relative to the scientific knowledge of celestial phenomena that bring about a plausible discourse or a series of explanations that fit with the phenomena. Finally, four modern abductive interpretations of the discovery process followed by Kepler in Astronomia nova are presented, reformulated and reviewed in order to propose a new abductive interpretation that leave a greater place to the actual project of building a new astronomy based on causes. This provides tools to better understand the meaning and significance of what can be understood as the “Keplerian revolution”, namely the transition from a geocentric system to a system not simply heliocentric but heliodynamic, which freed astronomers from the paradigm of circular orbits.

935	Essays in macro finance and monetary economics	This thesis consists of three essays in the areas of macro finance and monetary economics. The first two essays deal with the analysis of the term structure of interest rates in dynamic and stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models. The third essay explores inflation expectations formation across different economic groups in South Africa.     Interest rates are one channel through which monetary policy affects the real economy. Typically, central banks implement monetary policy by influencing short term interest rates. Theoretically, the interest rate on a long-term bond is the average of expected future short term interest rates over the maturity period, plus a risk premium demanded by the holder of the bond to compensate for the risk involved in holding a longer maturity bond. Therefore, any changes in the target rate of the central bank and the risk premium affect long -- term interest rates, such as mortgage rates and interest rates on certain durable goods. It is then important for the central bank to understand the economic factors that affect both components of long - term interest namely the market expectations about the short - term rates and the risk premium. For example, recently in the U.S. economy, between June 2004 and June 2006, the ineffectiveness of monetary policy to affect long - term interest rates has been attributed to a decline in risk premium over this period, which has offset the effect of the increase in the target rate of the Federal Reserve (Fed). In the implementation of its monetary policy, the central bank can more or less control agents' expectations through transparent communication. However, the risk premium is endogenous and unobservable and therefore can not be fully controlled by the central bank. On the other hand, achieving the goal of prices stability in an inflation targeting framework depends on the credibility of the central bank.     In the first two essays I explore the economic factors of the term structure of interest rates and risk premiums. I build a non-linear dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models whereby I incorporate a range of bonds with different maturities. Specifically, the goal of the first essay is to understand the relationship between macroeconomic factors and the level of risk premium in a New Keynesian general equilibrium framework. Uncertainty in the model comes from three sources: productivity, monetary policy and, preferences shocks. The model has two types of real rigidities namely habit formation in preferences and adjustment costs in capital stock. The model is solved by perturbation method up to second order and calibrated to the U.S. economy. Since the risk premium is by nature a compensation for risk, the second - order approximation implies that the risk premium is a linear combination of the volatility of the three shocks. Results show that at the calibrated parameters, real shocks (productivity and preferences) play a more important role in determining the level of the risk premium relative to monetary shocks. I show that, contrary to previous work (where production capital is fixed), the effect of habit formation on the risk premium depends on the degree of capital adjustment cost. When capital adjustment costs are so high that the capital stock is fixed in equilibrium, an increase in the parameter of habit formation leads to an increase in the risk premium. However, when agents can freely adjust the capital stock without cost, the effect of the habit formation parameter on the risk premium is negligible. This result is explained by the fact that when the capital stock can be adjusted without cost, it opens an additional channel to the agents for consumption smoothing. Therefore, the effect of habit formation on the risk premium is reduced. In addition, the results show that the way the central bank conducts its monetary policy has an effect on the risk premium. The more aggressive the central bank vis-à-vis inflation, the lower the risk premium and vice versa. This is due to the fact that when the central bank fights against inflation it leads to a decrease in the variance of inflation. As a result, the risk premium due to inflation risk decreases.     In the second essay, I extend the analysis of the first essay by using recursive preferences (as those proposed by Epstein - Zin) and by allowing the conditional volatility of the shocks to be time - varying. The use of this framework is motivated by two reasons. First, recent studies (Doh, 2010, Rudebusch and Swanson, 2012) showed that these preferences are appropriate for the analysis of asset prices in general equilibrium models. Second, heteroscedasticity is a prominent feature of economic and financial data. This implies that, contrary to the first essay, the uncertainty here is time - varying. Thus, the framework in this essay is more general and realistic than in the first essay. The main objective of this paper is to examine the impact of uncertainty due to conditional volatility of the shocks on the level and the dynamics of interest rates and risk premiums. Since the risk premium is constant at second order approximation, the model is solved by the perturbation method with an approximation of order three in order to get a time - varying risk premium. The advantage of introducing shocks conditional volatilities is that , it induces additional state variables that provide an additional contribution to the dynamics of the risk premium. I show that the risk premiums implied by the third -- order approximate solution have an ARCH-M (Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticty in Mean) type representation as that introduced by Engle, Lilien and Robins (1987). The difference is that in this model the parameters are structural and the volatilities are conditional volatility of economic shocks and not those of the variables themselves. I estimate the model parameters by Simulated Method of Moments (SMM) using U.S. data. The estimation results show that there is evidence of stochastic volatility in the three shocks. Moreover, the contribution of conditional shocks volatility to the level and the dynamics of the risk premium is significant. In particular, the effects of the conditional volatility of productivity and preferences shocks are important. The conditional volatility of the productivity shock contributes positively to the means and standard deviations of risk premiums. These contributions vary with the maturity of the bonds. Conditional volatility of the preferences shock contributes negatively to the averages and positively to the variances of risk premiums. As for the impact of volatility of monetary policy shock, its impact on the risk premium is negligible.     The third article (coauthored with Eric Schaling and Alain Kabundi, revised and resubmitted to the journal of Economic Modelling) deals with heterogeneity in inflation expectations of different economic agents and its impact on monetary policy in South Africa. The main question is to examine whether different groups of economic agents form their inflation expectations in the same way and if they perceive the central bank (South African Reserve Bank) monetary policy in the say way. We specify an inflation expectation model that allows us to directly test whether inflation expectations are anchored or not to the inflation target band (3% - 6%). The data used are inflation expectations data from surveys conducted by the central bank. There are three groups of agents: financial analysts, businesses and trade unions. We therefore exploits the panel structure of the data to test the heterogeneity in inflation expectations and derive their perceived inflation targets. Results show that there is evidence of heterogeneity in the way the three groups form their expectations. The expectations of financial analysts are well anchored to the central bank target band while those of businesses and trade unions are not. In fact, businesses and trade unions put a higher weight on lagged realized inflation in their expectations. This Indicates a lack of full credibility of the central bank.

936	La nanosanté : perspective et enjeux sociologiques de l'application des nanotechnologies à la médecine	Nanomedicine – the application of nanotechnology to medical practice – is seen as the medicine of the future. Thus, nanomedicine is not just a new biomedical field. It carries a new biomedical paradigm promoting a technoscientific conception of healthcare. This new paradigm grows from and brings together the three current tendencies of healthcare research: predictive medicine, personalized medicine and regenerative medicine. Its focus is on the technical control of the molecular mechanisms underlying the biological development of the body. The growing of this new biomedical paradigm is largely the result of government supports and economic potential. It is both a scientific and a politico-economic construction. In that sense, analysing nanomedicine means analysing the form and the conditions of the current biomedical progress. In other words, nanomedicine helps us to grasp and understand the issues and implications of the ‘‘technoscientifization’’ of healthcare. This thesis aims to highlight the socio-cultural nature of the technoscientific model of healthcare promoted by nanomedicine. To do so, I propose the construction of an ideal-type of this technoscientific model, which I call nanohealth. If nanomedicine refers to the different technological applications of nanotechnology to medicine, nanohealth refers to the different sociological dimensions and impacts of nanotechnological applications on health and society. The nanohealth ideal-type is constructed around three dimensions: transversality, enhancement and globalization. The synthetic nature of this tridimensional ideal-type helps us to tackle the crucial issues surrounding the development of the nanomedicine. It helps us to understand the meaning and impacts of the scientific, political and economic engagement in nanomedicine; to highlight the centrality of technoscience in the cultural conception of medical and social progress; to grasp the new forms of power upon life and identity, and the new forms of inequality and exploitation, which are characteristics of a society focusing on the technical adaptability of human being and the economization of health and body.	technoscience , nanohealth , nanomedicine , nanotechnology , technoscience , medicalization , bioeconomy , transhumanism , biocitizenship , bioinequality , biocolonialism	en	12004.0
937	Renouveau du genre fantasy pour la jeunesse dans Ellana de Pierre Bottero	Fantasy literature, heiress of many literary and cinematographic forms, has developed rapidly at the turn of the XXth and XXIst centuries. In this recent corpus, several works concur to the renewal of the conventional parameters of fantasy. Pierre Bottero takes part in this joint action through a singular feminine figure, Ellana, who belongs to the marchombre guild, and whose freedom quest refers to the author’s goal to dispel the commonplaces of fantasy genre. Indeed, after the writing of La Quête d’Ewilan (2003) and Les Mondes d’Ewilan (2005), Bottero moves away from tolkienian tradition and arthurian legend in order to create Le Pacte des marchombres, a trilogy relating the emancipation of Ellana’s figure by the way of a “poetical” writing practice.   This thesis searches for fantasy writing’s potentialities that are observable in the book Ellana (2006), first volume of Bottero’s final trilogy. Ellana comes under a particular transfictional writing practice – the prequel – that is done back to front. While the first trilogies of Bottero are based on Merlin’s myth, the author changes the focus to Ellana’s figure who plays a pivotal role in the alavirian cycle. We highlight the main features of the fantasy genre with the aim to identify the topoï that Ellana renews or infringes. At the same time, we set about studying the botterian imaginary that Ellana’s figure is dependent on. By turning the protagonist into a mythical figure, the author builds the image of a wild yet graceful feminine that nothing prevents from living apart from men.

938	Les articulations de l'arabité et du genre à travers les chaines d'équivalence : le cas de Uprising of Women in the Arab World	This master’s thesis is concerned with the aftermath of the popular protests that have emerged in light of the « Arab Spring ». It addresses these issues by means of an analysis of the  « Uprising of Women in the Arab World », a Facebook page that deals with women’s rights in the « arab world ». From a critical discursive standpoint, the research attempts to grasp the dynamics of this feminist collective through the lens of arabity and gender. On the one hand, the notion of arabity refers to a common belonging to the « arab world » that stems from the production of common religious and linguistic signifiers. On the other hand, gender refers to a privileged language used to signify power relations (Scott, 1988). I examine the intersections of gender and arabity through the concept of articulation (Hall, 1980) considered as the non-necessary assemblage of different production practices and hegemonic forces of a particular epoch that constitute a discourse. I use this concept of articulation to explore the intersections of different discourses through and by which gender and arabity are produced in the UWAW page. These articulations are analysed through the concept of chains of equivalence (Laclau, 2008), a concept that designates the aggregation of competing claims based on relations of equivalence and relations of difference. The latter are produced through the affirmation of the claims ‘particularity, while the former are constituted through the display of the claims' communalities.  This research is guided by the following research proposal: UWAW can be understood as a discursive space constituted by chains of equivalence where articulations of arabity and gender are materialized through relations of difference and relations of equivalence. This proposal is explored through a critical discourse analysis of three of the campaigns that took place on the UWAW in 2014. Focusing on these campaigns as discursive spaces where competing and heterogeneous statements emerge, I examine how the production of meaning is both impacted and informed by the competing knowledges brought to the fore by UWAW.   The analysis suggests that arabity is configured differently in each campaign. It is homogenized and universalized in « Do You Know », cleaved in « Israel Apartheid Week » and framed in civic terms in Je ne resterai pas silencieuse. Gender appears to be much more stable as it operated, for the most part, as a universalizing force throughout the campaigns.

939	In search of protection : sexual minority women in Canadian refugee determination	Canada has accepted refugee claims on the basis of sexual orientation for more than 20 years; however, research suggests that claims brought by women on the basis of sexual orientation have not always received fair adjudication. To ensure equitable access to protection for sexual minority women, an analysis of their risk of persecution must incorporate gender and other social and cultural factors that influence their experiences. Based on a case study of claims brought by women on the basis of sexual orientation between 2010 and 2013, which were subsequently rejected by the Canadian Immigration and Refugee board, this research identifies decision making that poses obstacles to sexual minority women’s access to refugee protection. The findings from this case study demonstrate that an intersectional analysis, which considers various forms of oppression within a particular social context, is crucial to a complete and informed assessment of the risk of persecution for sexual minority women. In light of these findings, this paper proposes that an intersectional analysis accompany continued training for Immigration and Refugee Board members on issues particular to sexual minorities.

We propose a methodology to adapt the XML-based business standards for the Semantic Web technologies by mapping documents defined on DTD or XML Schema to an ontological representation in OWL 2. Next, we propose an approach based on formal concept analysis techniques to regroup the ontology classes sharing some semantics to improve the quality, readability and the representation of the ontology. Finally, we propose ontology alignment to determine the semantic links between heterogeneous business ontologies generated by the transformation process to help entreprises to communicate fruitfully.

941	Influence of plant species and richness on pollutant removal in treatment wetlands	Treatment wetlands (TWs) are complex engineered ecosystems designed to remove pollutants from wastewater. In selecting plant species for TWs, the use of polycultures as well as the choice of local non-invasive species is increasingly recommended. However, to date, the majority of TWs have been planted in monoculture using invasive species, probably because the performance of native species and the possible advantages associated with plant diversity have not been clearly demonstrated. The research questions of my thesis are:  Are polycultures as good as or better than monocultures for pollutant removal, and could a native species be as efficient as an exotic invasive species in TWs?  Three experiments were performed to answer this question. The influence of plant richness on pollutant removal was tested in two mesocosm experiments: 1) comparing two emergent plant species in monoculture and planted in sequence, and 2) evaluating four free-floating species, each in monoculture versus pairs of species (all possible combinations) and the four species planted together. A third experiment was carried out to compare the removal efficiency of the invasive European haplotype of common reed (Phragmites australis) and the native non-invasive subspecies (P. australis subsp. americanus).   Plant species composition influenced the performance of TWs. The comparison of the performance of monocultures versus polycultures showed that, overall, TWs planted with a combination of species were as efficient as monocultures of the best performing species. Comparing the performance of native and invasive P. australis strongly suggests that the native could replace the invasive species in TWs, thereby avoiding possible environmental risks without compromising treatment efficiency.  The promising results of the native P. australis subspecies need to be further tested in full-scale experiments in order to encourage the use of this species in TWs. The results obtained comparing plant species combinations suggest that under circumstances in which the performance of available macrophytes is unknown or cannot be determined, using a mixture of species offers the best chances of achieving the highest possible level of pollutant removal. Furthermore, it has been suggested that plant diversity contributes to TWs in terms of their resilience to stress and disease.

942	Dynamiques d’intimidation contre la force publique : enjeux pour les policiers et les agents correctionnels	One of the most salient characteristics of police and correctional officers lies in their legitimate use of coercion to impose their authority. In theory, this public force must have precedence over any private force. In the study of violence, this feature makes their victimization particularly peculiar. Unlawful pressure and influence as well as intimidation tactics experienced by law enforcement officers have not been the focus of much attention. This thesis aims at bringing a better understanding of the intimidation dynamics, at identifying the major issues for the public force and at offering a more general theory of criminal intimidation. Public force being an inherently State function, we focussed first at the problem of intimidation in a global manner. By testing the theory of the action of security (Cusson, 2010), we observed that an intimidated and corrupted public force leads to a loss of legitimacy and efficiency of the judicial system in its fight against crime. We then adopted an interactionist approach to understand the everyday dynamics of intimidation. We asked ourselves what were the factors that officers considered severe and credible enough for them to consider an intimidation. By identifying the world of objects of police officers (Blumer, 1986), we observed that acts of intimidation that occurred outside the professional setting were considered more serious. Also, the fact that the intimidator belonged to a criminal organisation raised the gravity of the threat. Then, we looked into the social identities of correctional officers that experienced intimidation (Tedeschi et Felson, 1994). We discovered that minor but repeated acts of intimidation had a tendency to modify the professional practices of prison guards. An integrated analysis sheds light on two types of intimidation: on one side, a reactive and mild intimidation; on the other, a programmed and serious intimidation. This brings three issues for the public force: its symbolic aspects, a transformation of its action and its legitimacy. By integrating those issues, we have been able to offer a theory of the criminal intimidation. Lastly, preventive and repressive measures are discussed as a solution to criminal intimidation.

943	Étude du contrôle postural quasi-statique et dynamique en position debout des personnes ayant une lésion médullaire incomplète	Sensorimotor impairments resulting from a traumatic spinal cord injury affect the ability to stand safely. Individuals with incomplete spinal cord injury commonly experience falls while performing locomotor tasks after rehabilitation, resulting in injuries that affect social participation and quality of life. A better understanding of postural control in the clinical setting would help to identify effective interventions in this regard. The main objective of this thesis was to investigate standing postural control during various tasks among individuals with traumatic spinal cord injury using biomechanical assessments. The specific objectives were to explore the various aspects of postural control associated with each task and to identify explanatory factors of postural control. Twenty-five (25) people with incomplete traumatic spinal cord injury were recruited and underwent biomechanical assessments in a pathokinesiology laboratory. These assessments examined quasi-static stance with eyes open and closed, comfortable multidirectional limits of stability, natural gait, and gait initiation and termination. Biomechanical measures characterizing the displacement of the center of pressure (COP) as well as the stabilizing/destabilizing force model were used to compare the postural control of individuals with spinal cord injury with 33 able-bodied individuals. The results showed a decrease in quasi-static and dynamic postural control in people with spinal cord injury compared to their healthy counterparts. This decrease was accompanied by excessive reliance on visual information during quasi-static standing and correlated with the scores achieved on the Mini-BESTest. Displacement of the COP during the comfortable multidirectional limits of stability test was characterized by difficulty in following the indicated direction. This lack of precision increased the distance required to reach the maximal position in each direction. Measures of quasi-static stance did not correlate with those of the comfortable multidirectional limits of stability test. The single-support phase of gait among individuals with spinal cord injury was found to have a lower maximal stabilizing force and a greater destabilizing force compared to able-bodied individuals, whereas gait termination was more challenging than gait initiation for individuals with spinal cord injury. For all gait tasks, the COM velocity and the distance between the COP and the base of support were the main explanatory factors of stabilizing and destabilizing forces. To summarize, the results confirm the clinical impression of standing postural control impairment among individuals with spinal cord injury and identify the characteristics and parameters to consider for rehabilitation.

944	Conception et développement d'un environnement informatisé d'expérimentations contrôlées et assistées à distance par ordinateur (Ex@O)	In the school environment, the scientific (or experimental) approach requires experimental «savoir-faire» which is usually acquired in presential, that is to say in an institutional laboratory where the teacher or technician are present and may, at any time, fully assist the learner in his inquiry-based scientific and technological approach. The teacher or technician can direct, guide and stimulate the learner’s thinking, to do live demonstrations and control experiment by showing the learner how to configures the computer assisted experimentation (expérimentation assistée par ordinateur or ExAO) tools.  To meet the needs of distance learning, the R&D in science and technology education, provides learners and teachers with a computer laboratory environment, controlled and attended to from a distance. In order to distinguish between the remote computer lab environment and the ExAO microlaboratory, we named our environment Ex@O. It was first tested in order to werify its functionality and it was then evaluated in classroom situations by student teachers and students of adult education who practiced and experienced the scientific approach. This was done with a computer laboratory environment, but from a distance.  To achieve this, we combine the MicrolabExAO software with a grip remote, and audio and video tools (Teamviewer). In addition, we have create and included in the MicrolabExAO software, online help in order to facilitate the download and the grip remote laboratory. Because of Ex@O, the learner benefits from increased contacts with concrete experiments. In doing so, the Ex@O prototype meets the objectives of the « Programme de formation de l’école québécoise » (PFEQ), which is to increase the learner’s active participation in his learnings. With the first version of Ex@O prototype, where the learner can perform activities in remote laboratory, we were able to verify that it also focuses not only on knowledge, but also the experimental science and technology « savoir-faire », traditionally developed in institutional laboratories. Note here that the experimental approach is acquired almost exclusively in the laboratory practicing, often and on a regular basis, both inductive and deductive processes which are specific to this approach. The practice of the experimental approach from a distance with the Ex@O technology, has enabled us to verify that it was possible, even comparable to a real, step-by-step, experimental protocol traditionally conducted in an institutional laboratory.	assistance , Ex@O , actography , distance education , model of action , remote control , Scientific investigation , Ex@O , assistance	en	11917.0
945	Consommation de cannabis et symptômes dépressifs à l'adolescence : le rôle modérateur de la qualité de la relation parent-adolescent	Depression is a prevailing psychopathology which often begins during adolescence. Multiple repercussions on personal, economic and social levels have been associated with this disorder. Many factors including cannabis have been identified as likely to influence the onset and development of depressive symptoms. However, there is a lack of consensus concerning the link between cannabis use and depressive symptoms in adolescence, which could result from methodological differences as the control of potential confounding variables. Among these variables, parent-adolescent relationship has been identified as a potential moderator in the relationship between cannabis use and depressive symptoms. The present research project firstly aims to examine the relationship between cannabis use and the manifestation of depressive symptoms in adolescence and, secondly to verify the potential moderating effect of parent-adolescent relationship on that link. The sample includes 1 740 Quebec teenagers followed longitudinally in high school. Multiple hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to test the hypotheses. Results indicate a weak positive relationship between cannabis use and depressive symptoms assessed two years later. Moreover, only one dimension of the parent-adolescent relationship, defined as low parental support, has been identified as having predictive power on depressive symptoms. However, the variance explained by this interaction is insufficient to be considered on a clinical level. The implications of these findings are discussed.	adolescence , cannabis , parent-adolescent relationship , parental support , parental control , moderator effect	en	11909.0
946	The intangible aspects of architectural spaces that influence human well-being	This research uses qualitative and quantitative approaches in order to demonstrate how intangible aspects of architectural spaces influence human well-being. The goal is to increase awareness that interior spaces do impact human well-being and that architecture can be regarded as a solution to satisfy space users’ needs. In the first study a qualitative approach is explored through narrative inquiry in order to identify intangible aspects of residential and office spaces that affect human well-being. A discussion is built around the Model of Human Experiential Responses to Space and its purpose as a tool to unearth environmental characteristics that enhance well-being and can be of value to design professionals. Results show that 43 categories are interpreted as being intangible aspects of architectural spaces that influence human well-being. These categories are then used for three other studies to find out if there are any underlying regularities in environmental characteristics that affect user moods and feelings. Results show that similar environmental characteristics heighten sense of satisfaction and well-being for both residential and office space users. In the second study, a quantitative approach is applied to neurosciences and architecture in order to measure how architectural spaces influence human well-being. Neuroscience and environment / behaviour concepts are used where eight brain-based neuroscientific correlates (Zeisel 2006) are investigated in order to measure brain effects on architectural spaces. Neuroscientific outcomes reveal that the environment can affect human moods, ability to focus attention and stress levels and may also heighten task performance. Both studies contribute to knowing how space users feel environmental characteristics affect their mood and satisfaction. They reveal that people’s moods may be affected similarly in residential or office space settings and that a good environment that energizes employees will affect their work performance in a positive way (Vischer 2005).

947	Usage de la force policière au Québec : une analyse des facteurs individuels, situationnels et contextuels	In Quebec, the officer has the authority to enforce various laws and to maintain order. Since the police officer may be faced with a multiplicity of problems, he is, in certain circumstances, forced to use physical force to protect himself or to protect any person against death or serious injury. However, although the phenomenon of police force raises a good number of criticism and it is widely publicized, only a few studies have connected individual, situationnal and contextual factor to police use of force practices. The purpose of this thesis is to examine and to understand the phenomenon of police use of force in Quebec by identifying individual, situational and contextual factors on levels of police force. The data for the current study are derived from three primary sources : the incident reports of use of force of a Canadian police force for a period covering the years 2007 to 2011, 2006 Canadian Census and Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR). The use of multilevel models reveals that several factors have an impact on the level of police use of force. Individual and situationnal findings suggest that police are more likely to use higher level of force when they encounter males, citizens who physically resist and citizens who possess or display a weapon. Contextual findings indicate that the proportion of racial heterogeneity and concentrated disadvantage have an impact on levels of police force. Findings lead us to conclude that the nature of the immediate situation (individual and situational factors) is one of the most prominent explanations for police decision making, but police behavior can also be accounted for by variation in demographic and institutional characteristic of communities. However, further studies are needed to verify the consistency of our results.	Individual factors , Situational factors , Neighborhood context , Multilevel analysis , Police use of force	en	11889.0

949	Évaluation des distorsions cognitives et biais de désirabilité sociale chez les agresseurs sexuels d'enfants	At first glance, the assessment tools for cognitive distortions in child molesters seem valid and reliable. These tools are however critiqued for being associated with a social desirability bias as child molesters seemingly tend to modulate their answers to show the best of themselves. Despite this, it seems that the assessment tools can achieve a significative discrimination of child molesters’ cognitions. How is this possible?    For the purpose of this research paper, we conducted a literature review to determine whether the cognitive distortions assessment tools can allow for an effective discrimination of child molesters’ cognitions despite the social desirability issues they are attributed. We also aimed to achieve a better theoretical understanding of the assessment of child molesters’ cognitions as well as of the usefulness and clinical relevance of the assessment tools.   Our results indicate that, despite the criticism formulated about a presumed social desirability bias, the assessment tools do allow for an effective discrimination of child molesters’ cognitions. However, upon closer inspection, it is possible to note that child molesters mostly disagree with the assessment tools items. Although these results were once attributed to the presence of a social desirability bias, we could find little support of this conclusion in the literature as social desirability only seemed to play a minimal role in the analysis of the assessment tools results without rendering them invalid. Lastly, it seems that child molesters honestly answer the assessment tools questions without trying to dissimulate the beliefs they really hold.

951	Characterization of two sorting nexins : sorting nexin-11 and sorting nexin-30	The intracellular milieu is housed by countless numbers of intracellular molecules travelling by diffusion or along transient paths, which are regulated by specific trafficking proteins.  Among these traffic regulators are the sorting nexins that determine the fate of internalized proteins by directing toward a defined path, which can lead to either degradation or recycling.  To date, 33 sorting nexins (Snx1-33) have been identified, which all share a common characteristic, the presence of a PX (PHOX-homology) domain.  The PX domain is a phosphatidylinositol phosphate (PIP)-binding domain, which helps bring sorting nexins to PIP-enriched areas of lipid membranes.  For example, during receptor endocytosis, the surrounding membrane becomes transiently occupied by PI(4,5)P2.  PI(4,5)P2 is then recognized by Snx9, which contributes to the progression of endocytosis by linking the receptor complex to the actin cytoskeleton. The research presented in this thesis is the first to investigate the functions for two sorting nexins, Snx11 and Snx30, during embryogenesis and endosomal protein trafficking.  Results obtained from knockdown experiments in the frog (Xenopus laevis) were combined with data from cell culture and biomolecular experiments to propose a function for these two proteins.  The data presented here suggest that Snx11 is involved in somitogenesis, and regulates actin-dependent and -independent processes.  Snx11 could serve as a scaffolding protein, linking the extra-cellular matrix to the actin cytoskeleton and could also function in actin-independent receptor recycling.  On the other hand, Snx30 is implicated in early cardiogenesis and promotes the commitment of a population of mesoderm cells to the cardiac lineage.  It does so through the inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling but the underlying mechanism is still unclear.  Expression of Snx30 in Xenopus coincides with this critical period of cardiac specification and knockdown of Snx30 results in cardiac malformations as well as other defects in mesoderm- and endoderm-derived tissue.  In addition, data from both Xenopus and HEK293T cell culture show that knockdown of Snx30 increases Wnt/β-catenin signaling. This work provides the basis for future studies on Snx11 and Snx30.  Interestingly, Snx11 and Snx30 seem to act as fine-tuners of signaling pathways.  These proteins could potentially become interesting therapeutic targets due to their specificity and relatively subtle impact when knocked-down.  As such, interference with their function could be useful to re-balance a cellular disequilibrium while minimizing side effects.

952	L’adhésion pharmacologique et les difficultés cognitives	Adherence refers to the extent to which a patient respects the dosage and frequency of medication taken as prescribed for the recommended time. Despite the availability of many effective treatments, the problem of non-adherence is ubiquitous in medicine and in the psychiatric population. Patients with mood disorder or ADHD often have cognitive deficits. A research project conducted with 52 patients is presented. Results show that cognitive difficulties as perceived by patients reduce adherence. Areas such as inhibition, shift, working memory, planning and organization and the ability to initiate an action are particularly important. Ability to initiate tasks shows a trend to predict poorer adherence and correlates with adherence. Quick and simple tools permitting the assessment of cognition and adherence in clinical practice could help identify these problems. Targeted adherence enhancing interventions could then be offered to patients with such difficulties. Choosing interventions adapted to the individual on the basis of the specific profile of adherence influencing factors is an avenue which requires further exploration.

jeunes : rôle des animateurs non professionnels de la nutrition"	"Food garden curricula for children provide opportunities to work on their nutritional knowledge, vegetables preferences, self-efficacy to consume fruits and vegetables, willingness to taste them and their consumption. In such programs, certain obstacles can restrain the implementation or use of a food and nutrition curriculum by summer camp monitor/animator who are not nutrition or health professionals. This project consisted in developing and adding a food and nutrition educational component to ""Jardins-jeunes"", a gardening summer camp offered by Jardin Botanique de Montréal. A brief nutrition training was given to the camp’s monitors. Their level of interest and self-efficacy to implement this component trough the 2013 edition were evaluated. Evaluating methods included group interviews, questionnaires and a field observation. Qualitative analysis was conducted due to the small sample size. The nutrition training appears to have maintained or enhanced monitors' interests and knowledge on food and nutrition related subjects. They reported that the thirty minute food and nutrition activities integrated in the 2013 program presented opportunities to offer nutrition education, although limited by a lack of time. They report perceiving positive effects on children's knowledge, attitudes and behaviors on their food after their participation to the program. Our results suggest that a food and nutrition curriculum can be implemented in a garden program by summer camp monitor/animator who are not specialists in those fields, but who are provided with the adequate tools and support to be confident and interested in this task."

954	Caractérisation structurale et thermodynamique de la reconnaissance du substrat par le ribozyme VS de Neurospora	Kissing loops are tertiary structure elements that often play key roles in functional RNAs. Their formation is central to many RNA-mediated processes, such as translation initiation, antisense recognition and retroviral dimerization. Kissing loops are also involved in RNA folding as they form long-range interactions between different RNAs or remote domains within the same RNA and stabilize the complex architecture of functional RNA, such as tRNA, riboswitch aptamers and ribozymes.  Like several other functional RNAs, the Neurospora VS ribozyme contains an important kissing-loop interaction. The substrate recognition by the VS ribozyme depends largely on the formation of a magnesium-dependent kissing-loop interaction between stem-loop V (SLV) of the catalytic domain and stem-loop I (SLI) that defines the substrate domain. It has been shown from biochemical studies that the I/V kissing-loop interaction involves three Watson-Crick base pairs and is associated with a structural rearrangement of the SLI substrate from an unshifted and inactive to a shifted and active conformation. Here, we present a thermodynamic and structural characterization of the VS ribozyme I/V kissing-loop interaction using isolated stem-loop fragments (SLI and SLV). Both isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy studies were conducted with several SLI/SLV complexes using a common SLV, but either shiftable or preshifted SLI variants. From the ITC studies, we show that, under saturating amount of magnesium ions, the affinity of the preshifted SLI variants for SLV is remarkably high, the interaction being more stable than predicted for a comparable duplex. In addition, these ITC studies demonstrate that preshifted SLI variants have higher affinity for SLV than shiftable SLI variants, and these results allow us to evaluate the energetic cost of the conformational shift in SLI. From the NMR studies, we confirm formation of three Watson-Crick base pairs at the kissing-loop junction and provide direct evidence on the structural rearrangement of shiftable SLI variants in the presence of magnesium and SLV. The NMR structure of a high-affinity SLI/SLV complex demonstrates that both the SLI and SLV loops adopt U-turn structures, which facilitate intermolecular Watson-Crick base pairing. Several other interactions at the I/V interface, including base triples and base stacking help create a continuously stacked structure. These NMR studies provide a structural basis for the high stability of the kissing-loop interaction and lead us to propose a kinetic model for substrate activation by the VS ribozyme. Taken together, our ITC and NMR data suggest that the remarkable stability of the I/V interaction is likely provided by a combination of several elements, especially the presence of the U-turn motif, the presence of an extruded nucleotide in SLV (U700), the binding of magnesium ions and the extensive base stacking interactions at the junction.

956	Obligation de flâner : fugues narratives sur les sentiers littéraires	This mémoire proposes to dwell on the symbolism of the flânerie by associating the physical act of walking to the mental operation that accompanies it, while also seeking to draw a comparison with the evolution of reading practices over the last two centuries. If in the past the reader was expected to follow the path set by the author religiously, what followed, from the Nouveau Roman to the hypertext, was a whole new reader claiming the right to wander textually. The concept of narrative path emerges here as an alternative to traditional narratological studies; it constitutes a new hermeneutic approach where the reader makes his reading practices more dynamic by charting his own narrative paths inside the work itself. Using as examples the irruption of hypertext as well as the tortuous literatures of Kafka and Camus, this mémoire will examine how the wander-reading concept helps to renegotiate, both in print and digital forms, the relationship between the author and the reader in order to offer a literature that’s in movement, finally free to be acted upon, to be crisscrossed.

957	Les entreprises multinationales et les politiques publiques ; enquête sur leur engagement institutionnel au Canada	This thesis participates in a wide reflection on the interaction between government and multinational companies that is required in the current context of an accelerated globalization of the capitalist economy. We approach this issue by focusing on the institutional engagement of multinationals within different organizations, associations, forums or networks related to various development, innovation or labor market policies. What are the different dimensions of the institutionnal engagement of canadian subsidiary of multinationals ? How are those behaviors influenced by the various characteristics and strategies of these companies ? A comprehensive theoretical model, borrowing from many approaches used to understand the general behaviors of multinationals, is verified by quantitative analysis using original data obtained through the author’s participation in the Multinationals in Canada survey associated with the global INTREPID research initiative.   By highlighting the different facet of institutional engagement of the firm, this thesis establishes a more accurate operationalization of the broad concept of the “embeddedness”. Doing so, it put in question the essentially positive interpretation of the lather. The results reaffirm the relevance of various economics approach, but question the centrality of macro-intuitionalist approaches, particularly the Varieties of capitalism paradigm. Our analysis also illustrates the relevance of the Resource dependence theory and the impact of the presence in a firm of a structured actor able to counterbalance managers. Despite our theoretical venture, we were unable to observe a moderator effect of autonomy or power of the subsidiary on the country of origin influence on its institutional engagement behaviors.  This thesis provides some insight for better targeting institutional and economical interventions that seek to ‘embed’ multinationals and their capital inside the Canadian economy. It also draws light to the contributions of different stakeholder in the consolidation of the institutional engagement of multinationals, especially unions for training forums or employers networks.

958	Les impacts des stratégies patronales antisyndicales sur l’organisation des travailleurs	Anti-union management strategies are an increasingly popular phenomenon in the corporate world (Bronfenbrenner, 2009b). Management ideology could explain this tendency which results in the bitterness from sharing power with union worker representatives (Dundon et al., 2006). Corporations like WalMart, Disney, or McDonalds openly take position against unionization, thus spreading ideology and keeping work environments union-free (Dundon et al., 2006). Corporate power undeniably exerts power over smaller businesses (Dundon et al., 2006), a fact which could explain why anti-union strategies are often relied upon, even when unions are formally recognized. But what about Canadian anti-union movements? Many think that Canadian employers have officially acknowledged unionization in comparison with Americans, a belief supported by the unique historical background in regard to the Canadian industrial relation system and tactical preferences (Thomason & Pozzebon, 1998), alongside laws protecting union rights like association and negotiation (Boivin, 2010; Thomason & Pozzebon, 1998). Scientific scholarship however gives testimony of determination from Canadian employers in recourse to oppositional strategies against unionizing (Bentham, 2002; Martinello & Yates, 2002; Riddell, 2001). According to Martinello et Yates (2002), six percent (6%) of Ontarian employers covered would never use avoidance or oppositional tactics against unions: ninety four percent (94%) of employers covered thus would have used anti-union tactics. Therefore managerial opposition to union movements must certainly be present in the Canadian landscape.   However, few Canadian and Quebecer studies contributed to the literature on this phenomenon. Generally speaking, management scholars —British and especially American— explicitly mention strategy types and their frequency; they follow methodologies only taking court decisions in the subject matter into account or drawing almost exclusively on surveys. Keeping this in mind, we sought to contribute to the literature on anti-union strategies; we constructed an analytic framework for identifying their effects on workers and unions. Our research methodology is distinctly orig inal: we conducted a qualitative case study of a multi-sectorial retail organization. More specifically, our model is useful in identifying anti-union strategies against workers and unions, either targeting individual or collective interests or union interests, as suggested by Slinn (2008b). Moreover, we sought to understand to what extent anti-union strategies diminish (chilling effect) or augment (rebound effect) propensity to unionization among workers, whether they are targeted or not by these strategies (ripple effect).  To meet our goals, the research process was conducted in three steps. In Phase 1 several hypotheses were derived after reviewing the scientific literature. Phase 2 consisted of a data collection of union representatives and workers’ perceptions with semi-structured interviews. We then went on in phase 3 to a transcription of these interviews, and we analyzed results. Logical pairing methodology (Yin, 2009) was used in order to compare observed phenomena (fieldwork data) with predicted phenomena (theoretical and empirical predictions).  After the last step, we concluded that fear campaigns were most frequent in response to unionizing threats with coercive tactics such as: closure of two organizational branches, propaganda speeches given to captive audience, an internal video, and so on. As a matter of fact, a prevailing sense of fear for collective interests (experienced by 86% of research participants) followed from recourse to anti-union tactics by management. Consequently, we observed that in effect anti-union tactics would have stopped the unionizing process in other organizational branches (64% of research participants said so), and so disrupted union campaigns in general. We also remark that many tactics were employed following the official recognition of unions while also threatening individual interests. Many side effects could be enumerated: increased worker discipline (72%), intimidations or threats (80%) and resignations caused by a bad organizational climate (50%).

959	Misrepresenting Russia : Western perceptions of the Putin years, 1999-2008	The ascension of Vladimir Putin to the Russian presidency was a turning point in the history of Russia. Using articles from four influential western newspapers—the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Guardian and the Independent—this text will show the West perceived Russia during Putin’s between 1999 and 2008. Putin was heavily criticized as he was moving the country away from the “democracy” installed by the West after the Cold War, to a path more in line with traditional Russian principles. Russia refused to be subservient to Western interests. The western mainstream media reflected their government’s interests and critiqued Russia’s new path. The western media’s perceived obligation to promote “freedom” and “democracy” around the world has led it to condemn Russia and Putin and to create a sense of “russophobia” in the West.

960	Les discours de Pierre Plaoul au Parlement de Paris (1406) : un exemple des rhétoriques française et latine au Moyen Âge tardif	On May 27th 1406, the Parisian theologian Pierre Plaoul appeared before the court of the Parliament of Paris as a delegate of the University of Paris. His alma mater was involved against the University of Toulouse in an affair concerning the great schism. Plaoul made a speech in Latin, which the court immediately reproved, intimating him to speak French the next time. He did so on his second appearance on June 7th, but in a speech dramatically different from the first one. The French speech had a different genre and cited different authorities. Both instances are preserved in the X1a4787 register of the Archives nationales de France. The edition of both speeches helps us to understand the motivation behind such dramatic changes in style. But above all, it shows that the French speech was perhaps even more scholarly than the Latin one, and that the orator was not at all hindered by the use of French rather than Latin. Further analysis of the text shows that this instance is totally in line with the actual research’s tendency. Rather than viewing the relation between the vernacular and Latin of the late Middle Ages as being diglossic, current research prefers a dynamic of language contact. This view is supported by the many instances of medieval academics exhibit an excellent mastery of high-level French, be they poets, preachers or practitioners of law. A closer look at the use of the vulgar language by the doctors of theology during the reign of Charles VI also supports the hypothesis according to which late medieval scholars considered French as an apporiate mean of transmission for scholarly culture.

961	«Grandir comme aidant» : pour mieux comprendre la réalité des adolescents qui sont des aidants naturels auprès d'un parent dépendant	This research deals with adolescents that have become the young caregivers of a parent who suffers from a chronic illness in a context where increasing care needs have to be assumed by the individuals and their families (Guberman et coll., 2005), while, on the other hand, the services provided to caregivers still have difficulty in identifying the children or teenagers as carers. (Charles, Stainton et Marshall, 2012). Young carers adopt tasks and roles that are not always adapted to their age (Earley et Cushway, 2002) and which can compromise their psychosocial development (Sieh et coll., 2010, Davey et coll., 2005, Pedersen et Revenson, 2005). When talking about young caregivers, it is important to consider the caregiving on a continuum where all youth is implicated, in one way or another, in aspects related to the care of the ill parent. However, it is also important to consider that a smaller proportion adopts the role of young caregiver which results in an exaggerated implication of the teenager, as the time spent on helping as well as the nature of this help do not correspond to their age or their given developmental stage and there are important restrictions that have a negative impact in their life (Becker, 2007).  The aim of our research is therefore to investigate how this reality is experienced by the adolescents and how it is perceived and interpreted by practitioners from different professional fields in a Quebec context.  This research project is based on the theoretical framework of recognition as proposed by Honneth. In fact, based on the available literature we can assume that the attention given to young caregivers is central in their lives. Consequently, we believe that it is important to understand the various issues surrounding the recognition that most researchers talk about but that are seldom studied in relation to young caregivers. This conceptual framework will serve as a gateway to analyse four semi-structured interviews with teenagers aged 15 to 19 years, as well as seven semi-structured interviews with practitioners from diverse professional fields.  Findings from this study suggest there are three different dynamics of recognition describing the diverse challenges and issues surrounding the realities of young caregivers. These highlight that the consequences that young carers may face come not only from the caretaker role, but also from the relational dimension in regards to their reality. Furthermore, at the intersection of perspectives between teenagers and practitioners, a divergence point is made apparent and seems to impede in our way of conceptualizing the help that should be provided in regards to this phenomena. It seems that for practitioners, the improvement of the young caregivers’s situation occurs, among others, through support that should be provided to parents, while teenagers put a special emphasis in the particular ways in which their contribution is not only valued in the family sphere but also supported by the practitioners surrounding the family.

962	Dancing double binds : feminine virtue and women’s work in Kinshasa	While women in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo have historically participated in commerce at the local level, with an increase in higher education levels, and with dire economic circumstances putting additional pressure on already limited family incomes, women are increasingly entering new professions. In so doing, and as they become more visible in political and economic spheres, women are subjected new forms of moral suspicion. It is within this context that notions of femininity and female virtue in Kinshasa continue to be redefined. Historically, as Congolese women migrated to the city of Léopoldville, they were confronted with new demands to become “modern” and “civilized” they were also expected to remain “traditional” by staying home and tending to their families. I suggest that these binaries continue to inform conceptions of female virtue in Kinshasa today, namely in the form a distinction between “virtuous” and “non-virtuous” women, and this dissertation explores the ways in which women actively negotiate new gender roles and expectations influenced by such binaries.  Rather than of falling into the trap of the local dichotomy drawn between “virtuous” and “non-virtuous” women, I focus on the underlying causes and the unexpected outcomes of these local categories. I discuss how notions of female virtue have been shaped and influenced by what can be referred to as a “triple patriarchy,” consisting of “traditional” values, colonial and post-colonial state-led initiatives, and Christian Pentecostal discourse. I also examine how these factors have engendered new perceptions of female virtue that put women in a position of double bind, having to carefully manage impressions of themselves in public. Further, I show how this kind of impression management fuels problems of trust between and across the genders, ultimately impacting perceptions of women in the workplace and in society more generally through the performance of popular culture.   Because it is one of the most visible occupations among women in Kinshasa, the role of the popular concert danseuse is useful in illuminating the new challenges faced by women in Kinshasa. As such, this dissertation provides an ethnographic account of danseuses, their particular status as public objects of desire, and how this visibility comes to bear on local notions of freedom, power and femininity.	women , virtue , work , popular culture , dance , gender dynamics , public sphere , Kinshasa , visibility , danse	en	11683.0
963	Ce ne sont que des corps ; suivi de L'idéal de l'androgynie dans le réservoir des sens de Nelly Kaplan	This M.A. thesis combining research and creative writing explores the concepts of hybrid identity and the desire to escape standard expectations. In the novel Ce ne sont que des corps, two strangers are alternately sharing significant events of the past few months, while waiting for the train. Emmanuel, twenty-five, fall in love for Michelle, a strong-minded woman in her fifties, which he met in a bar. Michelle wants to fulfill some of her fantasies and Emmanuel decides to play along with the game until it turns sour. As for Alex, a young twenty something woman who left her village to study in Montreal, she falls in love with Gabriel, an aspiring musician for whom she is ready to give everything up. Each of the characters in this novel blurs sexual identities and gender. Furthermore, the essay explores the way Nelly Kaplan manipulates the sexuality and gender of her protagonists to suggest an “androgynous poetry” in some of the compendium’s Le reservoir des sens short stories. The essay bring forth knowledge from studies on irony, surrealist poetic, gender as well as intertextuality to underline how the author blurs sexual identity and gender.

964	Archive(s) : approche dialectique et exploitation artistique	This thesis proposes a dialectical reversal in the archival science concept whose central point is the use of archives rather than the production of records. The first chapters outline the various understandings of the archives since the creation of national institutions in the 19th century until a renewed approach done by some archivists defining themselves as postmodernists in the late 20th century. The history of the archives and the archival science shows two coexistent views which appear as essentially contradictory in that one (traditional) is centered on the creator of the records, and the past understood as the set of actions performed by the creator, while the other (postmodern) is based on the social functions of the archives and the archivist’s role. Following the dialectical thought of Walter Benjamin, the fourth chapter proposes to think the dual nature of archives as documents and testimony while articulating that thought about the archive as a means of inscription of self in time. It appears that the archives can be considered as an objectification of the past within a chronological temporality at the heart of which resides, latently, the archive as a potential emancipator. The artistic use of archives as presented in the fifth chapter shows how this particular type of exploitation highlights the fact that the archives are bound by their conditions of use, which are also the conditions of existence of the archive. Among the issues addressed by the artists, those of memory, authenticity, archives as a means of appropriating the world, and as a poetical object become as many possible entry point to revisit the archival science. The last chapter summarizes all the proposed renewals detailed throughout the thesis. We envision a non-chronological temporality where the archives, objects of the past handled by a singular current dialectic, are being oriented towards both the past and the future. New opportunities are being offered for the archival science from the new properties being assigned to the archives by the artists. Finally, it is the life cycle of the archives itself that can be revised by including the exploitation as a key dimension.

965	Théorie du langage et esthétique totalisante dans l’œuvre poétique de Christophe Tarkos	This dissertation takes as its object the tie between self-reflexivity and aesthetic form in the poetry of Christophe Tarkos, produced in the 1990s. It highlights the relationship between the development of a theory of language within his poetic oeuvre and aims to illustrate its “totalizing” aesthetics. “Theory” is understood as the combination of reflections, meditations and concepts about language and poetry. This thesis endeavors to identify the generating principles in his poetic oeuvre, which are inscribed within the crisis of representation often seen as originating in the mid- nineteenth century. By revisiting this crisis of representation, Tarkos’s poetry can been seen as being located in a historicity. My thesis attempts to interpret this revisiting process through an analysis of a poetic form that gives shape to the world and to individual memory. My assumption is that the theory of language facilitates the intelligibility of his poetry because it provides a reflexive medium. My thesis, which favors a method based on textual analysis, is divided into three parts. The first provides a review of the critical reception of the work, in which I track major lines of interpretation, ranging from Christian Prigent to Jean-Michel Espitallier. Placing Tarkos within the French poetic field allows me to position my research within the commonplace of criticism. The second part investigates the theory of language in his manifestos (Le Signe =, Manifeste chou, Ma langue est poétique et La poésie est une intelligence) that reveal several principles, powers and limits of language and poetry. In order to demonstrate the specificity of the concept of « pâte- mot » (a dough of words) developed by Tarkos, I compare it to the poet Danielle Collobert’s figurative representation of « dough », as « paste ». The third part offers a study of the will and “totalizing” aesthetic present in the work of Tarkos, which seeks to shape the real. Indeed, poetry answers to the excess of the real by various strategies. While wanting to represent his brimming nature through a language akin to logorrhea or by using methods such as repetition, it also seeks to control it in stable textual forms such as « squared » fragments of prose (Carrés, Caisses), in enumerative lists (Anachronisme) or in networks of figures. Tarkos’s willingness to “totalize” also seems to be rooted in a sense of urgency concerning, ultimately, a battle against finitude.

966	Un centenaire, des faire mémoire : analyse des pratiques de mémoire autour du Canadien de Montréal	This dissertation explores the heterogeneous practices of memory that emerged during the centennial anniversary of the hockey team Canadien de Montréal in 2009. The dissertation’s goals are twofold: 1) bring a theoretical and a communicational light on the object ‘memory’; 2) produce a contextual analysis of these memory practices and of the issues they render effectives. My dissertation is situated in the fields of memory studies (especially in its current media turn) and cultural studies. In the first chapter dedicated to the ‘problematization’ of the centennial, I explore this event by a communicational approach of memory. This approach aims to interrogate the materiality of the practices of memory and their co‐constitutive relation with media of memory. In the two following analytical chapters, I proceed by analyzing a heterogeneous archive (newspaper articles, websites excerpts, observation notes, interviews, tv shows, etc.) from different registers of memory.The second chapter focuses on the practices of memory regarding the former hockey player Léo Gravelle. I analyze how practices –such as archive digitalization, constitution of a ‘shoebox’,‘biographization’, conservation and ‘fetichization’ –render present some pasts in specific manners. This chapter highlights how familial relations, aging issues and particular forms of friendships are rearticulated through these practices of memory. The third chapter analyses the practices of memory developed by the organization of the Canadien de Montréal. I explore the commemoration and the patrimonialisation of the team. I also focus on the particular ways in which these practices of memory rearticulate the relationships between a professional sport team and the city of Montreal and how they put forward new issues such as philanthropy and consumer activism. The fourth chapter discusses about the implications of ‘doing memory’, which I conceive as a means to ‘space’, as a manner of being involved as well as a project that mobilizes and organizes. I conclude the dissertation by outlining the singular elements which constitute this centennial anniversary.

967	L’effet d’un programme de santé et de mieux-être en milieu de travail sur les invalidités de courte durée, les accidents du travail et le retour sur investissement	This thesis aims to study the effect of a health challenge focusing on weight loss, as part of a health and wellness program, in a Quebec organization, on short-term disability, workplace accidents and the resulting return on investment.  Quantitative analyses were conducted using an existing database of 1 981 employees in a large Canadian company employing more than 2 400 employees. Data was analysed over a period of 15 months: 6 months pre-intervention, 3 months during the challenge and 6 months post-intervention.  Results indicate that only the frequency of workplace accidents is significantly higher among non-participants when compared with participants in the post-intervention period. When comparing these two groups between pre and post-intervention period, we observed that the participants’ results remained stable over time, whereas non-participants deteriorated with regard to the frequency and duration of short-term disability and workplace accidents. Participants’ age had a moderating effect on workplace accidents because analyses showed that younger participants (18 to 44 years) experienced a lower frequency of workplace accidents compared to older (45 years and more) in the same group. Conversely, gender did not have moderating effect on short term disability and workplace accident.  The results obtained allow us to show employers that investing in a health challenge focused on weight loss with the framework of a Health and Wellness program has significant quantitative and qualitative positive effects on their workforce. This program helps to educate employees to eat well and be physically active, which helps to achieve a healthy weight and thus slows the annual increase absenteeism that we observe on the job market.

968	L’importance  de la polyphonie organisationnelle dans un processus  de  changement stratégique	This master thesis illustrates the ways by which polyphonic narratives reveal some information about the employees’ experiences during a process of organizational change.  In order to identify these multiple voices, we analyzed the employees’ and managers’ narratives. Through the employees’ narratives, we tried to empirically illustrate the way narratives are constitutive of organizational change. Furthermore, we sought to bring to light employees’ preoccupations that feed and are constitutive of the change process as well as the organizational entity. The employees’ stories were analyzed through a polyphonic perspective, that is, an approach that highlight the existence of multiple voices in tensions, voices that are part of the employees’ narratives. To help us investigate these stories, our theoretical framework was based on the ventriloquist approach, as proposed by Cooren (2012, 2013). These preoccupations were analyzed as several voices animating and authoring these narratives, hence creating a polyphonic narrative that we attempted to identify and categorize in our interviews. This polyphonic analysis, by the tracking of voices, figures and tensions allowed us to shed light on preoccupations that are constitutive of the change process.  In this master thesis we identified and analyzed the voices, figures and tensions that illustrate the ways by which each employee experienced the process of organizational change. Consequently, we were able to contribute to the literature on polyphonic narratives and organizational change. As we show, this literature does not allow us to understand the way by which employees voice their concerns emerging from the change process and how these preoccupations interact with one another and integrate into organizational change narratives. Our findings suggest that all the employees’ preoccupations and concerns provide a global picture of their experiences during the process of organizational change and a better understanding of the tensions that are also part of the change process.

969	Essays on oil price fluctuations and macroeconomic activity	In this thesis, I am interested in the effects of fluctuations in oil prices on macroeconomic activity depending on the underlying cause of these fluctuations. The economic models used in this thesis include the Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) Models and Vector Autoregressive (VAR) Models.  Several studies have examined the effects of fluctuations in oil price on the main macroeconomic variables, but very few of theses studies have specifically made the link between the effects of fluctuations in oil prices and the origin of these fluctuations. However, it is widely accepted in more recent studies that oil price increases may have very different effects depending on the underlying cause of that increase. My thesis, structured in three chapters, is focused on the sources of fluctuations in oil price and their impacts on the macroeconomic activity in general, and in particular on the canadian economy.   The first chapter of the thesis investigates how oil supply shocks, aggregate demand shocks, and precautionary oil demand shocks affect Canada's economy, within an estimated Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) model. The estimation is conducted using Bayesian methods, with Canadian quarterly data from 1983Q1 to 2010Q4. The results suggest that the dynamic effects of oil price shocks on Canadian macroeconomic variables vary according to their sources. In particular, a 10% increase in the real price of oil driven by positive foreign aggregate demand shocks has a significant positive effect of about 0.4% on Canada's real GDP upon impact and the effect remains positive over time. In contrast, an increase in the real price of oil driven by negative foreign oil supply shocks  or by positive  precautionary oil demand shocks causes an insignificant effect on Canada's real GDP upon impact but causes a slightly significant decline afterwards. The intuition is that a positive innovation in aggregate demand tends to increase the demand for Canada's overall exports. Oil supply disruptions in foreign countries or positive precautionary oil demand shocks increase the uncertainty about future oil prices, which leads firms to postpone irreversible investment expenditures, and tends to reduce Canada's real GDP. Furthermore, among the identified oil shocks, foreign aggregate demand shocks have been relatively more important in explaining the variations of most of Canadian macroeconomic variables over the estimation period.  The second chapter examines the links between oil demand and supply shocks and labor market adjustments in Canadian manufacturing industries using a panel structural VAR model. The model is estimated with disaggregated annual data at the industry level from 1975 to 2008. The results show that a positive aggregate demand shock increases both labor and the price of labor over a 20-year period. A negative oil supply shock has a relatively small negative effect upon impact but the effect turns positive after the first year. In contrast, a positive precautionary oil demand shock has a negative impact over all horizons. The paper also examines how the responses to different types of oil shocks vary from industry to industry. The results suggest that industries with higher net trade exposure/oil-intensity are more vulnerable to oil price increases driven by oil supply shocks and aggregate demand shocks.  The third chapter examines the welfare implications of introducing competitive storage on the global oil market using a three country DSGE model characterized by two oil-importing countries and one oil-exporting country. The welfare gains are measured by consumption compensating variation under two alternative monetary policy rules. The main results indicate that the introduction of oil storage has negative welfare effects for each of the two oil importing countries, while it has positive welfare effects for the oil exporting country, whatever the monetary policy rule. I also found that including the exchange rate depreciation in the monetary policy rules allows to slightly reduce the welfare costs for both oil importing countries. Finally, the magnitude of the welfare effects depends on the steady state level of oil storage and is mainly driven by oil storage shocks.

970	Malek Bennabi (1905 – 1973 É.C.) et les conditions d’une nouvelle renaissance de la société arabo-musulmane	Malek Bennabi (1905 – 1973) was a Muslim philosopher, and reformer from Algeria.  He was born in Constantine. Bennabi was particularily interested in understanding the civilization of the Arab-Muslim world. As an engineer who graduated from the Ecole Polytechnique in Paris, he combined both Franco-Western and North-African Islamic cultures. His publications received a number of awards and prizes primarily due to his unique combination of expertise, experience, innovation, and emancipation. He wrote numerous articles and books on a variety of issues such as civilizations, culture, ideology, societies, Orientalism, democracy, and the phenomenon of the Qur'an. His writings focused mainly on the causes of contemporary Arabo-Muslim social problems as well as the conditions for a new renaissance or rebirth.  The colonial and post-colonial contexts of Bennabi affected his thought. He did not consider an independent and modern state as sufficient conditions for reaching economic development or socio-cultural advancement. Similar to other thinkers, like the late Al Djâbiri Mohamed Arkoun, Malek Bennabi pursued to the logic that only through empowering Arab societies can there be prevention of their underdevelopment and decadence.  This thesis focuses precisely on this point: the rebirth of the diverse Islamic society. It seeks to answer the following question: “What innovative thinking did Bennabi contribute to improve the lives of Arab-Muslims?”	Malek Bennabi , Renaissance , Malek Bennabi , Islamic Thought , Arabo-Muslim Society , Civilization , Renaissance , Rebirth , Reformation	en	11573.0
971	Isolation, culture et caractérisation phénotypique de cellules musculaires lisses endobronchiques équines	Endobronchial smooth muscle is one of the main stakeholder in asthma by alteration of his volume and phenotype. Sampling airway smooth muscle using endobronchial biopsies is performed in order to study pathways associated with remodeling, but currently, little is known regarding the stability of the ASM phenotypes during in vitro culture. Specifically, whether the contractile phenotype is maintained in culture and his evolution across passages is not established. Two problems could explain this lack of information: first the sampling, secondly the maintenance of contractile phenotype in culture.     We developed culture condition based on tracheal smooth muscle in the aim to ensure the upkeep of contractile phenotype. Then we developed a sampling protocol to harvest and maintain in culture ASM cells from endobronchial biopsies on a live animals. The stability of the ASM contractile phenotype was evaluated at each passage using immunofluorescence, FACS and western blot for α-sm-actin, desmin and myosin contents over a 2-month period. No significant differences were observed between the first and the fourth last passage (4th to 7th). 96.4% of the tracheal smooth muscle cell expressed α-sm-actin, 83.3 and 77% of cells expressed desmin and myosin respectively, at the 7th passage. Endobronchial smooth muscle expressed 84% of α-sm-actin, 57% of desmin and 69% of myosin, respectively.   Contractile phenotype was maintained and we determined evolution of contractile phenotype in standardize conditions that will provide a characterized support for coming research.

973	La délinquance chez les jeunes : une évaluation approfondie de l’enchâssement social et du chevauchement des sphères relationnelles	Abstract: It is well established in the criminology literature that delinquent peers can have a detrimental effect on young people’s behaviors. The analysis of social environmental characteristics is therefore essential to fully comprehend the unraveling of individual actions. Since it is impossible for a youth, whether he offends or not, to completely isolate himself from the conventional world (Sykes et Matza, 1957, Warr 2002), the overlapping of conventional and delinquent relationships needs to be considered to grasp the extent of the social influence phenomenon. In addition, youth’s social networks are not limited to friends, family members, classmates and co-workers all have a potential influence on their behavior. This study conducted an analysis of the social environment of 237 youth aged 14-24, attending community organizations in Quebec. The results reveal that: 1) crime participation in a youth community sample is frequent, 2) social network’s relational characteristics reflecting social embeddedness are not indicative of crime participation 3) high intensity interactions with social network members significantly reduces market crime commission rates, even when controlling for the presence of offenders in the network, 4) presence of delinquent contacts in multiple social network’s relational spheres allows to create a delinquent dispersion index in order to reflect youth’s criminal embeddedness and finally 5) the more offenders are scattered across different relational spheres that make up the youth’ social network, the greater the risk of involvement in crime is. However, this measure of network delinquency does not predict offending rates. For intervention purposes, looking at network’s delinquent dispersion index might improve prevention of delinquent behaviors.

974	Design, synthèse et application en catalyse verte d’un ligand alkyl imidazolium β-cyclodextrine	Chemistry keeps evolving in new directions. Research has provided improved methodologies for the design and synthesis of targeted molecules. At the same time, the 21st century is witnessing increasing concern about the environmental impacts of chemical wastes. A new philosophy of chemical research and engineering has emerged, known as «Green chemistry». This concept encourages the design of products, processes and technologies that minimize the use and generation of hazardous substances. Therefore, there is an urge to develop environmentally friendly process to convert molecules into product of interest.  In the present thesis, we describe the synthesis, characterization and catalytic properties of a novel alkylimidazolium-modified β-cyclodextrin (-CD). Our strategy was to construct a single amphiphilic bimodal ligand by the combination of a mass transfer unit (-CD), covalently bound to a ligand moiety (alkylimidazolium, an N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) precursor) for aqueous catalysis. First, we demonstrated that the introduction of a dodecyl chain on the imidazolium moiety attached to the primary face of a native β-CD allows the formation of a highly active micellar self-assembled catalytic system in neat water with remarkable recyclable properties for the Suzuki–Miyaura coupling. In addition, we studied the versatility of this self-assembled bimodal system by performing Heck coupling in neat water.

975	Développement d’une méthode de transfert de protéines présentes dans des sections tissulaires minces sur des cibles fonctionnalisées pour augmenter la spécificité de l’imagerie MS du protéome	Imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) is a technique in full expansion that is used in a large range of studies such as the correlation between molecular expression and the health status of a tissue and developmental biology. A common limitation of the technology is that only the more abundant and/or more easily ionisable molecules are usually detected, in particular in protein analysis. One of the methods used to alleviate this limitation is the direct specific transfer of proteins from a tissue section to a functionalized surface with high spatial fidelity. In this case, only proteins with an affinity for the surface will be retained whereas others will be removed. The chemical nature of the surface is therefore critical. The research work presented in this document proposes a high spatial fidelity transfer method for proteins from a tissue section onto a nitrocellulose surface. The method uses a homebuilt apparatus that allows the transfer process to be done without any direct physical contact between the tissue section and the transfer surface while still using physical pressure to help protein migration. In subsequent work, the developed method was used to transfer proteins from a mouse kidney section onto the nitrocellulose surface. Serials sections were also collected either to be colored with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) to assess the high spatial fidelity of the transfer process, or to be directly analyzed as a control sample to access the different signals detected after transfer. Results showed a high spatial fidelity transfer of a subset of proteins. Some of the detected transferred proteins were not observed after direct tissue analysis and/or showed an increase in sensitivity.

976	Analyse anthropologique des politiques de brevetage génétique : le cas du BRCA 1/2 au Québec	The biotechnology company Myriad Genetics owns the diagnosis of genetic predisposition of breast and ovarian cancer since 1996. The patent, which grants an international license, reverses the right of molecular analysis by other laboratories. This monopoly allows the company to apply an excessively higher price than public laboratories and pursue the offenders in justice. However, since 2001, Quebec is the only province to respect (in part) the patent, using the company for the complete sequencing. This research analyzes the gene patent politics in its legal structure of intellectual property and the cultural meanings of biotechnology. I rely on an analytical framework of theories of property and biomedical research. I also proceeded to the discourse analysis of physicians and genetic counsellors in Quebec through interviews conducted in hospitals in the region of Montreal and Sherbrooke. This qualitative study identifies how doctors and genetic counsellors analysis the role of patents in the screening and diagnosis of cancer and how genetic patents express a medical culture. The study aims to explore how gene patents are perceived in analyzing and comparing the variations between ideological limits and practical limits.

977	Le potentiel musical des analyses sonores et autres phénomènes vibratoires	This thesis about the musical potential of sound analysis consists in an artistic and creative research on characteristic properties of sound behavior revealed by various types of analysis and likely to assist musical composing. This work presents the elaboration of analysis tools programmed and used on purpose, in addition of a corpus of six works which the order of presentation corresponds to their chronology of writing, and which both conception and musical analysis are unevenly exposed (from brief to exhaustive overviews). As the research occurs, the featured repertory integrates, by a conceptual enlargement, some analytic considerations for other vibratory phenomena (as light or the harmony of the spheres) and, aesthetically, all that approach is founded on the aristotelician concept of mimesis, in which the artistic ideal consists in the sublimation of nature.	mimesis , contemporary music , sound analysis , mimesis , aesthetism , harmony of the spheres , synaesthesia	en	11446.0
978	Facteurs de risque d’insuffisance rénale chronique chez les greffés cardiaques : du phénotype aux tests pharmacogénomiques	Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major problem frequently observed in cardiac transplant recipients. Calcineurin inhibitors, which have become the cornerstone of immunosuppressive treatments in solid organ transplantation, are considered a major cause of post-transplant renal dysfunction. Several other factors such as recipients’ demographic, clinical and genetic characteristics also contribute to this phenomenon, but it remains rather difficult to determine which patients present the highest risk of CKD after transplantation. Discovery of new genetic markers of renal dysfunction could one day lead to individualization of immunosuppressive therapy according to each patient’s genetic profile. However, transplant patients’ opinions towards pharmacogenomic testing remain unknown, and it is unclear whether these differ from healthy individuals’ opinions. This doctoral thesis thus aims: 1- To describe the very long-term evolution of renal function after transplantation and to identify demographic and phenotypic markers associated with postheart transplant CKD; 2- To identify genetic markers associated with calcineurin inhibitor-induced nephrotoxicity; 3- To assess and to compare the attitudes of patients and healthy individuals concerning the potential integration of pharmacogenomic markers in clinical practice. Three projects have been conducted to answer these questions. The first one relies on a retrospective analysis of the evolution of renal function in patients who received a heart transplantation at our institution between 1983 and 2008. We discovered that deterioration of renal function continues up to 20 years after transplant and that risk factors of CKD include, among others, advanced age, female gender, pretransplant renal dysfunction, hypertension, hyperglycemia and use of prednisone. The second project is a pharmacogenomic study looking at genetic determinants of calcineurin inhibitor-induced nephrotoxicity. We were able to illustrate for the first time that a genetic polymorphism related to PRKCB (gene encoding protein kinase C-β) is associated with renal function in heart transplant patients, whereas it is probably not the case for polymorphisms in TGFB1 (gene encoding transforming growth factor-β1). The third section of this thesis reports the results of a questionnaire whose purpose was to compare the attitudes towards pharmacogenomic testing in a group of healthy volunteers, cardiac transplant recipients and heart failure patients. This study demonstrated that, although enthusiasm regarding pharmacogenomics is shared equally among these individuals, preoccupations related to confidentiality and potential impacts on employment and insurance are more important in healthy volunteers. In summary, the work presented in this thesis showed that early identification of heart transplant patients who are most likely to develop renal dysfunction as well as adoption of an individualized therapeutic approach involving clinical applications of pharmacogenomics could potentially help to prevent this post-transplant complication.

979	Being a bereaved parent : early bereavement experiences and perspectives on paediatric palliative care and bereavement services	The death of a child is considered one of the most stressful and difficult experiences a person can face. Clinicians, hospitals, and other organizations want to help and support bereaved parents through their grief, but their efforts are hampered by a lack of research in the area of parental bereavement. This dissertation is comprised of two literature reviews and one empirical study that attempt to address this gap and inform services in paediatric palliative care in general, and in bereavement support in particular.  The first article consists of an examination of the needs of patients receiving paediatric palliative care and their families. By metasummarizing the descriptive and qualitative research in the area, 10 need domains were found. The results were generally in agreement with current guidelines in paediatric palliative and end-of-life care; however, there were several aspects of care that were reported as lacking or problematic that are not addressed in these guidelines and that should be considered in future guideline and policy creation.  In the second article, parents’ adaptation to their grief and elements found to influence their adaptation were examined. The aim was to synthesize the relevant literature in a way that could be useful to clinicians; to this end, a narrative synthesis method was employed in order to synthesize both quantitative and qualitative research in the area of parental bereavement. The results suggest important elements to keep in mind when assessing how parents adapt to their grief. The results also suggest aspects related to better adaptation, which could serve as potential avenues for support and intervention. However, this review also demonstrated certain methodological issues in the literature that hinder the synthesis and clinical applicability of the findings.  The objective of the third article was to inform bereavement follow-up and support services through the use of an interpretive description methodology. To this end, 21 bereaved parents (including 5 parental couples) and 7 hospital staff involved in bereavement follow-up activities at two paediatric hospitals were interviewed, and the clinical applicability of the results verified through various meetings with project collaborators and service/program providers. The results of the study describe how parents coped with their grief in the early phase of their bereavement, as well as their perspectives on how various bereavement follow-up services helped them cope. We found that parents regulate their intense feelings of grief through either loss-oriented or restoration-oriented strategies, including attempts to reorganize their self-identity and connection to their deceased child; often parents’ relationships with others help them cope in these ways. The insights we gained from the respondents also allowed us to elucidate how various bereavement support and follow-up services were helpful. These results are discussed along with the clinical implications and how these findings can inform bereavement service providers.	coping , dual-process model , pediatric , palliative care , end-of-life care , dual-process model , meaning reconstruction , social support , qualitative , interpretive description , pediatric oncology , pediatric intensive care	en	11433.0
980	Essais en économetrie et économie de l'éducation	"This these is organized in three chapter; the first two chapters are in Econometrics and the third in labor Economics.  The econometrics chapters focuses on estimating parameters in data rich environments. I investigate how to establish causal effect or treatment effect  in high dimensional setting using regularization techniques. The last chapter of this thesis focuses on the  outcomes associated with general and specific education. In particular I study the effect of specialization in high school on college major choice and performance in  college.  In the first chapter, entitled \textquotedblleft Regularized LIML for many instruments \textquotedblright (joint with Marine Carrasco), I consider the efficient estimation of a finite dimensional parameter in a linear model where the number of potential instruments is very large or infinite. The use of many moment conditions improves the asymptotic efficiency of the instrumental variables estimators. I propose regularized a versions of the limited information maximum likelihood (LIML) based on three different regularizations: Tikhonov, Landweber Fridman, and principal components.  The second chapter, entitled \textquotedblleft Efficient estimation with many weak instruments using regularization techniques \textquotedblright, (Joint with Marine Carrasco), extends  the previous works, to allow for the presence of a large number of weak instruments or weak identification.  The problem of weak instruments is due to a very small concentration parameter. To boost the concentration parameter, I propose to increase the number of instruments to a large number or even up to a continuum. I show that normalized regularized 2SLS and LIML are consistent and asymptotically normally distributed.  The third chapter of this thesis is entitled \textquotedblleft High school human capital portfolio and  college outcomes"" investigates  the trade-off between acquiring specialized skills, in high school, which will be useful for a particular college major and acquiring a package of skills that diversifies risk across majors. Using the 1980 High School and Beyond (HS\&B) survey, I study the empirical relationship between college performance and different  types of courses taken during formal high school education. This panel shows that students sort into majors according to the subject in which they acquired more skills. However, I  find a U-shaped relation between diversification and college performance, suggesting a trad-off between specialization and diversification. The underlying  trade-off is assessed by estimating a structural model of high school human capital acquisition and college major choice. Policies experiments suggest that one more high school quantitative course increases enrollment in  Science Technology Engineering, and Math (STEM) majors by  4 points percentage."

981	Variations interindividuelles des performances cognitives et conséquences évolutives chez une population naturelle de mésange charbonnière (Parus major)	Animals face a rapidly changing world due to anthropogenic habitat destruction and climate change, forcing them to quickly adjust their behaviour to new environmental conditions. Cognitive processes such as innovation and learning can allow animals to incorporate novel behaviours into their behavioural repertoires and facilitate optimal responses to environmental change. Cognitive performances vary between and within species and although several studies have recently addressed the causes of inter-individual variations in cognitive performance, the fitness consequences of this variation remain poorly explored in natural populations. In my PhD thesis, I investigated different selective pressures acting on innovation and learning performance to better understand the evolution of these traits in a natural population of great tits Parus major. Firstly, I designed a novel problem-solving task that involved opening a trap door to access chicks, and presented it to breeding great tit pairs in their natural habitat. I found that the most efficient birds at solving this task performed better at multiple measures of reproductive success than the less efficient. Secondly, to test whether chick provisioning motivation confounded this relationship, I manipulated brood size and recorded whether this affected the problem-solving performance of the parents. My results showed that this was not the case. Instead, solvers had higher reproductive success whatever the brood size manipulation experienced, supporting the hypothesis that this cognitive performance drives reproductive success rather than the opposite. Problem-solving performance correlates positively with reproductive success both at the early stages of breeding (i.e. number of eggs laid and hatched) and during the nestling rearing period (i.e. number and condition of fledged young). Moreover, solvers seem to provision their young at a higher rate than non-solvers, suggesting that solvers exploit their breeding habitat more efficiently than non-solvers. Thirdly, I found multiple links between morphological traits, among which feather colouration, and problem-solving and learning performances. Although complex and condition-dependent, these links suggest that cognitive performances may be under sexual selective pressures, since they can be signaled by morphological traits shown to be important in great tit mate choice. Finally, injecting breeding females with an anti-malaria drug did not affect their cognitive performances, but increased their level of activity and exploration when presented with the novel problem-solving task. This suggests that the presence of these blood parasites, which are frequent in passerine populations, could partly explain between-individual and between-population variation in certain behavioural traits in natural populations, as previously described in many other host-parasite study systems. In summary, my thesis provides the first detailed analysis of the relationship between cognitive performance and reproductive success in a wild bird population. My studies show that this relationship is robust and not confounded by parents’ motivation to provision their young. This problem-solving performance is also correlated with various morphological traits, but not with parasite load. The relationship between cognitive performance and reproductive success might be mediated through habitat exploitation and chick provisioning skills, but requires further investigation.	cognition , cognition , problem-solving , learning , natural selection , reproductive success , provisioning , sexual selection , feather coloration , parasitism , malaria	en	11427.0
982	L’influence du vieillissement normal et pathologique sur le traitement des expressions faciales et du jugement de confiance	To determine whether someone looks trustworthy or not is, throughout our lives, a basic decision in our social interactions. Recent studies have suggested that this type of judgment may be an extension of facial expression judgments, more specifically of anger and happiness judgments (Todorov, 2008). Even though trustworthiness judgments play a great role in our social interactions throughout our lives, little is known about the evolution of this process through aging. However, knowing that older adults are less efficient than younger adults in identifying facial expressions (Ruffman et al., 2008; Calder et al., 2003), one could expect to find differences between young and older adults in the way they judge trustworthiness. This work aimed to explore, for the first time, perceptual processes underlying trustworthiness judgments in a healthy older adult population as well as in a population of fronto-temporal dementia (FTD) patients. Results show that anger, happiness and trustworthiness representations are similar between young and older adults, and they suggest that a relationship does exist between emotional judgments and trustworthiness judgments. Moreover, results show that this relationship persists throughout aging, but that older adults rely more on their representation of anger than younger in adults while judging trustworthiness. Finally, patients with fronto-temporal dementia show different representations of anger, happiness and trustworthiness than that of the controls. Also, for trustworthiness judgments, they rely more on their representation of happiness than controls.

coopération dans un dilemme du prisonnier itératif"	Interpersonally, psychopathy involves a lack of consideration for others that can translate into deception, manipulation, and exploitation. The current thesis investigated the relationship between the psychopathic characteristics of non incarcerated men and the tendency to cooperate while playing an iterative version of the prisoner's dilemma game. A total of 85 men were recruited through advertisements that targeted personality traits corresponding to psychopathic characteristics formulated in a way that was not pejorative. A variety of methods was used to reach participants; 46 were tested in person after they replied to an invitation that appeared in a local journal as well as on bulletin boards close to a university; 39 participated via the Internet after they were recruited through a classified advertising website. Each participant completed a questionnaire including the Levenson Self-Report Psychopathy Scale (Levenson, Kiehl, & Fitzpatrick, 1995) and the Childhood and Adolescent Taxon Scale - Self-Report (Seto, Khattar, Lalumière, & Quinsey, 1997). They also played in a computer simulation of the iterative prisoner's dilemma lasting 90 trials. Both the computer simulation used to test participants in person and the Internet version were designed and programmed specifically for the present thesis. The computer simulation included three strategies often associated with the iterative prisoner's dilemma: tit-for-tat, generous-tit-for-tat, and win/stay-lose/shift. Preliminary analyses showed that participants tested in person and via the Internet did not differ in terms of sociodemographic variables, psychopathic characteristics, social desirability, or responses to the prisoner's dilemma. A standard multiple regression indicated that psychopathic measures could not predict the total number of cooperative choices in the prisoner's dilemma game. However, there was a negative correlation between interpersonal and affective characteristics of psychopathy and cooperation in the first third of the prisoner's dilemma game. Furthermore, participants showing more interpersonal and affective psychopathic characteristics tended to exploit the computer more often by defecting while the computer simulation cooperated. Multilevel analyses were used to explore the contribution of decision-level and individual-level variables to predict the choice to cooperate or to defect on each trial of the game; interactions between these variables were also considered. The results showed that variables at the decision level were generally associated with stronger odds of cooperating than individual-level variables. Among psychopathic measures, only the interpersonal and affective characteristics showed a significant association with the odds of cooperating; interactions with the first choice in the game and the first third of the game were significant. That is, if participants cooperated in the first trial, higher interpersonal and affective psychopathic characteristics were associated with decreased odds of cooperating. Also, during the first 30 trials of the game, participants with higher interpersonal and affective psychopathic characteristics were significantly more likely to defect. The type of strategy used by the computer simulation did not have an influence on the relationship between psychopathic characteristics and a participant's probability to cooperate. However, playing against tit-for-tat was associated with increased odds of cooperating from one trial to the next for all participants. Overall, the results suggest that non incarcerated men with psychopathic characteristics might not systematically choose to defect. Instead, the interpersonal and affective psychopathic characteristics appeared as a tendency to cooperate initially, then rapidly attempt to exploit by defecting, and finally cooperate. This behavioral pattern is discussed as well as the relevance of using the iterative prisoner's dilemma game and multilevel analyses to study interpersonal behavior in psychopaths.	psychopathy , cooperation , prisoner's dilemma , game theory , tit-for-tat , Levenson Self-Report Psychopathy Scale , multilevel analysis	en	11422.0
984	Nouveaux complexes pinces POCOP, NHCCOP, PIMCOP et PIMIOCOP, et complexes cyclométallés de Ni(II) : synthèse, caractérisation et réactivité	This thesis describes the chemistry of Ni (II) pincer and cyclonickelated complexes bearing at least one phosphinite moiety. The content is divided into three parts. A first study concerns the synthesis, the characterization, the mechanism of formation and the reactivity of nickel complexes bearing a ligand POCOP (1,3-(i- Pr2PO)2C6H4). New ligands R-(POCOP) = κP,κC,κP-{Rn-2,6-( R'2PO)2C6H3-n}; Rn = 4-OMe, 4-Me, 4-CO2Me, 3-OMe, 3-CO2Me, 3,5-t-Bu2 ; R' = i-Pr, t-Bu have been synthesized by addition of chlorophosphine in presence of base in a resorcinol or derivatives solution. The synthesis of R-(POCOP)Ni(Br) complexes occurred by reacting the corresponding ligand in presence of base and{NiBr2(NCiPr)}n. This new nickel precursor is synthesized in isobutyronitrile with bromine and metallic nickel powder. It is stable under inert atmosphere and its solubility in polar solvents allowed the study of those complexes in homogenous solution. Mechanism of formation of complexes bearing pincer ligands (PCsp3P) 1,3-(i-Pr2PCH2CH2)2CH2, (POCsp3OP) 1,3-(i-Pr2POCH2)2CH2, (PCsp2P) 1,3-(i-Pr2PCH2)2C6H4, Rn-(POCsp2OP) 1,3-(i- Pr2PO)2C6H4-n via C-H nickelation has been investigated by a method of competition reactions. The nickelation step was determined to be electrophilic. New {Rn-2,6-( R'2PO)2C6H4-n} ligands and corresponding nickel bromine complexes were characterized including linear correlation between 13C NMR chemical shift of ipso carbon (Cipso) and oxidation potential Eox. A new greener methodology for the one pot synthesis of (POCOP)Ni(Cl) from metallic nickel has been developed. Reacting at 75 °C at mixture of resorcinol, chlorodiisopropylphosphine and nickel power gives (POCsp2OP)Ni(Cl) up to 93 %. Reactivity of this complex has been investigated for fluorination and trifluoromethylation of benzyl halides. Synthesis of (POCOP)Ni(F) occurred starting from (POCOP)Ni(X) (X=Br, Cl) with excess of silver fluoride AgF. This complex catalyzes the fluorination of benzyl bromide and can be converted into (POCOP)Ni(CF3) using Ruppert reagent Me3SiCF3. Reaction of (POCOP)Ni(CF3) with benzyl bromide leads to its complete conversion into (POCOP)Ni(Br) and to the unexpected benzylation of the used aromatic solvent. The second part concerns the synthesis of new unsymmetrical complexes bearing imidazolo-phosphine moiety (PIMCOP) 3-[2-(R2P)-C3H2N2]-(R2PO)-C6H3, imidazoliophosphine (PIMIOCOP) 3-[2-(R2P)-3-(CH3)-C3H2N2]-(R2PO)-C6H3] and N-heterocyclique carbene (NHCCOP). (PIMCOP) ligands were synthesized by double deprotonation of 3-hydroxyphenyl-imidazole followed by addition of two equivalents of chlorodiphenylphosphine. Nickelation occured in a similar route as (POCOP)Ni. Methylation of the imidazole moiety of (PIMCOP)Ni(Br) using MeOTf leads the (PIMIOCOP)Ni(Br) complex. The latter can be converted into (NHCCOP)Ni(Br) after addition of tetraethylamonium chloride NEt4Cl. Analogs PiPr2 of those complexes are synthesized replacing ClPPh2 by ClPiPr2. Cationic species [(PIMCOP)Ni(NCCH3)][OTf], [(PIMIOCOP)Ni(NCCH3)][OTf]2 et [(NHCCOP)Ni(NCCH3)][OTf] are obtained reacting their bromo homologue complexes with silver triflate in acetonitrile. Those species are used to catalyze amidine synthesis from benzonitrile with various aliphatic amines. Finally orthonickellated complexes trans-Ni[(ĸ2-P,C-P(OC6H4)-(iPr2)( iPr2P(OC6H5))]Br, and dimeric specie {Ni(μ-Br){κ2-P,C-PiPr2(OC6H4)}}2 have been synthesized and characterized. Phosphinite ligand was synthesized reacting phenol and ClPiPr2 in presence of base. Nickellation occured heating in solution {NiBr2(NCiPr)}n and base. An intermediate trans-[NiBr2{PiPr2(OC6H5)}2] of this reaction has been isolated. Ortho-functionalization of diisopropyl phosphinite can be achieved by reacting dimeric complex with electrophilic species.

985	"L’apport des infirmières au processus de consentement aux soins en milieu pédiatrique
et enjeux éthiques qui en découlent"	This research will address the perception that nurses working in a pediatric setting have of their contribution to the process of consent for care. Data analysis reveals an extension of the more conventional definition: here, the very con-cept of consent is perceived as to include the dimension of a process initiated and continued in dialogue and negotiation. Participants hardly spoke about autonomy but mostly of constantly repeated and renegotiated consent to individual or even routine acts of care. The intent of the nurse is less to obtain the patient’s permission for the caregiver to do his or her job with immunity, in legal terms; it is more to empower the child and his or her parents so as to obtain a collaboration to enable co-management of the disease. Very often, nurses discussed the importance for them of teamwork as the logical way to design their work. It is also logical to extend to parents and children an invitation to partici-pate in the therapeutic team. This is not to say that everything always goes smoothly. The child or the parent may raise opposition. Value conflicts then arise: conflicts and moral distress among nurs-es generated by the confrontation of beliefs and cultural and religious values differ-ent from those the nurse would more easily be comfortable with. But often, the nurse demonstrated a great cultural and religious sensitivity, and even would seek advice from colleagues who could know, more than she, about the value systems that raise questions. We used a set of interpretative initial referents as a conceptual framework that inte-grates concepts from the nursing model of Corbin and Strauss, as well as from the symbolic interactionism perspective.

986	L’accès et le partage des avantages des savoirs traditionnels en Amérique latine : comment les droits de propriété intellectuelle peuvent empêcher la biopiraterie	This thesis examines the legal protection of traditional knowledge against biopiracy perpetrated by some pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. Despite the ongoing debate on this topic, since the signature of the Convention on Biological Diversity, traditional knowledge rests largely unprotected. The purpose of the thesis is to analyse mechanisms capable of protecting traditional knowledge associated with biodiversity of interest to the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries. Using intellectual property rights found in international law and in certain domestic legislations, the thesis evaluates these initiatives according to their efficiency leading to a recommendation as to the most appropriate legal tools for countries which lack legislation on the topic. The thesis also considers how the best practices identified could be incorporated into the international legal framework. The thesis presents an analysis of the Brazilian, Costa Rican and Peruvian legislation, as well as international legal instruments such as the Convention on Biological Diversity/Nagoya Protocol and the World Intellectual Property Organization’s Intergovernmental Committee on Intellectual Property and Genetic Resources, Traditional Knowledge and Folklore. The analysis points to a number of mechanisms found in national legislation which would benefit countries without legal protection for traditional knowledge. Also these same mechanisms could be very useful in updating and reinforcing international treaties. Despite these innovative national initiatives, the thesis concludes that the World Trade Organization’s Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights remains the most interesting forum for binding and effective protective measures against biopiracy. Inspired by constructivist theoretical fundamentals, this thesis demonstrates that countries of the South – biodiversity and traditional knowledge rich – can lead the development of international legislation for the protection of traditional knowledge which better meets the needs of traditional knowledge holders.

987	Application et efficacité d'une thérapie basée sur les inférences auprès d'une population d'accumulateurs compulsifs: une étude de cas clinique	Studies shows that there is about 4% hoarders in the population (Samuels et al., 2008). Consequences on their lives are high, hoarding could lead to break up, loss of jobs and mental and physical health issues (Frost et al., 2000; Frost et Gross, 1993; Frost et Hartl, 1996; Tolin, Frost, Steketee, Gray et Fitch, 2008). Treatments have been tried on hoarders, including a special design of cognitive behavioral therapy. Unfortunately, treatments success are low, hoarders seemed refractary to treatment (Steketee, Frost, Tolin, Rasmussen, Brown, 2010). It’s what led Kieron O’Connor to try to adapt his cognitive approach, the inference based therapy, to hoarders.   The goal of this project is to evaluate the faisability of an inference based therapy with hoarders. Nine people who received an inference based therapy for hoarding between 2003 and 2014 at the Centre de Recherche de l’Institut Universitaire en Santé Mentale de Montréal were evaluate. Two of them were studied in depth in clinical case studies. We found a clinically significant decrease at 66% of the sample (n=9). Four of them were sub clinical and one of them had light symptoms of hoarding on the Y-BOCS at the end of therapy. Fifty-six percent had a clinically significant decrease of their depressive symptoms and 33% of their anxious symptoms. An effect size of 0,8 for the Y-BOCS, 0,3 for the BDI and of 0,2 for the BAI were found.	Hoarding , Inference based therapy , Decluttering , Hoarders , Clinical Psychology	en	11376.0
988	La formine Diaphanous est essentielle pour l’organisation et la maturation de l’anneau contractile pendant la cytokinèse	Cytokinesis is the intricate process by which eukaryotic cells divide in two. It involves the coordination of many components in order to avoid the formation potentially cancerous cells. Initially, a Rho GTPase- and actomyosin-dependent contractile ring (CR) drives constriction at the cell equator until a stable actin-independent midbody ring (MR) forms and ultimately guides the separation of the two sister cells. Diaphanous (Dia), is a Rho-dependent formin that nucleates unbranched actin filaments, localises to the cleavage furrow and is required for cytokinesis. We have examined the role of Dia during cytokinesis by time lapse video microscopy of Drosophila S2 cells expressing markers tagged with fluorescent proteins (FPs). A functional Dia-FP was recruited to the CR independently of actin and stayed in the nascent MR, but was absent from the mature MR. The timing of its disappearance coincided with the transition of the MR to an actin-independent structure. RNAi-mediated depletion of Dia slowed furrow ingression, enhanced furrow oscillations and, in 70% of the failures, prevented furrow completion, consistent with a role for Dia in CR organization. The F-actin probe, LifeAct-FP, revealed a decrease in F-actin in Dia-depleted cells specifically at the CR while Anillin-FP and Myosin-FP were aberrantly recruited in punctate structures. Our findings are consistent with a model in which Dia nucleates actin filaments at the CR to maintain the dynamic organization of the actin-dependent CR and that the regulated loss of Dia from the nascent MR guides the formation of the stable, actin-independent MR.

989	Les valeurs des ergothérapeutes : résultats quantitatifs d’une étude exploratoire	Recent interest for the values in occupational therapy and of occupational therapists can be observed in the literature, because such values are at the heart of professional identity. Yet, studies have reported that many occupational therapists have an ambiguous professional identity and important diversity exists in academic publications regarding these values. This study aimed at determining the importance that is granted by occupational therapists to the values of occupational therapy and the values reported by occupational therapists in the literature. We wanted to verify associations between the importance granted to these values, as well as a) the number of years of professional experience and b) the fact of having undertaken training in ethics. Finally, our study also had as an objective to examine if the importance granted to specific values differed depending on the university or the professional training. A survey containing socio- demographic questions and ratings of 60 values was completed by 26 occupational therapists trained and working in Quebec. Spearman correlations, a Kruskal- Wallis test and a Mann-Whitney test were conducted. The values considered the most important by the largest and smallest number of participants were identified. Statistically significant associations were observed between the importance granted to certain values and the number of years of professional experience, having had training in ethics, and the University where this training was obtained. This exploratory study has permitted us to identify tendencies that deserve to be confirmed by a larger scale study. Our conclusions are innovative, because this is the first study reporting such associations.	occupational therapy , values , ethics , professional identity , mixed methods , axiology	en	11335.0
990	La production culturelle à l'ère de la convergence au Québec : analyse de la circulation d'Occupation Double de Quebecor	This thesis is devoted to cultural production in the context of convergence in Quebec. In the first chapter, I demonstrate how different elements have come to shape the contemporary cultural production in Quebec and how media convergence may influence the production and publication of cultural texts. I also expose the foundations of an approach of circulation through which I propose to construct theoretically the subject of my study. The second chapter is devoted to the methodological approach that led to my research. I first presented the field of analysis, the reality TV Occupation Double, as an intertextual phenomenon which I study the various configurations across the main platforms of Quebecor. I continue by describing the corpus of texts under study and the main parameters of analysis inspired by the theory of circulation and the chosen intertextual method. The third chapter reveals the results of analysis, with two media channels which allowed me to observe the possibilities of emergence of characters built around the contestants in reality TV Occupation Double. I initiate a subsequent line of thought on the creation of zones of intimacy performed by these characters.

991	Enjeux de la lecture institutionnelle de scénarios de longs métrages de fiction au Québec	Our purpose in this study is to focus on the specific phenomenon of screenplay reading in Quebec institutional context. We’ll analyze a corpus of one hundred seventy two screenplay reading reports for feature fiction films, written between 1972 and 2004. There is, to our knowledge, no specific study on reading reports texts. At first, we’ll situate function and place of the scenario in Quebec fiction film production history, between acceptance and rejection. Then, we will look at how scenarios are read: by whom, how, under what conditions and with what objectives. Finally, using a grounded theory analysis, we will determine, based on the commentaries founded in the reading reports texts, five entities from which the reader settled his judgment: the screenwriter, the screenplay, the reader himself, the film forthcoming and the expected viewer we’ll call fictitious viewer. We’ll conclude that the screenplay reader is a mediator between a text and its author on one hand, and a forthcoming movie with his fictitious viewer on the other hand. This mediation is the convergence center of different expectations, those of the readers, authors, producers and institutions.

992	A Synergistic Approach to Human Rights and Public Health Ethics: Effective or a Source of Conflict?	Concerns over the growing disparities in health and wealth between members of society incited Stephanie Nixon and Lisa Forman, in their 2008 article Exploring synergies between human rights and public health ethics: A whole greater than the sum of its parts, to propose that the principles of human rights and public health ethics should be used in combination to develop norms for health action. This commentary reflects on the benefits as well as the difficulties that could arise from taking such an approach.	public health , ethics , human rights	en	11330.0
993	An Analysis of Laypeople’s Beliefs Regarding the Origins of Their Worst Nightmare	Nightmares, usually defined as disturbing dreams that awaken the sleeper, are common in the general population. While many studies have examined the aetiological and psychological correlates of nightmares, very few have focused on laypeople’s conceptions of the underlying causes of their own nightmares. The first goal of the present study was to address the paucity of findings with regards to this question by investigating laypeople’s causal beliefs about their worst nightmare experience. A secondary goal was to examine whether these beliefs varied as a function of participants’ gender, age of nightmare occurrence, and recurrence of the nightmare itself. Five hundred and eighty-three adult participants were surveyed with a sleep and dream questionnaire that included an item asking participants to detail the factors they believed were at the origin of their worst nightmare. Responses were categorized according to a coding protocol. The results showed that : 1) The three most frequently reported categories for explaining the occurrence of people’s worst nightmare were interpersonal relationships, attributions of unknown or nonexistent causality, and mediums of entertainment; 2) Women were more likely than men to attribute their worst nightmare to factors related to interpersonal relationships; 3) Some attributions for people’s worst nightmares varied depending on whether the worst nightmare had occurred during childhood, adolescence, or adulthood; and 4) Worst nightmares that were recurrent in nature were more likely to be attributed to categories pertaining to specific phobias and negative emotions than non-recurrent worst nightmares. Interestingly, many of the lay beliefs endorsed in the present study were in line with empirical and theoretical studies on the causes of nightmares and also often paralleled waking preoccupations and pastimes that have been found to differ as a function of gender and stages of human development (i.e., infancy, adolescence, and adulthood).

994	The Gaia Commission: Climate Change and Moral Responsibility	This short story is set in the future. In it, Francis, a retired professor of bioethics, is scheduled to appear before the Gaia Commission to account for his carbon emissions. Because his carbon emissions contributed to climate change, which harmed people and destroyed ecosystems, he is charged with recklessness, negligence, and indifference. He seems to have lived a modest and responsible life, except for the carbon emissions that he generated by flying long distances to attend ethics conferences and to give lectures. The narrator of the story is assigned to defend Francis before the Gaia Commission, so he contacts Francis to learn more about the case and to prepare a defense. The two of them examine Francis’ conduct and thinking. This fictional account raises ethical issues for all of us who have high carbon footprints, but especially for those of us who work in bioethics.	responsabilité morale , réactivité , climate change , carbon emissions , air travel , bioethics , moral responsibility , responsiveness	en	11310.0
995	Caractérisation des processus moléculaires impliqués dans l’activation de la protéine IKKbeta par l'angiotensine II et son rôle dans la réponse phénotypique des CMLV	The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays an essential role in the homeostatic control of arterial pressure through its influence on the vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) contraction-relaxation cycle. Nevertheless, activation of the AT1 receptor by angiotensin II (Ang II) is also involved in VSMC inflammation and hypertrophy. The latter are two processes related to arterial remodeling which is the culprit of some cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension and atherosclerosis. These diseases are the leading cause of natural death in America and the treatments available to date are not optimum because they target only some and not all risk factors associated to it. Thus, determination of the intracellular effectors involved in these deleterious signaling pathways is needed to identify new therapeutic targets.  Ang II-induced inflammation in VSMC is under the control of the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB). However, the molecular mechanisms coupling the AT1 receptor to its activation are not well characterized. The study addressing this issue demonstrates in vitro that the activation of NF-kB is dependent of the activation of IκB kinase β (IKKβ) in VSMC. This kinase is regulated by two independents, but complementary signaling pathways to insure its vigorous and sustained activation. One of them is an early event that relies on second messengers and two novel effectors of the AT1 receptor, the E3 ligase TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and the IKK kinase transforming growth factor-beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1). The other pathway is delayed and relies on the- mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1/2 (MEK1/2) - extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) - ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) axis. Moreover, inhibition of both pathways completely abolishes the Ang II-induced inflammatory response in VSMC which indicates that they are the only one implicated. Thus, inhibition of IKKβ would be possibly sufficient to compromise the inflammation implicated in the development of vascular remodeling. One of the innovative discoveries that has emerged from this latest study is that the E3 ligase TRAF6 is a G protein-coupled receptors effector responsible for the formation of a new type of second messengers described as free poly-ubiquitin chains. Regarding the Ang II-induced hypertrophic response, the molecular mediators involved in protein synthesis are also poorly defined. However, it has been shown that IKKβ has the ability to control the initiation of translation in response to tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) by its capacity to phosphorylate the protein Tuberous sclerosis 1 (TSC1) and then to activate the mammalian target of rapamycin complex (mTORC1) in cancer cells. Therefore, some in vitro experiments have been conducted in VSMC to determine whether IKKβ also contributes to this phenomenon in response to Ang II. Indeed, in VSMC exposed to Ang II, IKKβ has the ability to induce the phosphorylation of TSC1 and the activation of mTORC1 as well as its downstream effectors S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) and translational regulators eukaryotic  translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein (4E-BP1), proteins related directly to hypertrophy. Furthermore, Ang II-induced protein synthesis in VSMC is drastically reduced following a decrease in the expression of IKKβ and following the overexpression of a mutant of TSC1 in which the consensus site of IKKβ has been modified.  Thus, IKKβ acts upstream of two processes involved in the development of cardiovascular diseases related to vascular remodeling in response to Ang II in vitro. In addition, most of their risk factors converge to the activation of IKKβ making it an attractive therapeutic target. Moreover, this kinase is a protein of interest for the translational research, since the administration of an IKKβ inhibitor to rats reduces not only the Ang II-induced protein synthesis in the aorta and mesenteric arteries, but also the synthesis of the pro-inflammatory protein VCAM -1.

996	Entre désincarnation et réincarnation : la poétique du corps dans le récit d'un soi anorexique suivi de Carnet d'une désincarnée	My research questions the relation between anorexia and writing, omnipotent in literature, but which the question of self-writing is still really obscure; the potential of reincarnation of the ascetic individual through writing being barely tackled. Amélie Nothomb (Biographie de la faim) and Geneviève Brisac (Petite) have been both remembering themselves, through autobiographical novels, their anorexic past through an ascetic poetic in itself. Analysing this textual performativity, as well as writing process such as self-mockery and narrative detachment solicited by these authors, my essay observes that these poetical features lead altogether to an independent corporeal reincarnation of the anorexic body into literary work, and therefore, draw a new vision on the past sufferings. Taking the form of a fragmented text sealed by an autofictionnal pact, Carnet d’une désincarnée (Disembodied’s Diary) experiment the reminiscence of my adolescence marked by anorexia. In this way, each fragment recall, using the pronoun « I » as talking to myself, an isolated situation of a routine in a perpetual battle with the self, battle which the unique goal is disembodiment. Further to this disembodiment, the objective of my project was to reincarnate myself with words through the production of a diary made out of flesh and bones. In between fiction and reality, Carnet d’une désincarnée is exploring the possibility of creating a performative text that projected the emaciation of anorexia, becoming a barebonned but alive body in itself.	autofiction , Amélie Nothomb , Geneviève Brisac , anorexia , asceticism , autobiographical novel , writing size zero , performativity , self-mockery , narrative detachment	en	11295.0
997	Acute inactivation of the contralesional hemisphere for longer durations improves recovery after cortical injury	With the introduction of non-invasive brain stimulation methods aimed at modulating the excitability of cortical areas after stroke, many groups are intensively investigating the effects of inhibition of the contralesional hemisphere on functional recovery. Although the reported results of these studies are very promising, limitations of enrolling acute stroke patients as well as technical difficult of establishing continuous inhibition protocols have left several open ended questions regarding the treatment parameters and patient selection. For example, the efficacy of inhibition treatment in acute setting after stroke and the effect of treatment duration are two questions that are virtually unexplored. Therefore, in the laboratory of Prof. Numa Dancause, we took advantage of a well established rodent model of cortical ischemic lesion to gain direct and objective insight about the importance of contralesional inactivation on motor recovery of the paretic limb. Using an Endothelin-1 rodent model of ischemic cortical lesion, we pharmacologically inactivated the contralesional hemisphere with a GABA agonist (Muscimol). By doing so we were interested in the effect of early treatment when contralesional inactivation is initiated rapidly after the lesion. Early after induction of cortical ischemic lesion, the contralesional hemisphere was inactivated with continuous infusion of the Muscimol for 3, 7 or 14 days in three different groups of animals. In a fourth group, Muscimol was infused at slower rate for 14 days to provide additional insights on the relation between the effects of inactivation on the non-paretic forelimb behavior and the recovery of the paretic forelimb. We included a group of animals with spontaneous recovery that received no inactivation after lesion.  Our results indicated that increasing inactivation duration (from 3 to 14 days) accelerated the recovery of grasping function. Both groups with 14 days of inactivation had similar recovery profiles and performed better than animals that spontaneously recovered. In fact, the duration of inactivation, not the intensity, correlated with the better functional outcomes.  Our results support early contralesional inactivation to improve recovery of the paretic forelimb after cortical lesion. Moreover, based on our results, the duration of inactivation is the most important factor to correlate with the functional outcomes. Therefore, by providing precise temporal and behavioral evidence, our results provide a window of opportunity for the researchers in which the current gap in our understanding of the clinical efficacy of contralesional inhibition in acute phase after stroke can be approached with more confidence.

998	Evidence for a reference frame transformation of vestibular contributions to voluntary reaching movements	Vestibular signals provide self-motion estimates that contribute to the planning and execution of voluntary reaching movements during body motion. However, because the vestibular sensors are fixed in the head whereas the arm is fixed to the trunk vestibular signals must be transformed from a head-centered to a body-centered reference frame to contribute appropriately to limb motor control. The first goal of the current work was to investigate the evidence for such a transformation. To do so we used galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) to selectively activate vestibular afferents and simulate rotation about a fixed roughly naso-occipital axis as human subjects performed reaching movements with the head in different orientations. If vestibular signals that contribute to reaching are transformed to body-centered coordinates, then with the head upright GVS should simulate mainly tilt about an earth-horizontal axis (roll), whereas with the head pitched forward the same stimulus should simulate rotation about an earth-vertical axis (yaw). We therefore predicted that GVS should perturb horizontal-plane reach trajectories in a head-orientation dependent manner. Our results demonstrate that vestibular signals which contribute to reaching are indeed transformed to a body-centered reference frame. The second goal of this work was to explore the mechanisms that use these transformed vestibular signals. By comparing the effect of GVS applied during versus prior to reaching we also provide evidence that transformed vestibular signals contribute to distinct compensation mechanisms for body motion during reach planning versus execution.

999	Facteurs socioéconomiques associés à l’usage des médicaments psychotropes chez les hommes et les femmes âgés de 65 à 74 ans vivant dans la communauté : l’étude internationale sur la mobilité des personnes âgées (IMIAS)	Study’s Objective: to estimate the association between socioeconomic position and use of psychotropic drugs in five diverse populations with 65-74 years of age. Method: The study sample was composed by 1,995 persons from the 2012 baseline data of the International Mobility in Aging Study (IMIAS) with 401 participants from Saint-Hyacinthe (Quebec), 398 from Kingston (Ontario), 394 elderly from Tirana (Albania), 400 from Manizales (Colombia) and 402 from Natal (Brazil). All psychotropic drugs consumed during the last 15 days were identified during a home visit and coded according to the ATC classification. Psychotropic medication included anxiolytics, sedatives and hypnotics (ASH), antidepressants (ADP) and analgesics/anti-epileptic/AntiParkinson (AEP). The associations between the prevalence in the consumption of psychotropic medications and education, income and occupation were estimated with prevalence ratios (PR) obtained by fitting a Poisson regression and using Andersen and Newman’s behavioral model for use of health services and controlling for needs (chronic medical conditions and depression), predisposing factors (age and sex) and  facilitating factors (using the study site as proxy for health system and environmental facilitating factors). Results: older people living in Canadian sites consumed more psychotropic medications than those outside of Canada, older people in Manizales people consumed less ASH and the elderly of Albania did not consume ADP. Socioeconomic inequalities varied by site. In Canadian sites, low socioeconomic position was associated with more consumption of psychotropic medication: in particular, those with low education consumed plus des antidepresseurs and those with low income consumed more analgesics.  In the Latin American research sites, the opposite patttern emerged, since those with higher education and higher income consumed more antidepresseurs and those with manual occupations consumed more analgesics. In Tirana (Albania), there was no consumption of antidepressive medication, but consumption of ASH was higher in those with lower income. Final multivariate analyses hid these across sites differences that are revealed in specific analyses through Canada, Latin America and Albania. Conclusion: There are socioéconomic inequalities related to the consumption of psychotropic drugs in the elderly population. These inequalities varied by site. Use of psychotropic medication was more frequent among the less educated and poorer people in Canada while the opposite was true in the Latin America sites. Albania was caracterized by the absence of antidepressant medication and a higher use of anxyiolitics in the lower income groups.	Socioeconomic , factors , psychotropic , drugs , elderly	en	11262.0
1000	Interventions infirmières en regard du phénomène de l’automutilation en milieu pédopsychiatrique : étude qualitative exploratoire	Nurses in the field of child psychiatry are familiar with the phenomenon of self-harm among adolescents because, when the situation arises, they are often called upon to intervene. However, sometimes misunderstandings, misperceptions and negatives attitudes in regard to self-harm may impair their ability to work with the patients involved.  This study seeks to explore self-harm from the standpoint of nurses in child psychiatry, describe recommended nursing interventions and outline organizational-context factors that may affect the way these interventions are executed.   An exploratory qualitative research approach was adopted, and several data-gathering methods were used, including interviews with participants and a period of observation in the unit in which the study was conducted. Analysis of the verbatim records in accordance with the procedure developed by Tesch (1990) elicited seven categories of nursing interventions: helping relationships, guidance, evaluation, safety, teaching, emotions and perceptions of self-harm, and prevention of social contamination. Three categories of factors that influence these interventions also emerged: interpersonal team work, nurses’ duties in child psychiatry, and the organizational culture in which members of the care team operate.   The results of this study will help nurses better understand adolescent self-harm. The study further suggests possible approaches that might help nurses in child psychiatry improve their interventions. The findings may also make it possible for the management of institutions to bring about changes, particularly in terms of work organization and training for nurses in the field.	étude qualitative , self-mutilation , self-harm , self-injurious behaviors , psychiatry , nursing interventions , organizational context factors , adolescents , qualitative study	en	11258.0
1001	Genomic architecture of sickle cell disease clinical variation in children from West Africa : a case-control study design	Background: Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is an important public health issue, particularly in Africa. Phenotypic heterogeneity of SCD is problematic for follow-up and treatment of patients. Little is known about the underlying genomic architecture responsible for this variation.  Rationale: Understanding the genetic contribution to the inter-patient variability will help in identifying patients at risk of developing more severe clinical outcomes, as well as help guide future developments for treatment options. Objectives: To characterize genome-wide gene expression patterns associated with SCD clinical severities and to identify genetic regulators of this variation. More specifically, our objectives were to associate gene expression profiles with SCD severity, identify transciptional biomarkers, characterise the genetic control of gene expression variation, and propose drug targets.  Methods: A case-control population of 250 SCD patients and 61 unaffected siblings from the National SCD Center in Benin were recruited. Genome-wide gene expression profiles and genotypic data were generated. Results: Genome-wide gene expression patterns associated with SCD clinical variation were enriched in B-lymphocyte development, platelet activation, stress, inflammation and cell proliferation pathways. Transcriptional biomarkers that can discriminate SCD patients with respect to clinical severities were identified. Hundreds of genetic regulators were significantly associated with gene expression variation and potential drug targets are suggested. Conclusion: This work improves our understanding of the biological basis of SCD clinical variation and has the potential to guide development of targeted treatments for SCD patients.	eSNP , Expression , Sickle cell disease , Genomics , eSNP , Transcriptomics , Biomarkers , Drug repurposing , Sub-saharan Africa	en	11255.0
1002	Transforaminal versus intra-articular facet steroid injections for the treatment of cervical radiculopathy : a randomized, double-blinded, controlled study	Transforaminal corticosteroid injections can be performed in the management of cervical radiculopathy but carry the risk of catastrophic complications. This study compares the efficacy of transforaminal and facet corticosteroid injections at 4 weeks post treatment. We randomly assigned 56 subjects to receive CT-guided transforaminal (15 men, 13 women; mean age 52 years; range 28 – 72 years) or facet (8 men, 20 women; mean 44 years; range 26 – 60 years) injections. The primary outcome was pain severity rated on a visual analog scale (0-100). Secondary outcome measures were the Neck Disability Index and the Medication Quantitative Scale.  In the intention-to-treat and as-treated analyses, for a mean baseline score, facet injections demonstrated a significant pain score reduction of 45.3% (95%CI: 21.4; 69.2) and 37.0% (95%CI: 9.2; 64.7), while transforaminal injections showed nonsignificant pain score reduction of 9.8% (95%CI: +11.5; 31.2) and 17.8% (95%CI: +6.6; 42.2). While facet injections demonstrated an improvement in Neck Disability Index score of [24.3% (95%CI: +2.9; 51.5); 20.7% (95%CI: +6.2; 47.6),] as opposed to transforaminal injections [9.6% (95%CI: +15.2; 34.4); 12.8% (95%CI: +11.2; 36.7)], the results did not reach statistical significance. Noninferiority of facet to transforaminal injections was demonstrated for baseline pain score ≤ 60, while noninferiority analysis was inconclusive for baseline pain score ≥ 80 and for the Neck Disability Index score. Neither intervention showed a significant medication intake score reduction over time. Facet injections are effective for the treatment of cervical radiculopathy and represent a valid and safer alternative to transforaminal injections.

1003	Influence of Weapon Types on the Patterns and Outcomes of Violent Encounters	In collaboration with the Service de police de la Ville de Montréal (SPVM), this study aims to improve the knowledge about the structuring effect of firearms on criminal violence. This study first identifies factors associated with firearms use in violent crimes and second, estimates the risk of fatal and non-fatal injuries associated with gun use. Data used in the present study come from the Module d’information policière (MIP), for the period of 2011 to 2012. Data were analyzed using a two-step strategy. First, logistic regressions were conducted to pinpoint factors associated with firearm use in violent crime. Second, estimates of the average treatment effect were computed using the propensity score matching (PSM) technique. PSM is an innovative statistical strategy that attempts to reproduce conditions of controlled experiments when cases were not randomized in the first place. In general, results show that firearms are more frequently used in gang-related crimes where individuals attack relatively non-vulnerable targets (young males accompanied by other persons). Despite these characteristics, firearm use increases the risk of fatal injuries in violent altercations, but lessens the risk of non-fatal injuries, among other things, in the case of robberies. Findings establish that firearms facilitate the perpetration of violent crimes, even in the hands of the strongest offenders. Results also suggest that other weapons are poor substitutes for firearms. Although the findings cannot fully corroborate firearms as the great equalizer, these weapons do confer several advantages to their user(s). Firearms also appear to be a sufficient threat in the case of robberies, where additional injuries are not necessary to successfully commit the crime.

1004	Proposition d'une perspective disciplinaire pour l'exploration de facteurs organisationnels influençant la violence horizontale chez les infirmières	Summary An integrative and critical analysis of the last decade’s studies regarding horizontal violence (HV) among staff nurses and their underlying theoretical frameworks was conducted.  Following this analysis, it has become clear that HV among nurses should be prevented with interventions held within the work environment because of its important prevalence, the variety of negative actions and their multiple consequences for the nurses, the patients and the healthcare organization.  However, a lack of knowledge regarding organizational factors of influence as well as the absence of an optimal theoretical framework to explore them, remain.  This constitutes an obstacle to the development of effective prevention strategies in the health establishments.  Therefore, a theoretical framework that allows the comprehension and contribution of those factors should be made available to researchers and nursing managers in order to orient the choice of prevention strategies to deploy.  A nursing framework would ensure a disciplinary coherence for its users and the transfer of knowledge in the healthcare environments.  The «Culture Care Diversity and Universality theory» elaborated by Leininger (1988; 2001; 2006; 2010) along with the Sunrise Model (Leininger, 2001) are proposed and privileged as a disciplinary perspective for the exploration of organizational factors that influence horizontal violence among staff nurses.

1006	Présentation personnalisée des informations environnementales	We present our work in this thesis in the field of information visualization. We dealt with the problem of the generation of weather forecasts reports. Given the huge amount of information produced by Environment Canada and a wide variety of users, it must generate a customized visualization that meets their needs and preferences.  We developed MeteoVis, a weather report generator. Given that we have little information on the user profile, we relied on the choices made by similar users to calculate the needs and preferences of a user.  We use unsupervised machine learning techniques to group similar users . We compute a degree of similarity of user profiles in the same cluster to determine the needs and preferences.  We conducted, with the help of external users experiments for evaluating and comparing our tool with the current site of Environment Canada. The evaluation results show that the visualizations generated by MeteoVis are significantly better than the current bulletins prepared by EC.

1007	Disclosure of Child Sexual Abuse : Impact of Interviewers’ Attitudes & Children's Collaboration during Forensic Interviews	Child Sexual Abuse (CSA) is a complex subject to investigate and an alleged victim’s disclosure is crucial as it may be the only substantial evidence for investigators to establish their case.  However, even when CSA is revealed, children may be reluctant to reveal personal and often embarrassing details to a stranger during a forensic interview.  As it is not always possible to obtain consent to film and it is relatively hard to measure children’s and interviewers’ non-verbal attitudes during forensic interviews, this doctoral dissertation was innovative in its creation of verbal scales of such attitudes.  In order to determine whether interviewers’ attitudes correlates with children’s collaboration during forensic interviews, 90 children ranging from 4 to 13 years of age were analysed. Interviews were audio taped, transcribed and then codified using verbal subscales of interviewers’ supportive and non-supportive attitudes as well as children's cooperative and reluctant attitudes. The proportion of details provided by the children in regards to the SA was calculated.      To determine if differences exist between National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Protocol and Non-Protocol interviews, a MANCOVA was conducted controlling for children’s age and the proportion of open-ended questions. As expected Protocol interviews obtained significantly more details from open-ended prompts than Non-Protocol interviews. However, it showed no differences according to children’s and interviewer’s attitudes. To find the variable that has the greatest impact on the quantity of detail disclosed by children, a hierarchical multiple regression analysis was conducted. After controlling for children’s age, NICHD Protocol and proportion of open-ended questions which are known to increase the quantity of details disclosed; children’s reluctance and interviewers’ non-supportive attitudes contributed to an additional 28% of the variance, when the total variance explained by the model as a whole was 58%.   Moreover, to determine whether children’s collaboration and interviewers’ attitudes vary according to the child’s age-group a MANOVA was conducted. It revealed that interviewers behaved similarly irrespective of children’s age, even though younger children were generally more reluctant and cooperated significantly less than pre-adolescents.  Finally, to determine which variables regarding child and SA characteristics, as well as interviewers’ attitudes, will have a greater chance at predicting children’s collaboration, a hierarchical multiple regression analysis was conducted. It showed that an interviewer’s support was a stronger correlating variable than children’s and SA characteristics in predicting children’s collaboration.            While we believe that the development of the NICHD Protocol has enabled considerable progress in the way children are interviewed leading to more details obtained from free recall strategies, and thus leading to more credible testimonies.  However, adherence to the Protocol is simply not sufficient to convince young reluctant children to talk in details about the SA to a stranger.  This dissertation results have great scientific value as it enhances the theoretical underpinnings of the attitudes expressed by both the child and the interviewer during forensic interviews.  Although, interviewers in this study did offer more support to reluctant children, regardless of their age, researchers need to find better ways to deal with young children’s reluctance as well as encourage practitioners to minimize non-supportive attitudes.	non-soutien , child sexual abuse , forensic interviews , NICHD protocol , age , reluctance , support , non-support , cooperation , sexual abuse characteristics , child characteristics	en	11196.0
1008	Le Sionisme chrétien contemporain aux États-Unis, entre religion et politique	This doctoral thesis deals with Christian Zionism, and more precisely with pastor John Hagee, the members of his organization (Christians United For Israel - CUFI) and his assembly, Cornerstone Church. This movement gathers fundamentalist Evangelicals who literally obey Genesis 12: 3, which says it is necessary to bless Israel to be blessed in return. They believe that the return of the Jews to the Holy Land, the creation of the State of Israel (1948) and the conquest of Jerusalem (1967) are forewarning signs of the Second coming of Jesus Christ confirming the prophecies from the New Testament and the Old Testament. CUFI has one message for the nation of America, and also for humanity. Their message must be communicated in defense of the State of Israel and the Jews. This explains how the Christian Zionist movement, which is not a recent one, aims for reaching its ultimate objective of national influence by constantly changing its techniques along with employing progressive strategies. The question deals with the relationship between religion and politics. The research follows the progression of Hagee and his groups from the religious sphere to political engagement, and the factors that are the origins of this passage. We will see how these Christians, who are influenced by a background that is political, millenarist and prophetic, become religious actors in the political arena. Moreover, we concentrated on pro-Israel Evangelical literature, in addition to making a field study along with observations and interviews. During the field trips, the individual, as a pro-Israel Evangelical, his own experience, and his relation to religion and Israel was our focus. Finally, this thesis provides an interdisciplinary perspective between religious studies and American studies.

1009	Les déterminants du comportement alimentaire de jeunes hommes gais	Introduction: This study aimed to explore the determinants of food choices amongst young gay men. The secondary objective was to explore gay men’s perception towards heterosexual men’s food choices.  Method: A qualitative method based on picture taking and individual semi-structured interviews was used.  Results: Eleven gay men from 21 to 25 years old and living in apartments in the Montreal area participated in the study. Physical appearance, health and nutrition are very influential factors of their eating behavior. Men in the cohort support the perception that these factors do not influence as strongly heterosexual men’s eating behavior. These men, in general, enjoy cooking, but do not all invest the same amount of time. They are big consumers of food outside home.. Many of them limit their consumption of meat, a food they consider masculine and strongly linked to heterosexual men.  Conclusion: The eating behavior of the young men in this cohort is influenced by many factors that are not usually associated with men, like physical appearance, health and nutrition. They are aware of this dichotomy by comparing themselves with their heterosexual friends.

These functions may be viewed as generalizations of the well-known Chebyshev polynomials. They are related to orthogonal polynomials associated with simple Lie algebras, e.g. the multivariate Jacobi and Macdonald polynomials. They have numerous remarkable properties such as continuous and discrete orthogonality. In particular, it is shown that the $S^s$- and $S^l$-functions characterized by certain parameters are mutually orthogonal with respect to a discrete measure. Their discrete orthogonality allows to deduce two types of Fourier-like discrete transforms for each simple Lie algebra with two different lengths of roots. Similarly to the Chebyshev polynomials, these four families of functions have applications in numerical integration. We obtain in this thesis various cubature formulas, for functions of several variables, arising from $C$-, $S^s$- and $S^l$-functions. We also provide a~complete description of discrete multivariate cosine transforms of types V--VIII involving the Weyl group orbit functions arising from simple Lie algebras $C_n$ and $B_n$, called antisymmetric and symmetric cosine functions. Furthermore, we study four families of multivariate Chebyshev-like orthogonal polynomials introduced via (anti)symmetric cosine functions.

1011	Verbaliser l’indicible : une étude de l’expérience de la «vibe» dans la scène underground-house de Montréal	"This thesis examines the discourses and embodied experiences of participants from the underground electronic house music scene in Montreal. In this empirical study, I aim to provide a twofold contribution to the field of studies on contemporary expressive cultural formations. First, on the methodological standpoint, this research illustrates the scope of the « explicitation » interview—a method of retrospective introspection developed by French researcher Pierre Vermersch (1994)—in assisting informants in the process of putting sensory impressions, emotions, thoughts or actions into words. Combined with a long-term immersive approach in the field, I argue that this innovative method proved to be a rigorous tool, which allowed participants to access and verbalize embodied memories with unprecedented accuracy. Second, this ethnographic study sheds light on new social spaces of solidarity and expression created by middle and upper middle class Quebecers of Haitian origin. The results of this research show, firstly, that the ""vibe""—an idiomatic expression widely used by the househeads to qualify their experience—is a conceptual cornerstone that maintains cohesion between the representations, beliefs and bodily practices of the participants. Secondly, the study demonstrates that this cultural formation stands as a new expression of counter-cultural space, which establishes a critical distance from both the commercialised ""hip hop culture"" as well as the dominant (mainstream) cultural space by promoting a subversive bodily and spiritual experience. This unique site of transmission and communion creates new models of sociability and contributes in an unusual way to the intercultural urban dialogue in Montreal."	immersion , explicitation , danse , vibe , Haitian , spirituality , methodology , reflexivity , methodology , embodiment , music , dance	en	11132.0
1012	La représentation du métro dans le jeu vidéo d'horreur : désorientation, angoisse et terreur	This master thesis studies video games‘ spatiality and the ludic adaptation of real locations. It focuses on one specific location, the subway, and on its representation in the horror genre. The research is structured by three levels of adaptation : systemic, sociohistorical and technological. Based on examples of games compared with the reality of the subway, those three levels of adaptation enable at once an exploration of the impact of the virtual location on the gaming experience and of the external influences on the game design.	video game , horror , spatial conception , production of space , urbanism	en	11131.0
1013	Étude longitudinale des liens prédictifs entre les traits de personnalité et les comportements antisociaux à l’adolescence	The goal of this longitudinal study was to evaluate if personality traits in early adolescence can predict future antisocial behavior, after controlling for initial level of antisocial behavior and the influence of various known risk factors. The sample includes 1036 adolescents from eight high schools in the province of Quebec. The adolescents were evaluated twice, once during the first year of high school (12-13 years old) and once during the second year of high school (14-15 years old). Adolescents filled a self-reported questionnaire. Structural equation models first confirmed that the covariation among different antisocial behaviors can be explained by a latent variable. The results confirmed that adolescents’ personality traits at ages 12 and 13 predict their antisocial behaviors at ages 14 and 15. In accordance with previous studies, Extraversion, Conscientiousness and Emotional Stability predict future antisocial behavior. However, the effect of Agreeableness disappeared once initial level of antisocial behavior was controlled for. Finally, multiple-group structural equation models showed significant gender-specific predictive relations. The results of this study support the relevance of personality traits for both theory of antisocial behavior and clinical practice.	adolescence , personality traits , antisocial behavior , adolescence , predictive relations , risk factors , gender	en	11104.0
1014	La coédition franco-québécoise et ses conséquences sur les oeuvres de fiction publiées en traduction	The copublishing of the translated version of literary books in Quebec and then distributed under a French publishing brand, is a practice used by editors to broaden the outreach of their books. The process of copublishing is carried out through various methods which tend to evolve in an unpredictable way : editors and translators make compromises about the target language in order to reach their cross-Atlantic markets. What is the nature of these compromises? Are they terminological, lexicographical, cultural or merely subjective? How are they perceived by translators and publishers? This essay explores these questions through the study of four cases of literary works copublished by publishers and literary translators from Quebec.  The analysis demonstrates that these compromises, be they cultural or not, have little impact on the quality of French in the copublishing market, which is often in France. But they sometimes create a feeling of cultural dominance on the part of France. This discourse is however nuanced by the type of copublishing practice and the position occupied by translators within the publishing structure. A clearer framework for copublishing practices and a better status for the translator of literary works would contribute to mitigate some of the tensions related to copublishing.

1015	Parenting styles and adjustment in gifted children	The present study examines the psychosocial development of gifted children. Although much evidence exists that gifted children experience problems of adjustment, such as social isolation, depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem, few studies have investigated the family environment of gifted children and its possible links to child psychosocial adjustment. The goal of this study, therefore, was to address these questions by examining the parenting styles, as defined by Baumrind, of parents of gifted children and their potential associations with the adjustment levels of their children. Parenting styles were measured using a self-report questionnaire. The level of adjustment for gifted children, aged 7 to 11 years old, was measured using behavioural and self-concept measures. Giftedness was determined using a standardized intelligence test. Forty-eight gifted children and 52 nongifted children participated in the study. Parents of gifted children reported using a predominantly authoritative parenting style. Mothers, however, reported significantly higher authoritative scores than fathers. Parents reported several gifted children to experience problems with peers, but their teachers did not report this nor did the children themselves. No associations were found between a particular parenting style and the reported presence of peer social problems in gifted children. Mothers’ authoritarian parenting style was significantly associated with lower conduct problem levels, and higher intellectual self-concept levels in gifted children. As for mothers’ authoritative parenting style, a significant relationship was found with higher conduct problem levels in gifted children. Mothers’ permissive parenting style was found to be associated with lower self-concept levels in gifted children. As for the fathers, authoritarian and permissive parenting styles were found to be linked to lower adjustment and self-concept levels in gifted children. Adjustment levels and parenting styles were also compared between gifted and nongifted children. For both groups of children, adjustment levels were in the normal range and the parents reported similar use of the three parenting styles. As for the relationships between parenting styles and adjustment in nongifted children, fathers’ authoritative parenting style was found to be associated with higher child adjustment levels. Mothers’ authoritarian and fathers’ permissive parenting styles were found to be associated with lower self-concept levels in nongifted children. The conclusions of this thesis permit a better understanding of the complexity of the links between parenting styles and the psychosocial adjustment of gifted children.

1016	Méga-événements et nouveaux médias : le journalisme liquide dans le contexte de la Coupe du monde de 2014 et des Jeux olympiques de 2016	This master thesis deals with the representations circulating on the Internet before and during the historical and unexpected popular uprising in Brazil, during the 2013 Confederations Cup. The wave of protests, which triggered a passionate online debate about mega-events, is still an understudied phenomenon. To fill this gap, this research investigates the problem by examining the case of the city of Rio de Janeiro, host of the finals of 2014 World Cup and of 2016 Olympic Games. The study aims to analyze on the representations emerging from news networks in the light of the fast-paced urban transformations and conflicts that currently characterize mega-events in the city. A natural logic analysis of documents published between 2009 and 2013 by four particular types of news sites highlights how social representations reproduced: (1) the government strategy of urban branding and (2) the civil movements strategies to face urban transformations. At the theoretical and methodological levels, the study explores the research path of liquid journalism, inspired by the work of sociologist Zygmunt Bauman, who focused on the cultural, economic and political consequences of globalization. The collected data were analyzed from a critical and theoretical viewpoint. The results were discussed by confronting those obtained by the researchers who we referenced in the literature.	mega-events , host city , journalism , online journalism , urban branding , urban transformations , evictions , Brazil , uprising	en	11084.0
1017	Un criblage ciblant de nouveaux facteurs impliqués dans l’assemblage mitotique des chromosomes dans le nématode C. elegans	Cell division is a fundamental process that continuously happens in all living organisms. In each cell division, genetic material of the parent cell duplicates and segregates to produce genetically identical daughter cells in a process called mitosis. Cells need to condense their genetic material to be able to partition them equally. Any subtle defects, either timing or compaction level, could lead to the unequal inheritance of genetic material, a phenomenon that is believed to be the leading cause of cancerous transformation. However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the coordinated changes of higher-order chromosome structure are poorly understood.  In the last two decades, various approaches have identified several conserved factors required for chromosome condensation. To define the roles of known and novel factors in this process, I performed an RNAi based screen using high-resolution live imaging of the C. elegans one-cell embryo. Importantly, using an in vivo approach, I discovered seven novel factors required for mitotic chromosome assembly, including Ribonulceotide reducatase (RNR) and DNA topoisomerase II (topo-II). In this thesis, I report a structural role for topo-II in mitotic chromosome assembly and underlying molecular mechanisms. During chromosome condensation process, topo-II acts independently as a local assembly factor leading to global chromosome axis formation, contradicting models that chromosomes organize around preassembled scaffolds, thus representing a novel pathway for chromosome assembly in C. elegans. Furthermore, I also discovered a non-enzymatic role of RNR in the mitotic chromosome assembly process. During this process, RNR is involved in nucleosome stability, and thereby, it allows higher-order chromatin assembly. In this thesis, I also report preliminary data for other novel factors that I discovered in the RNAi based screen for factors involved in chromosome condensation. Importantly, my analyses revealed that the depletion of several proteins results in distinct chromosome condensation phenotypes, indicating that they function in discrete events during mitotic chromosome assembly. In sum, I conclude that metaphase chromosomes are built by the distinct scaffolding activities of three proteins: DNA topoisomerase II, condensin complexes and centromere proteins. Taken together, these studies provide underlying molecular mechanisms contributing to the mitotic chromosome formation.

1018	Les décisions rendues par les arbitres de griefs dans les cas de sanctions visant des policiers ayant eu des démêlés judiciaires	The purpose of this study focuses on the determination of sanctions to police officers who had legal issues during their period of employment, on the influence of the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms through section 18.2 regarding this determination and on methods used in arbitrations. There are two opposing methods on the subject, the “broad and liberal” and the “strict and literal”. The “broad and liberal” method is derived from the application of article 18.2 of the Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms, which is a quasi-constitutional law and provides an objective analysis of the connection between the employment of the police officer and the penal or criminal offense that he was convicted. As for the “strict and literal” method for determination of the sanction, it comes from the application of the Police Act which is an ordinary law providing special treatment for police officers found guilty of criminal offenses. Indeed, the article 119 of the Police Act has enforced, since its redesign in 2000, the automatic dismissal of police officers convicted of an act or omission that is triable only on indictment and the dismissal imposition for any police officer who is found guilty of an act or omission punishable on summary conviction or by indictment, unless the police officer shows that specific circumstances justify another sanction. The analysis in the context of this research is about the determination of sanctions guiding the decisions made by arbitrators regarding the situation of police officers accused and/or convicted of criminal offenses during employment. To this end, 25 arbitrations and judicial reviews were studied by content analysis using an analysis grid. The analysis of data has been carried out through qualitative analysis.	police officer , criminal offense , connection between employment and criminal offense , article 18.2 Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms , article 119 Police Act	en	11032.0

Étude d’efficacité d’un programme d’entraînement intensif des processus attentionnels chez des jeunes ayant subi un traumatisme craniocérébral"	Attention dysfunctions following traumatic brain injury (TBI) frequently complicate the return to activities of daily living and negatively influence professional and socioacademic reintegration. Yet, clinicians in rehabilitation settings have limited access to cognitive remediation protocols for which efficacy has been demonstrated and that are adapted to French populations. Thus, the aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the intensive attention process training program « Attention! Prêt? On s’enTraine! » (Séguin, Lahaie & Beauchamp, 2012) based on a French adaptation of the « Attention Process Training-I » program (APT-I; Sohlberg & Mateer, 1987). Over five weeks, 17 participants who sustained TBI and demonstrated attention deficits received either the attention process training intervention (n = 8) or homework assistance (n = 9). Following the intervention, the experimental group improved on functions targeted by the « Attention! Prêt? On s’enTraine! » program, specifically, visual scanning, visual selective attention and attentional shifting. They also showed significant transfer gains on related tasks including measures of working memory, inhibition, mental flexibility and visuoconstructive planning. The demonstration of a positive effect of an intensive attention training program on attentional performances after TBI is likely to support and reinforce the development and validation of French cognitive remediation protocols, ultimately leading to improvements in the prognosis for individuals with TBI.

1020	Les négociations des plaidoyers de culpabilité : la pratique des avocats de la défense	This research paper aims to describe and understand the professional practices of criminal lawyers during plea bargaining, a well established phenomenon which is more pervasive than is commonly understood. Our study focuses on interviews of twelve criminal lawyers working at the Montréal courthouse. Our analysis emphasizes different elements related to the case, the defendant or lawyers’ professional considerations that can influence the negotiation process. We also show how those elements can be seen in a different way depending on the lawyer and the specific case they defend. Moreover, our lawyers’ interviews show that there is no uniformity in the way they handle cases, depending on their level of involvement (in the case, in their relationships…).	plea bargaining , guilty plea , sentencing , criminal lawyers , professional practices	en	11016.0
1021	Une activité d'élaboration d'hypothèses pour soutenir le développement du RCI d'étudiantes en sciences infirmières	Teaching and learning clinical reasoning has been a major concern amongst nurse educators for many years. Hypothesis generation is a critical milestone in clinical nursing reasoning which students are still struggling with at the end of their program. In a qualitative exploratory study, we tested a vignette-based activity to provide to the students an opportunity to specifically practice hypotheses generation. The study aimed at documenting nursing student’s capacity to formulate hypotheses during the activity. Seventeen nursing students in the last semester of their program were recruited by convenience and grouped accordingly to their availability to participate. The activity was held four times. Participants were asked to focus on a brief clinical vignette and to build an algorithm that would include 1) their hypotheses regarding the nature of the problem, 2) the essential pieces of information to collect in order to verify each hypothesis, and 3) the way the information was to be found. The combined methods used for data collection were participative observation, videotaping the activity and a written questionnaire immediately after the activity. Data were then classified in matrices in the form of verbatim and notes using clinical nursing reasoning skills described by Fonteyn (1998) as the theoretical framework. Results suggest that the vignette-based activity does stimulate students to formulate hypotheses. It also stimulates sharing and recollection of knowledge amongst students. This type of activity could therefore be useful in promoting the development of clinical reasoning as a complement to other educative activities used in nursing education programs.

1022	Effets de la perfusion pulsatile durant une circulation extra-corporelle	INTRODUCTION : Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) during cardiac surgery leads to postoperative pulmonary complications. The use of pulsatile pressure with an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) could preserve the endothelial function and decrease the occurence of pulmonary problems. MATERIAL AND METHODS : Twelve Landrace-Yorkshire swine were divided into two groups, one group (n=6) received pulsatile perfusion under CPB from an IABP in an internal mode at 80 beats per minute (bpm) and the other (n=6) had a standard CPB of 90 minutes. A third group (n=4) has been used as controls without CPB. The two first groups underwent aortic clamping for 80 minutes with administration of intermittent blood cardioplegia. After 60 minutes of reperfusion following of bypass, swine were sacrificed and pulmonary arteries were harvested. Haemodynamic values were calculated including pulmonary arterial pressures (PAP), mean arterial pressures (mAP), lactate production, blood glucose and cardiac index. Pulmonary arteries were placed in organ chambers and vascular reactivity studies were performed. RESULTS : There was a trend towards lower lactate production with use of pulsatile perfusion after 60 minutes of reperfusion. All other hemodynamics were not significally different in both groups.  Relaxation to bradykinin was greater in pulsatile group while relaxation to acetylcholine did not differ. CONCLUSION : IABP induced pulsatile pressure protect the pulmonary endothelium during CPB. This could be explained by an increase in blood flow through the bronchial arteries or by a decreased release of cytokines or bradykinin which could reduce reperfusion damage.

1023	Étude de la voie HOX-Flt3 dans les leucémies de type pré-B induites par E2A-Pbx1	Introduction: Previous work in the laboratory have established that Hoxa9 accelerated the onset of E2A-PBX1 induced B cell leukaemia. qRT-PCR analysis showed that RNA levels of HOXA9 target Flt3 was 32-fold increased in Hoxa9/E2A-PBX1 compared to E2A-PBX1 leukaemia. It is important to note that aberrant expression of Flt3 is found in both B-ALL and AML. Moreover, constitutive activation of Flt3 is associated with a poor prognosis. We hypothesized that the acceleration of E2A-PBX1 B-ALL by Hoxa9 is caused through increased Flt3 signalling.  Methods and Results: First, to evaluate whether Flt3 signalling is functionally relevant for E2A-PBX1 induced leukaemia, Flt3 expression was analysed by FACS and qRT-PCR. So far, we showed that E2A-PBX1 B-ALL express FLT3 but the receptor was detected on a variable proportion of the cells, ranging from 0.3-28 %. Secondly, we evaluated the leukemic potential of Flt3 positive and negative fractions. Both reinitiate leukaemia around 20 days post-transplantation. Thirdly, a shRNA mediated knockdown strategy for Flt3 has been applied to test the relevance of Flt3 signalling on E2A-PBX1 leukemic cells. To test this, primary leukaemic cells were infected, either with the shRNA anti-Flt3 or the shRNA control, and transplanted into recipient mice.  Unexpectedly, no difference was observed between the two groups of mice. Conclusion and Relevance: Our shFLT3 is not efficient enough on the chosen leukemic cells. Therefore, we propose to apply the same set-up to a less aggressive leukaemia. Moreover, transplanting cells in Flt3-/- KO mice is required to really assess the impact of Flt3 signalling.

1024	Les macrophages d’ascendance européenne et africaine répondent différemment aux infections bactériennes	Previous studies demonstrate that people of African and European ancestry differ in their susceptibility to certain infectious diseases. Differences in infection progression between these populations suggest inter-population variation in the immune response, possibly caused by adaptation to the pathogens of their historical environments. Here, we characterize the immune response of people of African and European ancestry to bacterial infections. Monocyte-derived macrophages from 30 African Americans (Africans) and 31 European Americans (Europeans) were infected with the intracellular pathogens Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella typhimurium for 4 hours and whole genome gene expression of infected and non-infected cells was measured by RNA-sequencing. Macrophage control of bacterial infection at 2, 4 and 24 hours was assessed by culturing infected cell lysate and counting colony-forming units to approximate bacterial survival rate. We found that macrophages derived from Africans presented fewer intracellular bacteria after 4 and 24 hours than Europeans, suggesting that Africans better control intracellular bacterial infections. Concordant with this observation, we identified inter-population differences in cytokine secretion and gene expression that might explain this pattern of increased infection control in Africans. Interestingly, several of those differences indicate that Africains have a stronger pro-inflammatory response than Europeans. We show that several of these genes appear to have been subject to recent selection in the Europeans population alone. We also identify multiple candidate genes that may affect the course of infection in these populations. Overall, our findings suggest that differences in infectious disease progression observed in Africans and in Europeans may be the outcome of natural selection.

1026	La recherche sur le transfert des connaissances en santé publique dans les pays à faible revenu : une synthèse exploratoire	Making use of the knowledge that comes from research has the potential of improving the quality and the offer of services targeted to the population. The integration of this knowledge to the interventions and decision making processes in healthcare is all the more central in countries with low income in which the financial, logistical, and human resources are limited, and in which public health concerns affect an alarming proportion of the population. The current study aims to describe the present state of research on knowledge transfer on public health in low-income countries. In order to do that, we conducted an exploratory synthesis abiding by the systematic method of PRISMA. 28 studies were selected. All in all, these studies evaluate multiple knowledge transfer strategies, of which the most common are training programs, distribution of material, and train the trainer programs. Other strategies are based on the distribution of educational materials, feedback and supervision, implementation of guidelines, etc. The agents of transfer that are implicated are mostly “non specialized” trainers and specialists of health; the potential users are mostly first-line health workers and consumers of services, especially women and young children. Globally, studies report positive results, many of which are significant: an increase in recommended practices, more utilization of essential products, and a better understanding of transferred knowledge. We also note the evaluation of some novel strategies such as artistic performances and playful activities. These strategies have shown encouraging results and are much appreciated by both transfer agents and users. In terms of the research methodology, the majority of studies use qualitative designs and have essentially been published in the last decade. Multiple research instruments are being used, but very few studies report their psychometric properties. In that sense, it is difficult for us to attest to their methodological quality and the results of these studies should therefore be nuanced. We finally note the importance of the health issues being addressed, the presence of novel strategies and the specificity of some conditions of utilization in the context of low-income countries. In conclusion, we propose future directions that could guide new research on the subject.	scoping study , public health , low-income countries , knowledge translation , evidences based practice , effect and process , clinical psychology	en	10929.0
1027	Les stratégies de compréhension lors de lectures à voix haute : accompagnement parental auprès d’enfants de cinq ans	A parent’s role in their child’s reading development is important, and reading to your child is a family literacy practice that is strongly encouraged by society.  This research describes parental support specifically in relation to reading comprehension strategies used between the parent and child while the parent is reading out loud. We observed 10 parents read aloud an alphabet book, a narrative text with an element of suspense, a narrative text without suspense, and a non-fiction text to their five year old child. It turns out that the reading comprehension strategies used by parents differed according to the type of text being read.  The children with the lowest results (letter sound recognition, story recall, and comprehension of vocabulary and syntax) used less comprehension strategies during read alouds than the children with higher results. We also observed support offered by parents of children with lower and higher results.  These two groups of parents differ by the quality and the frequency of their use of reading comprehension strategies. In fact, we noticed that parents who guide their child in using reading comprehension strategies are associated with their children having better results in reading.  Finally, we verified the family literacy practices (time exposed to reading, accessibility of books, family members modelling reading, attitude of parents toward reading, and activities that promote letter sound knowledge/phonemic awareness). Only the family practice of creating activities to further develop letter sound knowledge/phonemic awareness was directly linked to the child’s results.

1028	To Say or not to Say: Dyadic Ambivalence over Emotional Expression and its Associations with Sexual Function, Satisfaction, Depression, Dyadic Adjustment, and Pain in Women with Provoked Vestibulodynia and their Partners	Introduction. Provoked vestibulodynia (PVD) is a highly prevalent and taxing female genital pain condition. Despite the intimate nature of this pain and the fact that affective factors such as anxiety have been shown to modulate its manifestations, no study has yet explored the emotional regulation of couples in which the woman suffers from PVD.  Aim. Ambivalence over Emotional Expression (AEE) is an emotional regulation variable that quantifies the extent to which a person is comfortable with the way s/he expresses emotions. We examined whether the dyadic AEE of couples in which the woman suffers from PVD was differentially associated with their psychological, sexual and relational functioning. Methods. Couples (N = 254) in which the woman suffered from PVD completed the Ambivalence over Emotional Expression Questionnaire. A typology of couples was created: ‘HH’ couples with both partners high on AEE, ‘LL’ couples with both partners low on AEE, and intermediate couples. Dependent measures for both members of the couple were the (i) Global Measure of Sexual Satisfaction Scale, the (ii) Female Sexual Function Index/Global Score of Sexual History Form, the (iii) Beck Depression Inventory II, and the (iv) Revised Dyadic Adjustment Scale. Women also completed the McGill Pain Questionnaire. Results. ‘LL’ couples had the highest scores on sexual satisfaction (p = .04) and function (p = .01), the least depressive symptomatology (p < .01), and the best dyadic adjustment (p = .02).  No difference in pain intensity was found between couples. Conclusions. Findings suggest that, for couples in which the woman suffers from PVD, an emotional regulation that is low in ambivalence in both partners is associated with better psychological, sexual and relational outcomes.

1029	Étude-pilote portant sur une intervention de groupe auprès de femmes souffrant d’hyperphagie boulimique et l’évaluation de ses effets potentiels	This study focuses on a group intervention for binge eating disorder (BED), by measuring its potential effects on the quality of life related to weight, frequency and severity of binge episodes, depressive symptoms, body dissatisfaction and body weight, and documenting the degree of acceptance of the intervention by the participants. Thus, 11 overweight women that met the BED diagnostic criteria were recruited from spring 2012 to winter 2013, in Montreal. The program includes eight weekly sessions based on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy provided by a nutritionist and a psychotherapist. Quality of life related to weight (Impact of Weight on Quality of Life), binge eating frequency (recall of the last seven days), binge eating severity (Binge Eating Scale), depression (Beck Inventory for depression), body dissatisfaction (Body Shape Questionnaire) and body weight were measured before and after the intervention. Then, a questionnaire to assess the acceptance by the participants was submitted at the end of the program. The rate of participation was also collected. The results showed that our program has resulted in significant improvements in the overall quality of life score related to weight of 8.4 ± 13.3, and in terms of self-esteem and work. We also observed a decrease in binge eating frequency by 2.1 ± 2.1 days as well as in binge eating severity, depressive symptoms and body dissatisfaction whose scores decreased by 10.9 ± 7.7, 8.3 ± 5.7 and 32.8 ± 17.1 respectively. However, there was no significant difference in weight at the end of the intervention. Also, the program was well accepted by the participants with a participation rate of 93.8%. Satisfaction and relevance of the program scored respectively 4,6 and 4,8 out of 5. These data suggest that the group intervention seems to be a promising method to improve the symptoms and consequences of HB, except for weight.

1030	Étude de la Structure-Fonction du Prosegment et du domaine CHRD de la PCSK9 humaine	Hypercholesterolemia is one of the major risk factors leading to cardiovascular disease. In this context, we focused our study on a protein that directly influences hypercholesterolemia: PCSK9. Since 2003, the coding gene for PCSK9 has been identified as the third locus responsible for familial hypercholesterolemia (FH3). PCSK9 is a protein secreted mostly from the liver by hepatocytes and has the capacity to recognize, bind and direct to degradation the LDLR receptor. The latter is responsible for the elimination the LDL particles from the plasma. The direct consequence of the LDLR degradation induced by PCSK9 is the harmful accumulation of the bad cholesterol in the blood.   Since PCSK9 activity has undesirable consequences on lipid metabolism homeostasis, we directed our research to characterize this protein to better understand its mechanism of action. Three domains compose PCSK9 structure and we focused on the ‘’structure-function study’’ of two domains, of which roles were still unknown: the prodomain located at the N-terminal extremity and the CHRD domain at the C-terminus of PCSK9.  The first manuscript presented in this thesis brings to light the importance of the acidic N-terminal sequence of the prosegment (amino acids 33-58) and its effect on the activity of PCSK9. It also presents a novel mechanism for fine-tuning the activity of PCSK9, which is enhanced at acidic pHs close to those of late endosomes. The second manuscript dissects further the PCSK9 structure, revealing that the structural requirements of the hinge and the M2 module located in the CHRD domain are not the same for the intracellular and extracellular pathways of PCSK9-induced LDLR degradation. Although the R434W natural mutation in the hinge region is absolutely deleterious for the intracellular activity of PCSK9, it reduces by ~70% the extracellular one. In contrast, the loss of M2 module of the CHRD domain is tolerated for the intracellular activity of PCSK9 but not for the extracellular one. The third manuscript demonstrates for the first time that a chimera containing the prosegment (Fcpro) directly binds PCSK9 and effectively acts as a negative regulator (inhibitor) of its ability to induce LDLR degradation.  Our work presents a new strategy to develop such inhibitors by interfering with the structure of PCSK9 and exploiting the properties of the PCSK9 prosegment and the advantage of its fusion to a humanized Fc of IgG1. In summary, the present research data sheds new light on the functional contribution of the prodomain and the CHRD domain of PCSK9.

1031	Extradition et non-refoulement : la justice fondamentale en péril? Analyse du cas Németh c. Canada (Justice)	In Németh v. Canada (Justice) (2010), the Supreme Court concludes that it is possible for the Minister of Justice to surrender a refugee facing extradition, unless it is unjust or oppressive or the discrimination clause can be applied. Cromwell J. established it isn't necessary to revoke the refugee status prior to the extradition; the Minister only has to demonstrate that the change of circumstances in the refugee's country may lead to the cessation of refugee protection. This implies that the Minister must come forward with evidence of changed circumstances and be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the refugee no longer needs protection in Canada. Unfortunately, the extradition procedures do not properly ensure the substantive fundamental justice and protections sought by refugees. There is no discussion on a possibility to properly respond to the Minister's evidence. However, there must be an opportunity for them to disprove the evidence, especially because it is a subjective matter which challenges the refugees' credibility. Therefore, it is the Minister's responsibility to ensure there is a hearing to comply with fundamental justice. Nevertheless, the Court didn’t go on to prescribe such an obligation to the Minister. In this research, we will then ask ourselves which procedural safeguards should be given by the Minister of Justice to refugees facing extradition.

1032	Apport de nouvelles techniques dans l’évaluation de patients candidats à une chirurgie d’épilepsie : résonance magnétique à haut champ, spectroscopie proche infrarouge et magnétoencéphalographie	Epilepsy is the most common chronic neurological disorder after stroke. The major form of treatment is long-term drug therapy to which approximately 30% of patients are unfortunately refractory to. Brain surgery is recommended when medication fails, especially if magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can identify a well-defined epileptogenic lesion. Unfortunately, close to a quarter of patients have nonlesional refractory focal epilepsy. For these MRI-negative cases, identification of the epileptogenic zone rely heavily on remaining tools: clinical history, video-electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring, ictal single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and a positron emission tomography (PET). Unfortunately, the limited spatial and/or temporal resolution of these localization techniques translates into poor surgical outcome rates.   In this thesis, we explore three relatively novel techniques to improve the localization of the epileptic focus for patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy who are potential candidates for epilepsy surgery: high-field 3 Tesla (T) MRI, near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and magnetoencephalography (MEG).  In the first study, we evaluated if high-field 3T MRI, providing a higher signal to noise ratio, could help detect subtle epileptogenic lesions missed by conventional 1.5T MRIs. Unfortunately, we show that the former was able to detect an epileptogenic lesion in only 5.6% of cases of 1.5T MRI-negative epileptic patients, emphasizing the need for additional techniques.   In the second and third studies, we evaluated the potential of NIRS in localizing the epileptic focus by analyzing the hemodynamic behavior of temporal and frontal lobe seizures respectively. We show that focal seizures are associated with significant increases in oxygenated haemoglobin (HbO) and total haemoglobin (HbT) over the epileptic area. While a contralateral mirror-like activation was seen in the majority of seizures, lateralization of the epileptic focus was possible most of the time. In addition, an unexpected increase in deoxygenated haemoglobin (HbR) was noted in some seizures, suggesting possible hypoxia even during relatively brief focal seizures.   In the fourth and last study, the utility of MEG in the evaluation of nonlesional drug-refractory focal epileptic patients was studied. It was found that MEG source localization of interictal epileptic spikes had an impact both on patient management for over two thirds of patients and their surgical outcome.

1033	Processus décisionnel de la femme enceinte immigrante : étude exploratoire chez des primigestes et secondigestes	Despite the important role played by healthy behaviours during pregnancy, and their health implications for both mother and baby, several studies have highlighted that health information needs of low-income and ethnic minority pregnant women have not been met. Thus, the information-seeking behaviour of low-income pregnant Maghrebian women has been studied in this thesis by using the Engel, Kollat and Blackwell (EKB) model. The main objective of this thesis’s research is to explore information-seeking behaviours regarding nutrition-related topics during pregnancy in order to determine whether decisional processes regarding information-seeking behaviour differ among primigravid and secundigravid women. This thesis proposes four specific research questions aiming at the exploration of individual and environmental factors likely to influence the active information-seeking behaviour, the type of information and the sources from which such information is collected. Data has been collected among 28 low-income voluntary women (14 primigravid and 14 secundigravid) mainly referred by the Montreal Diet Dispensary between August 2010 and 2011. Semi-structured interviews lasting 60 to 90 minutes were conducted by the doctoral student. Data were analyzed using content analysis with NVivo software.  On one hand, individual factors likely to influence the active information-seeking behaviour have been found to be: the ideological examination of pregnancy, presence of pregnancy discomforts, perception of conflicting information from providers, perceived adequacy of received nutrition information, perceived sufficiency of information, body weight changes, recognition of the baby’s well-being, attitudes toward prenatal supplementation, importance given to healthy eating, and motivation to learn. On the other hand, environmental factors likely to influence the active information-seeking behaviour have been identified to     be: culture (eating habits, food beliefs, religious beliefs, loss of cultural markers regarding health care and counseling during pregnancy) and interactions with individuals from the social environment. Significant information sources consulted by primigravid women for topics regarding prenatal nutrition were as follows: the registered dietitian, mother, friends, husband, and Internet. For secundigravid women, significant information sources were as follows: the dietitian, doctor, friends and husband. A significant professional information source, both for primigravid and secundigravid women, about prenatal vitamin and mineral supplementation and pregnancy weight gain was the registered dietitian. Internet was a significant public information source from which primigravid women got information regarding prenatal nutrition-related topics. Few women reported having received, during their follow-up examinations, professional information related to food safety issues and risks of gaining too much weight during pregnancy.   Overall, results presented in this thesis highlight the importance of improving communicating strategies in order to better address the information needs of low-income pregnant Maghrebian women. Results raise a number of questions with regards to improving the participation of professionals to prenatal education and their nutritional counseling. Moreover, results from this thesis suggest means to improve activity planning to better address the nutrition-related information needs of pregnant Maghrebian women during pregnancy. It would be useful for researchers to get involved in studies aimed at a better understanding of the information-seeking behaviour of expectant mothers from different cultural backgrounds regarding nutrition-related topics during pregnancy as well as the baby’s nutrition.	nutrition , information-seeking , low-income , Maghrebian , nutrition , pregnancy , qualitative research , weight gain , vitamin and mineral supplementation	en	10905.0
1034	Exploration du rôle du fragment LG3 sur les cellules souches mésenchymateuses dans le contexte du rejet vasculaire	Graft vasculopathy is diseases characterized by a progressive and obliterate narrowing of the blood vessels leading to ischemia and loss of graft function. This vascular narrowing is due to an accumulation of extracellular matrix and mononuclear cells positive for alpha smooth muscle actin (alphaSMA) including mesenchymal stem cells, thus forming an occlusive neointima. This condition is the leading cause of long term loss of kidney and heart transplants. Acute vascular rejection is a predictor of graft vasculopathy. Dr. Hébert’s team has demonstrated that endothelial apoptosis, which plays an important role in the development of vascular rejection, initiates the release of LG3, a fragment of the proteoglycan perlecan. Blood and urine levels of LG3 are increased in renal allograft recipients with vascular rejection and graft vasculopathy. The results obtained in the laboratory during my Master have helped to better characterize the impact of LG3 on an important cell type involved in neointima formation: the mesenchymal stem cells. My work has shown that the LG3 induces both the horizontal migration and the transmigration of MSC. This migration is ERK1/2-dependent, previously identified as a key molecule involved in neointima formation. In addition, our results demonstrate that Src kinase is activated by upstream activation of the MAPK pathway. Horizontal migration and transmigration induced by LG3 are also dependent on alpha2beta1 integrins, and the activation of the MAPK pathway. In a murine transplantation model, we also demonstrated that intravenous injection of recombinant LG3 promotes the accumulation of alphaSMA positive cells in the neointima. In addition, when the recipient is deficient for the alpha2 integrin but the graft is wild type, LG3 fails to induce neointima formation in the graft suggesting that recipient cells play an important role in the neointima formation. Finally, we demonstrated that intravenous injection of LG3 also increases the number of positive cells for the phosphorylated form of ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2) in the neointima. This accumulation is dependent on the presence of alpha2beta1 integrins on recipient cells: when the recipient is wild type, there is an increase in the number of cells positive for p-ERK1/2.The investigation of these mechanisms in vascular remodeling presents new opportunities to inhibit the cellular response that leads to inadequate remodeling during chronic vascular damage and prolong graft survival.

1035	Warfarin-induced vitamin K deficiency is associated with cognitive and behavioral perturbations, and alterations in brain sphingolipids in rats	Vitamin K (VK) is widely known for its role in blood coagulation, however many studies suggest its involvement in brain function. VK is required for the activation of various cerebral proteins (e.g., Gas6) and menaquinone-4 (MK-4), the main K vitamer in brain, is involved in sphingolipid metabolism. Furthermore, life-long intake of a low VK diet has been associated with cognitive deficits in old rats. Warfarin (W) is a potent VK antagonist that acts by blocking the VK cycle causing a “relative VK deficiency” at the cellular level. In light of this and the emerging role of VK in brain, W could represent a risk factor for cerebral function. The finding of this study is important according to the large proportion of adults with thromboembolic diseases being treated with warfarin drugs. This study was conducted in a rat model where the impact of W was investigated with respect to cognition, behavior, and brain menaquinone-4 (MK-4) and sphingolipid status. Fourteen Wistar male rats were treated with 15 mg W/kg/d (in drinking water) and subcutaneous VK (85 mg/kg), 3X/wk, for 10 wks; 14 control rats were treated with normal water and injected with saline. At the end of the treatment period, rats were subjected to different behavioral tests, afterwhich their brains assessed for VK (phylloquinone and MK-4) and sphingolipids (gangliosides, ceramides, cerebrosides, sphingomyelin and sulfatides) and gangliosides subtypes (GT1b, GD1a, GM1, GD1b). Mean latencies to find the hidden platform were higher in the W compared to the control group (p<0.05) suggesting cognitive deficits as well as hypoactivity and lower exploratory behaviour in the open field test (p<0.05). Warfarin treatment also resulted in a dramatic decrease in MK-4 concentration in all brain regions (p<0.001), altered sphingolipid level, especially in frontal cortex and midbrain (p<0.05), and in a loss of sphingolipid regional differences, notably for gangliosides. W treatment was associated with lower GD1a in the hippocampus and higher GT1b in the striatum and prefrontal cortex. In conclusion, warfarin-induced VK deficiency alters VK and sphingolipid status in brain with potential detrimental effects on brain functions.

1036	Étude de protection conférée par vaccination ADN dans un modèle murin d’hépatite auto-immune	DNA immunizations were proven effective in a range of autoimmune diseases. The first goal of this master’s thesis was thus to evaluate if a protocol of 3 intramuscular plasmidic injections of pCMV-CTLA4-NP and pVR-IL-12, at 2 weeks apart, would protect TTR-NP mice, a transgenic murine model previously developed in the laboratory, against the development of an autoimmune hepatitis. The second goal was, if the protection was indeed conferred by DNA vaccination, to elucidate the mechanisms underlying this effect. The initial hypotheses were that DNA vaccination would indeed elicit a protection against autoimmune hepatitis, and that this could be attributed to a skew from the typical Th1 response to a more tolerogenic Th2 response, to the exhaustion of the immune cells and/or to the activation and the proliferation of regulatory T cells.  Results show that DNA vaccination induces a transient protection against lymphocytic infiltrates in the liver. This protection is thought to be caused by the exhaustion of the CD4+, CD8+ and CD19+ cells found in the spleen and expressing PD-1 in greater proportion at 3 months, and not to be mediated by CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ or CD8+FoxP3+ regulatory T cells. An immunomodulation from a Th1 to a Th2 response could still be a plausible explanation by the protection conferred by the DNA vaccination, but additional experimentations in a more physiological setting would be necessary to infer on its real implication. DNA vaccination had no effect on autoantibodies or on alanine aminotransferase levels, which are two biological markers of the disease.	autoimmune hepatitis , DNA vaccination , autoimmunity , tolerance break , liver	en	10857.0
1037	Mammite bovine à Escherichia coli : identification et caractérisation de la persistance	Escherichia coli is part of the environmental mastitis pathogens. However, in some cases, persistence in the mammary gland occurs. The objectives of this study were to confirm persistent infection in Canadian dairy cows and to identify possible spread between quarters of a same cow in a cohort of 91 herds monitored over two years. Also, persistent strains were compared to transient strains. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by the broth microdilution method. Genetic profiles were obtained for same cow isolates by DNA fingerprinting with pulsed field gel electrophoresis. Twenty-seven virulence genes were determined by colony hybridization. Persistence was detected in 18 cows and contagion between quarters, in 2 cows. Proportions of resistance in persistent E.coli ranged from 0.0% (enrofloxacin) to 27.8% (ampicillin and tetracycline). Proportion of resistance in transient E.coli ranged from 0.0% (enrofloxacin) to 16.8% (tetracycline). For each additionnal antimicrobial resistance, odds of being classified as a persistent isolate increased by a factor of 1.6 (95% CI: 1.1, 2.4). Resistance to ampicillin and to cephalothin were both associated with higher odds of being a persistent E. coli. Isolates harboring gene iroN had 5.4 times higher odds (95% CI: 1.2, 24.0) of being classified as persistent isolates. Similarly, isolates positive to virulence gene sitA had 8.6 times higher odds (95% CI: 2.8, 27.1) of being classified as persistent isolates. In conclusion, this study confirmed that E. coli can persist in the udder of Canadian dairy cows and that these E. coli are different when compared to transient E. coli.

1038	Les réseaux militaires comme acteurs des relations internationales : le cas du Multinational Interoperability Council	For more than fifty years, Western powers have created many different forms of international military networks, in order to strengthen their ties and harmonize their technics, equipment and ways of doing things. To date, these groups have remained largely ignored by the academic discipline of International Relations. And yet, globalization and the rise of information technologies have provided many new actors with an access to political processes, including in the field of security. This evolution sheds new light on the role, mission and responsibilities that states assign to these networks. This research conducts an in-depth analysis of one military network, the Multinational Interoperability Council. The aim of this analysis is threefold: to define international military networks as a category of analysis for International Relations, to document empirically their functioning, and to understand their role in the field of internal security. To do so, the analytical framework combines the conceptual apparatus of relational institutionalism, the theory of social fields, and the methodological tools of the practice turn in International Relations. This combination allows for addressing the institutional, cognitive and practical dimensions of collective action within the network. The analysis reveals that, despite a limited influence, the MIC produces its own identity, capabilities, preferences and effects. The MIC’s actors have been able to create the conditions of its institutionalization, and they have succeeded in turning the network into an intentional actor of the international security field, while it was originally created as a mere structure of exchange of information. The MIC is not able to act autonomously, without states’ control. However, the relations established by the military who belong to it have provided them with capabilities – social, political and expertise capitals – that they would not otherwise possess, and which they can mobilize in their interactions with other actors of the field.

1039	Routage adaptatif et stabilité dans les réseaux maillés sans fil	Thanks to their flexibility and their simplicity of installation, Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) allow a low cost deployment of network infrastructure. They can be used to extend wired networks coverage allowing connectivity anytime and anywhere. However, WMNs may suffer from drastic performance degradation (e.g., increased packet loss ratio and delay) because of interferences and congestion. In this thesis, we are interested in adaptive routing and stability in WMNs. In the first part of the thesis, we focus on defining new routing metric and gateway selection scheme to improve WMNs performance. In this context, we propose a source routing protocol based on a new metric which takes into account packet losses, intra-flow interferences, inter-flow interferences and load at gateways together to select best paths to best gateways. Simulation results show that the proposed metric improves the network performance and outperforms existing metrics in the literature. In the second part of the thesis, we focus on critical zones, in WMNs, that consist of mesh routers which are located in neighborhoods of gateways where traffic concentration may occur. This traffic concentration may increase congestion and interferences excessively on wireless channels around the gateways. Thus, we propose a proactive and adaptive routing protocol based on reinforcement learning which increasingly penalizes links with bad quality as we get closer to gateways. We use Q-learning algorithm to dynamically update path costs and to select the next hop each time a packet is forwarded toward a given gateway; learning agents in each mesh router learn the best link to forward an incoming packet and explore new alternatives in the future. Simulation results show that our distributed routing protocol is less sensitive to interferences and outperforms existing protocols in the literature. In the third part of this thesis, we focus on the problems of instability in WMNs. Instability occurs when routes flapping are frequent. Routes flapping are caused by the variations of link quality due to interferences and congestion. Thus, after analyzing factors that may cause network instability, we propose to use the number of path variations in routing tables as an indicator of network instability. Also, we use entropy function, usually used to measure uncertainty and disorder in systems, to define node stability, and thus, select the most stable routes in the WMNs. Simulation results show that our stability-based routing protocol outperforms existing routing protocols in the literature in terms of throughput, delay, loss rate, and Gini index.

1040	Estimation du modèle GARCH à changement de régimes et son utilité pour quantifier le risque de modèle dans les applications financières en actuariat	The Markov-switching GARCH model is the foundation of this thesis. This model offers rich dynamics to model financial data by allowing for a GARCH structure with time-varying parameters. This flexibility is unfortunately undermined by a path dependence problem which has prevented maximum likelihood estimation of this model since its introduction, almost 20 years ago. The first half of this thesis provides a solution to this problem by developing two original estimation approaches allowing us to calculate the maximum likelihood estimator of the Markov-switching GARCH model. The first method is based on both the Monte Carlo expectation-maximization algorithm and importance sampling, while the second consists of a generalization of previously proposed approximations of the model, known as collapsing procedures. This generalization establishes a novel relationship in the econometric literature between particle filtering and collapsing procedures. The discovery of this relationship is important because it provides the missing link needed to justify the validity of the collapsing approach for estimating the Markov-switching GARCH model. The second half of this thesis is motivated by the events of the financial crisis of the late 2000s during which numerous institutional failures occurred because risk exposures were inappropriately measured. Using 78 different econometric models, including many generalizations of the Markov-switching GARCH model, it is shown that model risk plays an important role in the measurement and management of long-term investment risk in the context of variable annuities. Although the finance literature has devoted a lot of research into the development of advanced models for improving pricing and hedging performance, the approaches for measuring dynamic hedging effectiveness have evolved little. This thesis offers a methodological contribution in this area by proposing a statistical framework, based on regression analysis, for measuring the effectiveness of dynamic hedges for long-term investment guarantees.

1041	Tactical Vehicle Routing Planning with Application to Milk Collection and Distribution	Many practical problems arising in real-world applications in the field of logistics can be modeled as vehicle routing problems (VRP). In broad terms, VRPs deal with designing optimal routes for delivering goods or services to a number of geographically scattered customers in a context in which, routing costs are minimized. Depending on the type of problem, one or several depots may be present. Routing problems are among the most difficult combinatorial optimization problems.  In this dissertation we study a special combinatorial optimization problem, belonging to the class of the vehicle routing problem that is strongly linked to the context of the transportation networks. We introduce a new problem setting, which is mainly inspired by the activities of collecting milk from production farms and distributing the collected product to processing plants in Quebec. Two different variants of this problem setting are considered. The first variant seeks a tactical routing plan for the milk collection-distribution problem over a given planning horizon assuming that the production level over the considered horizon is fixed. The second variant aims to provide a more accurate plan by taking into account potential variations in terms of production level, which may occur during the course of a horizon. This thesis is cast into three main parts, as follows:  In the first part, we describe an exact algorithm for the first variant of the problem, which is characterized by the presence of time windows, multiple depots, and a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles, where the objective is to minimize the routing cost.  To this end, the problem is modeled as a multi-attribute vehicle routing problem. The exact algorithm proposed is based on the column generation approach, coupled with an elementary shortest path algorithm with resource constraints.  In the second part, we design an exact framework to address the second variant of the problem. To this end, the problem is modeled as a multi-period vehicle routing problem, which explicitly takes into account potential production level variations over a horizon. New strategies are proposed to tackle the particular structure of the multi-period elementary shortest path algorithm with resource constraints.  To solve realistic instances of the second variant of the problem in reasonable computation times, a heuristic approach is required. In the third part of this thesis, we propose an adaptive large neighborhood search, where various new exploration and exploitation strategies are proposed to improve the performance of the algorithm in terms of solution quality and computational efficiency.

1042	Dynamique de recombinaison radiative dans les nanofils InGaN/GaN : étude détaillée de la photoluminescence	We have performed time-integrated and time-resolved photoluminescence measurements on four different configurations of InGaN/GaN dot-in-a-wire heterostructures in order to further our understanding of the localization and radiative recombination mechanism involved in the process of emission.  Time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) measurements from 100 ns to 26000 ns have allowed us to observe a strong non-exponential decay which follows a power law on long time scale. The characteristic exponent of this power law is strongly correlated with the emission energy, causing the life-time of the emission to fall rapidly with increasing of its energies.  The observation that the excitation power has an effect on the life-time shows that other factors such as the growth conditions must be involved in the coupling between life-time and energy.  Using a low power density of a few tens of watts per cm squared, we have shown, in a non perturbative regime, that the shape of the time-integrated spectra and the dynamics of the time-resolved decay curves were consistent with a radiative recombination process centered on In-rich nanocluster. These nanoclusters naturally occur in the embedded InGaN inclusions during the growth by plasma-assisted MBE.     This conclusion is supported by the absence of Quantum confined Stark effect. The success of a charge separation model is perfectly consistent with the emission centered on In-rich nanocluster and the observation of a quasiperfect isotropic emission.

1043	Méthode numérique d'estimation du mouvement des masses molles	Biomechanical analysis of human movement using optoelectronic system and skin markers considers body segments as rigid bodies. However the soft tissue motion relative to the bone, including muscles, fat mass, results in relative displacement of markers. This displacement is the results of two components, an own component which corresponds to a random motion of each marker and an in-unison component corresponding to the common movement of skin markers resulting from the movement of the underlying wobbling mass. While most studies aim to minimize these displacements, computer simulation models have shown that the movement of the soft tissue motion relative to the bones reduces the joint kinetics. This observation is only available using computer simulations because there are no methods able to distinguish the kinematics of wobbling mass of the bones kinematics. The main objective of this thesis is to develop a numerical method able to distinguish this different kinematics. The first aim of this thesis was to assess a local optimisation method for estimating the soft tissue motion using intra-cortical pins screwed into the humerus in three subjects. The results show that local optimisation underestimates of 50% the marker displacements. Also it leads to a different marker ranking in terms of displacement. The limit of local optimisation comes from the fact that it does not consider all the components of the soft tissue motion, especially the in-unison component. The second aim of this thesis was to develop a numerical method that accounts for all the component of the soft tissue motion. More specifically, this method should provide similar kinematics and estimate large marker displacement and distinguish the two components to conventional approaches. The lower limb is modeled using a 10 degree of freedom chain model reconstructed using global optimisation and the markers placed only on the pelvis and the medial face of the shank. The original estimate of joint kinematics without considering the markers placed on the thigh and on the calf avoids the influences of these markers displacement on the kinematic model reconstruction. This method was tested on 13 subjects who performed hopping trials and obtained up to 2.1 times of marker displacement depending the method considered ensuring similar joint-kinematics. A vector approach shown that marker displacements is more induce by the in-unison component. A matrix approach combining the local optimisation and the kinematic model shown that the wobbling mass moves around the longitudinal axis and along the antero-posterior axis of the bone. The originality of this thesis is to numerically distinguish the bone kinematics from the wobbling mass kinematics and the two components of the soft tissue motion. The methods developed in this thesis increases the knowledge on soft tissue motion and allow future studies to consider their movement in joint kinetics calculation.	wobbling mass , inverse kinematics , assessment , least squares algorithm , jump	en	10763.0
1044	Destinée des S-RNases dans les tubes polliniques lors des croisements compatibles et incompatibles	Self-incompatibility (SI) is a widespread genetic device used by flowering plants to reject their own pollen, and thus to avoid inbreeding. This cell-cell recognition mechanism is mediated by molecular interactions between gene products expressed in the pollen and those expressed in specialized cells of the pistil. The genetic determinants of the system are produced from a highly complex multigenic S-locus with multiple S-haplotypes, although other genes outside the S-locus also contribute to the phenomenon in a non-allele specific manner. SI discriminates between self and non-self pollen, as the former will be rejected (incompatible cross), whereas the latter will be allowed to accomplish fertilization (compatible cross). In the Solanaceae (to which Solanum chacoense belongs) the pistillar determinant to SI is an extremely polymorphic stylar extracellular S-RNase, whereas the pollen determinant involves the collaborative action of several members of the F-box family (SLF or S-locus F-box). This has led to the hypothesis that during compatible crosses, ubiquitin-mediated degradation of non-self S-RNases takes place (degradation model). However, it has also been found that non-self S-RNases appear to be sequestered in the vacuole during compatible crosses (sequestration model). The objective of our study was to discriminate between these two models by using immunolocalization techniques and transmission electron microscopy. We have found that the concentration of S-RNases is significantly higher in incompatible pollen tubes than in compatible ones.

1045	La contribution de la stéréoscopie à la constance de forme	This study was conducted to evaluate the contribution of stereopsis to the shape constancy phenomenon. Four groups of eight participants each were asked to perform a visual exploration task. The first group was exposed to a stereoscopic stimulation, the second group was exposed to a reversed stereoscopic stimulation, the third group was exposed to a monocular stimulation with textures and shadow and the fourth group was exposed to a monocular stimulation with shadow only. Response times and error rates were used to measure participant's performance. Results show an interaction between rotation effects (familiar viewpoints vs. non-familiar viewpoints) and available depth cues (stereopsis, reversed stereopsis, textures and shadow, shadow only). The rotation cost was smaller in the group exposed to a reversed stereoscopic stimulation. These results are congruent with the use of tridimensional representations underlying visual processing.

1046	Physiologie des émotions : l’effet des stimuli relationnels et de la qualité affective des schémas relationnels sur les réactions physiologiques associées à des émotions de valence positive et négative	The literature on the electrophysiology of emotions does not seem to find consensus on people’s responsiveness to emotion inducing stimuli.  While some studies show that people are more responsive to stimuli of positive valence, others concluded the contrary. The main objective of this paper is to verify the effects of relational variable on the physiological responses of subjects taken from the student population. That is, are the physiological reactions only influenced by the emotional valence of different emotions or are they also influenced by the relational context of the stimuli? The second objective of the research is to check if there is an interaction between the emotional quality of the relationship patterns of participants and the relational or non relational quality of the stimulus. To do this, the heart rate has been measured in 16 subjects divided into two groups, based on their results in the TAT, analyzed on the scale of the emotional tone of the SCORS. Finally, a third objective was to compare the subjective experience of participants and the physiological measurements obtained. The results show that people are more responsive to non-relational stimuli than to relational scenarios. In addition, the large effect size of the two groups (high and low emotional tone) suggests the importance of taking into account this variable in future research. Finally, other studies, particularly with larger samples, will be needed to show the importance of the quality of relationships in the emotional experience.

1047	Être et image : une approche de la notion de sujet chez Maître Eckhart	The following dissertation attemps to establish the presence of certain conceptual motives pertaining to the modern conception of subjectivity (as exemplified by the cartesian understanding of the self), in the middle-high german works of Master Eckhart of Hochheim, philosopher, theologian and predicator who was born in 1260 and died in 1328. In order to do so, it develops a three-fold argument taking place over three chapters, each of which presents a different approach - a different perspective - on Eckhart’s thought. The first chapter presents an ontological argument designed to explicitate the meaning of the key eckhartian notions of being, nothingness, intellect and image, whereas the second chapter exploits the existential consequences of Eckhart’s outlook on those notions – consequences which in ethical terms translate into the necessity for the human individual to practice a systematic annihilation of oneself in order to achieve an absolutely pure union with God. The third and last chapter of this dissertation attemps to explicitate de notion of “I” (ich), used by Eckhart to designate the identity that the detached human soul and God share, a type of identity in which we find similarities with the modern conception of the self – conception which Heidegger thought of as being entirely absent from precartesian philosophy.

1048	Anéantir l’Autre monstrueux : entreprise narrative et corporelle de disparition dans Moi, l’interdite d’Ananda Devi	The novel Moi, l’interdite, stands as an exception in Ananda Devi’s works due to the fact that it does not, directly or inherently, address the topic of feminine dissidence usually displayed in the majority of the works from the Mauritian author. The story, on the contrary, tries to set up a singular process: a disappearance affecting the narrator and main protagonist, forever condemned to be the Other because of her monstrous physical appearance. This study aims at exposing the inner machinery of the narrative, thematic, corporal and relational aspects of the destruction of this Other mainly through a narratological approach. Firstly the initiative of the disappearance can be observed through several narrative methods: chronological complexity, interlocking of several levels of discourses, abundance of narratees. Secondly the theme of disappearance is questioned in the alienating relationships developed by the main narrator, for whom her deformed body is mainly what is at stake.  This will of destruction leads to the crazily sick narrator’s (re)birth and death, as the incurable after-effects will prevent her from fulfilling her dream to belong to a fantasised Same.

1049	À la mémoire d'Émile... suivi de Entre silence et décadence : l'œuvre d'André Béland	Memorial romance, family romance, bildungsroman, autofiction… These are the concepts that inspired me in this creative research project. The starting point was a quest for identity, linked to a quest of the origins, symbolized by my unknown grandfather, a figure that I tried to demystify. Younger, I heard he had written a novel, Orage sur mon corps, which stirred in me various impressions and thwarted imaginations. I thought for example that my grandfather, Emile, had shared the ideas and mindset that circulated during the 1940s, while French Canada lived its first wave of cultural modernization. This version of the story, unfortunately, was not quite accurate. As a result of my dissatisfaction, my research progressed through an essay focusing on the work of André Béland, an author who corresponds better to the mythical figure of my grandfather. This essay is not intended to judge or to lionize the character, but to shed some light on his neglected work.

1050	Le braconnage dans le Parc national de l'île de La Réunion	Wildlife and flora of Reunion Island is characterized by a high level of endemism. The surface covered by forests accounts for almost one-third of the island. Theses exceptional conditions explain the creation of the “Parc national de La Réunion”. In protected areas of the national park, poaching is becoming a major concern for local and regional actors. As a matter of fact, many poached species are threatened and the damages caused by the poachers are visible throughout the Reunion landscape. The purpose of this research is to answer a major question: How does poaching take place (motivations, frequency, techniques, and places) in the “Parc national” and what are the reactions of the various actors? The methodology chosen in this study combines an exploratory approach and a case study analysis. A field research was carried out and data were collected by a literature search, interviews (exploratory, semi-structured, individual not structured) as well as by a literary analysis. The results of this study show that poaching is a firmly rooted tradition in the Reunion culture and a consequence of the economic context. Our analysis has identified two major categories of poachers: occasional poachers and professional poachers. Occasional poaching is widespread in the population because this activity is bound to traditions. Professional poaching, which refers to a systematic withdrawal of natural resources for money considerations, is the business of a small number of poachers. The damages caused by professional poachers are however more important than those linked to occasional poaching. In this analysis, we have enumerated and examined the methods used by the different actors associated with poaching. Punching vanilla plants and marking tangues are methods which have proven their efficiency. Other methods such as denouncement and educational visits will have to be further explored. However, re-educational meetings for the poachers as well as the sale of hunting licenses are currently not considered effective.                                               During this research, we also have collected recommendations in order to improve the dynamics between the different actors involved in the poaching issue.

1051	La torsion des métatarses : étude de sa plasticité chez l'humain	It has been shown that the metatarsals head torsion can be influenced by the mode of locomotion in primates and can be used to determine the presence or absence of a longitudinal arch in hominin ancestors. In modern humans, the longitudinal arch results in a foot more inverted than in apes, causing a slight tilting of the dorsoplantary axis of the metatarsals proximal joints. Thus, the metatarsal heads undergo torsion relative to the axis of the shaft so their plantar surface lie parallel to the ground. Since women have a higher longitudinal arch than men and since wearing hard sole shoes causes morphological changes in the foot, making the longitudinal arch higher and the hallux less abducted, it is expected that torsion will be different according to sex and type of shoes worn. By comparing different human populations, this paper examines whether metatarsal torsion is a plastic trait that can be influenced by the loading environment. The sample available for this study, consists of 166 individuals from 18 different archaeological sites including 57 men, 35 women and 74 of indetermined sex that were divided into four groups: Amerinds, Inuits, Military and Euro-canadian. There is no significant difference in torsion between men and women, suggesting that the slight difference in longitudinal arch height between men and women is not sufficient to be perceived in metatarsal variation torsion. The topography of the land does not seem to cause significant changes in the foot such as torsion. However, the surface of the ground, flat or irregular, could be a factor modifying torsion. Finally, wearing constrictive shoes with hard soles compared to flexible shoes, such as moccasins, increased variation in torsion angles. Individuals known to wear moccasins present more eversion of the first metatarsal and less eversion of the third, fourth and fifth metatarsals compared to individuals who used to wear constrictive footwear. These results support the hypothesis that metatarsal torsion is a relatively plastic feature.	Torsion , Anthropology , Metatarsal , Torsion , Longitudinal arch , Bone plasticity	en	10658.0
1052	"Perception de la profession de diététistes et de ses enjeux par des diététistes et des
étudiants finissants en nutrition du Québec"	Objectives. The main objective is to document, among university graduates in nutrition in Quebec, their professional motivations, their perception of the profession and its challenges and to compare these data with those obtained from dietitians. Methodology. An electronic survey was conducted among graduating nutrition students from three universities offering the program in Quebec. The questionnaire included 35 questions. Three of them were qualitative. Two questions referred to the critical incidents technique. For dietitians, data collected in 2009 by the OPDQ were used. Results. A total of 72 students completed the questionnaire and 597 dietitians had completed the survey of OPDQ. An interest in nutrition, health, food and the desire to help others are the main motivations for undertaking studies in nutrition and more than half express their intention to complete graduate studies in nutrition. A majority of them prefer to work with clients aged fewer than 65, which is of concern in view of the demographic context. Students have a rather positive perception of the profession and concerns similar to those of dietitians about issues that may affect the profession. Conclusion. This study reveals students’ profile, their motivations and perceptions of the profession. It stresses the importance of exposing students to workplaces as soon as possible in their school careers.

1053	Rôle du système du trijumeau dans la locomotion chez le nouveau-né d’opossum (Monodelphis domestica)	The opossum Monodelphis domestica is born very immature and crawls, unaided by the mother, from the urogenital opening to a nipple where it attaches and pursues its development. Sensory information is needed to guide the newborn to a nipple and studies suggest that the vestibular, trigeminal, and olfactory systems are likely candidates. The trigeminal, vestibular and olfactory regions of the brain were electrically stimulated to test their relative effectiveness at eliciting forelimb movement in newborn opossums, using in vitro preparations of brain-spinal cord with the limbs attached. The minimal stimulation of the cervical spinal cord needed to induce forelimb movement was considered as threshold (T). Similar movement were obtained with stimulations of the trigeminal ganglion at ~2T and of the vestibular complex at ~20 T and at ~600 T for the olfactory bulb. Neurofilament-200 immunohistochemistry and retrograde tracing with Texas-Red conjugated Dextran Amines were used to study trigeminal innervation of the facial skin and pathways by which trigeminal inputs may be relayed to the spinal cord. Numerous nerve fibers were observed in the snout dermis, elsewhere in the head skin. Some trigeminal ganglion cells project to the upper spinal cord, but more project to the caudal medulla where they could contact secondary trigeminal neurons or reticular cells projecting to the spinal cord. These results support a significant influence of the trigeminal and the vestibular systems, but not of olfaction, on forelimb movement of neonatal opossums.

1054	Image et survivance en anthropologie visuelle : Ernesto De Martino et l’ethnographie interdisciplinaire	This project deals with the production of images in Italian anthropologist Ernesto De Martino’s 1950s “interdisciplinary ethnographies” in southern Italy. These expeditions, innovative for their time, involved a team of researchers (including a religious historian, ethnomusicologist, psychiatrist, photographer and, at times, a filmmaker) and gave rise to mixed-media documents. While the textual aspects of De Martino’s work have been studied in depth, my approach focuses on image-making practices: photography, film, drawings. Building largely on his famous work La terra del rimorso (1961) on tarantism – a possession ritual observed by De Martino’s team in Puglia in 1959 – as well as on the iconographic atlas of Morte e pianto rituale nel mondo antico. Dal lamento pagano al pianto di Maria (1958) – his study on mourning rituals led in the southern Italian region of Lucania (Basilicata) –, this thesis suggests that images, despite their ancillary status, formed a major part of De Martino’s fieldwork and transmitted much more than documentary knowledge. Not only does the visual haunt De Martino’s own text as a literary device, but it is also tightly connected to a series of intermedial elements (sound, objects, bodies) inherent to the ritual “apparatus” itself and its documentation process. It was thus possible to perceive a dialectical relationship between technological imagistic devices such as photography and film, which “reproduced” possession rituals, and those practices’ own repetition processes, temporal rhythms, and performativity. Lastly, these images also suggest an anthropology of “afterlife” by means of visual analogies passed through bodily gesture, reminiscent of Aby Warburg’s work.	archive , Ernesto De Martino , ethnographie , possession , visual anthropology , tarantism , Aby Warburg , memory , photography , film , ethnography , media	en	10628.0
1055	Le poids de l’oiseau sur la vitre ; suivi de L’hétérogénéité graphique dans Blankets de Craig Thompson	This practice-led M.A. thesis explores how in hybrid novels, the integration of elements defying the visual conventions of the majority of the text participate to their construction of meaning. In the hybrid narrative Le poids de l’oiseau sur la vitre, an elderly woman revisits her diary, written – or imagined – decades ago to shield her from the reality of her infant son’s death. At first intent on restoring the truth, she soon falls, through the many corrections she brings to the original text and her reconstruction of the book, into her habit of tweaking facts, realizing at last that giving in to this spiral of lies means cheating herself from the past and, ultimately, her future. The following essay likens Craig Thompson’s Blankets, a graphic novel whose structure dynamics are based upon the use of different styles and page layouts, to hybrid novels, and studies its most visually striking pages to determine how, despite their distinctive appearance, they enhance the novel’s cohesion and make it more immersive.

1056	Vertus et limites de la critique communautarienne du libéralisme	In this essay about the communitarian critique of liberalism I seek to reach two goals. First, it is to form a synthesis from the works of philosophers Charles Taylor, Michael Sandel, Alasdair MacIntyre and Michael Walzer. This synthesis is articulated through three axes: ontologicial, social and methodological. Building on this, my second objective is to assess its relation to liberalism. More specifically, I seek to determine whether communitarianism is merely a critique, an alternative or a variant of liberalism. My conclusion is that communitarianism is reconciliable with a certain form of liberalism and that its critique allows to improve it.

1057	Déployer le réseau en images : les Googlegrams d'Abu Ghraib	The Web and its proliferating images have become part of our daily lives, thereby shaping the way we think about the world. It seems that some artworks allow us to ponder on the role of the image, Web technologies and their intricate relationship, as well as underlying socio-political issues. In this regard, this thesis examines the works of Joan Fontcuberta’s Googlegrams series (2004-2006), more specifically two artworks that are reworking iconic torture photographs of the Abu Ghraib prison. Thousands of smaller images are inserted into the photographs to refashion them into photomosaics. The images are found on the Web using Google Images search function with key words chosen by the artist in order to echo the source photographs. Considered here as tools of active study, these artworks allow us to unfold the assemblage of images and technologies that they are making interact. The aim is to follow the actors and the networks that are superimposed and interwoven within the Googlegrams: the Abu Ghraib photographs and their iconization; the search engine and its relationship with images; as well as the effects of the photomosaic. This study is driven by the interactions between these various elements that form the artworks as a means of reflecting upon their shaping roles in the representation of information.

1058	L’implication des enfants en médiation familiale : le point de vue et l’expérience des parents dans un contexte de partage des responsabilités parentales	This exploratory and descriptive research focuses on the experience and perspective of parents with regard to the direct participation of children in family mediation. To carry out this study, a qualitative research method was used and the phenomenology theoretical perspective was chosen. The sample consists of eight parents, all who participated in a semi-structured interview on the involvement of their children in family mediation. Data was collected between May and October 2013, and was analyzed based on the content analysis method as proposed by L'Ecuyer (1990) and Mayer and Deslauriers (2000). It is clear from this research that the direct involvement of children in family mediation has considerable influence on the process. Indeed, the majority of participants in this study reported that their children’s involvement was crucial to reach an agreement about shared parenting. Also, the results suggest that the majority of participants had positively experience the participation of their children and were satisfied with the benefits of the involvement. However, some parents lived this experience in a negative way. Those results highlighted the limitations and hazards associated with the direct involvement of children in family mediation. The terms of involvement chosen by family mediators also appeared to have influenced the experiences of parents and their children in the process. The results of this research provide access to the perception of parents about their children’s experiences before, during and after the process. A suggestion that comes from this study is that the child, although brought to give an opinion in family mediation, should not be held responsible for any decision related to shared parenting, for example the choice of care arrangements. The conclusions of this paper feed a family mediation strategy that is poorly documented from the point of view and experience of parents.

1059	La stimulation du nerf vague pour le traitement de la dépression réfractaire : les résultats après un an de suivi	Since 2001, Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS) has been used in treatment-resistant depression (TRD) in Europe and Canada, and in 2005 in the USA. European and American studies have shown a 50% response rate and 30% remission rate respectively after one year. Patient selection, driven by biological correlates and resistance criteria, may contribute to improved response and remission rates. This naturalistic study describes the follow-up of outpatients with TRD in individuals with unipolar or bipolar spectrum disorder (type 1 or 2) (n=13) treated with VNS. An exhaustive review of the medical and treatment history precedes an intensive clinical evaluation consisting of an individual evaluation and a subsequent team evaluation. A consensus is pursued, and if reached, an investigation of putative biological correlates of depression follows. This include a single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and a positron emission tomography (PET), a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a complete blood count, a dexamethasone suppression test (DST), a 24h urine collection; a polysomnography, and a limited neuropsychological evaluation. After one year of treatment, 61,5% (8/13) responded to treatment with at least a 50% reduction of their symptoms. Of those who responded 87.5% (7/8) are in remission. All patients with bipolar disorder, and/or abnormal baseline DST and/or baseline memory deficit responded to VNS therapy and continue to be in remission at the 24 months mark. Careful selection of patients for VNS treatment can be a very effective method of treatment of TRD and subsequent prevention of relapse, resulting in a sustained normothymic state in most responders.	neuromodulation , vagus nerve stimulation , treatment-resistant depression , bipolar disorder , neuromodulation , depression	en	10591.0

1061	Edgar Degas et le traitement moderne de la figure féminine : un terrain propice à l'éclosion des approches critiques féministes en art du XXe siècle	Edgar Degas, famous observer of nineteenth century Parisian life, made a special subject of the female figure throughout his whole career. As early as his first attempts at historical paintings and his first portraits - many of which depicted couples and family members - Degas introduces some kind of tension between men and women. This tension can not only be seen in the structure of his works but also through the postures and facial expressions of his characters. It remains in the genre paintings which show Degas’ increased interest in scenes of contemporary life after he turned away from historical topics. Those scenes point to a narrative that until today is difficult to decipher but where an opposition of a sort can still be seen between the male and female poles of the picture. But it is especially in the works depicting women at work or tending to their personal hygiene in the artist’s mature period that this tension is shown at its peak. It vibrates with an increasingly more personal and social tone. A shift in the figurative structure maintains the female pole in the depicted space whereas the male pole is now located in the beholder’s space. Female wearily label even by the postures, demeanors, and expressions lead us to believe that they are subjected to some visual intrusion of male origin, one akin to the existing voyeurism developing in the same period in many academic paintings and popular illustrations.

1062	Habileté de mentalisation chez les mères présentant un trouble de personnalité limite : orientation mentale maternelle lors d’interactions mère-bébé	Background. Mothers with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) have been theorized to have decreased mentalization ability, which is the capacity to perceive and interpret mental states. This could potentially increase the risk for troubled relationships with their infants and therefore have adverse consequences on the social and emotional development of the child. Mind-mindedness (MM), assessed through the mother’s references to her infant’s mental states during an interaction, is one aspect of maternal behavior that relies heavily on the mother’s mentalizing ability. However, research has yet to examine MM in mothers with BPD. Aims. Our objective was to assess the MM ability of 38 mothers during interactions with their 12 month-old infants, including 10 with BPD and 28 without a psychiatric diagnosis. Method. Trained observers assessed maternal MM from 2 minutes of videotaped mother-infant free play. BPD was assessed by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R-Personality Disorders (SCID-II). Results. Mothers with and without BPD did not differ in the frequency of comments referring to infant mental states. However, the mind- related comments made by mothers with BPD were 4.7 times more frequently judged as non- attuned to her infant’s mental state by a trained observer compared with those of controls without a psychiatric diagnosis. Conclusions. Mothers with and without BPD appear equally likely to envision and refer to mental states in their infants. However, mothers with BPD appear more likely to misread the mental states of their infants. This could put the child at risk for adverse developmental outcomes.

1063	Évaluations physiologiques de la tricaïne méthanesulfonate pour l’anesthésie des grenouilles africaines à griffes (Xenopus laevis)	Very few studies exist on the physiological and pharmacological effects of the most commonly used anesthetic agent used in amphibians, tricaine methanesulfonate, in Xenopus laevis frogs. Our first goal was to measure the effects of 20 minutes bath immersions of 1 and 2 g/L tricaine methanesulfonate on cardiorespiratory system, analgesia and reflexes. We also studied the pharmacokinetic of  tricaine methanesulfonate following an immersion in a 2 g/L bath. Our results show that both 1 and 2 g/L baths produce surgical anesthesia during 30 and 60 minutes respectively, without significant effect on the cardiorespiratory system. Following the immersion in a 2 g/L bath, the tricaine methanesulfonate has a terminal half-life of 3,9 hours and no effect on tissue histology is observed 24 hours after anesthesia. In a second experiment, we evaluated the effects of tricaine methanesulfonate overdose on cardiorespiratory system and on central nervous system using electroencephalography. Moreover, we evaluated the effect of sodium pentobarbital injection after 2 hours of immersion. A significant EEG depression of central nervous system activity occurred with the use of tricaine methanesulfonate following 2 hours of recording and the pentobarbital injection was necessary to induce euthanasia. We showed that tricaine methanesulfonate can produce safe anesthesia of 30 to 60 minutes with reduction of CNS activity and without cardiorespiratory effect in Xenopus laevis.	tricaine methanesulfonate , anesthesia , euthanasia , amphibian , African clawed frog , pharmacokinetics , electroencephalogram	en	10566.0
1064	Quand l’endettement fait problème : variations et constantes de l’expérience d’endettement vécu comme étant problématique chez les jeunes adultes scolarisés à Montréal et à Santiago du Chili	Based on two case studies conducted in Montreal, Canada and Santiago, Chile, this thesis seeks to develop an understanding of the experience of debt as a resentful and problematic situation among educated young adults from both contexts. The aim is to analyze the link between both of their social experiences-the ones facing a problematic situation of debt and the social context in which this situation arises. Specifically, it firstly seeks to describe how, when, and why the experience of young adults in debt becomes a problem and secondly, it seeks to compare how this experience is constructed in the two contexts studied.  The empirical results are presented in three articles. The first one explored, through a qualitative study conducted with young adults in Montreal who frequented Family Economy Cooperative Associations (in  French ACEF) because of their debt, the dimensions that make the debt become a problematic situation. The two elements that emerge from this analysis are the individualistic dimension and its great responsibility, which induces debt among young Montrealers. The second and third article deal with the case of young people in debt under the undergraduate loans system which are granted by the Corporation for the Promotion of Production (in Spanish Corfo).   The social context of debt emergency is producing two very different types of debt experience. In Montreal, the consequences of debt are limited in time and they are possible to overcome by young people who see themselves responsible for their situation. Conversely, in Santiago, young people are forced to repay their debts and in order to do so, they develop a series of adaptation strategies. The consequences of these strategies are irreversible and have a long-term effect. The extension of the power of submission to an abusive loan expands to a large network of people, which makes them face debt collectively. This thesis shows evidence on the differences in the discourse of debt and its implications between Santiago and Montreal. While in Montreal the discourse of failure (and its correlation with depressive states) causes passivity among young people, in Santiago, this situation causes anger. Young people in debt group together in associations to report a situation they consider an abuse.

1065	Parenting, self-regulation and childhood anxiety : A Self-Determination Theory perspective	Parental psychological control is a well known risk factor for children’s internalizing problems (e.g., Affrunti & Ginsburg, 2012; McLeod, Wood & Weisz, 2007). According to self-determination theory, psychological control leads to internalizing problems (Ryan, Deci, Grolnick, & La Guardia, 2006) because it thwarts the basic need for autonomy. Indeed, receiving pressure to think, behave and feel in particular ways (Ryan, 1982) is thought to foster a too rigid and overcontrolled regulation (Ryan et al., 2006). Following Soenens and Vansteenkiste (2010), the conceptual distinction between overt (e.g., threats, physical force) and covert (e.g., overprotection, bribes) forms of psychological control was used when assessing parenting style (Study 1) and disciplinary practices (Study 2). Parental psychological control and autonomy support (Study 2) were measured during toddlerhood as (a) internalizing problems emerge early, (b) the budding sense of autonomy and agency is central during this period, perhaps (c) “pulling for” parental control. With its two articles, the present thesis aims to clarify how overt and covert psychological control relate to the early development of internalizing problems. Study 1 is a population study examining the relative impact of parenting style onto child anxiety developmental trajectories (N = 2120 children; 2.5- to 8-years-old) along a host of putative child, mother, and family risk factors measured in toddlerhood. Results revealed that in addition to child shyness, maternal depression and family dysfunction, both overt (i.e., coercive) and covert (i.e., overprotection) parenting increase the risk for higher child anxiety. An interaction between maternal depression and covert control was found, indicating that overprotection only increases child anxiety when maternal depression is high. Finally, maternal covert control also predicted second grade teacher reports of children’s anxiety. Study 2 is an observational study investigating how toddlers’ self-regulation (SR) relates to later internalizing symptoms, while also exploring how parental disciplinary practices (controlling and autonomy-supportive) relate to these child outcomes. Parental practices were coded during a clean-up request task at 2 years of age (“Do” context; N = 102), while toddlers’ self-regulation was coded in both a clean-up (“Do”) and an attractive toys prohibition (“Don’t”) contexts, at age 2 and 3. Their anxious/depressed symptoms were rated by parents at 4.5-years-old. Results revealed that SR to prohibitions at 3-years-old decreased the odds of children showing high levels of anxious/depressed symptoms. Analyses also revealed that autonomy-supportive parenting was positively related to child SR to requests one year later. In contrast, overt and covert controlling parenting had detrimental effects on SR. Finally, only covert control increased the odds of showing higher levels of internalizing problems, above the protective effects of toddlers’ SR skills. There were somewhat mixed results in this thesis for the respective effects of both forms of control onto internalizing problems, depending on informant (mother vs. teacher) and methodology (questionnaires vs. observational data). However, covert psychological control was related to this affective problem across both studies. Coding autonomy support revealed that it may be an indirect, protective factor that merits further investigation.

1066	La schizophrénie dissociative : nouvelle entité clinique, trouble comorbide ou autres considérations nosographiques	"The existence of a dissociative subtype of schizophrenia has been suggested by several authors to account for the symptomatology of a group of people whose primary diagnosis is in the schizophrenia spectrum but have in addition dissociative symptoms (Ross, 2004; Sar et al, 2010; Van der Hart, Witztum, & Friedman, 1993). Of traumatic origin, this type of clinical picture where psychotic and dissociative symptoms are intertwined was first described more than a century ago (Janet & Raymond, 1898) but disappeared in the 30’s, having been incorporated to the concept of ""schizophrenia"" (Rosenbaum, 1980). It is in a new nosographic context that the concept of dissociative schizophrenia resurfaced. Indeed, psychiatric nosography took a turn in 1980 when the approach advocated by the DSM became descriptive rather than based on psychoanalytic conceptualizations. The psychiatric conditions of the time were divided into disorders whose symptoms tended to occur together (Cooper, 2004). Consequently, the presence of comorbid disorders increased. Given the frequently reported co-occurrence of psychotic and dissociative disorders, the phenomenological similarity of their symptoms and their potential traumatic etiology, Ross (2004) proposed a criteria set for the diagnosis of dissociative schizophrenia. The main objective of this thesis is to determine whether the dissociative schizophrenia, as defined by Ross (2004), exists. The first article focuses on the problem and the theoretical background that led to the research question. It aims at providing an overview of the issues surrounding the question of dissociative schizophrenia. It also reports on the literature pertaining to symptoms found in both psychotic and dissociative disorders, their traumatic etiology and studies on dissociation and schizophrenia. The second article is of empirical nature and reports the methodology used to answer the research question. Indeed, no study to date has systematically tested the criteria for dissociative schizophrenia. Our results show that 24 % of our sample (N = 50) could receive a diagnosis of schizophrenia with dissociative criteria proposed by Ross (2004). However, the criteria set was problematic so a modification was proposed and a prevalence of 14% was then found. Clinical vignettes are presented to compare our participants with those reported elsewhere. The links between psychotic and dissociative symptoms are discussed in trying to conceptualize dissociative schizophrenia in different ways, either as a new clinical entity, as a comorbid disorder or in a psychodynamic nosographic context."

1067	Calculs ab initio de structures électroniques pour un meilleur design de polymères photovoltaïques	This thesis focuses on the role of density functional theory in the design of polymers for photovoltaic applications.  Theoretical calculations are first studied in the characterization of polymers in the context of collaborations between theory and experiment. The stability and the energy levels of some organic molecules are studied before and after a sulfurization of their carbonyl groups, a process destined to lower the band gaps. The dynamics of the electronic processes and the Raman vibration spectra are also explored in a polycarbazole-based polymer.  From then, the usefulness of theoretical calculations in the design of polymers before their syntheses is explored. Density functional theory calculations are studied under the Scharber model in order to predict the efficiency of organic solar cells. Then, a new approach for the design of low band gap polymer based on the aromatic or quinoid structures is established, whose efficiency surpasses the actual donor-acceptor approach. These studies are used in the exploration of the chemical space and several candidate for polymers with interesting electronic properties are presented.

1068	Rapport M/L de disques de galaxies issus de modèles CSPE et contrôle des contraintes mécaniques dans la conception de revêtements optiques	The following thesis includes two parts: the first concentrates on mass models of galaxies while the second concerns the design of broadband optical coatings and the control of their mechanical properties.  Mass models presented here were performed on a subsample of ten galaxies from the SINGS survey.  It includes nine late-type regular galaxies as well as a dwarf galaxy. The work consisted in the determination at all radii of M/L ratio of galactic discs by choosing, amongst a grid of chemospectrophotometric galactic evolution models, the one that fits better the galaxy's multi-band photometric profile. Results from this work show that stellar discs weighted by the model's mass-to-luminosity ratio display consistent masses in all studied bands from the ultraviolet to the near-infrared (FUV to IRAC2 bands). The resulting discs are physically motivated and maximal, due to their mass-to-luminosity ratio being higher in the center of the galaxies than at their outskirts. In this maximal-disc situation, bars and bulges of galaxies can no longer be ignored and the appropriate corrections need to be made on the luminosity or circular velocity profiles of the galaxy.  In the second part, an additional module of the open source software Open Filters was written in order to take into account the mechanical properties of thin films in the design of optical coatings.  The mechanical stresses arising in optical coatings can have a deleterious effect on the optical performances of coatings, and this tool was meant to provide design capacities to minimize this effect. Broadband reflective coatings for Fabry-Perot plates were designed and fabricated as a proof of concept of the method. This specific case was interesting because the curvature induced by mechanical stresses induces decrease of the finesse of Fabry-Perot etalons.  Actual curvature of the deposited samples are coherent with the numerical calculations and undergo a substantial reduction for the two strategies devised here with this new design too. We therefore conclude that it is possible with this new software module to optimize coatings for their mechanical behaviour as well as for their optical properties.

1069	Lagrangian-informed mixed integer programming reformulations	Integer linear programming is a robust and efficient approach to solve large-scale instances of combinatorial problems.  However, problems constantly gain in complexity and sometimes impose strong constraints on computation times.  We must then develop specialised methods to compute heuristic primal solutions to the problem and derive lower bounds on the optimal value, and thus prove the quality of our primal solutions.  We propose to guide a reformulation approach for mixed integer programs with Lagrangian relaxations.  After the identification of a strong relaxation, a mechanical process leads to a second integer formulation. This reformulation is equivalent to the initial one, but its linear relaxation is equivalent to the strong Lagrangian dual.  We will show that the reformulation approach unifies and generalises prior formulations and lower bounding approaches, and that it exposes a simple mechanism to reduce the size of reformulations in return for weaker bounds.  Nevertheless, our reformulations are large.  We address this issue by solving their linear relaxations with specialised methods.  Finally, we apply the reformulation approach to two location problems. This yields novel formulations for both problems; some are very large but, thanks to the aforementioned specialised methods, still practical.

1070	African Nazarites : a comparative religious ethnography of Rastafari and Ibandla lamaNazaretha	Two rapidly growing theological and cultural movements currently sparking global interest are Rastafari and Ibandla lamaNazaretha. Founded by the Zulu preacher Isaiah Shembe during the 1910s, Ibandla lamaNazaretha originated as a hierarchical church order that worships at outdoor temples in the province of KwaZulu-Natal and currently comprises a number of splinter groups centralized around the Southern African peninsula. Rastafari, however, born in Jamaica, commenced as a multi-headed ideology that blossomed in scattered pockets across the Caribbean island and stemmed from the interpretations of a prophecy generally attributed to Marcus Garvey about a king to be crowned in Africa (circa 1920) as applied to the 1930 coronation of Ras Tafari Makonnen as Haile Selassie I, 225th Emperor of Ethiopia. Today, Ibandla lamaNazaretha and Rastafari comprise adherents and sympathizers numbering in the tens of millions and their presences connote varying degrees of political, theological, social, and cultural influence, especially in Africa and the Caribbean today.  This dissertation argues that both Ibandla lamaNazaretha and Rastafari perpetuate a conflation between the “Nazirite” from the Old Testament (Numbers 6:1-8) and the “Nazorean” of Matthew 2:23 through the hailing of a contemporaneous saviour: i.e. Haile Selassie I for Rastafari and Isaiah Shembe for Ibandla lamaNazaretha. Within this theological framework, both Rastafari and Ibandla lamaNazaretha have provided renewed life to the long defunct Ancient Judaic purification rites of the Nazirite, but have also adapted them in the context of messianism for the benefits of Africanness and the postcolonial concerns of indigeneity. Thus, through the persistence of indigeneity, the influence of Indian ideals of peaceful resistance, and the appropriation of various biblical themes, both Black African movements have successfully empowered the dispossessed by creating liminal communities wherein expressions of agrarian self-reliance flourish outside the auspices of a subjugating elite; a hermeneutic of naziritism unifies the discernable African, Judaic, Christian, Indian, and European hybridic roots.

1071	Transcendance et immanence chez Karl Rahner : échanges avec la philosophie de Gilles Deleuze	The question which moves throughout Karl Rahner’s work continues to lay down a principle: how can one make believable and convincing the revelation of God in Jesus to the people of today? This question must be considered again unceasingly in a practical reality of human life. In Rahner’s time, emphasis was placed into the transcendence of God. Since then, occidental culture was transformed: in the beginning of the 21st century, is showed a very obvious tendency of materialism, consumerism, individualism, relativism and secularism. Consequently, there is a tendency to evacuate the divine transcendence. Our research consists in exchanges between Karl Rahner’s theology and Gilles Deleuze’s philosophy, with the purpose of establishing possible conditions of Christian belief today. Deleuze’s philosophy introduces us into a creative process through which we can think radically of God as being at the same time transcendent and immanent. Our approach is developed with eight conceptual hybrids which help understand Rahners’s theology in another perspective and leads to the possibility of a Christian belief for today. Our research opens as well onto the perspective of theology meeting between the theological, philosophical, artistic and scientific worlds. Finally, it helps to enlighten the reality of the new evangelization in Christian Occident.	Immanence , Karl Rahner , Gilles Deleuze , Christian theology , Transcendence , Revelation	en	10505.0
1072	Étude préliminaire d'une nouvelle méthode de cotation du dessin de la famille chez les enfants d'âge préscolaire agressés sexuellement	This study assesses whether scores on the family drawing, derived with a new scoring method, can predict the presence of internalized and externalized behavior problems among sexually abused children. A family drawing was completed by 78 sexually abused children. The non-offending parent completed the Child Behavior Checklist 1½-5 (Achenbach & Rescola, 2000), the Index of Psychological Distress (Ilfeld, 1976), and a questionnaire on stressful events that their child may have experienced. The results indicate that a higher score on the family drawing is associated with a higher probability of clinical thresholds for internalized and externalized behavior problems in children who have been sexually abused, even when controlling for parents’ psychological distress, child’s age, number of stressful events experienced by the child, and type of abuse. This new scoring method may offer relevant information in the context of assessment of internalized and externalized behavior problems for preschoolers who disclosed sexual abuse.

1073	Perception du soutien social chez les adolescentes victimes d'agression sexuelle	This study investigates the role of social support as a protective factor in the posttraumatic adjustment of sexually abused victims. Many studies show the protective role of social support but others find its positive impact varies according to the source of support (Ullman, 1996), the type of support (Feiring, Taska, & Lewis, 1998) or the victim’s perception (Campbell, Ahrens, Sefl, Wasco, & Barnes, 2001). A qualitative approach allows us to examine the complex process at play when social support impacts post-traumatic adjustment which then allows us to better identify and explore social support’s characteristics. The goal was to describe in depth and to better understand how sexually abused female teenagers perceive the social support they received. A semi structured clinical interview was used with eight sexually abused adolescents to document their perspectives and verbatim accounts were analyzed qualitatively using thematic analysis. Social support was mainly positive although three main negative reactions were identified: betrayal regarding the abuse, verbal and physical violence and negative rumors about the adolescents. This understanding of the perspective of these adolescents can lead to promoting better social support experiences in the future.

1075	Le phénomène de la très faible natalité au Japon : une situation aux causes socio-économiques multiples	Japan is one of the countries with the lowest birthrate in the world since 1980s, and the low birthrate has lead to certain problems for the country. The Japanese government holds women responsible for the decreasing birthrate, stating that they are losing their traditional family values and becoming egocentric. This change is due to a higher level of education, accompanied by growing personal and professional expectations for women. In this thesis, we try to defend, with different theories on low birthrate, that even though there may be a change in values, it is not entirely responsible for the actual situation in Japan. We will cover the economic condition, the lack of gender equality in different spheres of life, and finally the change in traditional values.

1076	Essai de détection de processus migratoires à travers les isotopes de strontium et d’oxygène : étude des restes humains du cimetière Saint-Matthew (Québec, 1771-1860)	In order to distinguish first-generation immigrants from individuals born in Québec City and discuss the identity of immigrants to this city in the 18th and 19th centuries, osteological analysis as well as strontium (87Sr/86Sr) and oxygen (δ18O) isotopic analysis have been applied to thirty-four human skeletons exhumed from the Protestant cemetery of Saint-Matthew (Québec City, 1771-1860). The isotopic compositions obtained, although not as precise as historical data, allowed the distinction between three groups of origin: individuals born in Québec City (N = 12), first-generation immigrants most probably from the British Isles or northern France (N = 19) and first-generation immigrants whose origin cannot be determined (N = 3). In addition, the Scottish origin of some individuals could be suggested on the basis of isotopic compositions ranging from -10.0 to -9.09% vs. VSMOW. The comparison of these groups with data from historical sources and a previous study provides an overall picture of the immigrants’ identity, on both an individual and a populational level. In addition, isotope compositions (δ18O, 87Sr/86Sr, δ13C and δ15N) suggest that at least one individual could be Native American and another could come from an 18O depleted part of Europe (possibly Scandinavia or the Alps). Moreover, the spatial organization of burials allows us to consider the possible family and social ties of some immigrants buried in brick vaults or crammed into particularly modest graves.	immigration , strontium , provenance , Saint-Matthew , Québec , XVIIIe siècle , bioarchaeology , oxygen , origin , Saint-Matthew , Québec , 18th century , 19th century	en	10443.0
1077	The sculpture of Irma Stern (1922-1955)	This thesis proposes an unprecedented critical study of the sculptural production of the South African-born, German-Jewish artist Irma Stern (1894-1966). It seeks to open new perspectives on the art, the career, and the historical significance of a figure who is commonly celebrated for her pioneering contribution to the development of modern South African painting. This thesis’ contribution is twofold. Firstly, it offers the first comprehensive catalogue of Stern’s sculptural œuvre, bringing into focus a corpus of roughly thirty to fifty works, produced between the years 1922 and 1955 in a variety of different media, which display a consistent focus on the African female subject. Secondly, it analyzes and interprets Stern’s complete sculptural oeuvre. Mapping the narrative of Stern’s sculptural production onto the plot of her life and work as a painter of African subjects, it seeks to offer a richer understanding of the desires, anxieties, and concerns that underpinned Stern’s thirty-year-long engagement with African subject matter as well as an account of the racial power dynamics that are at play in her oeuvre. Through dedicated studies of Stern’s production in clay (1922), cement (1936-1945), and wonderstone and verdite (1936-1945), guided by concepts drawn from postcolonial, phenomenological, and sculptural theory, it tracks the changes in Stern’s sculptural approach to her subject matter and analyzes them in terms of Stern’s changing relationship with her African models. These analyses ultimately offer new directions for approaching Stern and framing her position in the history of South African art.

1078	Les enjeux de la diversité ethnoculturelle dans les établissements scolaires : les sessions de formation interculturelle	In the last decades, increased and more diverse immigration has lead the government of Quebec taken different measures aimed to deal with this new reality. Thus, in 1998, the Quebec ministère d’Éducation established the Politique d’intégration scolaire et d’éducation interculturelle from which followed a Plan d’action that suggests many ways to achieve its principles and goals. To help implement this new vision, intercultural training sessions were created for teachers, non-teaching staff and principals. The study of ethnocultural diversity’s challenges in schools through intercultural training has shed light on school staff members’ point of view. Their perceptions were used along the various strategies of both researchers and trainers to further analyse the dynamic between schools and ethnocultural diversity. Many issues arose during training sessions and interviews with school staff members that are discussed in the thesis: the future of Quebec’s identity, the teacher’s ethics and various complex issues raised by school staff members. I show how the encounter with the Other obliges daily reflection on the self by the teachers, in particular, through the intercultural discourse of the actors in the school setting, the different values present in the professional milieu, and the reflexivity promoted by those in charge of their training.

1079	Localisation des aires cérébrales impliquées dans le rappel de mots : validation d’un protocole d’imagerie optique	Until recently, patients with epilepsy refractory to drug treatments were intended to an uncertain future. Surgery as an alternative treatment offers hope to, one day, lead a normal life. In order to determine if a patient may benefit from a surgical intervention, a complete evaluation is essential. With the advancements in brain imagery techniques over the last few decades, preoperative evaluation methods have seen important progress. Among these techniques, near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), also known as optical imaging, presents numerous advantages (cost, participant mobility, spatial and temporal resolution, etc.). The purpose of this study is to develop a preoperative evaluation protocol for memory assessment. During a NIRS recording, a verbal memory task including encoding, immediate and delayed free-recall of a list of words was administered to ten healthy adults. The results obtained revealed bilateral activation of anterior and dorsolateral prefrontal areas as well as anterior and median temporal areas. Prefrontal and anterior temporal areas seemed to be regulated by different memory processes and the recall location in time. The first time that a list is recalled, increased hemodynamic activity is observed in comparison to subsequent recalls, with a greater activity in the left hemisphere than in the right hemisphere. This study constitutes the first step in the validation process of the protocol for clinical needs among epileptic patients.

1080	Études de type structure fonction des mutations causant l’ataxie épisodique de type I sur les canaux potassiques dépendants du voltage	The genetic episodic ataxias form a group of disorders with heterogeneous phenotype and genotype, but share the common feature of intermittent cerebellar dysfunction. Episodic ataxia (EA) types 1 and 2 are most widely recognised amongst the autosomal dominant episodic ataxias and are caused by dysfunction of neuronal voltage-gated ion channels. The present study focuses on mutations causing EA-1 located in the voltage sensor domains (VSDs) of Kv1.1. A member of the Shaker channel family. Here, we have characterised the electrophysiological properties of six different mutations at the position of F244 and we also reported the partiality effects of these following mutations T284A/M, R297K/Q/A/H, I320T, L375F, L399I S412C/I on Shaker sequence using the cut open voltage clamp technique (COVC). We have shown that mutations of F244 in the S1 of the Shaker Kv channel positively shift the voltage dependence of the VSD movement and alter functional coupling between VSD and pore domain. The mutations causing immobilization of the VSD movement during activation and deactivation and responsible for creating a leak current during activation, are removed by the application of 4-AP (4-aminopyridine) or by reinsertion of N-type inactivation but not by TEA (tetraethylamonium). Insights into the molecular mechanisms responsible for the stabilization of the intermediate state have been investigated by separately neutralizing the first three charges (R1Q, R2Q and R3Q) in the S4 segment. The result suggests an interaction between R2 and F244 mutants. It was established that a second co-evolved interface exists between S1 and the pore helix near the extracellular surface and it acts as a second anchor point. It is also responsible for generation of leak currents. The results suggest a dysfunction of the VSD in which the affected nerve cells cannot efficiently repolarize following an action potential because of altered delayed rectifier function	Voltage-gated potassium channel , Gating , Intermediate state trapping , Voltage sensor domains , Leak current	en	10425.0
1081	Le lien entre les perceptions des élèves sur la relation élève-enseignant et les problèmes de comportement extériorisés	Appling pedagogical methods and transmitting programmed material is not sufficient to define the complexity of teaching. The pedagogical relationship built by the teacher with his or her students is another important and necessary component. This relationship is considered optimal when it has a high level of warmth and a low level of conflicts. Previous studies demonstrate significant links between the quality of this relationship and different indicators of school-adaptations. In general, the reports reveal that a warm student-teacher relationship has a positive impact on student behaviour, academic success as well as feelings and attitudes toward school. Furthermore, the quality of student-teacher relationship has an even greater effect on students considered at risk. This student category is characterised by the presence of vulnerability factors such as poverty (social factors), difficult parent-child relationship (family factors) or a lack of social skills (individual factors). Majority of research done on student-teacher relationship does not specify which aspects in particular have a significant influence on its overall quality. In order to address this issue, two goals are aimed by the present study: 1) examine the relationship between perceptions of high school students considered at risk for various aspects of the quality of the student-teacher relationship and externalizing behavior problems; 2) verification if this link evolves over time. In our work, the type of student-teacher relationship is categorized by two dimensions: the warmth and the conflicts (Pianta, 1992). The classification according to the positive or negative pole of each dimension enables to distinguish between four types of relations the student is prone to establish with his or her teachers: either warm, controversial, negligent or conflict. A random sample of the data collected in 2002-2008 during the evaluation of intervention strategy Agir Autrement (Act Differently) (SIAA) is used in the present longitudinal study. It is composed of 563 high school students: 273 girls and 290 boys. V Secondary analyses are made on the data collected on the same students during their first and fifth year. This approach gives the opportunity to observe the changes in student behaviour as function of student-teacher relationship quality. In general, our results show a high complexity of links between different types of student-teacher relationship and the exteriorized behaviour problems. More specifically, we conclude that a warm type relation is less likely to be associated with exteriorized behaviour problems of students at risk, and that as much in 1st year of high school as in the 5th. According to our results, conflict and controversial relationship types are significantly linked to exteriorized behaviour problems of students at risk in the 1st and the 5th year of high school. In the case of the negligent relationship, the results demonstrate the existence of a correlation between this bond type and exteriorized behaviour problems. However, the strength of this correlation is higher for the students at risk in the 5th year of high school as compared to the same students when they were in their 1st year. Finally, when all the results are taken together, they reveal the relative stability of the relationship type over time and on the other hand, a significant increase in the frequency of problematic behaviour such as serious stealing and psychotropic consumption. Furthermore, the obtained results show the existence of a link between the conflict dimension of the student-teacher relationship and the psychotropic consumption of students accounted by our sample. The present study demonstrates that since conflicts act as risk factors capable of increasing the frequency of exteriorized behaviour problems of high school students considered at risk, the conflict dimension is equally important in the student-teacher relationship as the warmth dimension. A relationship between students and their teachers with a reduced level of conflicts can play an important role in the prevention of this type of problems experienced by high school students.	relations interpersonnelles , attachement , student-teacher relationship , student-teacher relationship quality , interpersonal relations , attachment , student at risk , exteriorized behaviour problems	en	10397.0
1082	Une silhouette naturelle est-elle fréquemment classée dans plusieurs catégories de base?	Ambiguous silhouettes such as the duck/rabbit (Jastrow, 1899) have been studied by several approaches. However, the figures taken as examples in the vast majority of studies are generally the same. This redundancy of the ambiguous images used in litterature implies they may be quite rare. On the other hand, anecdotal evidence suggests that they might be relatively frequent. This is what this experiment is trying to establish. We used three-dimensional models of animals from a random point of view to extract silhouettes whose perimetric complexity was subsequently modified by smoothing. Thirteen subjects were asked to indicate what they saw in the image. We show that silhouettes are classified on average with 1.9079 based categories. We also established that a decrease in the perimetric complexity initially makes a more ambiguous figure but that this effect eventually reaches a peak (at a perimetric complexity of approximately 6 times that of a disk) after which ambiguity drops.

1083	Mesure de la mortalité des médecins au Québec à partir de données administratives	The goal of this research is to obtain an approximate measurement of the mortality of male physicians in the province of Quebec who are considered under this study. Physicians’ mortality rates were analyzed in terms of changes between the years 1993-1998, 1999-2004 and 2005-2010, as well as being compared with the mortality rates of Quebec men at large. In addition, the mortality rates of male general practitioners were compared to those of physicians practicing a medical specialty. The data used in the production of this paper is derived from an administrative file provided by the Collège des médecins du Québec, which contains information on a certain number of physicians who had previously obtained a permit to practice medicine in the province, irrespective of their status within the Collège at the time that the file was released. This data was not collected for statistical purposes and therefore, the file presents certain constraints that restrict our mortality analysis, in particular due to the absence of information regarding the population at risk of death in each of the periods studied here. That said, while we were conscious of the bias that could result from this, we have produced two estimates of these physicians' exposure to risk of death, in order to try to compensate for the file's limitations, in as much as possible. By using the first method of calculation, we have assessed mortality rates for quinquennial age groups of physicians between the ages of 40 and 75 that are currently part of the membership roll. Using the second method of calculation, we obtained mortality rates for physicians belonging to the same age groups, except that this time, registered physicians of all statuses were considered. We believe the mortality measurements for male physicians are acceptable as long as any analysis thereof doesn’t overlook the limitations of the data. The results obtained demonstrated a reduction in mortality among male physicians from one period to the next, but the differences were only significant for groups above the age of 60, especially upon comparing the periods of 1993-1998 and 2005-2010. In addition, during every period studied, mortality rates among the province's entire male population proved to be higher than the mortality rates among the registered male physicians present in the file; this result was obtained for both methods of calculation of the exposure to risk of death. Finally, this study did not demonstrate a significant difference between mortality among general practitioners and specialists.

1084	Le discours muséal à travers l'exposition des collections de quatre musées d'art : Montréal, Québec, Joliette et Sherbrooke	Art museums are the perfect settings to gaze at past and actual works of art. According to their mandate, the museums have to conciliate two functions that can be difficult to manage, that is to say their functions of enjoyment and education. Some favor one approach instead of the other, but each museum is subjective in the way it exhibits works of art. Even if the art seems to be displayed naturally in the galleries, everything that is related to the conception and the realisation of the exhibition is the object of a construction and results from a decision of the museum. In accordance with their choices, that is to say which objects are presented or not, and the way they are exhibited, the museums contribute to define what art is, and influence the meanings of the works of art. Consequently, each museum transmits its own vision of art history and its institutional values. This particular discourse can be foregrounded as much by the writings installed near the works of art as by the museography around them. With a comparative analysis of four fine arts museums from the province of Quebec (Canada), this thesis explores a typology of museums discourses, as well as the intertwined relations between the different components of those discourses and the works of art that are shown in their galleries.	collection , Museum , exhibition , Quebec art , museum discourse	en	10384.0
1085	Nietzsche et le problème de Socrate	The purpose of this thesis is to investigate Nietzsche’s analysis and assessment of the meaning and the impact of Socrates’ character on the classical and modern culture. To that effect, I will emphasize the question of Socrates’ identity, in order to introduce the crucial issue in Nietzsche’s analysis, namely the distinction between Socrates’ doctrine and his character. Nietzsche isolated Socrates’ character – which he defined through the categories of instinct, drive, and affect – from his doctrine, which he labelled socratism and defined through the Socratic equation reason = virtue = happiness. This thesis explores the three core elements Nietzsche used to explain how Socrates was able to seduce the Greeks: not only was Socrates a very erotic figure, he also introduced a new form of debate to Athens, and was considered an eminent physician by his contemporaries. Socrates’ appeal to the Greek is of fundamental importance to Nietzsche, since it prompted him to question Socrates’ inherent character, and his true impact on Athenian culture. It thus forms the crux of what he called “the problem of Socrates.” Nietzsche’s understanding of socratism as well as its impact on classical and modern culture allows him to revaluate all values within his own culture. To that effect, I reveal Nietzsche’s critiques of socratism – in particular, his belief that society needed to be liberated from socratism, since it denies all agency to individuals. Given that it was strongly motivated by the unconscious, socratism, according to Nietzsche, overemphasizes a certain morality in the struggle against our dominant impulses.

1086	Brain edema in acute liver failure and chronic liver disease: Similarities and differences	Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a complex neuropsychiatric syndrome that typically develops as a result of acute liver failure or chronic liver disease. Brain edema is a common feature associated with HE. In acute liver failure, brain edema contributes to an increase in intracranial pressure, which can fatally lead to brain stem herniation. In chronic liver disease, intracranial hypertension is rarely observed, even though brain edema may be present. This discrepancy in the development of intracranial hypertension in acute liver failure versus chronic liver disease suggests that brain edema plays a different role in relation to the onset of HE. Furthermore, the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the development of brain edema in acute liver failure and chronic liver disease are dissimilar. This review explores the types of brain edema, the cells, and pathogenic factors involved in its development, while emphasizing the differences in acute liver failure versus chronic liver disease. The implications of brain edema developing as a neuropathological consequence of HE, or as a cause of HE, are also discussed.

1087	À la cheville des temps : la construction du présent dans la littérature narrative française au tournant du XXIe siècle	This doctoral thesis highlights present-day French authors’ narrative strategies used to illustrate and conceive the present. Our central hypothesis is that through an act of utterance intermeshing discourse and narration, as well as the critical and pragmatic use of references to the past, today’s narrative literature offers a counterpoint to the “presentism” described by François Hartog (i.e. a retrospective look at eras in which the present is both the vantage point and the point under observation). By so doing, contemporary authors offer a system of historicities where the past and the future are linked to the present in order to reconcile the link between the three temporal categories and reveal a present which, otherwise, would remain narratively elusive or subrogated to the authority of a past or a future that dictates its behaviour.  By distancing their works from the fictional genre and from the narrative form it embodies, Pierre Bergounioux, François Bon, Olivier Cadiot, Annie Ernaux, Chloé Delaume, Jean Echenoz and Olivier Rolin, amongst others, are part of the enunciative tradition of the narrative, considered here as a literary genre in which the enunciation and the text in gestation are, in and of themselves, their own intrigue. In the contemporary narrative, the aim of the enunciation subject is to clarify its relationship to time by using enunciative scenes having to do with this quest and the conversation so that from a personal and intellectual anamnesis, as well as from the clash of a memory with its recounting, emerge the characteristics integral to the present experience. And yet, one of the characteristics of the present that the contemporary subject experiences seems to be a resistance to narration and to storytelling, which makes it almost impervious to literary analysis. Authors take up this opposition to storytelling by using, in an effort to bring the immediacy of the present to the foreground, the note, the journal entry, and literary genres that thwart narration, such as poetry. In spite of their enunciative efforts to distil the present from the operation that transforms it into the past, these authors are nevertheless faced, time and again, with having to live the immediate dissipation of the present and their inability to capture in a literary form its essence.

1088	Analyse de groupe d’un modèle de la plasticité idéale planaire et sur les solutions en termes d’invariants de Riemann pour les systèmes quasilinéaires du premier ordre	The objects under consideration in this thesis are systems of first-order quasilinear equations. In the first part of the thesis, a study is made of an ideal plasticity model from the point of view of the classical Lie point symmetry group. Planar flows are investigated in both the stationary and non-stationary cases. Two new vector fields are obtained. They complete the Lie algebra of the stationary case, and the subalgebras are classified into conjugacy classes under the action of the group. In the non-stationary case, a classification of the Lie algebras admissible under the chosen force is performed. For each type of force, the vector fields are presented. For monogenic forces, the algebra is of the highest possible dimension. Its classification into conjugacy classes is made. The symmetry reduction method is used to obtain explicit and implicit solutions of  several types. Some of them can be expressed in terms of one or two arbitrary functions of one variable. Others can be expressed in terms of Jacobi elliptic functions. Many solutions are interpreted physically in order to determine the shape of realistic extrusion dies. In the second part of the thesis, we examine solutions expressed in terms of Riemann invariants for first-order quasilinear systems. The generalized method of characteristics, along with a method based on conditional symmetries for Riemann invariants are extended so as to be applicable to systems in their elliptic regions. The applicability of the methods is illustrated by examples such as non-stationary ideal plasticity for an irrotational flow as well as fluid mechanics equations. A new approach is developed, based on the introduction of rotation matrices which satisfy certain algebraic  conditions. It is directly applicable to non-homogeneous and non-autonomous systems. Its efficiency is illustrated by examples which include a system governing the non-linear superposition of waves and particles. The general solution is constructed in explicit form.

1089	Contexte de genre, autonomie des femmes et utilisation des services de santé maternelle en milieu rural africain : analyse par modèles d’équations structurelles	In Africa, the lives of women and their offspring continue to be threatened at every birth because of the underuse of maternal health care. It is estimated that every year about a quarter of a million the number of maternal deaths and nearly four million children die before age five. Comparing the health patterns in sub-Saharan Africa with other contexts helps to better understand the reality of sub-Saharan Africa, where the risk of death in pregnancy is of the order of 1 to 31, while it is only 1 per 4300 in industrialized countries. This situation is preventable and most often is the result of under or non-use of maternal health services, lack of adequate health care facilities or skilled health personnel. This thesis seeks to understand how gender inequality within the household and in the community reinforces inequalities in the use of maternal health services, as well as the empirical relationship linking the various types of maternal health care uptakes. Specifically, it aims to 1) provide a measure of gender norms favorable to violence against women and to analyze its influence on women’s decision-making authority within the household, 2) simultaneously analyze the impact of these gender norms along with the women’s decision-making authority on the use of antenatal care and delivery assistance, and finally, 3) determine the influence of antenatal care on the use of assisted delivery. Each of these objectives faces substantial methodological issues, either measurement or selection bias, which the structural equation modeling approach we adopted overcomes. The results of our analysis, in the form of scientific articles, are based on the data from Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) of Ghana, Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania and are related to women living in rural areas. Our first article provides a measure of gender norms and, more specifically, those related to violence against women by using the approach of latent variables. The five questions of the DHS on women's attitudes about the legitimacy of violence allowed measuring these gender norms at contextual level. The results suggest that this measure has good validity criteria as the Cronbach's alpha ranged from 0.85 to 0.94 for Kenya to Ghana, the chi-square is insignificant everywhere, the RMSEA is below 0.05 and the CFI above 0.96 and saturation are mostly higher than 0.7 in all countries. On the other hand, using multilevel structural equation modeling, we found that beyond their own attitude toward violence against women, women who live in an environment where gender norms are more favorable to violence are more likely to be of low or no decision-making autonomy (compared to high decision-making autonomy) in all the countries studied. The second Article documents the influence of the gender inequality identified at the contextual level by the gender norms favorable to violence against women and at the individual level by the women’s autonomy of decision-making within the household, on the occurrence of antenatal care during the first quarter, and the use of at least four antenatal care and assisted delivery with skilled professional. Also using multilevel structural equation modeling on the same data of article 1, we find that each of these dependent variables is strongly influenced by the cluster in which the woman lives. In other words, her place of residence determines the maternal health behavior she adopts. Similarly, controlling for other variables, our results show that women who live in an environment where gender norms related to violence against women are higher, have on average, a greater chance of not giving birth with a qualified staff in Ghana and Uganda, of not starting their antenatal care in the first trimester in the same countries, and of not reaching at least four antenatal care visits in Tanzania. By cons, this contextual variable does not significantly affect the use of maternal health care in Kenya. Finally, the results show that norms in favor of gender violence against women are more critical to understand the use of maternal health care in the countries studied than the women’s decision-making autonomy.  Chapter VII is the last empirical paper of the thesis and examines the effects of prenatal care on the use of skilled birth attendance and also investigates the role of the content of prenatal care in this relationship. Previous studies on the topic have failed to control for possible endogeneity biases, limiting the validity of their conclusions. Our findings point to the existence of important biases in Kenya and Tanzania, where the estimated effect of prenatal care on the use of skilled birth attendance is highly biased downwards when endogeneity is not taken into account in the statistical model. Furthermore, with the exception of Ghana and, to a lesser extent, of Tanzania, our findings indicate that the beneficial effects of prenatal health care are completely mediated by the content of services that women receive. This study emphasizes the role of healthcare providers who, to effectively reach populations, must also act as leaders in their community.

1090	A mitochondrial perspective on striated muscle physiopathology: insights from sepsis, denervation, and dystrophinopathies	Mitochondria are increasingly being recognized for their role in contributing in cellular damage. Mitochondrial dysfunctions, in addition to causing energy failure, contribute to apoptotic signaling, stimulate ROS production and calcium overload. These are all features of various types of myopathies. This thesis sheds light on how mitochondrial dyfunctions may contribute to the pathogenesis in certain myopathies that have been found to show mitochondrial abnormalities. Specifically, we found that although mitochondrial dysfunctions are involved in denervation-associated atrophy, desensitizing mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening through genetic ablation of CyclophilinD does not prevent mitochondrial apoptotic signaling nor atrophy in this model of chronic inactivity. We also observed mitochondrial dysfunctions in the Duchenne dystrophic muscle that were improved after PGC1-α transfection, which also resulted in an amelioration of the disease presentation. Finally, we found that mitochondrial recycling, led by Parkin and alternate mitophagy pathways a crucial component of cardiac recovery in sepsis.	mitochondria , striated muscle , muscular dystrophy , denervation , sepsis , mitophagy , cardiomyopathy , atrophy , biogenesis , cardiac metabolism , cardiomyopathie	en	10334.0
1091	Évaluation du processus : analyse de l’évaluabilité et de la mise en œuvre d’une stratégie d’amélioration de la couverture vaccinale au Burkina Faso	Immunization is one of the most important subjects in public health despite constant on-going controversies. In the context of this research it is more its accessibility that is at issue. This particular research is situated in the perspective of the comprehensive approaches to evaluation and analyses an immunization improvement strategy using a three steps process evaluation after documenting its context. The perceptions and factors influencing immunization coverage before the intervention are assessed, as well as the conceptual and theoretical foundations of the intervention, the implementation and reception of the intervention and mechanisms used to attain the results.  The results indicate that immunization is integrated into the local strategies used for protection and grounded in the local concept of risk. Results show also that the context associated with socioeconomic factors and the relations between parents and health services contribute to explain the relatively low complete immunization coverage rate (50.3%) before the intervention. The exploratory analysis indicates that the intervention had an implicit theory and a philosophy. Although the intervention was adequate for an evaluation, discrepancies in the implantation compromised the possibilities of validating its initial theory and philosophy. The descriptive analysis showed that more than 95% of the recipients were reached by the intervention and the received dose of intervention was acceptable indicating that the intervention is a workable strategy that needs to be improved. The complete immunization coverage after the intervention was 87.3%; it was influenced positively by factors including parents’ level of knowledge and the fact that the child was born in a health center, and negatively by the long distances from household to immunization place. The strategies involved in the attainment of the results used parents’ knowledge improvement as a principal procedure. This contains an underlying mechanism mainly related to the perception of the opportunities that immunization permits for preventing various health, social and economic risks. However, complementary approaches tend to maximize intervention outcome by using the power given to female community immunization facilitators and social coercion. The research contributes to highlight the relationship between evaluability assessment and process evaluation, to propose a new conceptual and operational understanding of dose of intervention administered and dose of intervention received. On practical grounds, this research recommended the improvement of the immunization activities staff profile and the widespread adoption of the strategy after it improvement. Indications are provided to improve the intervention and to inform founding agencies.

1092	Une approche multi-agents pour le développement d'un jeu vidéo	A multi-agent system is composed of several autonomous agents that interact with each other in a common environment. This thesis aims to demonstrate the use of a multi- agent system for the development of a video game. First, a justification of the artificial intelligence’s concepts used in this master’s thesis is exposed. Subsequently, a practical approach is used in developping a video game. To do this, the game was developed from an existing single-agent video game and modified into a multi-agent system in order to properly highlight the benefits of a multi-agent system in a video game. The development of this game also demonstrate the application of other concepts in artificial intelligence such as pathfindinig and behaviour trees. In summary, the use of a multi- agent system has achieved a more realistic behavior for the non-human players and a more competitive gameplay for the human player.

1093	Étude longitudinale des liens prédictifs entre les traits de personnalité et les symptômes intériorisés à l'adolescence	The goal of this longitudinal study was to determine if personality traits (according to the Big Five model) in early adolescence (12-13 years old) can predict internalizing symptoms two years later (14-15 years old), after controlling for the initial level of internalizing symptoms and the influence of various known risk factors. Data came from a prospective longitudinal study. The sample includes 1036 adolescents from eight high schools in the province of Quebec. Adolescents filled a self-reported questionnaire. Structural equation models first confirmed that internalizing symptoms can be conceptualized as a latent variable. Other models showed that some personality traits do predict subsequent internalizing symptoms. However, unlike adult studies, the role of Emotional stability and Extraversion is not significant after controlling for known risk factors and gender. In this study, it is rather Conscientiousness and Agreeableness which are significantly related to subsequent internalizing symptoms. Indeed, a low level of Conscientiousness and a high level of Agreeableness are significantly related to subsequent internalizing symptoms among adolescents. The results also confirmed the important role of peer relationships factors. Finally, multiple-group structural equation models showed significant gender-specific predictive relations. This study confirms that adolescents’ personality traits can play a role in the development of internalizing symptoms, which supports their relevance for both theory and clinical practice.

1094	Effect of exercise training on preeclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension in a mouse model	Preeclampsia is among the leading causes of perinatal mortality and morbidity, affecting 2-7% of pregnancies. Its incidence increases to 10-25% in already hypertensive women. To date, no treatment, aside from delivery, is known. Interestingly, several studies have reported that exercise training (ExT) can reduce preeclampsia prevalence although the available studies are considered insufficient. Therefore, the aim of this study is to determine the impact of ExT when practiced before and during gestation on pregnancy outcome in a mouse model of preeclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension (SPE). To do so, mice overexpressing both human angiotensinogen and renin (R+A+) were used because they are hypertensive at baseline and they develop many hallmark features of SPE. Mice were trained by placing them in a cage with access to a running wheel 4 weeks before and during gestation. ExT in this study prevented the rise in blood pressure at term observed in the sedentary transgenic mothers. This may be realized through an increased activity of the angiotensin-(1-7) axis in the aorta. In addition, ExT prevented the increase in albumin/creatinine ratio. Moreover, placental alterations were prevented with training in transgenic mice, leading to improvements in placental and fetal development. Placental mRNA and circulating levels of sFlt-1 were normalized with training. Additionally, the increase in angiotensin II type I receptor and the decrease in Mas receptor protein were reversed with training. ExT appears to prevent many SPE-like features that develop in this animal model and may be of use in the prevention of preeclampsia in women.

1095	Caractérisation neuro-immunitaire d'un modèle d'encéphalomyélite auto-immune expérimentale spontanée	Multiple sclerosis is an idiopathic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system. It is characterized by the formation of focal perivascular lesions and demyelination of the surrounding area, which appear concomitantly to a massive immune cell infiltration and disruption of the blood brain barrier. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis is the animal model most extensively used for the study of multiple sclerosis. Unfortunately, this model does not mimic many aspects of the human disease. The goal of this project is to further the characterization of a new transgenic model of spontaneous experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, the TCR1640 model, and to validate it as a relevant tool for the study of multiple sclerosis physiopathology and treatment. The TCR1640 mouse possesses a transgenic T cell receptor which recognizes a myelin peptide and triggers an autoimmune response against endogenous myelin in the central nervous system. In situ and in vitro observations have led to the identification of early changes which appear at the neurovascular unit in presymptomatic TCR1640 animals. This early disruption of blood brain barrier homeostasis is linked to the establishment of a proinflammatory immune profile in the periphery. Animals at the chronic stage show sustained inflammation of the central nervous system parenchyma and massive leukocyte infiltration, compared to animals in acute phase of disease. An in vivo experiment has allowed modulating the disease by treatment with a multiple sclerosis-approved therapy, in wild type mice which had received reactivated CD4+ T cells from TCR1640 animals. Finally, the implication of new cell adhesion molecules in the development and maintenance of spontaneous experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis has been suggested by in vitro study of melanoma cell adhesion molecule (CD146) and activated leucocyte cell adhesion molecule (CD166). The results obtained in this study suggest that the TCR1640 model is a valuable asset in the study of neuroimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis. It could also be used to validate new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of this disease.

1096	Un outil d’évaluation neurocognitive des interactions humain-machine	More and more researches on Human-Computer Interactions (HCI) are trying to perform detailed analyses of interaction to determine its influence on users’ behaviours. A particular emphasis is now put on emotional reactions during the interaction, whether it’s from the perspective of user experience evaluation or user performance. Standard qualitative approaches are limited because they are based on observations and interviews after the interaction, therefore limiting the precision of the diagnosis. User experience and emotional reactions being, by nature, highly dynamic and contextualized, evaluation approaches should be the same to accurately diagnose the quality of interaction. This thesis presents an evaluation approach, both dynamic and quantitative, which allows contextualising users’ emotional reactions to help identify their causes during the interaction with a system. To this end, our work focuses on three main axes: 1) automatic task recognition using machine learning modeling of eye tracking and interaction data; 2) automatic inference of psychological constructs (emotional activation, emotional valence, and cognitive load) through physiological signals analysis; and 3) diagnosis of users’ reactions during interaction based on the coupling of the two previous operations. The ideas and development of our approach are illustrated using two experimental contexts: e-commerce and simulation-based training. We also present the tool we implemented in order to allow HCI professionals (e.g.: user experience expert, training supervisor, or game designer) to use our evaluation approach to assess interaction. This tool is designed to facilitate the triangulation of measuring instruments and the integration with more classical Human-Computer Interaction methods (ex.: surveys and observation coding).

1097	Processus post-transcriptionnels inédits dans la mitochondrie des diplonémides	Our laboratory has recently discovered an unprecedented mode of expression of mitochondrial genes in D. papillatum, a biflagellate protozoan. In addition to its mtDNA formed of hundreds of circular chromosomes, genes are fragmented. For example, the cox1 gene which encodes the subunit one of the cytochrome oxidase complex, comprises nine modules carried by nine chromosomes. The cox1 mRNA is obtained by trans-splicing and is also edited by the insertion of six uridines between two modules. My thesis project focused on the study of post-transcriptional processes in diplonemid mitochondria. We characterized the fragmentation of cox1 in three other species belonging to two diplonemids genera: Diplonema ambulator, Diplonema sp. 2 and Rhynchopus euleeides.  The cox1 gene is fragmented into nine modules in all species but the modules are carried by chromosomes of different size and sequences from one species to another. We have shown that there are no motifs for classical introns, including spliceosomal and archaeal introns, as well as introns of group I and II, that might be implicated in the trans-splicing of cox1 modules. No significant complementarity exists between the flanking regions of two neighboring modules, nor are any conserved residues within a species or across species. We therefore concluded that the trans-splicing of cox1 in diplonemids involves a novel mechanism implicating trans rather than cis-factors. Trans-splicing and editing of cox1 probably involve guide RNAs, but it is also possible that the trans-factors are proteins or DNA molecules. The study of different species has also shown that the insertion of six uridines between two cox1 modules in mRNA is a shared trait in these diplonemids. We discovered that four other mitochondrial genes are also edited in D. papillatum and that RNA editing is not limited to mRNA. So, fragmented genes and RNA editing are common characteristics of diplonemids.  We elucidated D. papillatum’s mitochondrial transcript maturation steps. All transcripts undergo three coordinated and precise processes including end processing, trans-splicing and / or editing and polyadenylation. The processing of the 5 'and 3' ends gives rise to three kinds of maturation intermediates. A primary transcript with one free end can bind to its neighbor and trans-splicing occurs without directionality. In the case of edited transcripts, editing precedes trans-splicing. These studies have prepared the ground for functional studies of trans-splicing and RNA editing with the long term goal to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in post-transcriptional regulation in this intriguing system.

1098	"Sectaire et ""inter-dit"" : introduction à la dimension du croire dans l'écoute du dire des personnes en cause dans le sectaire"	The thesis questions the conditions of listening concerning the testimonies of people who lived a sectarian experience, as well as the ethical and methodological issues arising from the way literature proposes to understand the telling of these people. A literature review shows that the main theoretical frameworks used to explain the sectarian (alienation, mental manipulation, addiction) determine the way the telling of these people is listened. Thereby, the meaning of the sectarian directs not only our understanding of people, but it also outlines the conditions of the listening. The premise of the dissertation is that the introduction of the « dit-mention » (the mension of the telling) of the believe as an interpretative intersection leads to develop a listening concerning both the speaking subject and the dimension of the being. From a theorization of believe as a movement of the living distinct from religion, spirituality, belief and mysticism, the dissertation moves the problematic of a sectarian experience from its polemic structure to give full value to the telling of people. Thus, by setting the listening on its symbolic side, that is in a way that takes into account the subject's relation to the Other, the meaning produced by an act of listening to a believe does not rely anymore on an external meaning to explain and report a sectarian experience. It is produced by the binding of the signifiers together, which opens a research space where something of the subject can happen. The hypothesis of a subject « à croire sur parole » (which words must be believed) then offers a basis for a differential act of listening, since it allows the working out of an effective knowledge, a knowledge that moves, surprises, revives the subject.

1099	Pratiques et usages de l'Europe dans le maintien de la paix : la coopération franco-irlandaise au Tchad	This dissertation is about European Union-led military operations and their effects on two issues: processes of Europeanization and the evolution of peacekeeping. For rational choice scholars, Europeanization reflects the preferences of Europe’s main powers, which impose those preferences on other states, especially when it comes to defence policies. On the opposite, constructivists argue that handling international crises collectively results in adaptations and a certain rapprochement of national ways to do things. To sort out this debate, this research puts forward and defends a sociological approach to EU military operations, which is inspired by the practice turn in international relations and usages of Europe in European studies. This approach emphasizes the context of interaction, actors’ social strategies, and the merits of an interpretive method grounded in actors’ experiences. The empirical demonstration rests upon a qualitative and comparative analysis of two most different cases: French and Irish actors during the military operation EUFOR Tchad/RCA, in which they got involved. The research concludes that Europeanization is not a linear and homogenous phenomenon, and that its shape mostly depends on the context and actors under scrutiny. At the political and decisional level (in Brussels), national logics prevail, and each actor tries to take advantage of its opportune resources (material, ideal, symbolic) in order to enforce its national preferences. However, the further one moves away from Brussels (towards the operation’s headquarters or the field), the more military actors – the main actors concerned with EU operations – develop common practices that come on top of their national singularities. The operational context of peacekeeping yields dynamics of socialization and learning, which themselves make common usages of military Europe possible. These usages make up the grounds of a “European” approach to peacekeeping, which is a hybrid combination of existing practices imported from other contexts (national, NATO, UN) and new, EU-specific practices. However, this Europeanization tends to remain mostly at the military’s level. It does not bring about convergence at the formal, political and decisional level, where national dynamics still prevail.

1100	Bridging Knowledge Gaps in the Management of Acute Coronary Syndromes	Background Acute occlusion of an artery of the heart results in acute coronary syndromes (ACS), either with ST-segment elevation (STEMI) or without ST-segment elevation (1). STEMI requires urgent treatment to restore coronary artery flow either by primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or fibrinolytic therapy (FL) (2).  Although several randomized controlled trials (RCTs)  demonstrate the superiority of primary PCI in reducing mortality compared to FL (2), the benefit of primary PCI over FL remains uncertain in unselected “real-life” patients (3,4).  FL can be administered either in the pre-hospital setting (i.e., pre-hospital FL (PHL)) or at the hospital. PHL is rarely available outside Europe (5,6).  Insights into the organization of PHL systems of care may promote more widespread use of PHL. Risk stratification of ACS patients should be prompt to ensure timely PCI for high-risk patients and to avoid unnecessary intervention in low-risk patients (7).  Despite the availability of numerous ACS risk scores, there is still no simple risk score that can be easily applied in the initial management of ACS patients (8).  Objectives The objectives of this doctoral dissertation were to address these current knowledge gaps in the optimal management of ACS. The objectives were to: 1) evaluate the efficacy, effectiveness, and safety of primary PCI and FL, (2) describe the infrastructure, processes and outcomes of several international PHL systems; and (3) develop and validate a novel clinical risk score for early risk stratification of ACS patients.   Methods To address these objectives, I completed Bayesian hierarchical random-effects meta-analyses of published RCTs and observational studies which compare primary PCI and FL in patients with STEMI.  I undertook a survey of the infrastructure, processes and outcomes of PHL in several European and North American pre-hospital emergency systems.  Finally, I developed and validated an ACS risk score called the Canadian ACS (C-ACS). Results Primary PCI was superior to FL in reducing short-term mortality in RCTs and observational studies.  However, the long-term survival benefit of primary PCI was noted only in RCTs, and not in the observational studies. PHL can be effectively delivered by health care professionals with variable levels of expertise. The new risk score, C-ACS, has good discriminant properties for short- and long-term mortality in patients with ACS. Conclusions  The first manuscript of this dissertation has been recognized as one of the most valuable recent publications in STEMI management and has contributed to reorganization of STEMI care in Ontario.  The other two manuscripts in this dissertation provide practical information and tools for health professionals caring for patients with ACS.  In summary, this doctoral dissertation has and will continue to contribute to improve access to high quality care for patients with ACS.

1101	Function of the immunoregulatory CD4-CD8- T cells in the context of autoimmune diabetes	Immune tolerance is dependent on the immune system discriminating between self and non-self. A break in immune tolerance results in autoimmunity, which can lead to the destruction of healthy organs, glands, joints or the central nervous system. Any disease that results from such an aberrant immune response is termed an autoimmune disease. Autoimmune diabetes, which is also referred to as juvenile diabetes and type 1 diabetes, results from an autoimmune attack on the insulin-producing β cells located within the islets of Langerhans of the pancreas. Although autoimmune diabetes is treatable through a combination of insulin therapy, diet and exercise, many chronic complications may arise in patients, including, but not limited to, blindness, cardiovascular disease, kidney failure and amputation. Due to the many complications associated with long-term autoimmune diabetes, research continues to better understand all the factors implicated in disease progression in order to develop new therapies that will prevent, reverse and/or cure this disease.     A prominent role in the generation and maintenance of immune tolerance has been attributed to the number and function of regulatory cell subsets. One of these regulatory cell populations, namely CD4-CD8- (double negative, DN) T cells, have been studied in both mice and humans for their contribution to peripheral tolerance, disease prevention and their potential for use in cellular therapy. DN T cells are of particular therapeutic interest because they exhibit an antigen-specific immunoregulatory potential in various experimental settings, including the prevention of autoimmune diabetes. Indeed, using a transgenic system, we have shown that autoimmune diabetes-prone mice carry fewer DN T cells and that this phenotype contributes to autoimmune diabetes susceptibility, where a single transfer of DN T cells is sufficient to prevent diabetes progression in otherwise autoimmune diabetes-prone mice. These results suggest that DN T cells may be of therapeutic interest for diabetic patients. However, we must first validate these results using a non-transgenic setting, which is more physiologically relevant to humans.   The main objective of this thesis is to determine the immunoregulatory function of the DN T cells as well as the therapeutic potential of these cells in the prevention of autoimmune diabetes in the non-transgenic setting. Here, we show that diabetes-resistant mice present with a higher proportion and cell number of DN T cells than diabetes-susceptible mice in the non-transgenic setting, which associates a deficiency in DN T cell number with disease susceptibility. We determine that DN T cells eliminate activated B cells in vitro via a perforin/granzyme-dependent pathway, where the function of DN T cells is equal between the diabetes-resistant and -susceptible mice, demonstrating that the association to autoimmune diabetes is due to a deficiency in DN T cell number rather than function. Interestingly, we show that non-transgenic DN T cells eliminate B cells loaded with islet antigen, but not B cells loaded with an irrelevant antigen, in vitro. Importantly, we establish that the transfer of activated DN T cells could prevent autoimmune diabetes development in the non-transgenic setting. Interestingly, we reveal that DN T cells migrate to the pancreatic islets and undergo preferential activation and proliferation within the pancreatic lymph nodes. Moreover, the transfer of DN T cells results in a decrease in both germinal center B cells directly within the pancreatic islets as well serum insulin autoantibody levels, which correlates with the aforementioned findings. Altogether, the results presented in this thesis have allowed us to enhance our understanding of the function of DN T cells both in vitro and in vivo as well as demonstrate the therapeutic potential for DN T cells as a novel cellular therapeutic for autoimmune diabetes.

1102	No Laughing Matter: Shakespearean Melancholy and the Transformation of Comedy	My dissertation argues for a reconsideration of melancholy as an integral component of Shakespearean comedy. I analyse its presence across the comic canon, from early farcical plays through mature comic works, to the late romances that conclude Shakespeare’s career. In doing so, I denote its shift from an individual, humoural characterization to a more spectral incarnation that engrains itself in the dramatic fabric of the plays it inhabits. Ultimately, its manifestation purports to the cyclical nature of emotions and the mixture of mirth and sadness that the aforementioned late plays put forth. The thesis repositions Shakespearean melancholy away from humoural, psychoanalytical and other theoretical frameworks and towards an early modern context, where the term “melancholy” channels a plethora of social, scientific, and dramatic meanings. After a brief overview of the prevalence of melancholy in early modern England, the following chapters attest to the pervasiveness of melancholy within Shakespeare’s comic corpus, suggesting that, rather than a mere foil to the spirits of mirth and revelry, it proves elemental to comic structures as an agent of dramatic progression that fundamentally alters its generic make-up. I initially consider the ways in which melancholy is developed in The Comedy of Errors and Love’s Labor’s Lost, as an isolated condition, easily dismissible by what I refer to as the symmetrical structure of comic resolution. In both plays, I suggest, the failure to completely eradicate melancholy translates into highly ambiguous comic conclusions that pave the way for subsequent comic works, where melancholy’s presence grows increasingly cumbersome. Chapter three reads Much Ado about Nothing and The Merchant of Venice as prime dramatic examples of the phenomenon by which prominent comic characters not only fail to offer a clear cause for their overwhelming melancholy, but refuse to mitigate it for the benefit of the plays at hand. The melancholy found here creates emotional loose ends from which a sense of malaise that will take full effect in later comedies emanates.       In the next chapter, As You Like It and Twelfth Night are held as a landmark in Shakespeare’s treatment of comic melancholy. The chapter suggests that these plays complete the break from individual melancholic characterization, which no longer seem suitable to the comic style towards which Shakespeare progressively turns. Consequently, the final chapter undertakes an analysis of Pericles and The Winter’s Tale to demonstrate the fact that, in his concluding dramatic phase, Shakespeare returns to the comic taxonomies of melancholy in order to foster more forceful, lingering emotional impacts as a form of dramatic impressionism, a relinquishing of details in favour of more powerful emotional responses. In a brief coda, I read The Two Noble Kinsmen as the culmination of the dramatic treatment in melancholy in Shakespeare, where the spectral wistfulness that characterized the late plays reaches a breaking point.

1103	On the Effects of Mergers on Equilibrium Outcomes in a Common Property Renewable Asset Oligopoly	This paper examines a dynamic game of exploitation of a common pool of some renewable asset by agents that sell the result of their exploitation on an oligopolistic market. A Markov Perfect Nash Equilibrium of the game is used to analyze the effects of a merger of a subset of the agents. We study the impact of the merger on the equilibrium production strategies, on the steady states, and on the profitability of the merger for its members. We show that there exists an interval of the asset's stock such that any merger is profitable if the stock at the time the merger is formed falls within that interval. That includes mergers that are known to be unprofitable in the corresponding static equilibrium framework.	Mergers , Dynamic games , Oligopoly , Common property , Renewable resources	en	10091.0
1104	The Taxation of Nonrenewable Natural Resources	We provide an analytical overview of the distortionary eff ects of some common forms of taxes faced by the nonrenewable resources sector of the economy. In the category of taxes meant speci fically to capture the resource rent, we look at a speci c severance tax, an 'ad valorem' severance tax, a profi t tax and a 'lump-sum' tax, with emphasis on their e ffects on the extraction decisions over time and on the initial reserves to be developed. In the category of taxes meant for all sectors of the economy, we look at the corporate income tax and its special provision for the resource sector in the form of a depletion allowance, with emphasis on the eff ects on the intra-industry resource extraction decisions and on the inter-industry allocation of investment.

1105	A Characterization of Exact Non-atomic Market Games	Continuous exact non-atomic games are naturally associated to certain operators between Banach spaces. It thus makes sense to study games by means of the corresponding operators. We characterize non-atomic exact market games in terms of the properties of the associated operators. We also prove a separation theorem for weak compact sets of countably additive measures, which is of independent interest.

1106	Réduction de la durée de vie des porteurs de charge dans le silicium noir par implantation ionique	The goal of this project is to study the effect of crystalline damage on the optoelectronic properties of photodetectors made from “black silicon” (i.e. femtosecond-laser microstructured silicon, which make it appear black).  Black silicon samples were annealed then implanted with either 300 keV Si+, 1500 keV Si+ or 2000 keV H+ ions.  The fluence used for the implantation was 1E11, 1E12 or 1E13 ion/cm2, resulting in nine different samples with a crystalline damage distribution of various depth and concentration.  Photodetectors were fabricated on these samples, together with a control detector made from a non-implanted black silicon sample and then characterized.  The I-V curves, spectral responsivities and frequency responses of the detectors were measured in short-circuit or under bias and compared.  The detectors display an approximately ohmic behavior, but those implanted at a higher fluence show a slightly better current rectification.  The implantation had a strong effect on the responsivity.  The external quantum efficiency increased from (0.069 ± 0.001) % at 900 nm for the control detector up to (26.0 ± 0.5) % for the 1E12 cm-2, 1500 keV Si+ detector.  With an applied bias of -0.50 V, the responsivity is increased and some detectors exhibit above unity photocurrent gain.  Similarly, the cutoff frequencies of the implanted detectors are higher.  A contactless experiment was attempted for the measurement of the effective carrier lifetime. The implantation damage was expected to reduce the carrier lifetime.  The setup didn’t meet all experimental conditions required to detect the signal using frequency-domain photo-induced reflection.

1108	Dessine-moi une maison : psychanalyse d’un processus de design	This research is a continuation of those invested in order to clarify the question of the design process, especially the architectural design of the house. It also seeks to develop the reflexivity of the designer on his acts by offering a view from the perspective of psychoanalysis. It extends the initiatives brought by the third generation of design methods researches focusing on an unexplored field: the unconscious process of architectural design. Its’ problematic is the unconscious origins of creative work of the designer in architecture. Creation is one of the important topics of psychoanalysis, several psychoanalytic concepts like Freudian sublimation, try to explore and explain it. The design being a creative discipline, psychoanalysis can lighten us about the design process, and give us the opportunity to observe and approach it. The architectural metaphor, used to express the Freudian theory, is also the scope of several psychoanalytic theories and concepts. Architecture in general, and particularly architecture of the house, offers a field where many of the psychoanalytic concepts can be observed and applied, because of the emotional investigation that the designer, the user, or the builder invest in it. This research will approach the architectural example according to the concepts developed by the three most important psychoanalytic theories of Freud, Lacan and Jung. The application of these concepts will be made through an auto-analysis that puts the designer in a double stance: the research subject and the researcher, which highly promotes the reflexivity that the design researches look for. Free association is the first step that will start the self-study process, and follows its development. Applied to the speech and the shape of the house, free association will seek to distinguish several psychological mechanisms that inform our investigation. The results of the application of Freudian concepts will serve as a basis on which the concepts of Lacanian and Jungian theory will be applied. At the end of this analysis, we would be able to present a model of the unconscious process of design that lead to the creation of the house used as an example. We will discover the nature of the unconscious process that precedes and follows the creative work of the designer. We will also see how this process is fed from designer experiences dating back to the early years of his childhood. This would help to see the possibility of applying psychoanalytic concepts in architectural design and help identifying potential approaches to the contribution of psychoanalysis to the practice of design and it’s teaching.	architecture , creation , design process , house , psychoanalysis	en	10047.0
1109	Les inégalités sociales dans le dépistage du cancer du sein, quand le système s'en mêle...	Research has demonstrated significant disparities amongst populations in regard to chances of survival to breast cancer. It has proven to be the case that immigrant women are more likely to die of breast cancer than non-immigrants. Several studies attribute this to poor adherence to mammography testing within this group of women. Thus, late detection of this disease unavoidably reduces their chances of survival. In Quebec, the Quebec Breast Cancer Screening Program sends a letter of invitation to women when they attain 50 years of age. This letter is a prescription for a screening mammogram. The present study has demonstrated that this letter is a barrier for immigrant communities in Montreal, ore specifically the underprivileged Haitian community. This is due to their low level of literacy. Consecutive to the results obtained in this study, we suggest modifications to the letter of invitation, in order to ensure that its content is accessible to all women, including women in underprivileged circumstances.	breast cancer , mammography , screening , immigrants , socioeconomical status , strategies for breast cancer screening promotion , breast cancer screening programs	en	10038.0
1110	Sur la pertinence de la culture en pragmatique	There is a strong division between those who believe in linguistic relativity and those who tend more towards universalism. Since Whorf, many experiments were conducted to determine how and if language could influence thoughts, but not often they were focussed on pragmatics. I revisit the debate on linguistic relativism by considering pragmatics only. There are two different theoretical models in pragmatics at the time, and they support opposing views on relativism: ethnopragmatics and relevance theory. Using models of cultural interaction from anthropology, in particular the ideas of Bourdieu and the concept of assemblage, I show that relevance theory is flexible enough to be able to incorporate a relativistic component, without having to modify its core principles. To illustrate this necessary transformation, I introduce the Cognitive Identity that could interact with the universalistic relevance of the model and still be relativistic itself.

1111	Localisation et fonction de CHK2 en mitose	Centrosomes function primarily as microtubule-organizing centres and play a crucial role during mitosis by organizing the bipolar spindle. In addition to this function, centrosomes act as reaction centers where numerous key regulators meet to control cell cycle progression. One of these factors involved in genome stability, the checkpoint kinase CHK2, was shown to localize at centrosomes throughout the cell cycle. Here, we clarify that CHK2 only localized at centrosomes during mitosis. Using wild-type and CHK2-/- HCT116 human colon cancer cells, or human osteosarcoma U2OS cells depleted for CHK2 with small hairpin RNAs, we show that several CHK2 antibodies are non-specific for immunofluorescence and cross-react with an unknown centrosomal protein(s). To analyse further CHK2 localization, we established cells expressing inducible GFP-CHK2 and Flag-CHK2 fusion proteins. We show that CHK2 localizes to the nucleus in interphase cells but that a fraction of CHK2 associates with centrosomes in mitotic cells, from early mitotic stages until cytokinesis. In contrast to previous data obtained by A. Stolz and colleagues with the human colon carcinoma HCT116 cell line, our experiments exploring the possible functions for CHK2 during mitosis did not support a role for CHK2 in the bipolar spindle formation and the timely progression of mitosis in human osteosarcoma U2OS cells.

1112	«Le grand retour» : le processus de rapatriement chez l’étudiant en échange à l’international	The rapidly increasing interconnectedness of the world brought on by the expansion of globalization calls for a redefinition of the traditional notion of higher education. As such, many Canadian educators, government officials, and students alike are insisting on the importance of internationalizing higher education through intercultural exchanges and studying abroad, in the hopes that current and future generations of Canadians will acquire a global perspective and become citizens of the world (Advisory Panel on Canada’s International Education Strategy, 2012). Yet in order to ensure that students are gaining the most from their international experience, it is important to understand the impact that studying abroad can have, both in the short and long term. While many past studies have focused on the short-term, or the actual time spent abroad and subsequent impacts, few have examined the exchange student’s re-entry into their society of origin and subsequent long-term effects, such as personal developments that surface during repatriation.  In this qualitative study, eight undergraduate students from the University of Montreal were interviewed regarding how they lived their reintegration into Montreal society after returning home post studying abroad. While academics that have broached the subject in the past tended to view repatriation as a static series of events, our data analysis showed a similar pattern that surfaced in all respondents’ testimonials allowing us to henceforth recognize this repatriation as an interconnected three-step process. By borrowing from Kim’s theory of Intercultural Personhood (2008), we are now able to define these three distinct phases as stress, adaptation, and growth; all of which not only help to better understand the difficulties students face during their process of reintegration but also facilitate the identification of possible identity transformations that surface upon re-entry and how these transformations impact the repatriation process.	study abroad , repatriation , reintegration , exchange student , re-entry , international higher education	en	10018.0
1113	D’une structure de gouvernance canado-américaine pour la gestion du Passage du Nord-Ouest : l’apport du transgouvernementalisme	Transgovernmentalism is based on the existence of transboundary networks between sub-national entities exercising similar functions in order to address common issues. Canada-United States transgovernmentalism can be characterised by limited relinquishment of sovereignty by partners, significant participation of regional actors, informality in the relations and the integration of the private and public sectors and civil society into mixed networks.   The governance model in place in the St. Lawrence basin and the Great Lakes region presents all the features of the typical model of Canada-United States transgovernmentalism. A thorough analysis indeed reveals a complex and strong matrix of transgovernmental networks which ramifications now extend far beyond the strict framework of agreements under whose auspices these networks arose.  However, if transgovernmentalism is the solution adopted by both governments for the collaborative management of the St. Lawrence basin and the Great Lakes, it is an appropriate governance model for the management of the Northwest Passage? Although the model in place in the region of the St. Lawrence basin and the Great Lakes can not be entirely reproduced for the management of the Northwest Passage, a “bottom-up” transgovernmental model focused on the implementation of common rules in the field of navigation, and on collaboration at the operational level to ensure the implementation of this regulation, is appropriate for the management of Northwest Passage.

1114	Queering the Cross-Cultural Imagination: (Trans)Subjectivity and Wilson Harris's The Palace of the Peacock	This study contains two parts: a theoretical component and a literary text. The theoretical component discusses desire as a thematic and philosophical methodology in Wilson Harris’s The Palace of the Peacock. Chapter one argues that Harris paradoxically makes use of forms of empirical desire to demonstrate its epistemological limits. Chapter two discusses the problematic situation of female subjectivity in relation to male subjects, through environmental and anatomic metaphors, which Harris’s writing necessitates. Chapter three discusses contemporary poetics in order to situate my impetus for literary writing and attempts to salvage some of Harris’s theoretical concepts in dialogue with my own poetics. Chapter four contains the creative writing project, HEROISM/EULOGIES—an excerpt from a larger project—that charts the movement of various subjects across an imagined American landscape.

More precisely, results for the convergence of the first order of the maximum of a set of Gaussian variables will be presented. Some results on the convergence of the second order, and of the law will also be explained. The models presented here are the Gaussian field of i.i.d. variables, the hierarchical model and the Gaussian free fields model. These fields differ from one another by their correlation structure. The main result of this study is that the first order convergence in probability of the maximum is the same for the three models. Finally, numerical simulations results will be presented to confirm theoretical results.	Maxima , Gaussian free field , Hierarchical model , Random walk	en	9986.0
1116	Abstraction et plasticité sonore : une nouvelle approche à la composition de musique acousmatique	My artistic practice can be divided in two paths: acousmatic music composition and abstract painting. Far from independent, these two practices meet on many aspects and can be perceived in a very complimentary manner. It becomes clear that the way in which I approach the mechanisms of the creative process in both practices is in fact quite similar. When painting or composing, I’ve come to realize that the result I strive for is in terms of structure and in terms of how I attempt to organize both the sound events in my compositions and the plastic materials I use on canvas. This text presents a potentially new approach to acousmatic composition derived from the techniques and concepts found in modern visual arts, more specifically non-figurative painting. In order to illustrate these ideas, I’ve composed a series of short composition studies that attempt to experiment the suggested methods and techniques.

1117	Sentiment de compétence parentale,  qualité de la relation d’attachement et la fonction paternelle d’ouverture sur le monde chez des pères d’enfant d’âge scolaire	The Paternal Openness to the World Function (POWF) is a recent concept in the father involvement field of research. Links between parental practices and mental representations associated with this form of father involvement, children behaviors and development have yet to be known. This cross-sectional study addressed two objectives. First, to verify the predictive links between the dimensions of the POWF, the fathers Parental Sense Of Competence (PSOC) and the father-child attachment relationship quality. Second, to examine the potential moderator role of the fathers PSOC on the significative links between the dimensions of the POWF and the father-child attachment relationship quality. The data come from a sample of 200 french speaking fathers who filled out a self-reported questionnary. Their child was between 5 (first grade) and 13 years old (sixth grade). Hierarchical linear regression models were used to verify the influence of the moderator effect. The results show significative positive links between the dimensions of “perseverance stimulation” and “disciplinary and tasks teaching” of the POWF and the father-child attachment relationship quality. The dimensions of risk taking and competition stimulation of the POWF are not correlated to the father-child attachment relationship quality. Contrary to expected results, the fathers PSOC has no moderator effect on the significative links, but rather an additive effect which can be translated has transactional relationships between these variables. Complementary analyses reveal a marginally significative moderator effect of the fathers PSOC on the link between perseverance stimulation of the POWF and the “pleasure and security” scale of the Father-Child Attachment Relationship Quality Questionnary (FCARQQ). The fathers propension to stimulate their child to persevere emerge more particularly in playfull activities and contribute to the development of the felling of confidence and personnal security of their child. Results are discussed in light of actual literature in order the have a better understanding of the links between these variables.

1118	Phylogénie moléculaire du genre Salix L. (Salicaceae) en Amérique du Nord	Fast growing willows (Salix sp.) are increasingly used in Europe and North America for biomass production and other environmental applications. However, the development of molecular tools is recent. The phylogeny of willows is incomplete, which slows down the selection of suitable native species and the development of improvement programs. The genus Salix includes approximately 500 species worldwide, and these are mainly located in temperate and cold regions of the Northern Hemisphere. We gathered leaf material from all 121 willows of North America (species native and introduced). We developed three molecular tools-methods: DNA extraction, SSR markers, and nuclear genes. We sequenced two chloroplast genes matK and rbcL and the ITS region. Phylogenetic analyses were carried out using parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches. The species tree provides strong support for a division of the genus into two subgenera, Salix and Vetrix. Sixteen species have ambiguous positions. A complete molecular phylogeny of American willows has been established. It needs to be confirmed and further resolved using other molecular data. Nonetheless, the genus clearly has two clades.

1119	La mémoire émotionnelle chez les patients schizophrènes consommateurs de cannabis : une étude en imagerie par résonance magnétique fonctionnelle	Context In spite of well-known adverse consequences of cannabis consumption in patients with schizophrenia (SCZ), it is recognized that cannabis use reaches levels as high as 40 % in this population. Recently, a number of studies have attempted to get a better grasp of the relationship between these two conditions, which remains unclear to this day. Previous studies, including some from our group, have shown that cannabis abusing patients (SCZCAN) tend to have less prominent negative symptoms, better cognitive abilities, and that their emotion processing is closer to normal. Aim The present study aims to compare emotional memory in patients with schizophrenia with or without cannabis abuse, our hypothesis being that SCZCAN will perform better on an emotional memory task and will activate larger brain regions during functional imaging, as compared to SCZ. Method Three groups of subjects, namely SCZ (N=14), SCZCAN (N=14) and control subjects (N=21) underwent an emotional memory task during a functional magnetic resonance imaging session. Results Our study showed that the group of SCZCAN performed better than SCZ in a functional memory task and activated larger brain regions during functional imaging, in particular those linked to memory and emotional processing (orbitofrontal and temporal cortex, hippocampus). Conclusion The group of SCZCAN demonstrated a relative preservation of their emotional memory as compared to SCZ and activated larger brain regions during functional imaging.

1120	Optimization Studies to Improve MSC-based Cardiac Cell Therapy : Cytokine Preconditioning and Nanoparticle Coupling	Background: Ischemic heart disease (IHD) remains a leading cause of mortality in North America. Cardiac cell therapy (CCT) has emerged as a promising therapy to help heal the damaged heart. Among the various candidates for stem-progenitor cells, Mesenchymal Multipotential Stromal/Stem Cells (MSC) is of great promise. However, there remain unresolved issues and challenges that prevent clinical application of MSC-based CCT in IHD. Among the latter, low cellular retention rate, in vivo cell tracking and post-delivery apoptosis. Here in, growth factor preconditioning and MSC coupling to nanoparticles are investigated as methods to optimize MSC. Methods：Lewis Rat MSC (rMSC) and pig MSC (pMSC) were isolated from bone marrow. Rat MSCs were preconditioned with SDF-1a, TSG-6 and PDGF-BB, and then subjected to hypoxia, serum deprivation and oxidative stress.  Wound healing assays were also done with preconditioned rat MSCs. In parallel, novel ferromagnetic silicone core-shell nanoparticles (NP) were synthesized.  Pig MSCs were coupled to NPs following functionalization of the NPs with an antibody to a well-recognized MSC surface antigen, CD44. Subsequently, biocompatibility studies were performed on the pMSC-NP complex and included testing of key cellular processes such as migration, adhesion, proliferation and differentiation properties. Results: Of all cytokines used, PDGF-BB showed greatest capacity to improve MSC survival under conditions of hypoxia, serum deprivation and oxidative stress.  NP conjugation has mitigated effect on the migration and proliferation of pig MSC, but do not change the differentiation capacity of MSC. Finally, the MSC-NP complex was detectable by MRI. Conclusion: Our data suggest that novel strategies, such as PDGF-BB preconditioning and ferromagnetic nanoparticle coupling, can be considered as promising avenues to optimize MSCs for CCT.

1121	Induction d’anticorps anti-idiotypiques contre les protéoglycanes de la matrice extracellulaire dans la réduction des lésions athérosclérotiques	Atherosclerosis is characterized by the accumulation of low density lipoprotein (LDL) associated with the proteoglycans of the arterial wall. Chimeric (ch) antibodies that react against glycosaminoglycans (GAG) were generated. We tested the hypothesis that vaccination with chP3R99, a mutant chimeric antibody of the P3 hybridoma, could interfere with the retention of LDL by inducing a cascade of anti-idiotypic antibodies directed against the GAG.Male mice deficient in apolipoprotein E fed with a hypercholesterolemic diet were given five subcutaneous injections of 50 μg of chP3R99 or chP3S98 (a mutant with low reactivity) vaccine. The injections were performed every week or every two weeks. After sacrifice, the aorta was perfused with PBS, excised and analyzed after staining with Oil Red-O. The results were expressed as a percentage of lesions areas on the total area of the aorta. The reactivity of the sera obtained was tested against the chP3R99, chP3S98, heparin, dermatan and chondroïtin sulfate from obtained immunized mice by ELISA. The anti-idiotypic response was measured by blocking the anti-isotypic reactivity by a nonspecific IgG, hR3. In addition, the antibody chP3R99 binding to GAG in the atherosclerotic lesion was shown by an in vivo molecular imaging device. Our results show that the immunogenicity of the antibodies chP3R99 is higher than chP3S98 and that sera from mice immunized with chP3R99 present anti-idiotypic antibodies directed against the GAG. This effect is associated with a 42 % reduction (p <0.01) of atherosclerotic lesions in vaccinated mice. The use of active immunization with antibodies chP3R99 may constitute a new therapeutic approach for the treatment of atherosclerosis.

1122	Étude Pharmacologique de la Douleur Neuropathique Centrale à la suite d'une Hémorragie Intrathalamique induite chez le Rat	Central post stroke pain is a debilitating condition for which treatment is often difficult and unsuccessful. The goal of this project was to reproduce an animal model of this condition by performing a stereotaxic injection of collagenase solution inducing a localized hemorrhage within the ventroposterolateral thalamic nuclei of rats. Behavioral tests to evaluate motor coordination, sentivity to mechanical, hot and cold stimuli were performed regurlarly to establish if neuropathic pain was present. Then, the effects of ketamine, amitriptyline, gabapentin and carbamazepine on such pain were evaluated. Induction of an intrathalamic hemorrhage produced bilateral persistent mechanical allodynia as well as transient cold allodynia in some animals without notable changes in motor coordination. High doses of ketamine did reverse mechanical allodynia but with significant impairment in motor coordination. Similarly gabapentin also reversed mechanical allodynia without undesirable effect on coordination. The others two drugs failed to show any significant effect. Histopathological evaluation of the brain revealed a well localized lesion in the area of interest. These results show that an intrathalamic collagenase injection produced a reliable model of central neuropathic pain. Ketamine was able to reverse mechanical allodynia but with significant side effects. Gabapentin appeared to be a promising drug for the treatment of this condition. The role of NMDA receptors and voltage dependant calcium channels, that target ketamine and gabapentin respectively in the maintenance of this pain, needs to be further defined.

The forecasts are personnalized according to the clients’ own features, the most notable being the fact that they can have any combination of automobile and residential insurance products. Three approaches are compared. The first approach is the simple Markov model which assume homogeneity and stationnarity of the transition probabilities. The other model suggested – which is implemented both by direct computation and by simulation – allows for heterogeneity of the transition probabilities, thus providing forecasts which evolve in time along with the characteristics of the clients. The transitions probabilities are estimated using multinomial logistic regressions.	Lifetime expectancy , Markov chain model , multinomial logistic regression , insurance	en	9920.0
1124	The anti-inflammatory properties of intravenous immunoglobulin in a murine model of allergic airway disease ; effects on the development of regulatory T-cells	Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) is a therapeutic preparation of normal human polyclonal IgG derived from pooled plasma from a large number of healthy donors. Initially used as replacement therapy for patients with primary and secondary immune deficiencies, IVIg is now also widely used for the treatment of a variety of autoimmune, allergic and systemic inflammatory disorders, at high immunomodulatory doses. The beneficial effect of IVIg in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases has been attributed to different mechanisms. Increasing evidence shows that IVIg induces expansion and enhances the suppressive function of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in different experimental animal models and human subjects, through an unknown mechanism. Human inflammatory and autoimmune diseases are known to be associated with Treg deficiency. Therefore, a more precise understanding of the mechanisms by which IVIg modulate Treg populations seems to be needed for more rational use of this compound as an alternative therapy in context of various inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. Using a robust antigen-driven model of allergic airway disease, we have demonstrated that IVIg markedly attenuates airway inflammation and this effect is associated with the induction of Tregs from non-regulatory T cells in pulmonary tissues. We have also demonstrated that the antiinflammatory actions of IVIg, in our model are dependent on a population of pulmonary CD11c+ dendritic cells (DCs), as the action of IVIg could be completely replicated by adoptive transfer of CD11c+ DCs from IVIg-treated mice. we have shown that tolerogenic DCs involve in the peripheral induction of Tregs. Given the requirement of DCs in the induction of Tregs, we explored the mechanism by which IVIg interacts and modulate these cells and for the first time demonstrated that the purified sialylated fraction of human IgG (SA-IVIg) (that consists 2-5% of whole IgG) interacts with an inhibitory C-type lectin receptor on dendritic (DCIR) and this interaction triggers an ITIM intracellular signaling cascade. This subsequently results in rendering tolerogenic activities to DCs and peripheral induction of Tregs. The anti-inflammatory activity of SA-IVIg has been shown in previous studies, but the mechanism by which it modulates DCs functions is not well understood. We also demonstrated that DCIR facilitates the internalization of IgG molecules into DC and this internalization appears to be a crucial step for induction of Tregs. IVIg is a costly therapeutic compound. Characterization of the mechanism of action of IVIg can lead to a better application of this plasma based therapy in a wide range of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.

1125	Étude génétique et fonctionnelle des Interferon-producing Killer Dendritic Cells	The idea that a cell could kill transformed cells, like a Natural Killer (NK) cell, all the while exhibiting also the capacity to present antigens to T cells, like a Dendritic Cell (DC), may seem farfetched. However, in mice, a cell presenting these specific properties was identified in 2006. These cells were named Interferon-producing Killer Dendritic Cells (IKDC) and extensive studies revealed that they were endowed with an important immunological potential. Indeed, the fact that IKDCs exhibit properties of both DC and NK cells conferred them with an exceptional anti-tumor potential. Notably, on a per cell basis, the in vivo anti-tumor activity of IKDCs is more efficient than NK cells. Therefore, following their identification, IKDCs showed great therapeutic promise.   However, a debate on the cell lineage origin of IKDCs emerged. Several independent groups could not replicate the finding that IKDCs showed functional antigen-presentation properties similar to DCs. Also, additional studies revealed that IKDCs are very similar to NK cells. These and other observations led the scientific community to believe that IKDCs were activated NK cells.  Despite this controversy, IKDCs clearly exhibit a unique and outstanding anti-tumor potential, highlighting the relevance to further explore these cells. We must first close the debate regarding the lineage origin of IKDCs. We subsequently need to identify a means to specifically target IKDCs to facilitate their use in novel anti-tumor therapies. Thus, the objective of my thesis is first, to define the identity of IKDCs and second, to determine the genetic factors implicated in the regulation of these cells. For the first objective, we demonstrated that IKDCs do not represent activated NK cells, as previously suggested. We show that IKDCs are highly proliferative and exhibit a unique phenotype associated with very immature NK cells. In an attempt to verify if IKDCs could acquire a mature phenotype, we conducted an adoptive transfer experiment. We found that, after adoptive transfer, IKDCs adopt a mature phenotype, but also surprisingly differentiate into NK cells. These findings indicate that IKDCs represent an intermediate in NK-cell differentiation. For the second objective, we demonstrated that the IKDC proportion was highly variable between strains of different background origins, indicating that these cells are regulated by genetic factors. A genetic study revealed that genetic factors in distal arm of chromosome 7 associate with the proportion of IKDCs. The results presented in this thesis represent an important breakthrough for the research on IKDCs. They allowed to define the cell lineage origin of IKDCs and to identify a genetic region involved in the regulation of this cell type. These discoveries are valuable knowledge for the identification of human IKDCs and the development of novel anti-tumor therapies.

1126	Les figures de l’intimité en situation de rue : une pluralité d’expériences chez les jeunes à Montréal	The objective of this study is to understand how street-involved youth in Montreal experience their intimate relationships. Most studies focused on sexual health and HIV infection risks. However, little is known about the meanings they give to their intimate relationships and how they are influenced by the street life. In this study, the relationship between intimate experiences and street experiences of young street-involved people is explored.  Inspired by the sociology of experience (Dubet, 1994), this study focuses on the construction of the intimate experience of street-involved youth, assuming a dynamic relationship between their agency and the social and material conditions of the street life. This analytical framework allows us to overcome the empirical works which present these youth as passive victims of precarious living conditions or as careless and reckless when it comes to sexuality. Individual interviews were conducted with thirty-two street-involved youth (18 women and 14 men) aged from 18 to 27 years old (mean = 22 years old). The testimonies were analyzed within a qualitative typological framework (Schnapper, 2005), allowing the construction of ideal types of intimate experiences in the street life, the “figures of intimacy”.  Five figures of intimacy in the street life among young people were constructed based on the testimonies analysis: criminal success, withdrawal, survival, commitment and confinement. Each of these figures offers a unique dynamic description between intimate experiences and street experiences of the participants. The analysis shows some overlaps between the figures. Youth from the criminal success and the commitment figures build a sense of belonging to a peer group in the street situation, while youth from the withdrawal and survival figures perceived the street situation as disqualifying and try to stay away from other street-involved young people. Also, participants from the criminal success and survival figures reported a subjectivation of the intimate partner through emotional commitment. In contrast, youth in the withdrawal and the commitment figures showed a tendency to instrumentalize sexuality in order to satisfy various needs. This study illustrates the importance of understanding the dynamic between intimate relationships and the street life to capture the diversity and the complexity of the life experiences of the street-involved young people.

1127	Cauchemars et mauvais rêves : impact différentiel des méthodes de collecte et analyse descriptive de leur contenu	The overall goal of this thesis was to further our understanding on disturbed dreaming (bad dreams and nightmares) along two main lines of inquiry. First, we examined the methodological implications associated with the different instruments used to measure dream recall frequency (articles 1 and 2). Second, we investigated the actual content of disturbing dreams, a dimension for which empirical data remain surprisingly scarce (article 3).  Study 1 compared the frequency of nightmares and bad dreams obtained with retrospective methods and with two types of prospective instruments (narrative and checklist logs) in 411 participants. In addition to replicating findings showing that when compared to daily logs, retrospective self-reports underestimate current nightmare and bad dream frequency, we showed that these frequencies were not differentially affected by the type of prospective log. Our second study extended these findings by comparing the differential effects of narrative and checklist logs on general dream recall in 358 participants. The results indicate that checklist logs yield higher prospective dream recall frequency than narrative logs, and that prospectively measured dream recall frequency tends to peak at the beginning of the log and then remains stable over time. Thus, improved dream recall arising from subjects' increased attention towards their dreams is short-lived and the effect quickly offset by motivational factors. Our third article presents a comprehensive and comparative description of the content of 431 bad dreams and 253 nightmares collected prospectively from 331 participants. The results indicate that although nightmares and bad dreams share many content characteristics and features, they also differ along several dimensions: nightmares tend to involve physical threats whereas psychological threats predominate in bad dreams; nightmares are more likely than bad dreams to contain fear as their principal emotion as well as being significantly more emotionally intense; and when compared to bad dreams, nightmares are more bizarre and contain significantly more aggressions, failures, and unfortunate endings. Taken together these findings support the view that nightmares represent a more intense expression of the same basic phenomenon and that this intensity manifests itself along a number of content dimensions. These results are discussed in relation to different theories on the etiology and function of dreams.	Nightmares , Bad dreams , Dream content , Dream recall , Dream recall frequency	en	9878.0
1128	The Hybridity of Violence : Location, Dislocation, and Relocation in Contemporary Canadian Multicultural and Indigenous Writing	This dissertation explores the relationship between indigenous and multicultural writing in Canada. While critics have paid increasing attention to minoritized literatures, indigenous and multicultural literary strategies are seldom examined together without the mediating presence of settler or dominant Canadian literatures. In order to perform such an analysis, this dissertation deploys the concept of hybridity as a category of literary analysis that comes from a history of colonial violence, but which adequately describes the forms of stylistic experimentation which indigenous and multicultural writers use to dramatize and subvert their marginalization. In order to avoid fetishizing indigenous and multicultural texts as markers of reified “otherness,” I examine them in relation to specific discourses and debates in Canadian literary studies, such as the Canadian long poem, prairie writing, city writing, multiculturalism, and indigeneity. Methodologically, my dissertation examines how each text under discussion contributes, yet radically reconfigures and particularizes, each of these literary categories. In addition, I develop a conceptual framework through which the relationship between multicultural and indigenous texts can be approached without rehearsing the conflations that have marked Canadian literary criticism. To this end, I provide close-readings of texts by Armand Garnet Ruffo, Suzette Mayr, Rawi Hage, and Jeannette Armstrong. My introductory chapter details the manner in which the relationship between indigenous and multicultural writing has been approached in Canadian literary studies so far, and elaborates my conceptual framework through critical re-interpretations of postcolonial, globalization, and hybridity theory as they relate to the field of Canadian literary studies. In my second chapter, I analyze Armand Garnet Ruffo’s long poem Grey Owl: The Mystery of Archie Belaney. I focus on the generic and stylistic strategies Ruffo develops in order to indigenize the genre of the Canadian long poem and question Grey Owl’s identity. My third chapter examines Suzette Mayr’s Venous Hum as a text which challenges prairie writing, Canadian multiculturalism, and Albertan conservatism through stylistic experimentation, metaphor usage, and use of magic realism. In my fourth chapter, I interpret Hage’s Montreal novel Cockroach as a text whose local, national, and global scales intersect with colonialism and contest national narratives as the novel ultimately replicates Western humanitarian intervention. My final chapter explores Jeannette Armstrong’s Whispering in Shadows in order to illustrate the conceptual limits of this dissertation. Since hybridity always assumes (partial) assimilation, its application in the context of Armstrong’s work would bear coercive results. For that reason, this chapter draws on Armstrong’s definition of indigenous concepts in order to develop a non-hegemonic method of analysis.  My dissertation then examines the manner in which each text mobilizes hybridity in order to challenge and supplement the critical discourses that seek to contain them. It contributes to postcolonial Canadian literary studies by opening up the field to the complexities which competing definitions of the global generate, and by examining what literary strategies indigenous and multicultural texts share, yet deploy to different ends.

1129	Ni hypersexualisées ni voilées ! Tensions et enjeux croisés dans les discours sur l’hypersexualisation et le port du voile «islamique» au Québec	This dissertation identifies a co-occurrence between the discourses about girl’s ‘hypersexualization’ and those regarding the ‘Islamic’ practice of veiling, which have been generating similar concerns, discourses and anxieties in Quebec as well as in most Western societies for the past years. More specifically, I propose a ‘general economy of discourses’ (Foucault, 1976) about hypersexualization and headscarf-wearing, from a conjunctural perspective, and by means of three contexts of analysis: feminist, media, and public. I demonstrate how hypersexualization and headscarf-wearing are problematized (Foucault, 2001/1984), that is to say, how they are produced as concomitant social problems. The dissertation consists of three main chapters that each takes on one of the contexts of problematization. The chapter entitled ‘Feminism(s) and Gender Equality’, argues that gender equality is invoked as the modern value par excellence within the feminist movement as in Quebec society. As such, gender equality is constitutive of the problems of hypersexualization and headscarf-wearing. The next chapter, ‘Media Diversity and (Hyper) Visibility’, focuses on the media and popular culture as both subjects and objects of discourse, which produce and define adolescence and Muslim religion/culture as worlds apart, while exposing them to the public. Finally, the chapter entitled ‘Secularism, Sexuality, and Neutrality’ analyzes the public discourses about hypersexualization and headscarf-wearing and highlights the ways in which these problems are constitutive of charters, codes of conduct and other forms of regulations, in the name of the common good and state’s neutrality. In conclusion, I provide a ‘look back’ on the conjuncture, stressing some issues that crosses the main chapters of the dissertation, such as the questions of consensus and extreme.

1130	"Narrativité et temporalité dans la construction identitaire 
en contexte organisationnel"	This dissertation makes theoretical and methodological contributions to questions of identity construction in organizations. It does so by developing an original conceptualization of the problem of temporal dimensions of identity, made visible through the dialectical tension between stability and change. In the organizational communication literature, identity is either seen as something that evolves or as something that is stable through time. For instance, many authors adopt a performative stance to study identity, which makes it difficult to take into consideration fixity of identity. I postulate that these two dimensions of identity are in a dialectical tension and that the process of configuration and interpretation of narratives makes their mediation possible. Moreover, I demonstrate that keeping in tension temporal dimensions of identity through narratives makes it possible to study the concomitant construction of individual, collective and organizational identities. Using an analytical method drawn from Ricoeur’s theory of narrative identity (Ricoeur, 1995) as well as inspired by conversation analysis, I analyzed data drawn from group interviews with employees of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police conducted in 2007 and 2008. This method allowed me to simultaneously analyze textual and contextual aspects of identity narratives	identification , narrative identity , identification , interpretation , temporality , organization , police organization	en	9858.0
1131	Analyse de l'implantation d'une innovation en prévention du VIH: le dépistage rapide en milieu communautaire gai	In 2009, a multidisciplinary and intersectoral team implemented an innovative research-intervention project: Spot, a community-based rapid HIV testing service for men who have sex with men in Montreal. A case study was undertaken to describe the implementation process of Spot and the contextual factors that affected it. Grounded theory analysis of interviews, participant-observer, and a document analysis allowed the identification of a multistage dynamic implementation process. These stages were influenced by stakeholders’ motivations, the complexity of partnership dynamics, the challenges surrounding coordination and organization of staff members, as well as factors influencing staff members’ daily practices. Motivations like the unique opportunity to contribute to the implementation of an innovative and relevant prevention project, had a constant and positive influence, which united stakeholders in the project and maintained their involvement despite the difficulties. In terms of partnership dynamics, vague definitions of roles and tasks delayed the implementation of the project, although once clarified, everyone felt legitimate and actively participated in the success of the implantation. The management of interinstitutional funds was mentioned as one of the difficulties of coordinating the project and a factor that caused delays in the implementation process. This study allowed learning about the implementation and sustainability of a gay community-based rapid HIV testing service.

1132	Distribution spatiale des racines fines, disponibilité de la lumière et rendement dans un système de culture intercalaire avec arbres feuillus en zone tempérée	Spatial distributions of fine roots were studied in a tree-based intercrop system (TBI) with Quercus rubra L. (CHR), Populus deltoides x nigra (DN3570) (PEH) and pasture species (FOUR) in southern Québec (Canada). Results didn’t show deeper root profiles for trees in TBI. Profiles were superficial as commonly found for tree species grown in conventional plantations or in natural ecosystems. More than 95 % of fine roots were found in 25 cm and 45 cm depth for CHR and PEH, and in 35 cm for pasture. However, spatial separation exists between CHR and pasture fine roots systems as CHR allocate less fine roots in the top 10 cm of soil, and more between 10 cm et 30 cm. PEH fine roots didn’t show any adaption when intercropped with pasture and a high value fine root length density (FRLD) in top soil layer near tree trunk reduces pasture FRLD by 45 %, suggesting strong competition interaction for resources. Pasture yield analysis revealed biomass reduction near trees, particularly near PEH. However results of a principal component analysis indicates stronger negative effect of light reduction on pasture yield than the presence of tree fines roots. PEH, a fast growing species, have stronger impact than CHR on pasture yield but they will be harvested sooner and larger alleys should benefit the intercrop. This dynamic aspect of TBI systems is close to natural ecosystems and should be further investigated for future success.

1133	Chert Nastapoka : caractérisation chimique et exploitation au Paléoesquimau, baie d’Hudson, Nunavik	The dominant cultural material on Nunavik’s archaeological sites is lithics. As a result they constitute an important source of information on prehistoric lifeways. The lack of lithic raw materials resarchs carried out on the east coast of Hudson Bay gave us the opportunity to focus on a source in this area. The objective of this thesis research was to characterize one component of the geological formation: Nastapoka chert.  In order to do this, X-ray fluorescence was chosen. The results demonstrate that it is difficult to construct a unique geochemical pattern for the source because of its variability. To complete the portrait, we take into account the technological use of Nastapoka chert by the Paleoeskimo groups by comparing three site’s studies (GhGk-4, GhGk-63 and IcGm-5). This analysis of the exploitation of this material reveals a developement from Predorset to Dorset that supports the idea of cultural continuum between the two periods.

1134	"Analyse des agents de chimiothérapie 
par extraction sur phase solide automatisée couplée à la chromatographie liquide et la spectrométrie de masse en tandem (SPE-LC-ESI-MS/MS)"	The last few decades have been marked by an increase in the number of cancer cases, which subsequently led to an increase in the consumption of chemotherapeutic agents. The toxicity and the carcinogenicity of these molecules justify the increased interest. Few studies have been conducted to detect and quantify chemotherapeutic agents in environmental matrices.  In this project, a method using liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) preceded by an online solid-phase extraction (SPE) has been developed for the detection and quantification of a group of six chemotherapeutic agents, which are among the most commonly used in Quebec (gemcitabine, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, irinotecan, epirubicin) and having different physico-chemical properties and different chemical structures. The developed method was validated in a real water matrix representing the influent of a sewage treatment plant in the Montreal area. Two of the six studied cytotoxic agents (cyclophosphamide and methotrexate) were detected in eight samples of the nine taken mainly at the influent and effluent of some treatment plants in the Montreal area. The results of the analysis of real samples showed that there was no significant difference in concentration between the influent and effluent. This also demonstrates the inadequacy of the current wastewater treatment approaches to remove those compounds.

1135	Problèmes de comportement à long terme chez les patients pédiatriques atteints de leucémie lymphoblastique aiguë	Recent improvements in pediatric cancers treatment have led to marked increases in patient survival rate. However, it has been well documented that pediatric cancer survivors are at elevated risk for various other health problems. With respect specifically to neuropsychological side effects, known predictors (mainly: age at diagnosis, patient gender, exposure to radiation therapy) remain insufficient so far to target, and prevent efficiently, long term sequelae in this population.   General objectives related to this thesis were: 1) characterization of individual trajectories of behavioral problems in pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia; 2) the identification of genetic, medical and psychosocial determinants of behavioral problems in this population.   This research program was based on the following hypotheses: 1) there is an association between the trajectories of individual behavioral problems and a – familial well-being-related psychosocial factors, b – gene polymorphisms involved in the therapeutic responses to methotrexate and glucocorticoids, c – anti-cancer treatments-related variables. 2) Multilevel statistical modeling can be used to characterize patient groups according to their individual behavioral problem trajectories, and can also identify predictive factors.   138 pediatric patients (0-18 years old) who received an acute lymphoblastic leukemia diagnosis between 1993 and 1999 at CHU Ste-Justine participated in this 4 years-long longitudinal study. A standardized and validated instrument, the Child Behavior Checklist, was used to measure behavior problems, as reported by the mother, at diagnosis, and then 1, 2, 3 and 4 years post-diagnosis. Genetic, psychosocial and medical data were also collected during this longitudinal study; these data were exploited in the context of the statistical modeling performed.   Results obtained suggest that internalized and externalized behavioral problems have distinct trajectories and have different predictive factors. Internalized problems are affective issues presented by the patient, such as depressive or anxious symptoms. They are highly prevalent post-diagnosis and normalize over the following years, suggestive of temporary yet significant problems. Stress-enhancing medical variables such as a higher relapse risk at diagnosis and medical complications requiring a longer hospitalization slow down the normalization process. Externalized problems need interpersonal contact to occur; violence or aggressiveness manifestations are some examples. Compared to internalized problems, externalized problems are much more stable across time. However, pharmacological and genetic variables do contribute to individual differences in trajectories. In particular, administration of a more potent glucocorticoid (from pharmacological and toxicological perspectives) and being homozygous for NOS3 gene -786C844T haplotype are linked to modulation of externalized problems in time. Finally, the level of perceived family stress at time of diagnosis is positively correlated with initial externalized problems, while shortly after the induction period, the level of familial stress is linked with the initial internalized problems.     Together, these results support the idea that a holistic care strategy is essential to develop efficient, preventive interventions in this population, due to the multifactorial nature of these behavioral problems. The knowledge generated in the present studies could contribute to better quality of life for these patients.     This thesis also brings a more holistic contribution to our current knowledge of behavioral problems in this population, by highlighting the need for individual, multidisciplinary follow-ups, with particular emphasis on repeated measurements and appropriate statistical analyses. More than ever, knowledge de-compartmentalization appears essential in reaching a certain comprehension level of observed phenomena, rather than adhering to descriptive settings. It indicates that, despite obvious methodological and logistic challenges, this type of research is not only desirable in studying dynamic processes, but is certainly achievable with current analytical tools.

1136	Sensibilité des cellules leucémiques aux immunoconjugués anti-CD33	Acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a cancer where hematopoietic precursors are arrested in an early stage of development, is associated with a poor survival rate of 20 to 30% over five years, despite intensive chemotherapy treatments. In approximately 90% of AML cases the malignant cells express CD33 antigen, which makes it a target of choice for development of immunotoxin based therapy. Three immunoconjugates (IC) composed of anti-CD33 monoclonal antibody coupled with maytansine derivative, which prevent tubulin polymerization and thus formation of mitotic spindle, were designed. These three IC were tested for their activity against several AML cell lines and primary AML patient cells and we investigate mechanisms responsible for variation in sensitivity to IC treatment. In this report, we show that differences in number of CD33 molecules on AML cell surface does not explain the observed differences in IC sensitivity. We demonstrate that binding of huMy9-6 antibody to CD33 induces rapid internalization and that it is first process through endosome. We confirm that lysosomal processing is essential for the antimitotic effect induced by IC treatment. Also, we provide evidence that SOCS3 protein may play a role in resistance of AML cells to anti-CD33 therapy by directing IC-CD33-SOCS3 complex to the proteasome and therefore affecting lysosomal decoupling of IC-CD33 and intracellular release of maytansine derivatives. Finally, the linkers and maytansine derivative modifications were not sufficient to increase sufficiently the efficacy of conjugates to eliminate higher numbers of AML cells. The identification of mechanisms responsible for increased resistance of AML cell lines and primary AMLs may allow us to identify IC responsive AML cells and also identify strategies to improve the efficacy of IC treatment.

1137	Rôle du facteur de transcription PITX1 dans la pathogenèse de l'arthrose	Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most common age-related chronic disorders. The multiplicity of loci identified in OA linkage studies and the large number of associated SNPs suggests that many molecular pathways are involved in OA pathogenesis. Most of these pathways share common features with the process of endochondral ossification, normally occuring during embryogenesis. Cartilage degradation and the presence of osteophytes, hallmarks of OA, could be attributable to the reinitiation of this process. One gene that has surfaced both in OA and in musculoskeletal development is PITX1. Contrary to its original moniker, PITX1 is expressed in many tissues beyond the pituitary gland, including bone, cartilage, muscle and fibroblast cells. Pitx1 is considered as a master regulator of hindlimb identity and its complete inactivation in mice leads to a forelimb-like phenotype. Less severe, its partial inactivation results in early OA symptoms in aging mice. In humans, loss of PITX1 expression is observed in OA cartilage concomitantly with the upregulation of EXTL3, REG1 and PARP1. The association between these proteins and tissue regeneration is consistent with the biosynthesis phase initially taking place in OA cartilage. The dose-dependent relationship between PITX1 and cell proliferation supports the view that low PITX1 expression levels are necessary for chondrocytes to proliferate. Conversely, high levels of PITX1 would prevent proliferation and be required to maintain a differentiated state in normal articular chondrocytes. The regulation of PITX1 gene is of particular interest since it could help to better understand its role in osteoarthritis pathogenesis and in the process of endochondral ossification. Search for mechanisms responsible for the downregulation of PITX1 in OA led to the identification of prohibitin (PHB1) bound to its distal promoter region. PHB1 is a mitochondrial marker but its presence in chondrocytes nuclei seems to correlate with the initiation stage of OA. This discovery could impact diagnosis as well as possible treatments for osteoarthritis.

1138	Les impacts de la dispersion historique sur la variabilité génétique à différentes échelles spatiales : connaître l'histoire pour mieux comprendre le présent	Current genetic variability depends on a complex combination of historical and contemporary factors. Therefore, an unbiased interpretation of the impact of current processes requires a deep understanding of historical processes that shaped genetic variability. Based on the premise that spatially close populations should share a common recent history, many studies conducted at small spatial scale do not take into account the effect of historical processes. This thesis aims to verify the validity of this assumption by estimating the effect of historical dispersion at large and small spatial scales. The aim of the first part of this thesis was to evaluate the impact of the historical dispersion on the distribution of organisms, at large spatial scale. The freshwater mussels of the genus Floater (Pyganodon spp.) were used as biological model. The dispersal of freshwater mussels occurs when larvae parasitize fish. Also, a series of null models has been developed to evaluate the co-occurrence between parasites and their hosts. The distinct associations of the Newfoundland floater (P. fragilis) with euryhaline fish species can explain its distribution. These associations also promoted differentiation with its sister taxon: the Eastern floater (P. cataracta). This study demonstrated the effects of historical biological associations on the current distribution of species at a large spatial scale. The aim of the second part of this thesis was to evaluate the impact of historical dispersal on the genetic variability, at small spatial scale. This time populations of rock bass (Ambloplites rupestris) and sunfish (Lepomis gibbosus) in adjacent drainages were used as biological model. The striking differences observed between the two species suggest opposing colonization patterns. Rock bass have colonized the drainage from a downstream source, resulting in low genetic diversity upstream and a strong differentiation between drainages. However, the sunfish have colonized the system from upstream, resulting in a high genetic diversity and low differentiation upstream, inducing at the same time a false signal of gene flow between drainages. The present study shows that the historical dispersion may hinder the ability to estimate the actual connectivity at small spatial scale, thus invalidating the premise tested in this thesis. The impacts of historical processes on genetic variability are not easy to demonstrate. The aim of the third part of this thesis was to develop a method to facilitate their detection. The proposed method is very flexible and facilitates the comparison between genetic variability and multiple dispersal hypotheses. The method could be used to compare dispersal hypotheses based on the historic or the current landscape and allow the assessment of historical and contemporary processes on genetic variability. The performances of the method are presented in several simulation scenarios, of increasing complexity. Despite an overall impact of differentiation, the number of individuals or the number of loci sampled, the method is highly effective. To illustrate the potential of the method, two contrasted data sets from previously published studies, were re-analyzed. This thesis demonstrates the impacts of historical dispersal on genetic variability at different spatial scales. Potential historical effects must be taken into account before assessing the impacts of ecological processes on genetic variability. In short, we must bridge the gap between ecology and evolution.

1139	Importance des protéines cellulaires incorporées dans les virions matures d’HSV-1	To complete their life cycle viruses interact with many factors of the host cell. Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is no exception. A recent proteomic study of the virus carried by our laboratory has identified up to 49 cellular proteins potentially incorporated into the mature virions of HSV-1[1]. Since some of these proteins may play important roles during the viral life cycle, they are interesting targets for identification and characterization of new host-pathogen interactions in the context of HSV-1. To target the proteins that are relevant to the viral life cycle of Herpes, the laboratory performed a screening with small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which showed that at least 15 incorporated proteins are involved in the replication cycle of HSV- 1 in cell culture (Appendix 1). Numerous studies report the incorporation of host proteins in mature virions but few addresses the importance for the viral infectivity of the fractions of cellular proteins incorporated into the virions. To verify this, we depleted these proteins from the mature extracellular virions using siRNAs. Subsequently, we used these viruses to re-infect depleted or normal cells. This method allowed us to identify for the first time eight proteins (DDX3X, HSPA8, KRT10, MIF, Rab5A, Rab6A, Rab10 and 14-3-3ζ) whose absence in virions reduced viral production by at least 50%. As part of understanding at what stage of the life cycle these proteins are necessary for HSV-1, we tested the infectivity of intracellular depleted viruses. Thus, we found at least seven cellular proteins (DDX3X, HSPA8, KRT10, MIF, Rab5A, Rab6A and Rab10) to have a pronounced effect on the replication of herpes virus, which has stimulated us to begin a series of more in-depth tests of the entry of HSV-1. Preliminary results demonstrate the involvement in the entry of HSV-1 of at least three to four proteins (HSPA8, KRT10, Rab5A and Rab10).

1140	Implication des protéines WHIRLY dans la biogénèse du chloroplaste en association avec la protéine SIG6	The autotrophic lifestyle of plants relies entirely on the integrity of chloroplasts and particularly on their biogenesis. Chloroplast gene transcription, performed by a Plastid-Encoded Polymerase (PEP) and two Nuclear-Encoded Polymerases (NEPs), is one of the key steps during the development of photosynthetic chloroplast. There are 3 classes of genes, one transcribed by PEP alone (class I), one by both PEP and NEPs (class II), and the third by NEPs alone (class III). To carry out transcription, PEP associates with plastid sigma factors including the general sigma factor SIG6. sig6 mutants have a pale cotyledon phenotype, a severe decrease in class I gene transcription and a reduction in the level of class I proteins. In our laboratory, we study the role of the two plastid WIHRLY proteins (WHY1 and WHY3) in maintaining plastid genome stability. However, little is known about any role these proteins may play in transcription or chloroplast biogenesis. It seems likely they are involved in plastid gene transcription since they are found in the Plastid Transcriptionally Active Chromosome (PTAC). Moreover, they have been implicated in chloroplast biogenesis in maize. In this study, we verified the implication of these proteins in plastid biogenesis using a genetic approach in which we crossed a sig6 mutant with a why1why3 mutant. We isolated sig6why1 and sig6why3 double mutants and a sig6why1why3 triple mutant. Using a phenotypic characterisation and quantification of some plastid proteins, we show that loss of one of the two Why genes complements the sig6 pale cotyledon phenotype and allows a more normal pattern of expression of plastid proteins that are under-expressed in the sig6 mutant. However, we also show that loss of the two Why genes does not alleviate the sig6 phenotype. Moreover, the triple mutant shows a second pale phenotype on true leaves, and the plastid protein expression pattern is abnormal compared to either sig6 or wild type plants. Those results cannot be explained by the role of WHIRLY proteins in plastid genome stability since the triple mutant shows fewer plastid genome rearrangements than the why1why3 mutant. Finally, we show that inhibition of the PEP polymerase using rifampicin elicits the same complementation of the sig6 phenotype as the loss of one of the two WHIRLY. Together, these results show the implication of WHIRLY proteins in plastid biogenesis in association with SIG6. We propose a model in which WHIRLY act as activators of PEP activity, particularly during the chloroplast biogenesis. Therefore, the absence of one of the WHIRLY would cause a weak inhibition of PEP, facilitating the set-up of a rescue mechanism by NEPs and, consequently, allowing the complementation of plastid biogenesis in the sig6 mutant. However, the absence of the two WHIRLY proteins would cause a strong inhibition of PEP, and the inability of the rescue mechanism by NEPs to compensate for this strong inhibition, resulting in a more severe phenotype in the sig6 mutant.

1141	La tension narrative au cinéma : articulations et mécanismes du suspense	This thesis focuses on the mecanisms and narrative tools used in suspense and thriller films. The first chapter analyzes the function of the synecdoche and metonymy and their role in filmic time-space. The presence of danger triggers incertainties for the viewers that are bound to the endangered character. Then, following larger definitions and numerous films such as Jaws and The Matrix, the second chapter tries to find recurring thematic and aesthetic elements. The purpose of this approach is to legitimate a genre that might not be one. Finally, the third and last chapter, introduces the creative part of this work. A screenplay, The Perfect Seasons (Les saisons parfaites), a psychological suspense, is inspired by Darren Aronofsky’s Black Swan and Claude Chabrol’s L’enfer.  This thesis asks how does work narrative tension in films and how is it possible to define suspense as a genre? Does this genre exists? If so, why is it important to study it?

1142	Développement et mise à l'essai d'un outil pour analyser des albums jeunesse afin d'élaborer un répertoire d'oeuvres québécoises propices au travail interprétatif	This research paper examines literary reading in the context of primary education and focuses specifically on picturebooks that foster the development of interpretive skills. It gives an account of research and development in which we pursued three objectives. The first objective was to develop a tool to analyse the narrative processes of picturebooks and identify elements conducive to interpretive work; the second aimed to test the analysis tool in order to measure its reliability and validity; and the final objective was to use the tool we developed to put together a collection of Quebec children’s books that favour the development of interpretive skills in primary students. To achieve these three objectives, we adopted a methodology that enabled us to first analyse the needs, namely the users and purposes of the analysis tool, and then to design and develop an initial version. This version was tested with experts to determine its validity. A second version was then produced and its reliability was evaluated using encoders. Lastly, a third and forth version was produced to assemble a collection of Quebec picturebooks conducive to interpretive work. Although our test did not allow us to draw an altogether satisfactory conclusion about the objectivity of the indicators of our analysis tool, an analysis of comments by the experts confirms that the indicators of our analysis tool are highly relevant, which suggests that the tool we developed and the collection of 15 Quebec picturebooks that favour the development of interpretive skills in primary students we assembled may be important and useful tools within a school environment.

It is not surprising that under these conditions, tasks tend to become more algorithmic in order to help students’ performance and favor apparent transparency of the new concept (Chevallard, 1991). This classical response makes forget the unifying role of the concept and does not encourage its powerful use.  In order to improve the learning of a unifying concept, this thesis aimed at studying the relevance of a didactical sequence in the formal training of future engineers, centered on a unifying concept of linear algebra: the linear transformation (LT).     The idea of unification and the question of meaning are addressed through the development of problem solving competencies. The sequence of problems to solve is aimed at constructing an abstract concept (the LT) on a domain which is already mathematized, with the intent of abstracting the unifying aspect of the formal notion (Astolfi y Drouin, 1992).   Building on the work of Dupin (1995) and Sfard (1991), in mathematics and science education, we have designed didactical situations with elements of modelling, by articulating two ways of conceiving the notion (« procedural » and « structural ») in order to find a safest, more economical and reusable solving strategy. In particular, we have situated the notion in various mathematical domains where it is applicable: arithmetics, geometry, algebra and analysis. The sequence aims at developing connections between different mathematical frameworks, and between various representations of the LT in the different mathematical registers, with the historical development of the notion as a source of inspiration.  Moreover, the didactical sequence aims at achieving a balance between the practical aspect of the tasks in the foreseen professional practice and the theoretical aspect required to structure the concepts.    The study was conducted in Chile, with engineering students in the first linear algebra course of the program. We had completed a detailed a priori analysis of the sequence in order to reinforce its robustness and prepare for data analysis. With the analysis of answers to the entry questionnaire, team productions to the tasks, and comments received in students interview, we were able to identify the mathematical competencies and the levels of communication (Caron, 2004) put at work in their use of the LT. Results show emergence of the unifying role of the LT, even with students whose problem solving habits in mathematics have been marked by a procedural influence in the teaching and the learning.    The didactical sequence showed its effectiveness in the progressive construction by students of the linear transformation concept (LT), with its specific meaning and properties: the TL has appeared as an economical means of solving problems outside of linear algebra, which helped students in abstracting its underlying properties.  In contrast, we have also observed that some previously taught concepts could act as obstacles to the desired unification.  In these cases, students could revert to their old habits, and their use of the LT would rather reveal their partial understanding than help guide the resolution.	structural , application , didactical sequence , unifying concept , linear transformation , procedural , modelling , change of a system of representations	en	9726.0
1144	Rôle de l’axe CD40L/CD40 dans les cellules endothéliales progénitrices	Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are endothelial precursors which possess a considerable therapeutic potential in vascular repair and regeneration. In the context of cardiovascular diseases, the understanding of the role of EPCs in the regulation of thrombogenesis and endothelial repair is relevant and necessary to the understanding of their therapeutic potential. We have shown that EPCs interact with platelets via P-selectin and inhibit the adhesion, activation and aggregation of platelets as well as thrombus formation. Recently, we have shown that EPCs express the inflammatory receptor CD40 and it is well known that platelets are the main source of the soluble form of its agonist CD40L («soluble CD40 ligand», sCD40L). Hence, we have hypothesized that the CD40L/CD40 axis in EPCs influences the anti-thrombotic and pro-angiogenic functions of EPCs. To verify this hypothesis, we have successfully generated early and late EPCs from peripheral blood mononuclear cells in culture. We have demonstrated the existence of the CD40L/CD40 axis in EPCs by showing the expression of adaptor proteins, named tumor necrosis factor associated factors (TRAFs). In our first study, we investigated the effect of sCD40L on the function of early EPCs in platelet aggregation. Indeed, we have shown that sCD40L reverses their inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation without having an effect on prostacyclin (PGI2) and nitric oxide (NO) secretion by these cells. Moreover, no effect of sCD40L has been noted on the apoptosis and viability of these cells. However, we have shown a significant increase in oxidative stress in early EPCs following sCD40L stimulation. The inhibition of oxidative stress reverses the effect of sCD40L on early EPCs in platelet aggregation. These results could partially explain the decreased function of EPCs in individuals displaying higher levels of sCD40L in circulation. In our second study, we have studied the effect of sCD40L on the function of early EPCs in relation to angiogenesis. First, we have identified the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) which are secreted by these cells. We have found that early EPCs mainly release MMP-9 and that this release is increased by sCD40L. The sCD40L also induces the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK which contributes to increase the secretion of MMP-9. In functional studies, we have shown that pretreatment of early EPCs with sCD40L can potentialize HUVEC endothelial repair. In conclusion, our work in the context of this doctoral research project has allowed us to study the mechanisms involved in the role of sCD40L in the inhibitory and angiogenic function of early EPCs in platelet aggregation and angiogenesis, respectively. These results add new insights to the role of EPCs and could constitute the basis for future studies allowing for the correlation between high levels of sCD40L and the incidence of cardiovascular disease, particularly atherothrombosis.

1145	Mécanismes d'action des antioestrogènes totaux	Approximately 70% of breast tumors express or overexpress estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) and are treated with antiestrogens (AEs), which act as competitive inhibitors of this receptor. Tamoxifen has been widely used for the treatment of ERα-positive tumors, but intrinsic or acquired resistance can lead to tumor recurrence. Full AEs such as Fulvestrant (ICI182, 780) are currently used to treat postmenopausal women with ERα-positive breast cancers with disease progression following Tamoxifen therapy. Unlike Tamoxifen and other Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), full AEs (SERDs) are devoid of any agonistic activity. It is currently thought that the capacity of full AEs to induce rapid polyubiquitination and degradation of ERα underlies their complete suppression of ERα signalling. On the one hand, we show a correlation between ICI 182, 780 induced ERα inhibition and its association with the insoluble fraction. This insolubility corresponds to an immobilization within the nuclear matrix and takes place in the absence of an accelerated turn over. The helix 12 in the ligand binding domain is important in the induction of insolubility and inactivation. On the other hand, we identify ERα as a target for Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier (SUMO) posttranslational modification by SUMO1 and SUMO2/3 specifically when liganded with full AEs. Induction of SUMOylation is rapid and precedes receptor degradation in ERα-positive breast cancer cells. On the other hand, the SERMs do not induce SUMOylation. The helix 12 in the ligand binding domain and the DNA binding domain play a role in the induction of SUMOylation in the presence of full AEs. Structure activity relationship experiments with full AE derivatives showed that the induction of SUMOylation is correlated with the degree of inhibition of ERα-mediated transcription. In addition, preventing SUMOylation by overexpression of a SENP1 deSUMOylase abolished the inverse agonist properties of full AEs without increasing activity in the presence of agonists or of Tamoxifen. In our attempt to screen for factors with a possible role in SUMOylation and inactivation, we show that the treatment with SERDs but not SERMs, induces a rapid interaction between ERα and the human ATP-utilizing chromatin assembly and remodeling factor (ACF) in ERα-negative and ERα-positive cell lines. The helix 12 is important since introducing single point mutations in this helix lead to an increased solubility and abrogate ACF recruitment. Using ChIP, we find an increase of ACF1 subunit association with proximal promoter of estrogen target gene pS2 suggesting a possible role of ACF in remodeling in this promoter. ACF recruitment is SUMOylation dependant since the overexpression of DeSUMOylase SENP1 abolishes the interaction between ERα and ACF. Together, induction of insolubility, SUMOylation and ACF recruitment are characteristic properties of full antiestrogens that contribute to their specific activity profile. They can be used to screen for new compounds with an improved therapeutic potential.	Breast cancer , estrogen receptor , SUMOylation , Fulvestrant , chromatin remodeling , antiestrogens	en	9718.0
1146	Homme immigrant cherche homme : (re)formations de subjectivités ethnosexuelles en contexte post-migratoire au Québec	"This thesis calls for reconceptualising the dominant narrative about the life course of immigrant men with non-normative sexualities. Far from being a migration from tradition to modernity, from oppression to liberation, their life course is a more complex story of mobility and visibility inscribed in unequal social relations. Far from being torn between a homophobic ""ethnic community"" and a racist ""gay community"", their story is one of (re)established bonds over significant social interactions. At the intersection of multiple and conflicting norms, there is a process of (re)formation of subjectivities, both constrained and empowered by these norms.  Two corpuses are combined: a critical discourse analysis of visual and textual representations of ethnic and religious difference in three major gay magazines in Québec and a grounded theory analysis of semi-structured interviews. These interviews were conducted in Montréal with thirty immigrant men who have love and/or sexual relationships with other men.  The images show a tendency to reduce the body of men of color to exotic and erotic objects on magazines’ covers. In addition, the texts bring forward a narrative of sexual liberation by migration which reproduces the dominant dichotomies.  A much more complex story emerges, however, from the interviews’ analysis. On the one hand, the experience of migration is modulated by various social phenomena beyond the single sexual liberation and homophobia is insufficient to understand the status of non-normative sexualities both in countries of origin and ""ethnic communities"": it is rather heteronormativity that renders inferior some sexual and gender practices. On the other hand, the experience of visibility constraints is only very partially signified by the idea of a ""closet"": these men rather express the vast potential for experiences in a ""tacit"" space, allowing many to live their non-normative sexuality without telling it explicitly. Finally, contrary to the rejection of religious accommodations expressed in gay magazines, interviews show a real potential for accommodation of religion and sexuality that, despite tensions, maintains religious faith or spirituality while living sexuality."	racisation , queer , homosexuality , immigration , racialization , intersectionality	en	9713.0
1147	Problèmes de premier passage et de commande optimale pour des chaînes de Markov à temps discret	We consider diffusion processes, deﬁned by stochastic differential equa-  tions, and then we focus on ﬁrst passage problems for Markov chains in dis-  crete time that correspond to these diffusion processes. As it is known in the  literature, these Markov chains converge in distribution to the solution of the  stochastic differential equations considered. Our contribution is to obtain ex-  plicit formulas for the ﬁrst passage probability and the duration of the game  for the discrete-time Markov chains. We also show that the results obtained  converge in the Euclidean metric to the corresponding quantities for the diffu-  sion processes.  Finally we study an optimal control problem for Markov chains in discrete  time. The objective is to ﬁnd the value which minimizes the expected value of  a certain cost function. Unlike the continuous case, an explicit formula for this  optimal value does not exist in the discrete case. Thus we study in this thesis  some particular cases for which we found this optimal value.

1148	Redevances forestièrse annuelles et développement local au Cameroun : expériences de deux communes rurales : une analyse anthropologique	Our thesis is an examination of the relationship between annual forest royalties (AFRs) and local development in two communities in Cameroon. This anthropological study joins the debate that is taking place on an international scale with regard to the role and the future of local populations in the management of natural resources. In the past, the management of annual forest royalties was, especially in Central Africa and in Cameroon, the sole responsibility of the state. Such a policy did not offer the guarantees necessary for the sustainable use of these resources, which are indispensable to the lives of riverside village populations and the stability of the environment. Taking advantage of the crisis of the 1980s and 1990s in Africa, the IMF (International Monetary Fund) and the World Bank applied pressure on African States to revise their policies, in accordance with the Conference of Rio (1992), regarding the management and conservation of forest resources.  In 1994, Cameroon was the first country in the Congo river basin to revise its forest laws by means of a decentralization of the forest tax system: taxes received were distributed between the State, decentralized territorial collectives and riverside village populations. Funds transferred to these collectives and riverside populations were to be used for local development, specifically by contributing to the improvement of the general conditions of these populations through the realization of social works, water delivery, the construction and maintenance of roads, schools, health centers, etc. In practice, the impact of the decentralized forest tax system is hardly visible in the dynamics of the local development of communities to this day.  Our doctoral research project is in the field of the anthropology of development centered on the study of the solutions local populations bring to the problems they are confronted with in their daily lives. The analysis of the impacts of economic development policies on the village populations of Africa is here foregrounded, not only in the sense of a criticism of state policies regarding forestry development but also in the sense of better understanding the conditions of their implementation and impact on village populations; both from the point of view of direct financial benefits as well as ecological changes forestry activities introduce to the agricultural practices of the villagers.  On the methodological level, it is essential to note that it was very difficult to obtain the necessary information, the subject of the study proving to be very sensitive in its political implications. We were nevertheless able to collect a solid set of data by means of a local qualitative approach that was carried out in two forest communities, those of A (68 villages) and B (17 villages), which represent two different realities in terms of the management of annual forest royalties (AFRs). Through an intensive approach, data collection was undertaken in seven villages that responded to our criteria: we were able to study, in depth, the situation of the most disadvantaged social groups excluded in the sharing of the forest royalties.  In building out theoretical framework, we combined elements borrowed from environmental theory, economic anthropology and the analysis of management styles. It should be noted, moreover, that the anthropologist is neither a forester, nor an environmentalist, nor a specialist in managerial studies. We focused our comparative study in the municipalities of A and B on the objective of understanding the mechanisms for the management of AFRs set up by the local leaders and to estimate their impact on the improvement of the living conditions of the village populations and their ecosystems. Our concern was to know if AFRs establish vectors for the socioeconomic development for village populations living and from the forest.

1149	La stratégie sénégalaise du faire faire et la construction du sens de la gouvernance de l’éducation non formelle	In the past three decades, education systems throughout the world have experienced major transformations in relation to the overall quest of more relevance and effectiveness (Mundy, 2005; Lessard, 2000; Farrell, 1997). These developments took, among other forms, a trend towards decentralization of educational provision and management (Mons, 2004) considered by many researchers as a form of privatization. Today, the way the decentralization policy has been carried out is being questioned because the fact that (1) the limited financial capacity of many of the States concerned has led them to accept the recommended, if not imposed, policies by international bodies and also because (2) after several years of implementation, many countries like Senegal are still waiting for the beneficts promised (Daun, 2007). In the context of this thesis, we were interested in Senegal's experience of decentralization of education. From the 1990s, this country, as many other subsaharian African countries, facing a profound crisis of its education system, initiated a decentralization reform intended to improve their system (Pelletier, 2001; ADEA, 2001). We more precisely studied the faire faire strategy then implemented. Presented as a promising or exemplary strategy during the first years of implementation (ADEA, 2004), the strategy faces more and more criticism (Charlier & Faye 2005; Clemons, 2007). Convinced that a better understanding of the sensemaking of this initiative may help to better implement it, we analyzed it in the light of critical, post-major theories, and sensemaking by the actors’ perspectives (Ball, 1994 and 2006; Weick, 1995 and 2001; Spillane, 1998 and 2000). For the purposes of this analysis, we observed and interviewed nearly a hundred actors involved in that strategy. Processing of all the data collected allowed us to clarify the sense that the main actors give to the initiative, to see the lack of a shared sense and to point out the conflict between different meanings of the initiative. Thus, if the official discourse tries to situate the project in dynamics of participation and involvement, our extensive observation rather shows a form of commodification process and a blind application of its requirements (Charlier, 2003). Moreover, the study of the structures and rules of operation of the strategy as presented in official documents reveals a bureaucratic and centralized organization and guidance. In fact, the analysis of the sensemaking of the faire faire, highlighted the clash of the two models of democraty, i.e. participatory vs market oriented, described by Lessard (2006) as the main trends in the current developpents in education governance. The proponents of the faire faire may proclaim the quality of the project and blame insufficient resources or limited capacity of change among actors, the really remains there seems to be little concerned about the grassroots actors sensemaking. In fact, inspired by the rhetoric of international donors, the promoters held a discourse based on the first model (participatory) while setting up the second (merchant). Conceptually, the choice of a mixed analytic framework, combining sense-making, representation, critical and post-positive perspectives, helped to overcome the traditional resistance to change and the macro analyses explanations. This framework sheds new light on the implementation of public policy that may be informative for those involved in the faire faire, especially the institutional actors. With this framework, the thesis has shown that what did not work here is that there were, among others, the confrontation of at least two different meanings that cohabit in the strategy and the predominance of a formal sense of decentralization, one that is essentially and primarily oriented towards diversification of educational provision and not towards the actual demand. It also confirmed the increasing role played by the new education operators and, conversely, the limited room left to the learners and populations. Ultimately, the thesis reaffirmed the relevance of exploring the possibilities of hybridization of different actors’ meanings. In sum, the Senegalese case studied here is a pretext to discuss the implementation of public policies in education, an emerging field of knowledge. The methodology and results of this doctoral research are therefore transferable to other contexts where the same problem arises.

1150	Estimation utilisant les polynômes de Bernstein	This thesis focuses on the presentation of the Bernstein estimators which are recent alternatives to conventional estimators of the distribution function and density. More precisely, we study their various properties and compare them with the empirical distribution function  and the kernel method estimators. We determine an asymptotic expression of the first two moments of the Bernstein estimator for the distribution function. As the conventional estimators, we show that this estimator satisfies the Chung-Smirnov property under conditions. We then show that the Bernstein estimator is better than the empirical distribution function in terms of mean squared error. We are interested in the asymptotic behavior of Bernstein estimators, for a suitable choice of the degree of the polynomial, we show that the Bernstein estimators are asymptotically normal. Numerical studies on some classical distributions confirm that the Bernstein estimators may be preferable to conventional estimators.

1151	Caractéristiques des structures turbulentes de l'écoulement et du transport en charge de fond en rivière à lit de graviers lors de la montée d'une crue	In gravel-bed rivers, bedload transport is an intermittent process related to many variables of the fluvial system whose prediction is still unreliable. Available models for prediction of bedload transport use mean hydraulics variables and generally do not consider turbulence even if coherent turbulent flow structures in rivers are highly energetic. New approaches to bedload transport investigation can shed light on this very important process in alluvial channels. In this thesis, we document these components of the fluvial system in a gravel-bed river during a flood. The objectives of the research are to: 1) investigate the effect of discharge on turbulent variables and turbulent coherent flow structures, 2) investigate the effect of discharge on bedload transport events statistics detected with a newly developed and tested algorithm and 3) link turbulent flow characteristics to individual bedload transport events. Turbulence data shows that at high water level, the decelerated flow has a low coherency and an isotropic turbulence where coherent turbulent flow structures have a short duration. These observations differ from those made at low water level where the accelerated flow corresponds to what is generally observed in uniform flows of gravelly channels. Frequency distributions of bedload transport events variables (mean bedload transport rate, event duration and time interval between successive bedload events) have different shapes for the two investigated flood intensity. At high water level, bedload transport is less intermittent that at low discharge where distributions are more characterised by rare events. Flow velocity acceleration on a short time scale has a positive effect on bedload transport, but mainly when the mobilizing flood is under bankfull stage. Results from the study show that turbulence properties and complex relationships between turbulence and bedload transport are a function of discharge.

1152	A Tangled Web? Asking the Gender Question in the Multilateral Development Banks’ Law and Justice Policies in India	Over the course of the last two decades, IFIs (most prominently the World Bank) have begun acknowledging the centrality of human development as an essential element of the economic development process if the growth aimed at is to be holistic and sustainable. Strikingly, there is no agreement on the manner in which this approach is to be achieved, especially in the field of gender and development. This paper focuses on the issue of whether the Multilateral Development Banks’ policies have truly attempted at implementing their stated model of gender mainstreaming through their programmes and projects in India, with a specific focus on the legal sector, since that sector has both instrumental and intrinsic value for gender rights advocates. This article will aim at reviewing their approach towards rule of law projects and the manner in which gender equality norms have or have not been addressed within that framework; it will end with recommendations as to the necessary issues which gender programmes must address within the rule of law framework in order to achieve the Millennium Development Goal of gender equity.

1153	Identifying the direct effects of ammonia on the brain	Elevated concentrations of ammonia in the brain as a result of hyperammonemia leads to cerebral dysfunction involving a spectrum of neuropsychiatric and neurological symptoms (impaired memory, shortened attention span, sleep-wake inversions, brain edema, intracranial hypertension, seizures, ataxia and coma). Many studies have demonstrated ammonia as a major player involved in the neuropathophysiology associated with liver failure and inherited urea cycle enzyme disorders. Ammonia in solution is composed of a gas (NH(3)) and an ionic (NH(4) (+)) component which are both capable of crossing plasma membranes through diffusion, channels and transport mechanisms and as a result have a direct effect on pH. Furthermore, NH(4) (+) has similar properties as K(+) and, therefore, competes with K(+) on K(+) transporters and channels resulting in a direct effect on membrane potential. Ammonia is also a product as well as a substrate for many different biochemical reactions and consequently, an increase in brain ammonia accompanies disturbances in cerebral metabolism. These direct effects of elevated ammonia concentrations on the brain will lead to a cascade of secondary effects and encephalopathy.

1154	Decreased glutamate transporter (GLT-1) expression in frontal cortex of rats with acute liver failure	It has been suggested that reduced astrocytic uptake of neuronally released glutamate contributes to the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy in acute liver failure. In order to further address this issue, the recently cloned and sequenced astrocytic glutamate transporter GLT-1 was studied in brain preparations from rats with ischemic liver failure induced by portacaval anastomosis followed 24 h later by hepatic artery ligation and from appropriate sham-operated controls. GLT-1 expression was studied using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Expression of GLT-1 transcript was significantly decreased in frontal cortex at coma stages of acute liver failure. Western blotting using a polyclonal antibody to GLT-1 revealed a concomitant decrease in expression of transporter protein in the brains of rats with acute liver failure. Reduced capacity of astrocytes to reuptake neuronally released glutamate, resulting from a GLT-1 transporter deficit and the consequently compromised neuron-astrocytic trafficking of glutamate could contribute to the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy and brain edema, two major complications of acute liver failure.

1155	Increased extracellular brain glutamate in acute liver failure: decreased uptake or increased release?	Glutamatergic dysfunction has been suggested to play an important role in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) in acute liver failure (ALF). Increased extracellular brain glutamate concentrations have consistently been described in different experimental animal models of ALF and in patients with increased intracranial pressure due to ALF. High brain ammonia levels remain the leading candidate in the pathogenesis of HE in ALF and studies have demonstrated a correlation between ammonia and increased concentrations of extracellular brain glutamate both clinically and in experimental animal models of ALE Inhibition of glutamate uptake or increased glutamate release from neurons and/or astrocytes could cause an increase in extracellular glutamate. This review analyses the effect of ammonia on glutamate release from (and uptake into) both neurons and astrocytes and how these pathophysiological mechanisms may be involved in the pathogenesis of HE in ALF.

1156	Selective alterations of brain osmolytes in acute liver failure: protective effect of mild hypothermia	The principal cause of mortality in patients with acute liver failure (ALF) is brain herniation resulting from intracranial hypertension caused by a progressive increase of brain water. In the present study, ex vivo high-resolution 1H-NMR spectroscopy was used to investigate the effects of ALF, with or without superimposed hypothermia, on brain organic osmolyte concentrations in relation to the severity of encephalopathy and brain edema in rats with ALF due to hepatic devascularization. In normothermic ALF rats, glutamine concentrations in frontal cortex increased more than fourfold at precoma stages, i.e. prior to the onset of severe encephalopathy, but showed no further increase at coma stages. In parallel with glutamine accumulation, the brain organic osmolytes myo-inositol and taurine were significantly decreased in frontal cortex to 63\% and 67\% of control values, respectively, at precoma stages (p<0.01), and to 58\% and 67\%, respectively, at coma stages of encephalopathy (p<0.01). Hypothermia, which prevented brain edema and encephalopathy in ALF rats, significantly attenuated the depletion of myo-inositol and taurine. Brain glutamine concentrations, on the other hand, did not respond to hypothermia. These findings demonstrate that experimental ALF results in selective changes in brain organic osmolytes as a function of the degree of encephalopathy which are associated with brain edema, and provides a further rationale for the continued use of hypothermia in the management of this condition.

1173	L’analyse et la mise en œuvre du développement d’une communauté virtuelle de pratique pour les infirmières en santé scolaire au Québec	School health nurses, are professionals working in health community network and who perform work with youth and their families in schools. This area of nursing involves an autonomous practice without colleagues nearby, thus limiting advisory access to colleagues. Isolation is a feature of the work of school nurses. This has an impact on their ability to continuing education, which makes this branch of industry demanding and difficult (Smith, 2004). Barriers that contribute to feelings of isolation from the school nurse are physical, social and organizational (Smith, 2004). Barriers that contribute to the sense of isolation of the nurse in the school environment are physical, social and organizational (Smith, 2004). In addition, school nurses have a unique professional role because they lie on the border between the areas of education and health care. The success of school nursing practice requires an understanding of the two environments and effective negotiation with stakeholders of the two sectors.  This requires autonomy of the nurse, a quality that can be difficult to develop. Autonomy, as described by Simmons (2002), is a source of independence, professionalism and innovation. Perceptions that color the practice of school nursing vary depending on the expertise of the school nurse. So there is a need to consider realistic and effective ways to overcome the perceived barriers, promote independence and facilitate knowledge sharing. The development of a virtual community of practice for school health nurses who work in Quebec (CVP-ISSQ) proved to be an innovative tool to address a need. I've started this CVP in 2010 to meet the perceived needs and since no other study only became interested in it.  This work presents a review and an analysis of the concepts followed by the development of a conceptual framework to support the operation and ensure the sustainability of a virtual community of practice for nurses in school health. A conclusion emerged to the effect that the modalities of communication have evolved dramatically in recent years and as all professionals, nurses must take advantage of this tool to share ideas and best expertise.	knowledge transfer , practice of school nurses , virtual community of practice	en	9263.0

1175	Developmental trajectories of marijuana use and psychological distress : exploring the co-occurrence of these phenomena in early adolescence	Early adolescence is period of rapid changes where psychological distress and marijuana use experimentation are common occurrences. Longitudinal studies examining the association between these two phenomena have provided mixed results and many questions prevail regarding the nature of this association. The purpose of this study is to examine the patterns of co-occurrence between marijuana use and psychological distress in early adolescence.  A sample of 448 adolescent boys and girls attending two high schools in Montreal, Canada was followed from Grade 7 to 9. From 1999 to 2001, the participants completed an annual survey which included measures of marijuana use and psychological distress (IDPESQ-14).  Using a semi-parametric group based modeling strategy, the study has for objectives to establish the developmental trajectories of marijuana use and psychological distress in early adolescence, to explore how marijuana use or psychological distress measured at baseline is associated with various developmental trajectories and to examine the interrelationship of these two phenomena as they concurrently develop over the span of our study.  Our results provide evidence that marijuana use and psychological distress are phenomena with great heterogeneity as they develop over time.   We identified 3 trajectories of marijuana use: Light Users, Increasers and High Chronics and 3 trajectories of psychological distress: Low, Medium and High. Our findings also demonstrate that adolescents who reported psychological distress at baseline were more likely to follow problematic trajectories of marijuana use when compared to light users and the reverse of the association was also true since adolescent who reported marijuana use at baseline were more likely to follow an elevated trajectory of psychological distress. Our joint trajectory analysis demonstrated that the developmental patterns of co-occurrence of marijuana use and psychological distress are complex.  Our study provides evidence that adolescents following a trajectory of elevated psychological distress are at increased risk of also following a trajectory of elevated marijuana use but adolescents following a problematic trajectory of marijuana use are not necessarily at greater risk of following an elevated trajectory of psychological distress.  Our study highlights the presence of an asymmetrical relationship between marijuana use and psychological distress in early adolescence.	marijuana use , psychological distress , depressive symptomatology , early adolescence , co-occurrence , semi-parametric , developmental trajectories , joint trajectory analysis , marijuana , adolescence	en	9235.0
1176	Un aspect méconnu de l’île de Montréal : les occupations amérindiennes du Sylvicole supérieur à la fin du XVIIe siècle	The main aim of this thesis is to define and characterize the native presence on the island of Montreal during the period extending from the Late Woodland to the end of the 17th century, and to attempt to understand the role of the Mount Royal within this context. On the basis of landscape archeology theories, we study the human landscape’s creation and the way by which these places affect the behavior and identity of their occupants. Using the continuity of repetitive tasks associated with the concept of taskscape, we have tried to establish a model of occupation reflecting the dynamic and strategic use of the landscape with regard to colonial policies. The method adopted is a holistic approach based on archeological, historical, ethnohistorical and ethnographic data from archeological excavation reports, oral traditions and various colonial documents dating from the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries. This study has made it possible to determine various areas associated with different perceptions of landscape reflecting a continuity strategy regarding the conceptualization, organization and manipulation of space following land appropriation by the colonial government.

1177	L'état de stress post-traumatique-complexe : un concept novateur à explorer	Maltreatment is a risk factor that may hinder the normal development of children. The principal objective of this thesis is to better understand complex posttraumatic stress disorder, by evaluating it and documenting its relationship with other variables. This thesis includes two empirical articles. The objective of the first article is to develop a measure of complex posttraumatic stress disorder for French-speaking adults. The psychometric properties of the translated version of the Structured Interview for Disorders of Extreme Stress-Self-Report (SIDES-SR) were tested through preliminary analyses with 438 French-speaking adults from the general population and the University of Montreal. Results demonstrate that the instrument has a factor structure of five factors similar to the English version of the instrument. The factors obtained are: 1) pessimistic beliefs about others and future, 2) managing emotions, 3) avoidance of physical and sexual contact, 4) somatization, and 5) risk-taking behaviours. The internal consistency of 4 of the 5 factors varies from acceptable to very satisfactory, while their temporal stability and convergent, divergent and concurrent validity are acceptable. The purpose of the second article is to examine the contribution of complex posttraumatic stress disorder found in mothers and parenting practices (monitoring and abusive punishment) on psychological symptoms reported by children victims of sexual abuse. Symptoms of 96 mothers and their rearing practices were assessed using self-report measures, while children’s symptoms were measured with an instrument designed for children. Results demonstrate that, after controlling for sociodemographic variables and characteristics of the child sexual abuse, complex posttraumatic stress disorder is associated with several symptoms in children. The moderating role of maternal monitoring in the relationship between complex posttraumatic stress disorder of mothers and symptoms of depression and opposition of children is also demonstrated. Theoretical and clinical implications are discussed concerning the results obtained in this doctoral project.

1178	Estimation des corrélations phylogénétiques entre paramètres d'évolution moléculaire et Traits d'histoire de vie	In recent years, molecular evolution seeks to characterize the variation and intensity of selection through the ratio between non-synonymous and synonymous substitution rates (dN/dS). The dN/dS measure was either used to study the history of the variation of the intensity of selection over time or to detect episodes of positive selection. Correlations between selection and variations of the effective population size interfere in these measurements. The Comparative method can measure correlations between quantitative traits along a phylogeny. They are also be used to test hypotheses of correlated evolution of life history traits, like the body mass, and the substitution rate. We propose an approach combining the comparative method based on the principle of independent contrasts and a model of molecular evolution in a Bayesian probabilistic framework. By integrating along a phylogeny both ancestral reconstructions of lines and of dN/dS we estimate the covariance among traits and between traits and parameters of the model of molecular evolution. A hierarchical model was implemented in the software coevol published during this master. This model allows the simultaneous analysis of multiple genes within a single model. Parallel calculations allow increasing the size of the model to the genome scale. We studied placental mammals, where many complete genomes and phenotypic measurements are available. Based on theories of life history traits, our method is expected to characterize the association of groups of genes in biological processes related to the studied phenotypes.

regards sur la condition d’exilé dans les littératures libano-québécoise et arabe contemporaine"	Exile is a condition of displacement and a phenomenon that affects great masses of people today. Although this experience exists since the proverbial beginning of time, its parameters are changing in the present context of globalization, which transforms the role of nations and where societies are characterized by greater mobility and cultural diversity. The profound psychological and cultural transformations of identity – inward and outward – to which people are confronted through displacement can be understood as a condition per se, an exilic condition. This condition with moving marks, and which develops in a discontinuous temporality and as a necessarily painful experience, has been the source of prolific literature and of literary studies in the 20th century and before. How, differently then, does the 21st century gaze at this condition ? In this thesis, four works are analyzed in which the authors present different visions of the exilic condition. Two main lines of thinking have been explored around this condition: Edward Said embraced a critical and political posture while Julia Kristeva conceived of exile in its psychological dimensions. Within these analytic perspectives, Mourid Barghouti’s autobiography has affinities with Said’s approach as it inaugurates an autonomous condition. Through Rawi Hage’s novel, a more psychological experience of exile is observed, one that is more violent and traumatic. It sheds light on the undeniable impact of the environment on the experience of exile in the host country. If the relation to the host country stays dysfunctional, a pathological attitude to the exilic experience may develop. Abla Farhoud’s novel explores the possible overcoming of the pathologies of exile through distance, age, time, and words, the distance needed for Dounia. Finally, the psychological limitations of exile can be overcome by translating the “unspeakable” in violence, by a return to the pre-exilic traumas, and by a collective sharing of this restorative work. Mouawad’s play also exposes the psychological dimension of exile, but it also maintains its critical and political ones. We observe through these analyses that the exilic condition demands a redressing of the traumas that preceded exile, understood as another trauma, so that the exiled can exist in an autonomous, creative and committed way in his or her society of adoption. For the last three authors, this society is Québec, which shows openness to, and comprehension of, the major issues of the exilic condition in the 21st century.

1180	Détection et caractérisation de naines brunes et exoplanètes avec un filtre accordable pour applications dans l'espace	This thesis determines the capability of detecting faint companions in the presence of speckle noise when performing space-based high-contrast imaging through spectral differential imagery (SDI) using a low-order Fabry-Perot etalon as a tunable filter. The performance of such a tunable filter is illustrated through the Tunable Filter Imager (TFI), an instrument designed for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).  Using a TFI prototype etalon and a custom designed test bed, the etalon’s ability to perform speckle-suppression through SDI is demonstrated experimentally. Improvements in contrast vary with separation, ranging from a factor of 10 at working angles greater than 11 lambda/D and increasing up to a factor of 60 at 5 lambda/D. These measurements are consistent with a Fresnel optical propagation model which shows the speckle suppression capability is limited by the test bed and not the etalon. This result demonstrates that a tunable filter is an attractive option to perform high-contrast imaging through SDI. To explore the capability of space-based SDI using an etalon, we perform an end-to-end Fresnel propagation of JWST and TFI. Using this simulation, a contrast improvement ranging from a factor of 7 to 100 is predicted, depending on the instrument’s configuration. The performance of roll-subtraction is simulated and compared to that of SDI. The SDI capability of the Near-Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (NIRISS), the science instrument module to replace TFI in the JWST Fine Guidance Sensor is also determined.  Using low resolution, multi-band (0.85-2.4 um) multi-object spectroscopy, 104 objects towards the central region of the Orion Nebular Cluster have been assigned spectral types including 7 new brown dwarfs, and 4 new planetary mass candidates. These objects are useful for determining the substellar initial mass function and for testing evolutionary and atmospheric models of young stellar and substellar objects. Using the measured H band magnitudes, combined with our determined extinction values, the classified objects are used to create an Hertzsprung-Russell diagram for the cluster. Our results indicate a single epoch of star formation beginning 1 Myr ago. The initial mass function of the cluster is derived and found to be consistent with the values determined for other young clusters and the galactic disk.

1181	Construction d'un Atlas 3D numérique de la cornée humaine par recalage d'images	We propose to build a 3D digital atlas which contains the average characteristics and variability of the morphology of an organ.  In particular our work consists in the construction of a 3D digital atlas of the entire human cornea including anterior and posterior surfaces. The atlas was built using topographies provided by the Orbscan II system. First, we normalized the given population of corneas using  a variant of the ICP (iterative closest point) algorithm for shape registration to fit simultaneously the anterior and posterior surfaces with the anterior and posterior surfaces of a reference cornea. Indeed, we developed a specific algorithm for corneas topographies that considers scaling during registration and which is based on neighborhood search via the Euclidean distance to find the correspondence between points. After that, we built the corneal atlas by averaging elevations of anterior and posterior surfaces and by calculating their associated standard deviations. A population of 100 healthy corneas was used to construct the normal corneal atlas. To illustrate the atlas, we used topographic color maps like those already offered by existing topographic systems. Finally, observations were made on the corneal atlas that reflects its precision and allows to develop a better understanding of corneal anatomy.

1182	L'évolution des comportements d'agressivité physique de la petite enfance à l'âge scolaire : le rôle des relations d'amitié en début de scolarisation	The aim of the present dissertation was to investigate the prospective links between friendship relationships and physical aggression development during the early school years. Within a theoretical framework based on social learning, personality, attachment and socioconstructivist theories, we examined the unique and combined role of various dimensions of friendship quality, friends’ behavioral characteristics and child’s pre-existing vulnerabilities in regard to the persistence of young children’s physical aggression. Data from the Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child Development (QLSCD), from the Quebec Newborn Twin Study (QNTS) and from an efficacity test through a dyadic intervention program were used. Measures in this dissertation were collected from kindergarten to grade 2, when the children were aged from 5 to 8 years old, with the children themselves, their friends, their classmates, their parents, as well as their teachers, through various questionnaires, a peer evaluation procedure and hypothetical scenarios.       In line with the social learning perspective, friends’ aggression was linked to a significant increase in children’s physical aggression. However, in line with the social bonding perspective, a good friendship quality played both a compensatory and a protective role, by respectively reducing children’s initial level of physical aggression and by mitigating the associations between friends’ and children’s physical aggression. Results also show that friendship conflict was associated to a linear increase with boys’ but not with girls’ physical aggression over time. Shared positive affect and conflict resolution skills were found to mitigate the prospective association between friendship conflict and children’s physical aggression. These results were independent of children’s sex and genetic risk for physical aggression. No interaction effects were found between the friendship dimensions and genetic risk for aggression, suggesting that children are equally affected independently from their genetic liability. Results showed an indirect effect of the dyadic intervention on decreasing levels of physical aggression through the improvement of one specific feature of friendship quality: conflict resolution. These results support the causal role of friendship quality on the developmental course of physical aggression and point to the inclusion of this relational aspect in prevention programs targeting young aggressive children.  Overall, the main and moderating effect found between friendship quality, friend’s aggression and child personal characteristics bring both theoretical and practical implications. Indeed, these results suggest that fostering a positive relationship between friends in the early school years may decrease physical aggression even if the friends are aggressive. Besides, high friendship quality may also buffer against the risk associated with experiencing conflict. These findings underscored the importance of taking into account the relational characteristics, such as conflict resolution and positive affect, in order to better understand the impact of friendship relationships on children’s physical aggression development.

1183	Espace urbain et identité : l’imaginaire de la ville comme symptôme de la crise identitaire dans l’oeuvre d’Orhan Pamuk	"Istanbul is for Pamuk what Paris is for Baudelaire: an inexhaustible source of inspiration and spleen. But, if the French poet is more conscious of his states of mind, the most widely read contemporary Turkish novelist seems at first to deliberately disregard the fact that any discourse on the external world is also a discourse about himself. At first, in emulation of other Turkish novelists, Pamuk seems to thoroughly enjoy mapping the hüzün, the much talked about collective feeling of melancholy, reputed to be intrinsic to the city and its ruins. Nevertheless, as soon as Pamuk starts to follow in the footsteps of foreign writers and artists who have visited Istanbul, he notices that the apparent melancholy of the ruins is only one layer among many fluid layers. While following the tracks of the otherness, Pamuk discovers the heterogeneous character of his city but also of himself and notices that the collective melancholy widely accepted by most his compatriots is fabricated by a certain socio-political narrative, within a specific social class. Indeed, by tracking the reflections of his own imaginative twin, the novelist is suddenly aware of the elusiveness of his own subjectivity but also of the world and the others. If such is the case, the urban space that preoccupies and obsesses Pamuk is only a reflection of his mind and the will to fully access to the presence, is nothing but an illusion. As if the disturbing uncanny of his unconscious, by revealing the elusive side of the world and the self, encourages Pamuk to challenge a number of views and opinions taken for granted, inside his own culture but also inside the culture of the other, his European twin. For, if everything is fluid and malleable, there is no reason not to question everything, including tradition and state politics, the latter making him, ""a person well more political, serious and responsible that I am and ever whished to be"". Thus, Istanbul: memoires and the city questions the relationship between the subjectivity and the heterogeneous layers of Istanbul in order to come to a deconstructionist conclusion: everything is a substitute; there is a general absence of sense. If the city lacks a tangible raison d’être or sense in its history and topography, then it must be the same in places that are far from Istanbul. Thus central characters in The House of the Silence question not only the very foundation of their identity and subjectivity, but also the relationship between tradition and modernity, center and periphery, East and West, not to mention the destructive and ephemeral nature of time and space. In Pamuk’s most recent novel, The Museum of Innocence, the protagonist engages in an even more obsessive and destructive quest for another kind of space and time — an imaginary in-between space allowing for a seamless traffic between reality and fiction, East and West, and tradition and modernity. This in-between space or identity clearly anchors Pamuk among the most interesting postmodern novelists of our time. But, this in-between positionality, however, can only be attained at a price: Pamuk’s work, illuminating insight or a precarious balance is more often than not achieved through the sacrifice of the female figure."

1184	Neural correlates of affordance competition in dorsal premotor cortex	This thesis examines the role of the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) in the process of decision making (action selection) and visual guidance of arm movements. The work describes electrophysiological experiments conducted in awake monkeys (Macaca mulatta) and tests a number of important predictions suggested by the affordance competition hypothesis (Cisek, 2006; Cisek, 2007a). This hypothesis suggests that decisions can be viewed as the result of a competition between internal representations of conflicting demands and opportunities for actions or affordances (Gibson, 1979). Specific interest is given to the interaction between spatial information and expected value (EV) in a proposed affordance competition mechanism for action selection. The first study presented (article 1) explores how EV is represented during the delay period in PMd. This study also describes how this area reflects the spatial metrics of the options and examines the interaction between value and spatial information. The second study (article 2) explores the mechanism of action selection in more detail and extends the results to ventral premotor cortex (PMv). This study also addresses the nature of value and spatial representations from a learning perspective. In a novel environment the spatial metrics of the actions seem to be invariably present in PMd, meanwhile EV representations appear only once the animals make behaviorally informed decisions about the value of the available options. The third study (article 3) explores how PMd is involved in “changes of mind” in which action selection is updated following a movement instruction (GO signal). III IV The major findings in all these studies are reproduced by a computational model (Cisek, 2006) suggesting that decisions between actions can be made through a biased competition process that takes place in the same region that specifies the actions.

1185	Biomédecine et médecines alternatives : alliance possible ou scission inévitable? : le cas des acupuncteurs à Montréal	If the alternative is to our days and in our western societies a concept more and more in vogue, its character remains ambiguous. In effect, and even that number of practices called “alternatives” emerge on both sides of the society, in referring to in some areas is equivalent to plague itself-even a label on which would be marked “New-Age” in bold. Yet, its character far from referring to this single dimension, seems also be consistent to a more and more significant unbalance within the prerogatives of the State. This dissertation therefore attempts to account for this phenomenon while inquiry into the repercussions of this asymmetry on the integration of alternative medical practices in Quebec. This with the intention not only to further explore the nature of the relationship between alternative medicine and biomedicine, but also in order to install a new look on its expansion. A look, which would potentially lay the groundwork necessary to a space of conciliation between the medicines and which would lead to a new balance in the heart of the prerogatives of the State.

1186	L’évolution de l’évaluation de la composante linguistique de la compétence à écrire par le ministère de l’Éducation : une étude longitudinale sur les épreuves uniques de 5e secondaire	This research aims to describe the ways in which the evaluation of written French has evolved within the “épreuves unique” of secondary 5. More specifically, it analyzes the evolution of evaluation methods regarding written language conventions in these examinations. A documentary research has allowed us to collect examinations and other related documents for a time span stretching from 1971 to 2012. Although our study specifically looks into the “épreuves uniques”, which were implanted in 1986, we have chosen to go back further in time in order to depict a larger portrait of certificate evaluation of French writing in secondary 5. Many aspects are analyzed: context of examinations, tasks contained within them, scoring parameters and pass levels regarding language conventions, examinations as a whole as well as writing and the French language. We have also observed the province-wide evolution of students’ results for these examinations. Using a variety of theoretical concepts related to the evaluation of written language conventions, a methodology was developed in order to allow the analysis of writing assignments. The latter notably reveals that the nature of such tasks and their parameters have remained relatively constant in time, particularly since 1986. The number of allowed language-related mistakes has augmented, whereas students’ results have remained stable. Furthermore, the historic perspective of this study illustrates how the ministère de l’Éducation nowadays allows a great importance to writing and the correction of spelling mistakes.	ministère de l’Éducation , secondary 5 , writing , writing evaluation , language conventions , French	en	9169.0
1187	Novel non phospholipid liposomes with high sterol content : development and characterization	Liposomes are promising and versatile nanocarriers suitable for potential applications in many fields. A decade ago, a new type of liposomes formed from monoalkylated amphiphiles and sterols was born somehow fortuitously in our group. They are referred to as Sterosomes, because they contain a large proportion of sterols, between 50 and 70 mol %. The objectives of the present thesis are to develop novel Sterosome formulations with specific features, and to gain a deeper understanding of the physicochemical rules that dictate their phase behavior. We have specifically examined the role of the molecular features of sterols, of the interfacial charges and of the H-bond capacity in the intermolecular interactions leading to the self-assembly. The phase behavior was characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), infrared spectroscopy (IR), and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of deuterium (2H NMR).  First, we have established some correlations between the structure of the sterols, the propensity to form fluid bilayers, and the permeability of the resulting large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs). The nature of the sterol modulates the properties of the mixture with palmitic acid (PA). Sterols bearing a bulky tail chain at C17 are less capable to induce fluid bilayers than those with a non-bulky tail chain, like that of cholesterol. A large ordering of the alkyl chain of PA is an effect exhibited by all of the investigated sterols. It is shown that the permeability of the LUVs can be controlled using different sterols. However, these sterols have no significant impact on the pH-sensitivity of Sterosomes. In order to create liposomes that are pH-sensitive and that have a positive surface charge, Sterosomes composed of stearylamine and cholesterol (Chol) were designed and characterized. It is concluded that the protonation/deprotonation state of the amine (in this work) and carboxylic acid (in previous work) groups confers the pH-sensitivity and determines the surface charge of the liposomes.  The first completely neutral Sterosomes were crafted based on the creation of strong intermolecular hydrogen bond networks. The sulfoxide group was capable of forming strong hydrogen bonds with cholesterol and water molecules. In an equimolar octadecyl methyl sulfoxide (OMSO)/Chol mixture, a metastable fluid bilayer was obtained at room temperature. This distinct phase behavior allowed extruding the mixtures to form LUVs at room temperature. After 30 h, the life-time of the metastable phase, stable and impermeable Sterosomes still existed in the solid form. A temperature–composition diagram was proposed to summarize the phase behavior of OMSO/Chol mixtures.   Finally, a further step was made to prepare “stealth” Sterosomes by incorporating polyethylene glycol (PEG) with a cholesterol anchor (PEG-Chol) at the interface of PA/Chol Sterosomes. Up to 20 mol % PEG-Chol can be introduced without disturbing the bilayer structure. The presence of PEG-Chol had no significant impact on the permeability of the resulting LUVs. Active-loading of an anti-cancer drug, doxorubicin, can be achieved despite the low permeability of these LUVs and the presence of the PEG at the interface. The inclusion of PEG modified considerably the interface properties and decreased significantly the pH-triggered release observed with naked PA/Chol LUVs. This novel formulation is potentially useful for the application of intravenous administration in the drug delivery field.	liposomes , liquid-ordered phase , monoalkylated amphiphiles , sterols , PEGylated cholesterol , passive release , controlled release , active loading , NMR , fluorescence , IR , DSC	en	9157.0
1188	Enforcing dendritic cell vaccines by manipulating the MHC II antigen presentation pathway	Dendritic cell peptide-based vaccines are the most common immunotherapy approach in cancer therapy. While, in principle, dendritic cells (DCs) could be loaded efficiently by exogenously added tumor peptides, their loading efficacy is severely reduced due to low number of peptide-receptive MHC II on cell surface. Most surface MHC II molecules are either occupied by endogenous peptides or are inactive due to a conformation that is not receptive for free peptides. In MHC II antigen presentation pathway, HLA-DM (DM) in acidic endosomal vesicles removes the self-peptides and grants a peptide receptive conformation to MHC II.  Mutating of an intracellular sorting motif in DM, renders its accumulation on cell surface. We hypothesized that the mutant DM (DMY) is functional on cell surface and can generate peptide receptive MHC II on surface of DCs for exogenous peptide loading. By using an adenoviral vector that expresses DMY, we found that DMY is functional on surface of DCs. DMY supplied peptide receptive MHC II on surface of DCs and improved exogenous peptide loading.  The improvement of peptide loading by DMY is both quantitative and qualitative. DMY improves helper T cell (Th) response in Th1 direction that favors anti-cancer immunity. The qualitative improvement of peptide loading extends to loading of superior conformational isomer (conformer) of peptide-MHC complexes. This superior conformer (type A) is the favourite type for vaccination approaches and DMY successfully edits peptide-MHC conformers on cell surface level by eliminating undesirable one (type B).    Function of DM is regulated by HLA-DO (DO) and it is well accepted that in acidic pH of late endosomes, DO inhibits function of DM by preventing removal of class II associated invariant chain peptide (CLIP) from peptide binding groove of MHC II. My results indicate that DO overexpression, changes binding of peptide-dependent superantigens to MHC II molecules. Superantigens (SAgs) are small microbial proteins that bind out side peptide binding groove of MHC II. DO probably enhances binding of peptide-dependent SAgs by forcing the accumulation of CLIP on the cell surface of antigen presenting cells. DO also neutralizes Th2 polarization by CLIP. Collectively, these results indicate that DMY is a valuable tool for improvement of exogenous peptide loading in DCs vaccines. An unnoticed effect of DO on SAgs binding was also recognized. Further investigations are needed to clarify the mechanisms by which, DMY and DO influence Th polarization. This would provide a better understanding of antigen presentation pathway and its interaction with immune system.

1189	Les pratiques stratégiques des infirmières dans les réseaux intégrés de services de santé	The integration of healthcare and services is perceived equally by the decision makers, by the professionals and by the users, as a necessity to ensure a better accessibility, to promote continuity and coordination and to improve the quality of these care and services, while controlling the costs. About two decades ago, the integrated healthcare and services networks have been developing in the countries of the OECD. This phenomenon has generated a broad quantity of literature concerning the organizational conditions supporting the integration of healthcare and more recently, on the importance of the role and the position of the professionals within these structures. The empirical data and the writings have been highlighting that the nurses have played an important part in the setting of the integrated healthcare and services networks since their beginning. This study’s goal is to identify the strategic practices of nurses that are involved in the integrated healthcare and services networks and to understand how those practices promote the organizational learning that allow adjustments of practices of all the contributors in the integration of services. It also aims to put forward the individual and organizational factors involved in the development of those practices and in the organizational learning process. Literature reviews on integrated services networks, clinical integration, organizational learning and strategic analysis confirmed that these writings, while being complementary, supported the objectives of this study. Indeed, the writings on the integration present determinants of the integration without approaching the strategic practices and while being discrete on the organizational learning. Literature on organizational learning fails to describe the practices that promote the organizational learning and are not talkative on the factors that influence the organizational learning. Finally, literature on the strategic analysis discusses the systems and the dynamic processes including the individual and organizational conditions, but they don’t refer to organizational learning. To discover the strategic practices and the organizational learning and to understand the learning process and its factors, we used multiple case studies as our research strategy. We studied the practices of nurses evolving in four situations aiming the clinical integration. Those situations were taking part of three healthcare and services networks involving professionals from different disciplines attached to either a hospital or to a local community services center. Three case studies have been written from the information arising from different data bases. Through this study, four data bases were used: individual interviews with nurses, other professionals and managers (n=60), group interviews (n=3), observation sessions (n=12) and the study of archive documents (n=96). With the empirical data collected we were able to discover fifteen strategic practices and to precise the nature of the learning they generated. The analysis of the cases also allowed us to better understand the link between the strategic practices and the organizational learning and to bring precisions on the organizational learning process. This study is concluded by a discussion on the integrated organizational learning model and on its applications in research as well as in practice. This study contributes to practice and to research by offering an integrated organizational learning model on top of specifying that the organizational learning process is propelled by learning cycles which are stimulated by strategic practices. It also clarifies that strategic practices take place because of the nurses’ individual resources and the organizational factors. Finally, the study demonstrates that organizational learning encourages a change in the practices supporting clinical integration.

1190	Elementary steps in aqueous proton transfer reactions : a first principles molecular dynamics study	The nature of acids in an aqueous environment is fundamental to many aspects of chemistry and biology. The defining feature of an acid is its ability to transfer a proton to water or to any accepting base, but this seemingly simple process can be complex and highly dependent on the solvation involving different reaction intermediate species. This thesis describes computational studies based on first principles molecular dynamics simulations aimed at obtaining molecular-level descriptions of diverse proton transfer process involving acids and bases in liquid water.  For that, we have investigated a variety of systems including aqueous hydrofluoric acid, aqueous trifluoroacetic acid and a model system comprising of a phenol and a carboxyate molecule bridged by a water molecule in aqueous solution.    Two different intermediate stages of proton transfer from an acid were identified which are found to be stabilized by distinct local H-bond solvation pattern. Their spectroscopic signatures were characterized using infrared spectroscopy computed from first principles molecular dynamics simulations which incorporate nuclear quantum effects explicitly.  This study also identified three elementary reaction pathways that are responsible for proton translocation from acid to the base and their characteristic time scales. Conclusions drawn from this study are discussed in molecular detail, highlighting experimental comparisons.

1191	Étude technologique et morphologique de la cornéenne dans le sud du Québec : le cas de la carrière préhistorique du mont Royal (BjFj-97) à Montréal	The Mount Royal quarry site (BjFj-97), discovered in 1993 by Yvon Codère and test pitted in 1997 by Ethnoscop Inc., is an interesting archaeological puzzle for anyone interested in the Montreal region prehistory. Following the 1997 archaeological testing, some ideas were raised about the quarry’s cultural affiliation and its chronological position. Archaeologists proposed a primary occupation focused on hornfels extraction and transformation dating back to the Terminal Archaic period (4000-3000 BP). Hornfels is a metamorphic rock that resulted from bedrock being “cooked” during cretaceous magmatic intrusion that created the Monteregian hills. The material recovered, includes more than 10,000 flakes and over 70 artefacts, and is analysed here for the first time.  This thesis provides a new perspective on the Mount Royal quarry site describing morphologically and technologically the stone tool production in order to better understand the hornfels’ chaîne opératoire. This lithic material is common on archaeological sites in southern Quebec can help us to address some issues of dating the quarry site. The entire lithic collection was subjected to an extensive analysis including all of the debitage and finished products, and shows the dominance of bifacial flintknapping, with some flake tools also being produced. All stages f the lithic reduction sequence are present on the Mount Royal quarry site. Hornfels is a difficult material to work because of its unpredictability, due to structure of matter, leading to a high rate of failures in the manufacture of tools. The main occupation of the site is dated to the Terminal Archaic, but the equivocal nature of the various objects makes it difficult to clearly define the period of occupation and exploitation.  Site BjFj-97 is similar to another site in New England where hornfels was worked using a similar lithic reduction sequence, suggesting a possible cultural kinship. Hornfels is common on sites in the Montreal area, often substituting for better materials. The presence of hornfels on these sites suggests a wider chronological spread than that established from the material analysis from the quarry and covers the Laurentian Archaic to Woodland periods. Hornfels is usually found in formal bifacial tool forms (bifaces, knives and projectile points) and less formal flakes tools (scrapers) suggesting a strictly utilitarian significance, characteristic of low quality materials. Little is known about hornfels extraction methods on the mountain.

1192	De la relation d’aide à la rencontre créative : le récit numérique comme outil de reconnaissance mutuelle	This exploratory study describes, from the viewpoint of social workers and other support workers, the conditions needed to set up a project that makes use of digital storytelling tools, as well as the main contributions of these tools as part of an intervention. The tools may be digital stories in the form of short, two-to-five minute videos (with music, text, voice, and/or animations), or short audio files (i.e., podcasts). They may also be interactive video games or a video montage created from extracts drawn from personal stories. A study exploring intervention tools that encourage creativity becomes all the more pertinent in a context where, particularly in public health and social services, intervention practices are becoming increasingly standardized. As yet, this field has been only minimally explored. Semi-directed interviews were conducted with eight workers who used these tools in their practice. Analysis of their statements sheds light on the conditions necessary to carry out this type of project, as well as the ethical questions that arise in the process. The analysis also reveals that one of the main contributions of these tools lies within the collaborative creative process. The process enriches the intervention by providing a space for freer speech where support workers and the people they help create ties that modify the hierarchical relationship between them. Moreover, the professional attention given to creating and sharing the products helps provide greater visibility to people who are often excluded from the public arena. Thus, in addition to exploring the contributions of an artistic tool to interventions, this study also makes it possible to analyze the issues of visibility and recognition associated with using participatory media.	empowerment , digital storytelling , visibility , creativity , participatory projects , empowerment	en	9100.0
1193	La mise en œuvre de services cliniques intégrés sous l’angle du sensemaking organisationnel : le cas des services intégrés en santé mentale et en dépendance	"The main objective of this thesis is to further our understanding of the implementation process of integrated care in an organizational context. It is structured on the sensemaking perspective (Weick, 1995).   At first, we studied how actors construct the meaning of the integration project they had to implement, and the impact of this sensemaking on clinical and organizational issues. The context studied is a new organization created to provide ultra-specialized services to patients suffering from co-occurring mental health and addiction disorders. We used a qualitative research strategy and based our analysis on longitudinal data (8 years) collected from three sources: semi-structured interviews, observations and document analysis. This analysis has resulted in two articles. While the first article focuses on the transformation of professional practices, the second article examined the phenomenon in terms of organizational identity.  Secondly, we conducted a critical analysis of the literature,focused on current trends in the way implementation studies of integrated services are carried out. The results are presented in the third article. Four main findings emerge from this work. The first finding is that the implementation of integrated care is a dynamic phenomenon, not without strain or tensions. In other words, this is an evolutive phenomenon that is defined and redefined depending on events, but never completely renewed. The enaction and commitment of professionals appeared to be key explanatory mechanisms of this phenomenon. The second finding is that implementation is actualized through interrelated levels of integration, which means that the context of implementation and the object that is implemented co-evolve and become mutually transformed. Our results showed that the concept of ""coupling practices"" was useful to capture this dynamic. The third finding is that implementation remains deeply rooted in the meaning that organizational members collectively construct of the integration project, through their everyday actions and interactions. This sensemaking leads to understanding how the content and form of the integration project are shaped according to circumstances, both from clinical and organizational aspects. The fourth finding is that these dynamics remain relatively unexplored to date in the scientific literature on the implementation of integrated care for co-occurring disorders. We hypothesize that this lack of recognition may explain some of the actual difficulties in implementing these services. Overall, these findings considerably enrich general understanding of the phenomenon by revealing the dynamics that constitute it and the issues it raises. Also decision makers and researchers consideration of these dynamics has the potential to promote and improve integrated practices."

1194	Analyse des figures féminines juives dans le roman québécois moderne et contemporain : L’avalée des avalés, La Québécoite et Hadassa	This thesis is devoted to the construction of Jewish female characters in three novels of modern and contemporary Quebec french literature. It examines the novels of Réjean Ducharme, L’avalée des avalés (1967), Régine Robin, La Québécoite (1983), Myriam Beaudoin, Hadassa (2006). Functions, values and discourses surrounding the presence of Jewish women figures are analyzed by means of dialogues between places and spaces in order to identify markers of identity, culture, society, linguistic and religion. We sought to update the chapter on the female figure of the Jewish pioneering book Mythes et Images du Juif au Québec (1977) from Victor Teboul. Teboul considers the female Jewish character as a secondary and mainly sexual character. This analysis, deeply entrenched in social discourses of the period of publication, deserves to be revisited with a corpus broader and more contemporary. To do this, we identified the main vectors of female Jewish identity by analyzing the discourses surrounding this presence, dialogue between identity, culture, history and society and the dynamics between spaces and places. We found that, in addition to stereotypes, the Jewish identity of the female figures of the three novels is shaped by its relation with places and spaces. The three novels differ widely in their relationship to Jewishness.	Jewishness , Quebec's literature , Cultural identity , Place and space , Cultural hybridity	en	9062.0
1195	Analyse comparative de l'équivalence terminologique en corpus parallèle et en corpus comparable : application au domaine du changement climatique	The research undertaken for this thesis concerns the analysis of terminological equivalence in a parallel corpus and a comparable corpus. More specifically, we focus on specialized texts related to the domain of climate change. A unique aspect of this study is based on the analysis of the equivalents of single word terms. The theoretical frameworks on which we rely are the terminologie textuelle (Bourigault et Slodzian 1999) and the lexico-sémantique approaches (L’Homme 2005).  This study has two objectives. The first is to perform a comparative analysis of terminological equivalents in the two types of corpora in order to verify if the equivalents found in the parallel corpus are different from the ones observed in the comparable corpora. The second is to compare in detail equivalents associated with a same English term, in order to describe them and define a typology. A detailed analysis of the French equivalents of 343 English terms is carried out with the help of computer tools (term extractor, text aligner, etc.) and the establishment of a rigorous methodology divided into three parts. The first part, common to both objectives of the research concerns the elaboration of the corpus, the validation of the English terms and the identification of the French equivalents in the two corpora. The second part describes the criteria on which we rely to compare the equivalents of the two types of corpora. The third part sets up the typology of equivalents associated with a same English term. The results for the first objective shows that of the 343 English words analyzed, terms with equivalents that can be criticized in both corpora are relatively low in number (12), while the number of terms with similar equivalences between the two corpora is very high (272 identical and 55 equivalents not objectionable). The analysis described in this chapter confirms our hypothesis that terminology used in parallel corpora does not differ from that used in comparable corpora. The results of the second objective show that many English terms are rendered by several equivalents (70% of analyzed terms). It is also noted that synonyms are not the largest group of equivalents but near-synonyms. Also, equivalents from another part of speech constitute an important part of the equivalents analyzed. Thus, the typology developed in this thesis presents terminological equivalent mechanisms rarely described as systematically in previous work.

The study first draws a parallel between the manufacturing of ""found images"" and the process of industrial recycling. The thesis then discusses the artistic influences of the experimental film movement initiated in the 1960s, which has been increasing its presence more and more since the introduction of the latest digital technologies. Finally, the study proposes an investigation of found footage in relation to the digital technology era, analyzing the causes and consequences of the [re]rise of the movement, and taking into account the multiplication of its format on the Internet through the practice of mashup."

1197	The relevancy and effectiveness of the United Nations Convention Against Corruption	The United Nations Convention Against Corruption (adopted in 2003) is the first global in-depth treaty on corruption. This work attempts to assess its significance by analyzing its provisions, in particular concerning the areas of prevention, criminalization, international cooperation and asset recovery. It then seeks to assess its relevancy and effectiveness by giving an overview of the Convention's main compliance challenges, as well as other existing initiatives that tackle corruption. Although the Convention innovates in many respects, it is argued that it also suffers from weaknesses that cannot be overlooked, preventing it from having a real impact on States' behavior.

1198	Characterizing the Expression of Cytochrome P450s in Breast Cancer Cells	Several types of cancer cells have shown an innate or accute resistance to anti-cancer agents which in turn causes a failure in treatment. This resistance has been suggested to be caused by the expression of membrane transporters in cancer cells, as well as inter-individual variability in metabolism. Our interest was to evaluate the implication of CYP450 enzymes in the local metabolism of cancer cells. Our first objective was to screen the expression level of six housekeeping genes (HKG) using 23 different cell lines to determine which gene was the most stable. We found that NUP-214 was the most stable HKG across the panel of cell lines tested, with a standard deviation of only 0.55 Ct. Our second objective was to determine the expression level of 19 CYP450 mRNA isoforms in various breast cancer cell lines by RT-PCR. The CYP450 mRNAs showed a large variability between the different cell lines analyzed, where CYP1B1 and 2J2 were strongly expressed in most cell lines. Our third objective was to determine if measurable metabolic activity was present and correlates with mRNA expression in these same breast cancer cell lines using the specific substrates 7-ethoxyresorufin and ebastine for CYP1B1 and 2J2 activities, respectively. The metabolism of 7-ethoxyresorufin showed an excellent correlation of 0.98 with CYP1B1 expression while ebastine demonstrates a strong correlation (r2=0.99) with 2J2 expression. Overall, these results suggest that local metabolism of anti-cancer agents could significantly affect drug disposition and be a source of chemoresistance.

1199	Towards the identification of a neighbourhood park typology : a conceptual and methodological exploration	Few studies have characterized park features that may be appealing for youth physical activity (PA). This study assesses the reliability of a youth-oriented direct-observation park assessment tool; identifies park domains captured by the tool using an operationalized conceptual model of parks and PA, and identifies distinct park types.  576 parks were audited using a park observation tool; intra- and inter-rater reliability were estimated. Exploratory principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted and variables were retained if they loaded at 0.3 or higher. A cluster analysis (CA) was conducted using the principal components and park area. The tool was found to be reliable and PCA yielded ten principal components explaining 60% of the total variance. The CA yielded a nine-cluster outcome explaining 40% of the total variance. PCA and CA were found to be feasible methods to use with park data. The operationalization of the conceptual model helped interpret these results.

1200	La formation continue à distance des enseignants du secondaire au Bénin : réalités et perspectives	This study focuses on the relevance and feasibility using Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) for in-service training of qualified teachers of secondary general public school in Republic of Benin through a distance education program. There were two specific objectives: the identification and analysis of in-service training needs of teachers and the study of administrative procedures, educational and technological development of such a program in the context of Republic of Benin. The population of the study was made up of    1 488 qualified teachers and a sample of 278 teachers representing them in general secondary public education of the Republic of Benin. The research was conducted on the basis of the implementation of two types of questionnaire. We used the Nominal Group Technique (NGT) to generate a data bank for designing a questionnaire to collect information from qualified teachers, and three questionnaires based on the Delphi Technique were submitted to 13 experts from the Beninese education system. It was found that a future in-service training program on distance education for secondary school teachers should include mainly the following three themes, in order of priority:  1. Information Technologies and Communications; 2. Teaching methods; 3. Specific subject areas.  Experts from the Beninese education system used the Delphi Technique and established a list of 23 items corresponding to the administrative procedures, and teaching techniques for the implementation of training. Analysis of the results of the Delphi technique and the answers of the questionnaire to teachers showed that the use/integration of a variety of media to transmit knowledge and support learning is very necessary. The results of the research also showed that teachers in general secondary education need continuing education which can be facilitated by the use of distance education with the aid of ICT. An organizational model of in-service training based on the use of ICT has been suggested.	West africa , Subsaharan africa , Needs analysis , Training , Teachers skills , ICT	en	9003.0
1201	La collaboration des parents de minorités visibles avec les services de la protection de la jeunesse : le rôle du soutien informel parental et des compétences de l’intervenant	This research is in response to the overrepresentation of visible minority families in the Montreal child welfare system. It explores, from the perspective of the practitioner, the role of the practitioner's cultural competencies and of informal parental support in developing collaborative relationships. The analysis looks at data from 24 individual interviews, during which practitioners described 48 different interventions. The results propose a typology based on the collaboration of parents and the involvement of their informal network in the intervention. The practitioners provide a description of the competencies and how they are used with typology profiles. The discussion evokes the concept of social resilience, intervention strategies and social constructionism. Three outcomes result from this research : a view of collaboration that expands on the informal network, a questioning of cultural competencies, and the development of a reflective practice.

1202	Les origines biologiques de la musique	Music is a universal and ubiquitous human behaviour, but it is still largely ignored by anthropology. While music is well characterised at proximate levels of explanation, the question of their evolutionary origins remains relatively unexplored. Nevertheless, any attempts to explain this phenomena needs to investigate its potential adaptive significance and phylogeny This project consists of an attempt to define music in terms of universals, of a interspecific comparison of the phenomena and of a summary of the phylogenetic history of musical behaviour as well as an analysis of two theories on origins of music (Miller, 2000 ; Mithen, 2006). Their predictions will be confronted to empirical data from a large array of disciplines to evaluate their scientific value. The analysis of the data available allows to produce an inventory of cognitive, structural, emotional, functional and symbolic music universals and to identify certain biological bases of the phenomena. Several evolutionist mechanisms, including natural selection, sexual selection, group selection and kin selection, have been employed by several authors to explain the emergence of music. It seems that music played an important role in the parent-infant relationship throughout evolution, as well as in social cohesion, coordination of social activities and formation of group identity. Regarding the two models analysed in this research, their comparison allows us to conclude that they are mutually exclusive and only discuss part of the musical invariants. In the end, an evolutionary framework that synthesizes and reconciles these hypotheses is proposed.	Music , Evolution , Anthropology	en	8973.0
1203	Les carrefours de la composition. De la musique comme art de la scène	This thesis examines the theme of performing a composition of contemporary music on the stage. The research takes as its basis multiple composition projects putting the idea of music as a performing art at the forefront. Each piece submitted integrates, at different levels, the notion of on-stage performance as a compositional parameter. The first part of this document examines the concepts of the “surroundings” of a piece, compositional processes as metaphors, music and speech interaction, musical references, possible encounters between the body, playacting and objects. The second part of the thesis analyses four compositions. By examining the artistic approach and diverse processes used in these pieces, we will follow the evolution of the theme in its many variations. More generally, this thesis suggests different ways in which the semantic potential of contemporary music can be expanded. List of pieces submitted : Les chiens (2005), Pan-toutt (2007), La Fugue (2007), Quelque composée qu’elle soit (2008), Only When the Tide Goes Out Do You Know Who Has Been Swimming Naked (2009), Bungalopolis (2010), Renaissance (2011).

1204	Reconceptualisation encyclopédique du corps cyborg dans les textes d’Élisabeth Vonarburg et de Catherine Dufour	The cyborg is an avatar of what science fiction can produce as a territory where heuristics of gender identities are developed. In her Cyborg Manifesto, Donna Haraway reveals the potential of discursive liberty provided by the cyborg’s narrative figure. It appears to me that since its fictionalization as well as its theorization throughout the 1980’s and the 1990’s, the cyborg has evolved within science fiction. Élisabeth Vonarburg’s Le Silence de la Cité and Catherine Dufour’s Le Goût de l’immortalité present characters whose cyborg nature explores questions of humankind’s identities through a certain writing affected by technology. My study of these writing processes is conducted through the analysis of gender. This allows me to better understand the ever-changing fictionalization of the cyborgs found within Vonarburg’s and Dufour’s work. These cyborgs deconstruct the borders of traditional binarist systems by experimenting the trans-genders and trans-species possibilities their excentric bodies enable. As fantasized representations of desires otherwise unmentionable, the science fictional cyborgs attest the inherent uneasiness of couples such as man/woman, human/animal or organic/artificial.

1205	Morphologic evaluation of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm by 3D modeling	Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is defined as a dilatation of the abdominal aorta exceeding the normal diameter by more than 50%. The standard and widely used approach to assess AAA size is by measuring the maximal diameter (Dmax). Currently, the main predictors of rupture risk are the Dmax, sex, and the expansion rate of the aneurysm. Yet, Dmax has some limitations. AAAs of vastly different shapes may have the same maximal diameter. Dmax lacks sensitivity for rupture risk, especially among smaller AAAs. Thus, there is a need to evaluate the susceptibility of a given AAA to rupture on a patient-specific basis. We present the design concept and workflow of the AAA segmentation software developed at our institution. We describe the previous validation steps in which we evaluated the reproducibility of manual Dmax, compared software Dmax against manual Dmax, validated reproducibility of software Dmax and volume in cross-sectional and longitudinal studies for detection of AAA growth, and evaluated the reproducibility of software measurements in unenhanced computed tomographic angiography (CTA) and in the presence of stent-graft.  In order to define new geometric features associated with rupture, we performed a case-control study in which we compared 63 cases with ruptured or symptomatic AAA and 94 controls with asymptomatic AAA. Univariate logistic regression analysis revealed 14 geometric indices associated with AAA rupture. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, adjusting for Dmax and sex, the AAA with a higher bulge location and higher mean averaged surface area were associated with AAA rupture.  Our preliminary results suggest that incorporating geometrical indices obtained by segmentation of CT shows a trend toward improvement of the classification accuracy of AAA with high rupture risk at CT over a traditional model based on Dmax and sex alone.  Larger longitudinal studies are needed to verify the validity of the proposed model. Addition of flow and biomechanical simulations should be investigated to improve rupture risk prediction based on AAA modeling.

1206	"Les récepteurs 5-HT4b adoptent différentes conformations ligand-spécifique ayant des 
propriétés de signalisation et de régulation distinctes"	Antidepressants currently available are very similar toward their mechanism of action and are more or less effective. One major problem is their long latency to provide a therapeutic effect due to adaptations of pre and post synaptic locations. In an animal model, we recently discovered that the agonist RS67333 of the 5-HT4 receptors was able to produce in three days the same antidepressant effects that normally take two to three weeks to appear with the currently available antidepressants. In addition, we found that the antidepressant effects of this agonist had a resistance to tolerance. There are others agonists of the same receptor such as prucalopride, which does not produce antidepressant effects as RS67333. Since the effectiveness of prucalopride to stimulate 5-HT4Rs is similar if not greater than RS67333, we stated the hypothesis that the 5-HT4 receptor could adopt different active conformations following its activation by various agonists. We decided to explore the major functional responses of 5-HT4B by observing their regulatory and signaling properties.  We showed that the B isoform of the 5-HT4, being highly expressed in the limbic system, has a different signaling and regulation depending on the ligand. Our results indicate that each of the agonists tested (5-HT, RS67333, ML10302, Zacopride, Prucalopride) distinctively modulate cAMP production and receptor internalization. The results have clearly identified that agonists differed in potency and efficacy. Moreover, the order of effectiveness of agonists to modulate the cAMP pathway was (prucalopride> zacopride = 5-HT = ML10302> RS67333) different from their order of effectiveness in inducing receptor regulation by internalization (5-HT> Zacopride> Prucalopride> RS67333 = ML10302). Thus, we have shown that 5-HT4Rs adopt conformations that are ligand-specific. This implies that functional selectivity is an important factor in the mechanisms of antidepressant action of this receptor agonists.	5-HT4 receptors , EPAC , 5-HT , RS67333 , ML10302 , Zacopride , Prucalopride , depression , antidepressants , tolerance , cAMP , desensitization , internalization	en	8906.0
1207	Arès dans le quotidien des Grecs à travers l'épigraphie	This study talks about the god of war for the ancient Greeks, Ares.  The historical community asserts that Ares was a god of second order and unloved by the Greeks of this period.  Investigations of historians of XXe century are focus on literary sources and they simply restate, in most cases, the content of them.  To gain a new perspective on the god, Ares was studied through the epigraphic documents to corroborate or not our present knowledge.  We want to know if the Ares, as presented in the literature, has been the same as that was transmitted in the ancient Greek epigraphy.  The answer to this question will help us to see if our current knowledge is right and deepening it.    The epigraphic research is done in five steps.  First, we determine whether the military side of Ares was also predominant in the inscriptions.  Then we pay a specific attention to documents that propose an unloved Ares in the epigraphy.  After, we establish some links between the former oath and Ares.  Finally, we close the epigraphic study with a geographic approach who allows us to determine two important sites that belong to the god of war, the city of Metropolis and the island of Crete.    Through this process we were able to determine the appreciation and the importance, which the Greeks gave to this god, were not unanimous.  The resentment of the Greeks varied among individuals and places.  We were also able to establish some facts about Ares : his dominant sphere remained the military in the inscriptions; he was a reel god, present, respected and praised; he possessed important places of worship in Lato and Metropolis.   In conclusion, we redefine Ares profile, so it would be interesting that a research reviews the literacy sources about him.  Furthermore, an evaluation of all the sources (iconographic, archaeological, numismatic, epigraphic etc…) would also be appropriated.	Ares , Epigraphy , Greek religion , Ancient Greece	en	8901.0
1208	Méthodologie pour la synthèse combinatoire d’azapeptides: application à la synthèse d’analogues aza-GHRP-6 en tant que ligands du récepteur CD36	Azapeptides are peptide mimics in which the CH alpha in one or more amino acids has been replaced with a nitirogen atom. Such a modification tends to induce beta turn conformations in peptides, because of the consequences of lone–pair lone–pair repulsion between the two adjacent nitrogens and the planar geometry of the urea in the semicarbazide moiety. Furthermore, the semicarbazide increases protease resistance and is chemically more stable than its amide counterpart. Despite the potential advantages of using azapeptides mimics, their synthesis has been hampered by the solution-phase construction of substituted hydrazines prior to their incorporation into peptide sequences. Growth Hormone Releasing Peptide 6 sequence (GHRP-6, His-D-Trp-Ala-Trp-D-Phe-Lys-NH2) is a synthetic hexapeptide that binds to two distinct receptor: the Growth Hormone Secretatgogue Receptor 1a (GHS-R1a) and the Cluster of Differentiation 36 (CD36) receptor. The body of my Ph.D thesis has been generally targeted towards two objectives: (a) the development of azapeptide analogs of GHRP-6 with enhanced receptor selectivity and (b) the elaboration of a new synthetic approach for combinatorial submonomer azapeptide synthesis. In response to the first objective, 49 aza-GHRP-6 derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for receptor binding and biological activity. From this library, certain candidates were identified which exhibited decreased affinity for the GHS-R1a receptor with maintained affinity for the CD36 receptor. Furthermore, in studying their anti-angiogenic properties, our collaborators have identified aza-GHRP-6 analogs, which caused a marked decrease in microvascular sprouting in choroid explants, as well as another displaying potential to increase angiogenesis. A new approach for the combinatorial synthesis of azapeptides was developed to better conduct SAR studies using azapeptides. This method features the chemoselective alkylation and deprotection of a resin-bound semicarbazone building block. The scope of the methodology was further expanded by the development of reaction conditions for the chemoselective N-arylation of this semicarbazone residue, yielding 13 aza-GHRP-6 derivatives with aza-arylglycines residues at the D-Trp2 and Trp4 positions. The elaboration of a methodology based on the chemoselective alkylation and deprotection of a semicarbazone has allowed for greater aza-amino acid side chain diversity, enabling for example, the efficient incorporation of aza-propargylglycine residues into peptide sequences. Considering the reactivity of alkynes, we developed reaction conditions for in situ formation of aromatic azides, followed by a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction on solid support to yield aza-1-aryl,2,3-triazole-3-alanine residues as tryptophan mimics. Seven aza-GHRP-6 analogs were synthesized and subsequently tested for binding to the CD36 receptor by our collaborators. Moreover, the coupling reaction between an aza-propargylglycine-containing dipeptide building block, paraformaldehyde and a variety of secondary amines (A3 coupling) was accomplished in solution to provide access to rigid aza-lysine mimics. These aza-dipeptides were subsequently incorporated at the Trp4 position of seven new aza-GHRP-6 analogues using a solid-phase protocol, and the resulting azaLys mimics were tested for binding towards the CD36 receptor. Finally, conditions for a 5-exo-dig cyclization of an aza-propargylglycine residue were developed to give N-amino imidazolin-2-ones as turn-inducing peptide mimics. Their modification at the 4 position was achieved using a Sonogashira coupling protocol prior to the cyclization step. The conformational properties of these new heterocyclic motifs were assessed by X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy on a tetrapeptide model system. The incorporation of N-amino-4-methyl- and 4-benzyl-imidazolin-2-ones at the Trp4 position of GHRP-6 was further accomplished and the biological evaluation of the peptidomimetics was examined. Taken together, these results should lead to a better understanding of the structural and conformational factors responsible for binding and biological activity of azapeptide ligands of the CD36 receptor. Furthermore, the submonomer approach for azapeptide synthesis developed should promote the use of azapeptides as peptide mimics, given its accessibility and the increased aza-amino acid side-chain diversity available.

1209	Les pratiques d'attraction et de rétention de la génération Y dans les PME	The owner-managers of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are increasingly interested in human resource management (HRM), which some see as a competitive advantage for the shortage of current workforce. Starting from the assumption that the compatibility between the characteristics of the workforce and the ones of organization can generates positives outcomes (Kristof-Brown and Guay, 2011), our study examines the link between HRM practices in association with Generation Y’s work values and their effect on SMEs’ ability to attract and retain this new cohort within their organization.  This qualitative study was conducted using primary data collected through interviews with managers of four SME in the construction sector and with sixteen Gen Y employees from these companies. We found that the quality of the relationships, both with colleagues and supervisors, usually remains the main source of attraction and retention of this workforce in SMEs. Our results also support that the attraction and retention of Gen Y may be heavily promoted through unlimited two-way communication, strategic communication and freedom in time management and working methods. Balancing work and personal life, various challenges, opportunities of advancement, socially responsible management, recognition of skills and participative management practices are most strongly linked to the attraction and retention of this generation. Moreover, our results showed that the attraction and retention of Y in SMEs is moderately enhanced by teamwork, fair and objective working conditions and competitive compensation package. Otherwise, the presence of information and communication technology and training opportunities are weaker sources of attraction and retention.  Finally, this study contributes to the literature on HRM in SMEs, since the specificities of this type of business were not considered until now. It also allows the recommendation of useful practice for owner-managers and HR professionals involved with the challenge of attracting and retaining Gen Y in their company.

The main goals of this research are to assess the influence of such local environmental risks on the prevalence of symptoms of eye and skin diseases among children aged under five and to examine the effects of other possible determinants of these problems in Ouagadougou, capital city of Burkina Faso. Data are from a survey conducted in February 2010 that collected information on the health status and behaviors associated with recent disease episodes; these are linked to data collected in May 2009 by an earlier round of the Ouagadougou DSS on demographic events and the living conditions of households. Our sample consists of 950 children from 736 randomly selected households in five suburbs of the city. The descriptive analysis (cross-tabulations and chi-2 tests) showed that several variables of domestic environment, namely the waste disposal, the type of toilet used by the members of the household and the type of neighborhood are associated with the prevalence of the symptoms of eye diseases. The multivariate analysis using multivariate logistic regressions, however, confirmed only the effect of neighborhood type – zoned versus spontaneous settlements. Concerning the skin diseases, the descriptive analysis indicated that the only aspects of the domestic environment that are associated with their symptoms are the type of floor in the living union and the method of household waste disposal. The multivariate analysis confirmed the significant effects of these variables on children’s health. We note some limitations of the data used, including the relatively small size of the sample, the fact that disease symptoms were reported by the children’s guardians and not verified by doctors, and the cross-sectional nature of the data. The data however do provide unusual information on the domestic living environment and are of relatively good quality. The results of the study may be useful to planners and decision makers who are responsible for the management of urban space, in order to improve the design of policies aiming to improve the structure and living conditions in precarious (spontaneous, non-zoned) neighborhoods to better fight preventable diseases. That said, further research is needed to attain stronger conclusions that are based on larger data sets that are less subject to possible self-reporting inaccuracies.

1211	Peinture et comédie : les scènes de théâtre de Cornelis Troost (1696-1750)	This master’s thesis focuses on one of the most famous Dutch painters of his time, Cornelis Troost (1696-1750). Troost’s success derives from the originality of his subjects in the theatrical scenes he depicts five of which are discussed here. Troost himself was a professional actor before devoting himself to the art of painting. Dutch art of the eighteenth century is a topic rarely discussed in art history. Several elements of Netherlandish history, including political changes, are essential in order to acquire a better understanding of Troost's theatrical work. Troost embraces the theatrical source. His works of art bear the same title as the plays from which they are drawn. Troost puts the emphasis on his characters, and this feature helps to put the focus on the emotions of the characters and the action. A parallel is made with Jan Steen and Gerard De Lairesse, other Dutch artists who were inspired by the theatrical world. The narrative aspect in the works of Troost is also an important aspect which needs to be approached in order to understand his theater scenes.

1212	Strategy-proofness makes the difference: deferred-acceptance with responsive priorities	In college admissions and student placements at public schools, the admission decision can be thought of as assigning indivisible objects with capacity constraints to a set of students such that each student receives at most one object and monetary compensations are not allowed. In these important market design problems, the agent-proposing deferred-acceptance (DA-)mechanism with responsive strict priorities performs well and economists have successfully implemented DA-mechanisms or slight variants thereof. We show that almost all real-life mechanisms used in such environments - including the large classes of priority mechanisms and linear programming mechanisms - satisfy a set of simple and intuitive properties. Once we add strategy-proofness to these properties, DA-mechanisms are the only ones surviving. In market design problems that are based on weak priorities (like school choice), generally multiple tie-breaking (MTB)procedures are used and then a mechanism is implemented with the obtained strict priorities. By adding stability with respect to the weak priorities, we establish the  first normative foundation for MTB-DA-mechanisms that are used in NYC.

1213	Étude du rôle de la tyrosine kinase Src dans la régulation de la signalisation des récepteurs opioïdes delta (∆OR)	Opioids are the most effective analgesics available but their use is limited by  tolerance. Tolerance is related, at least in part, to receptor desensitization. Hence, the  role of the present study was to better characterize the desensitization process, in  particular concerning the role of the tyrosine kinase Src on regulation of delta opioid  receptor signalling. Our results show that pharmacological inhibition with PP2  (administered at low concentration: 20-40µM) or molecular inhibition of the kinase  with low expression levels of a dominant negative mutant of Src (0,2µg of DNA)  potentiate the magnitude and duration of agonist-dependent (DPDPE; 1µM; 5 min)  activation of the ERK pathway. We also showed that higher concentrations of Src  inhibitors (80 and 100µM of PP2 or 1µg/ml of dominant negative mutant DNA)  block the MAPK cascade following DOR stimulation by DPDPE. These  observations indicate that Src has a biphasic effect on ERK activity, respectively  potentiating or inhibiting agonist stimulation of the MAPK cascade at low and high  levels of Src inhibition. We reasoned that high levels of Src blockers were interfering  with ERK activation mechanism while low levels of inhibition were interfering with  receptor desensitization. This possibility was tested by using cAMP accumulation  assays to evaluate the effect of Src blockers (PP2, 20 µM; 1h) on agonist-induced  desensitization. DOR stimulation by DPDPE inhibited forskolin stimulated cAMP  production in a dose dependent manner with a maximal reduction of 61%. This  inhibitory response was reduced by 72% following pre-exposure to DPDPE (1 µM,  30 min), an effect that was blocked by pre-treating cells with PP2 (PP2, 20 µM; 1 h)  before desensitization. The protective effect of Src blockers did not involve changes  in DOR internalization but interfering with internalization by using an  internalization-deficient DOR mutant or hypertonic medium (0.4M sucrose) reduced  this protection, indicating the need for optimal internalization in order for the  protective effect of Src blockers to take place. Based on the latter observation it was  possible to conclude that Src contribution to DOR desensitization is post-endocytic.

1214	L’influence du réseau de chimiokines sur les lymphocytes T dans le contexte de l’infection à virus de l’immunodéficience humaine de type 1 (VIH-1)	The chemokines and their counter receptors play an important role in regulating innate and adaptive immunity. The chemokine receptors serve as markers for distinct CD4+ T cell subsets with specific tissue homing potential, antigenic specificity, and polarization profile. There is limited knowledge on the identity of primary CD4+ T cell subsets selectively targeted by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The recruitment in the intestinal mucosa of excess effector (CD8+ T) versus target (CD4+ T) cells predicts a good outcome for the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection, while the depletion of Th17 cells in the gut-associated lymphoid tissues (GALT) represents a marker for HIV disease progression. The regulatory role of chemokines on cellular activation and on HIV replication in different CD4+ T cell subsets remains poorly investigated. This M.Sc. project is dived in 3 parts: (1) the identification of chemokine receptors CCR4, CXCR3 and CCR6 as surface markers of CD4+ T cell subsets, with susceptibility to HIV replication (2); the phenotypic and functional characterization of HIV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in HIV-infected long-term-non progressor (LTNP) individuals and (3) the effect of chemokine ligands of CCR4, CXCR3 and CCR6 on cellular activation and viral replication in vitro. Our results reveal that CD4+ CCR4+CCR6+ T (Th17 cytokine profile) and CD4+ CXCR3+CCR6+ (Th1/Th17 cytokine profile) T cells are highly permissive to HIV replication. Also, our results suggest new correlates of immune protection against HIV in LTNP subjects: (i) the co-localization potential of HIV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the intestinal mucosa via the integrin β7, (ii) the high ratio between effector (CD8+) versus target (CD4+) T cells, (iii) the Th17 cytokine profile and (iv) the ability of HIV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells to produce CCR5 ligands blocking viral entry. Finally, our results on the co-stimulatory effect of chemokines on T cell activation and their opposite impact on HIV replication in CD4+ T cells demonstrate the role played by the chemokine network during HIV pathogenesis.

1215	La Guerre civile espagnole : l'influence du Québec sur les politiques du gouvernement fédéral	The Canadian foreign policy in view of the Spanish Civil War was adopted on July 31th.  The shilly-shallying of Ottawa related to his politic is questionable in regard of the motivations that guided the federal gouvernement.  The Canada adopted a neutrality position, similar to the one of Great Britain, decided by the Non-intervention Committee.  Like London, Ottawa voted a weapons embargo on both sides of the belligerants.  Also, with the Foreign Enlistement Act, it was criminally forbidden to go to fight in Spain. The law applied on both sides, but was aimed especially to prevent the making of the Mackenzie-Papineau Batallion, the Canadian branch of the International Brigades.  These acts dedicated the neutrality of Canada.    In Quebec, this war was deeply felt.  The traditional elites and the catholic clergy assimilated the Spanish governement to Soviet communism and showed solidarity with the Spanish Catholic Church.  According to Ernest Lapointe, the main minister in Quebec, Ottawa should deeply take into account the conservative movement in Quebec to prevent a domestic crisis that could endanger the national unity.  But the foreign policy of Canada was only partially influenced by the clerico-nationalist reaction in Quebec; it was much more dictated by the following  of the British foreign policy.

1216	La Quatrième Croisade : analyse du traité de Venise	This master’s thesis is about the Treaty of Venice, made in 1201 between the Fourth Crusade’s barons and the Republic of Venice, regarding the transportation and provisioning of a fleet bound for the Levant. The importance of this study stems from the Crusaders’ default on their obligation, which had a decisive impact on the course of events, thus placing it at the heart of the Crusade’s deviation to Constantinople. First, this study analyses the nature and scale of Venice’s undertaking, attempting to quantify and measure in economic terms the number of ships and passengers onboard, as well as the supplies’ weight and cost, for both men and horses. This analysis, based on analoguous contracts, proves the agreed sum of 85 000 silver marks was in no way exaggerated. Also, the analysis weighs the importance of such a sum in the economic context of the times, and tries to identify the reasons of the crusaders’ shortcomings. Despite a certain traditional historiography, this analysis demonstrates that Venice cannot bear the brunt of the responsibility for the Crusade’s deviation, and that blaming their uncompromisingness, their greed, or even their duplicity, is wrong. The sheer effort provided by the Republic, indicates it took every measure to warrant the venture’s success. The interruption of far-away trade, the construction of numerous ships, the requisition of thousands of sailors to man them, and the logistics needed to supply tens of thousands, display well the Venetians’ dedication. It is the crusaders’ failure to pay which triggered doge Enrico Dandolo to commit further, thus irremediably joining his city’s fortunes to those of the expedition.

1217	Principes de conception et d’utilisation des e-portfolios de présentation en milieu universitaire	Based on the human-machine ergonomics methodology, this study deals with how e-portfolios of presentation could be implemented in the University. An e-portfolio can be defined as a structured amount of information displaying the education, learning and working experience of a person in relation to a selection of outstanding results. It also includes personal reflections on the learner on those accomplishments, on his career plan, on his working experience or simply on his resume. With a focused needs’ analysis, we try to understand how learners could put forward a reflexive thinking throughout their career. Also, we try to figure out how e-portfolios could become an effective investment tool for students as well as for employers. To answer these questions, we have made many interviews with employers and students in order to assess and understand their expectations. The sum of collected information has helped us to design a primary model on which they will be able to interact each other. After that phase, and according to all the usability tests conducted on that model, we developed the final model for an e-portfolio.	e-portfolio , recrutement , certification , e-portfolio , usability , layout , recruitment , student , reflexive , presentation , outcomes , employability , certification	en	8831.0
1218	Design pédagogique et jeux vidéo : recherche exploratoire pour le développement d’un modèle soutenant le design pédagogique dans les jeux vidéo non éducatifs	Instructional design for non-educational video games is an ill-defined discipline that lacks established methods. Contrarily to the one used in schools or other education or formation institutions, video game instructional design is done by video game designers who often have no teaching training. An instructional design model for non-educational games is developed, in this paper, based on video game content analysis and educational science theories. Considering the limited resources available for the development of this model, it lays grounds for the establishment of a more elaborate model on instructional video game design, offers insights on education through games and can help video game designers plan the instructional design for their games.	design , instructional , video games , model , taxonomy of educational objectives , behaviorism , cognitivism , constructivism	en	8827.0
1219	Le visage de la douleur : informations efficientes pour la reconnaissance et impacts sur l’observateur	Facial expression plays a central role in pain communication including when judging on others’ pain intensity. Facial expression characteristics have been investigated mainly with descriptive methods (e.g. FACS). The thesis introduction summarizes current knowledge on behavioral and cerebral processes involved in pain facial expression and pain communication. Moreover, a better understanding of the processes subtending the recognition of pain in others appears essential to address clinical issues such as the classical under-estimation effect. The article 1 uses a direct method (Bubbles) to identify the visual information efficiently used by the observer to correctly discriminate pain among basic emotions facial expressions. Results show that, among all the facial movement typically found in pain facial expressions, the observers use few information. Moreover, the visual regions highly correlated with correct identification of pain have previously been described as encoding the affective-motivational of the pain experience of the sufferer. It is known that the pain experience can be increased by visual stimuli with a negative affective valence, including pain facial expressions, through spinal and supra-spinal (perceptual) processes. The article 2 aims to study if the facial regions important for pain identification are sufficient to modulate the observer’s pain experience. Results showed that looking at the diagnostic visual information for pain identification enhanced the perception of pain) of the observer when compared to viewing regions not correlated with correct identification. A post-experimental exploration of the characteristics of our stimuli suggests that this effect is not attributable to an induction of negative emotions, thereby supporting a predominant role for pain communication in the vicarious facilitation of pain in the observer. However, spinal measures were not modulated by our visual stimuli, suggesting that the neural system underlying the modulation does not involve cerebro-spinal processes.

1220	Dialogue sur l'avenir de la démocratie libérale : John Rawls, Richard Rorty et Leo Strauss	Our study stems from the awareness that three twentieth-century political philosophies emanating from the United States have not partaken in any serious dialogue, even though this country should be a leader and model of openness regarding the topic of liberal democracy. The three political philosophies in question are those of John Rawls, Richard Rorty and Leo Strauss. Consequently, we have initiated a dialogue by confronting the ideas of these three thinkers on matters concerning truth, history, the dimensions of man, and democratic principles, having furthered this effort by highlighting the opinion of each on eleven classical dualisms related to these four matters. These dualisms are binary oppositions, generally venerable, which classify and divide two orders of reality. Using the common language of classical dualisms allowed us to overcome the obstacles due to the particular language game or vocabulary of each. In the first place, we show that if no real victor emerges from our confrontation, it is possible to judge each of the thinkers according to non contentious criteria (consistency, complexity or subtlety, capacity to refute the other positions). Then we illustrate that the direct confrontation through dialogue allows each of the three positions to express itself on the same issues and leads one to conclusions regarding matters beyond simple exegetic analysis. These conclusions show what kind of compromise is possible between the principles of truth and history. They support the project of resolving the tensions in our understanding of man, in particular, between the public and private spheres. Finally, they remind us of the importance of the ancient view of democratic principles (freedom, equality, justice), if only to counterbalance the current overwhelming trend. Ultimately, we explain how this confrontation can lead to a program for a political philosophy which balances the claims of (premodern) criticism and (modern) confidence, as well as restates the importance of continuing the dialogue in order that our thought be worthy of the idea of liberal democracy.

1221	Devenir environnemental des antidépresseurs dans les rejets urbains par chromatographie liquide à haute performance couplée à la spectrométrie de masse en tandem	Mood disorders such as depression, burn-out and anxiety have increased in our modern society. Increasing amounts of antidepressant prescriptions around the world are now suspected to be the main cause of the recent detection of traces of antidepressant residues within urban wastewaters. These so-called “emerging” substances that possess pharmacological activity towards neurotransmitter regulation in the brain have raised serious concerns from the scientific community.                                            The initial goal of the study was to better understand the fate of various classes of antidepressants present in different environmental matrices (e.g. surface waters, wastewaters, treatment sludge, and biological tissues) by developing novel reliable analytical methods that can detect, quantify and confirm antidepressants using high performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem-mass spectrometry (LC-QqQMS,LC- QqToFMS).                                              A preliminary study completed at the Montreal sewage treatment plant (STP) confirmed the presence of six antidepressants and four N-desmethyl metabolites in raw sewage (2 – 330 ng L-1). For this primary treatment (physico-chemical), low removal rates (≤ 15%) were obtained. Concentrations of antidepressant close to 100 ng L-1 were also detected directly in the St. Lawrence River at 0.5 km of the effluent outfall.                                              A second study conducted at the same STP allowed the selective extraction of antidepressants in three biological tissues (e.g. liver, brain, and filet) dissected from juvenile brook trouts previously exposed to diluted untreated and treated effluents with ozone. Bioaccumulation of antidepressants was readily observed in fish tissues (0.08-10 ng g-1) for the specimens exposed to untreated effluent (20% v/v), with major distribution in liver and brain. During experiments, a significant correlation was established between the concentrations of three antidepressant detected in brain tissues and the activity of a selected biomarker of exposition (e.g. an N/K ATPase pump involved in the serotonin regulation) measured within dissected synaptosomes from trout exposed to effluents.                                       Investigation of estimated treatment removal efficiencies from various Canadian STPs operating different disinfection modes showed that secondary treatments (biological) were more efficient than primary (physico- chemical) to remove antidepressants (mean removal rates : 30%). The highest amounts detected in treated sludge (biosolids) were obtained respectively with citalopram (1033 ng g-1), venlafaxine (833 ng g-1), and amitriptyline (78 ng g-1). Experimental calculated sorption coefficients (Kd) of each antidepressant predicted fairly good sorption capacities for sertraline, desmethylsertraline, paroxetine, and fluoxetine to solid matters (log Kd > 4). Finally, an excellent mean removal rate of 88% was obtained after ozonation (5 mg L-1) of a primary effluent. However, the characterization of new N-oxide side-products (venlafaxine, desmethylvenlafaxine) in ozonized effluent by high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-QqToFMS) highlighted the possibility of formation of multiple polar compounds with unknown toxicity.

1222	L'interdiction de fumer en établissement de détention canadien : le vécu des hommes incarcérés	The present study aims to understand how inmates have adjusted to a total ban on smoking in Canadian prisons. From qualitative interviews conducted with seventeen men detained in various detention facilities in Canada, we analyzed the experiences of inmates subject to the new regulations. It appears from our analyzes that tobacco allows inmates to lessen the suffering associated with imprisonment, which leads the individual and collective adaptation to circumvent the smoking policy. In addition, the tobacco regulation has a significant impact on the total character of penal institutions. The loss of a right that was acquired over several decades has created an increase in control measures, deprivation and tensions within the prison.

1223	Difficultés d’ordre grammatical rencontrées chez les immigrants adultes allophones dans l’apprentissage du français langue seconde	The current research is to identify and classify grammatical difficulties facing by adult English speaking immigrants in their French as a second language (FSL) study.  On one side, we have analyzed exams of 98 students from French learning course in Université de Montréal in order to describe their common grammar mistakes. We have described in detail common grammar mistakes produced by learners of each level of French learning course so that they can effectively prevent themselves from using common errors and develop language skill in studying FSL. On the other side, we have also collected personal opinions of five senior teachers of French as a second language course in terms of the importance of teaching grammar in FSL course, the treatment of grammar errors, and the persistence of errors throughout various level, etc. By specifying grammar points to study in each level of FSL course and merging the results of learners and teachers, we can provide adult English speaking learners simple tables of grammar points and grammar errors corresponding to each level. They could use them to improve their language skills and to better integrate themselves into Quebec society.	immigrants , French second language , French grammar , immigrants , adults , grammatical difficulties , grammatical errors	en	8784.0
1224	Dynamo Magnétohydrodynamique en champ moyen	It is generally agreed upon that the 11-year magnetic cycle of the Sun arises through the action of an internal dynamo operating in the convective zone, and perhaps also immediately beneath it. Although the computing power of current supercomputers is sufficient to allow fairly realistic magnetohydrodynamical simulations of this dynamo process, to study the temporal and spatial evolution of the large-scale solar magnetic field over long timescales, it remains advantageous to work with simpler models. Thus, to better understand the physical mechanisms at the origin and maintenance of the solar dynamo, we used a simplified formulation, known as a mean-field model.  By using a complete alpha-tensor extracted from a global MHD model of solar convection [Ghizaru et al., 2010] as input to a kinematic axisymmetric mean-field dynamo model [Charbonneau & MacGregor, 1997], it becomes possible to study the effect of the electromotive force on the magnetic cycles produced by the global model. In this way, we are able to reproduce some of the observed characteristics of the Ghizaru et al., 2010 simulation, in particular magnetic cycles. The axisymmetric magnetic field produced by the mean-field dynamo model exhibits two distincts dynamo modes. These modes, with similar periods, are present and peak at substantially at the same radii and latitudes as the sonlly-averaged magnetic fields extracted from the global model. Thanks to the spatial complexity of the alpha-tensor, we can reproduce these two dynamo modes. In contrast, the ratio of the periods of the two modes present in the mean field model differs significantly from that found in the global model. In addition, the accumulation of strong magnetic fields at the base of the convective zone disappears in a model where differential rotation has been removed. This suggests that differential rotation plays a significant role in the accumulation of magnetic fields in this region. Furthermore, removing the turbulent pumping component of the alpha-tensor produces a very different magnetic field cycle. Therefore, turbulent pumping plays a crucial role in the spatial distribution of the magnetic field. It is important to underline that the models without differential rotation, with or without turbulent pumping, both succeed in producing an oscillatory dynamo using only the turbulent electromotive force. However, the dynamos materializing in these modified models are significantly different from that using the full alpha-tensor. Finally, both the intensity and form of meridional circulation profiles are significant factors affecting the dynamo modes.	alpha effect , Soleil: dynamo , Turbulent pumping , Mean-field model , Sun: magnetic field , Global model , Magnetohydrodynamic	en	8781.0
1225	L’accommodation des valeurs professionnelles aux valeurs culturelles chez les bibliothécaires universitaires sénégalais	A profession basically includes two components: scientific skills and professional values, which are the guidelines of professionals’ daily demeanor. The library profession is based on values like the preservation of humanity cultural heritage, a fair access to knowledge, intellectual freedom, confidentiality  and the protection library users’ private lives, professional neutrality, tolerance etc. In Senegal as well as in the other African countries, libraries are, on the whole, legacies of colonialism. The values of library science were designed in a western perspective. This profession value system may sometimes conflict with the Senegalese librarians’ cultural value systems. However, very little is known on ways Senegalese professionals cope with these two value systems. This present research will describe and explore the interactive co-existence and adaptation of professional values within the cultural value system of Senegalese academic librarians. It seeks to answer the following research questions: (1) what is the Senegalese academic librarians’ dominant cultural value system? (2) How do Senegalese academic librarians prioritize their professional values? (3) How do Senegalese academic librarians adapt their professional values to cultural values? This exploratory and descriptive analysis combines a mixed methodology approach: Two types of data collecting methods have been used: a questionnaire based on interviews and on Schwartz’s Portrait Values Questionnaire (PVQ) (Schwartz, 2006) The findings highlight the fact that, on the cultural level, Senegalese academic librarians essentially emphasize, in the value system, the interests of the social group they belong to, the respect of social order and adoption of normative behavior in order to facilitate their relationships with the other group members. The values favor a strong integration of the individual into a group but do not encourage an action and thought autonomy which may destroy social harmony. On the professional level, they regard access to information, preservation and conservation of heritage and the denial of all sorts of discriminations as essential professional values. As professional values conflict with cultural norms, Senegalese academic librarians often seek a compromise, a balanced position to make decision which does not basically question their cultural values. When a compromise is impossible, the final decision is made in favour of cultural values. On the theoretical level, this research confirms the theory of a value system predominance rooted in Schwartz’ perspective of the “continuity/self-transcendence” (Schwartz, 2006, 1992). In his system, the dominant values are universalism, benevolence, tradition, conformity and security. These values favor the individual’s integration into a group, solidarity and family security and the refusal to undertake actions which may endanger group harmony. On the practical level, this research displays the necessity to reinforce professional socialization which includes ethics and values in the training of Senegalese academic librarians.

1226	"L’implantation des Cultural Studies dans les
curricula francophones de sociologie :
Étude comparée de deux départements québécois"	This research analyzes the penetration of cultural studies in the curricula of two French departments of sociology, one at the UdeM and in the other one at the UQAM. From interviews conducted with teachers, but also from the analysis of curricula inspired by the theory developed by B. Bernstein, this research examines all issues related to the introduction of a new course or a new way of thinking in a department. The purpose is not to conclude on the high–or low–presence of cultural studies in the programs, but rather to explain these variations of presence from the social, political, economic and even geographic characteristics that are specific to each department. The conducted analysis goes even further by noting that cultural studies, even if they have not been developed at a large scale in Quebec, have had an impact on how the objects are sociologically discussed.

1227	Le modèle antarctique	There are currently border disputes between North circumpolar states that impede the good governance of the region. In order to identify possible solutions for improving the governance in the Arctic and to facilitate cooperation, we analyze the process that, at the other pole, led to the creation of the 1959 Antarctic Treaty. We use a neoliberal institutional approach as a theoretical framework and a methodology based on the process tracing. We identified four variables (states' interests, the political context, leadership, and the International Geophysical Year [IGY]) that we studied through three historical periods and whose evolution has contributed to elaborating the Antarctic regime. The steps leading to the development of a regime, identified in Frischmann’s dynamic institutionalism theory, apply to the three periods that we have identified. The first historical period corresponds to identifying an interdependency problem. States first tried to satisfy their particular interests pertaining to the Antarctic continent through individual strategies. The unclear status of the Antarctic continent characterized by conflicting claims, the will of the superpowers to potentially make territorial claims, and the leadership of the United States, however, facilitate the states to move to more cooperative strategies. The second historical period corresponds to negotiating the agreement. The leadership of a group of scientists and the United States in addition to the political context of the Cold War facilitated the cohesion of states interested in Antarctic affairs and their investment in a soft multilateral cooperation, the IGY. The third period corresponds to implementing the agreement, that is IGY. During this event, the parties have respected a tacit agreement, a gentlemen’s agreement, which suspended territorial considerations in Antarctica. The cooperation during the IGY proved to be a success. States were satisfied with their gains from the scientific cooperation in a peaceful environment. The IGY has allowed states to experiment multilateral cooperation and to observe the behavior of other participants within the institution. Due to the satisfaction of the states vis-à-vis the cooperation, the development of the 1959 Treaty was facilitated. Through our study, we identified key elements that led to the creation of the Antarctic regime and could serve as an inspiration for the development of future regime. The continuous of leadership throughout the process helped to promote the benefits of cooperation and to strengthen relations between the states involved in Antarctic affairs. The accomplishment of a soft agreement, during the IGY, centered around the parties common interests, and of a gentlemen’s agreement, which put aside divisive issues were also central points in the success and the extension of the coopération after the IGY. This gradual approach from soft law to hard law is undoubtedly the most important element that facilitated the cohesion of parties and the creation of the Antarctic Treaty.

1228	Stress oxydatif, fonction mitochondriale et maladie inflammatoire de l'intestin	Background: Although mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are key mechanisms in various pathological conditions, they have not been extensively studied in the gastrointestinal tract, which is known to be constantly exposed to luminal oxidants from ingested foods and pathogens. Key among these is the simultaneous ingestion of iron salts and ascorbic acid, which can cause oxidative damage to macromolecules. The protein ‘’Nuclear factorerythroid 2- related factor’’ (Nrf2) is an important redox-sensitive transcription factor, which protects against oxidative stress by inducing antioxidant and detoxifying genes through binding with antioxidant response element (ARE). Many of Nrf2 antioxidant protective and anti-inflammatory functions have been established in various cells and tissues. However, limited information is available on its role in the gastrointestinal tract. Objectives: The objectives are to evaluate how iron-ascorbate (FE/ASC)-mediated lipid peroxidation affects mitochondrion functioning in Caco-2/15 cells, and to mechanistically determine the role of Nrf2. Methods: Caco2/15 cells were treated with 0.2mm/2mm of FE/ASC to induce oxidative stress. To increase Nrf2 expression, cultured Caco2/15 cells were pre-treated with 50 μM Olitpraz (OPZ). To down regulate the Nrf2 function, Nrf2 gene was knocked down by transfecting Caco-2/15 cells with a pGFP-RS lentiviral vector containing shRNA against Nrf2. 4 RESULTS: Our results show that the treatment of Caco-2/15 cells with FE/ASC (0.2 mm/2 mm): increased the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), a marker of oxidative stress; reduced ATP production; raised mitochondrial calcium content; regulated the protein expression of cytochrome C and apoptotic inducing factor (AIF); decreased mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes I, II, III and IV activity; prevented mtDNA damage as illustrated by the raised levels of 8-OHdG; lowered DNA Glycosylase, and altered the gene expression and protein mass of mitochondrial transcription factors (mtTFA, mtTFB1, mtTFB2). Furthermore, our observations indicate that the induction and activation of Nrf2 in Caco2/15 cells resulted in an augmentated endogenous antioxidants enzymes (catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase), a reduction of nuclear factor-kappaB (NFκβ) and Tumor Necrosis Factor- Alpha (TNF-α), an increase in the ATP production, mitochondrial respiratory complexes (I, II, III, VI), PGC1α , and a regulation of the mitochondrial Prohibitin, anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein, and Occludin level. CONCLUSION: Findings indicate that acute exposure of Caco-2/15 cells to FE/ASC-catalyzed peroxidation produces pathological effects on mitochondrial functions and DNA integrity, which were diminished by Nrf2 induction. It appears that Nrf2 plays a critical cytoprotective role in intestinal epithelial cells against oxidative stress.	Oxidative stress , Mitochondria , Inflammation , NRF2	en	8751.0
1229	Implication de l'aldostérone dans les changements hémodynamiques de la grossesse	Pregnancy is accompanied by important hormonal and hemodynamic modifications. Among them, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is activated early during pregnancy. Furthermore, this increase of RAAS is accompanied by raises of cardiac output and blood volume as well as paradoxal decreases in blood pressure and peripheral vascular resistance. These suggest that pregnancy induces reorganization of the normal physiological responses to RAAS. In addition, a decreased vascular reactivity to vasoconstrictive agents is observed during pregnancy. Modifications of calcium and potassium channels function would be implicated in this phenomenon. Furthermore, an implication of the Na+/K+-ATPase is suspected, through its influence on the membrane potential of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). Aldosterone, through the presence of mineralocorticoid receptors (MR) in VSMC, could control vascular tone by its genomic and non-genomic effects. With our knowledge at this time, we submit the hypothesis that the increased serum aldosterone levels of pregnancy are responsible for the hemodynamic changes associated with pregnancy and that these effects are caused by the activation of MR.  Pregnant rats were treated with potassium canrenoate (20 mg/kg•d), a MR antagonist, during the last week of pregnancy (out of 3 weeks). Vascular reactivity of endothelium-denuded aortic rings was measured. Contractile responses to phenylephrine (PhE) and KCl were studied in the presence of a voltage-dependent calcium channel (VDCC) blocker, nifedipine, as well as calcium-actived (BKCa) and ATP-dependent (KATP) potassium channels activators, NS-1619 and cromakalim respectively. Vascular responses to PhE and KCl were reduced as of the 17th day of gestation. Canrenoate increased the responses to both agonists in the aortas of all the groups. Ionic channel modulators reduced the contractile responses to PhE and KCl. However, canrenoate also modified the responses to the modulators. In the aortas of non pregnant rats, no effect or a decrease of their inhibitory effect were observed while with the pregnant rats we noticed an increased effect. These results suggest that aldosterone could be implicated in the adaptation of vascular responses to pregnancy.  On the other hand, VSMC membrane potential could be affected during pregnancy. To verify this hypothesis, Na+/K+-ATPase activity was evaluated since it is implicated in its control. Our results demonstrated that the pump is inhibited as of the 19th day of pregnancy. This effect was reversed by canrenoate. However, since the reversal of the inhibition of the pump was also present in pregnant rats treated with PST 2238, an ouabain antagonist on the Na+/K+-ATPase, and because canrenoate can also act as a partial agonist of the pump, we believe that the decreased activity associated with pregnancy is linked to the inhibition of the Na+/K+-ATPase by cardiotonic steroids rather than the effect of mineralocorticoids. The increased activity of the pump by canrenoate is linked with a decreased of the α1 subunit expression. This suggests that the α2 subunit of the pump would be responsible for the variations of aortic contractility since its expression is not modified by canrénoate. The effects of the diminished expression of the α1 subunit, influenced by the MR signalization, still need to be determined. Nevertheless, our results showed that modifications of Na+/K+-ATPase activity had an impact on the activity of potassium channels and that the pump could be one of the principal elements implicated in the control of vascular reactivity during pregnancy.  Since canrenoate modified vascular reactivity, we wanted to determine its impact on blood pressure. Pregnant rats were treated with canrenoate (20 or 60 mg/kg•d) and hemodynamic functions were determined by radiotelemetry. No modification was observed in blood pressure, cardiac output and pulse pressure among the treated rats. However, increases in osmolality, aldosterone and corticosterone levels as well as plasma renin activity were observed in the animal receiving the 60 mg/kg•d canrénoate. Thus, canrenoate blocks the negative feedback of the RAAS. However, MR are not the principal element responsible for the control of blood pressure during pregnancy.  In conclusion, we have demonstrated that canrenoate affects aortic vascular reactivity during pregnancy. This effect is perpetuated by modifying the activity of certain ionic channels (VDCC, BKCa and KATP). Furthermore, canrenoate is able to reverse the inhibition of the Na+/K+-ATPase observed during pregnancy. Finally, the local actions of this MR antagonist on blood vessels are not reflected by the global systemic effect and no modification of the blood pressure was observed. Other studies will be necessary to determine the signaling pathways by which aldosterone modulate ionic channel responses in VSMC.

1230	A Generalization of a Theorem of Boyd and Lawton	This thesis applies to study first, in part 1, the Mahler measure of polynomials in one variable. It starts by giving some definitions and results that are important for calculating this height.        It also addresses the topic of Lehmer’s question, an interesting conjecture in the field, and it gives some examples and results aimed at resolving the issue.        The extension of the Mahler measure to several variable polynomials is then considered including  the subject of limit points with some examples.        In the second part, we first give definitions of a higher order for the Mahler measure, and generalize from single variable polynomials to multivariable polynomials.        Lehmer’s question has a counterpart in the area of the higher Mahler measure, but with totally different answers.        At the end, we reach our goal, where we will demonstrate the generalization of a theorem of Boyd-Lawton. This theorem shows a relation between the limit of Mahler measure of multivariable polynomials with Mahler measure of polynomials in one variable.  This result has implications in terms of Lehmer's conjecture and serves to clarify the relationship between the Mahler measure of one variable polynomials, and the Mahler measure of multivariable polynomials, which are very different.	higher Mahler measure , Lehmer’s question , Llimit points , Multivariable polynomials , Boyd-Lawton theorem	en	8745.0
1231	Évaluation d’une expérience de conférence citoyenne : analyse éthique	In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the role of citizens in public decision-making. This interest is reflected in the development and implementation of various citizen participation mechanisms, such as citizen conferences (also known as consensus conferences). Many of these experiences have been evaluated, but mainly in terms of their effectiveness or success. What are the ethical challenges posed by citizen participation mechanisms? This study looks at a citizen conference on advances in human biology in the era of genomics, held by the Groupe de recherche en bioéthique (GREB) of the Université de Montréal in 2005. The concept of discourse ethics, as developed by four Quebec authors, is used to conduct a qualitative analysis of six documents from the conference. Two categories of results are discussed: noteworthy aspects of the citizen conference and participants’ concerns with regard to science, society and their participation. A better understanding of key ethical issues will help to improve citizen conferences and their long-term use.

1232	Craftsmanship as a means of empowerment for the traditional population of Guaraqueçaba : a case study	This research is a case study of craftspeople from a traditional population that have been successful in transforming craft tradition into income-generation. These craftspeople of Caiçara culture have formed a cooperative in Guaraqueçaba, state of Paraná, southern Brazil. Caiçara is the name given to the traditional population living along Brazil south and southeast coast, of mixed Aboriginal and European descent. The natural environment of Guaraqueçaba, because of its precious and extremely high biodiversity, is one of the highest priorities for conservation in the planet. In order to protect its ecosystems, an Environmental Protection Area was created, in 1985, to regulate the use of natural resources. These regulations imposed many severe restrictions to the traditional subsistence practices and sources of income of the Caiçara communities, causing their impoverishment, a disruption in the Caiçara way of life and a great damage to their culture. This case shows the local population striving to improve their living conditions by the means of the creation of crafts for sale. The objective of this research is to understand how craft design and production allowed for their empowerment and the valorization of the local culture. The approach to data collection in the field was inspired by ethnography, using the following methods: interviews (unstructured and semi-structured), observations (participant and non-participant), and photos and physical artifacts. This case study had an exploratory nature, exploring questions related to empowerment and culture aiming to provide the scope for future research.

1233	Heteroplasmy in mammal mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic acid	Nature has developed strategies to ensure the beginning of life in conditions of homoplasmy, i.e. cells harboring the same mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). However, novel mtDNA haplotypes can arise by many means during life, leading to heteroplasmy. For instance, mtDNA heteroplasmy can originate artificially through assisted reproductive technologies and naturally by the process of aging. Therefore, this doctoral thesis was divided into two general objectives: Firstly, to analyze the changes in mtDNA heteroplasmy produced by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) during development from embryos, to fetuses and adult tissues, in cattle. Secondly, to analyze the changes in mtDNA heteroplasmy caused by aging in adult germinal and somatic tissues, during oogenesis and early embryogenesis, and in in vitro culture procedures in mice. In the first series of experiments in cattle, fetal fibroblasts carrying an mtDNA mutation (insertion of 66 bp) were fused to host oocytes carrying wild type mtDNA. The presence of mtDNA from the donor cell was analyzed in 30 SCNT clones at different stages of development: 17-day-old embryos (n=17); 40-day-old fetuses (n=3); 60-day-old fetuses (n=3); one 240 day-old fetus; and 3 post-natal clones (18-24 months). Every individual clone proved to be heteroplasmic and 99% (103/104) of the analyzed tissue samples were heteroplasmic as well. Only the ovary coming from a 240 day old fetus was homoplasmic for the mtDNA of the recipient oocyte. In most (95.2%) of the analyzed tissue samples (99/104) the mean of heteroplasmy was 1.46%. In contrast, one 40-day-old fetus presented high levels of heteroplasmy (20.9%) indicating rare events of donor mtDNA increases. Since most SCNT clones showed heteroplasmy at proportions comparable to the donor mtDNA at the moment of embryo reconstruction, we concluded that heteroplasmy produced by nuclear transfer techniques using somatic cells is due to the neutral segregation of the mtDNA. In the second series of experiments, performed in mice, females of different ages, i.e. young (0-8 months), middle (8-16 months) and old (16-24 months), were synchronized (gonadotropins) and sacrificed to obtain germinal vesicle oocytes, metaphase-II oocytes in vivo and in vitro. Also, 2-cell and blastocyst stage embryos were obtained from young females in vivo and in vitro. Somatic tissues from females of the three age periods were obtained: brain, granulosa, liver and muscle and the effect of aging was measured on fertility. The effects of aging, stage of development and in vitro culture on the heteroplasmy were measured in oocytes and embryos. Also, the effects of aging were measured in somatic and germinal tissues on total copies of mtDNA, percentage of mtDNA common deletion and the expression of three genes: Ndufs4, Mt-nd2 and Mt-nd4. We observed that female fertility in the mouse colony decreases with age. Aging affected mtDNA in somatic tissues but no effect was observed in granulosa, oocytes and embryos. MtDNA deletions increased during the resumption of meiosis and decreased during early embryo development; and culture in vitro did not affect the mtDNA in most germinal tissues. Because we did not find effects of age in most mitochondrial parameters analyzed in oocytes and embryos, we suggest that mtDNA common deletion in germinal tissues is more related with the cellular status of energy production than with the process of aging. Two different sources of mutations in the mtDNA generated in normal or reconstructed oocytes produced different heteroplasmy outcomes at the beginning of embryogenesis. In cattle, artificial heteroplasmy involving a small insertion (66 bp) in the non coding region (D-loop) of the mitochondrial DNA was apparently not harmful to the embryo, allowing persistence of the foreign mtDNA during the different stages of clonal development. In mice, the natural heteroplasmy of a large deletion (4974 bp, common deletion) in the coding region of the mtDNA was apparently harmful to the embryo and, therefore, may have been eliminated to ensure homoplasmy at the beginning of embryonic development.

1234	Les chercheurs, leur discipline, leurs publics: l’orientation de la recherche en sciences sociales et humaines	Our study of the orientation of research in the social sciences and humanities is a response to Micheal Burawoy’s typology of knowledge production. The objective of this investigation is to identify and describe the social organisation of the meaning of research as scholars attempt to reach different audiences and as their investigations are routed towards particular cognitive aims. Having conducted twenty-five in-depth interviews with historians, sociologists and economists, we analysed their interpretations of research practices in relation to the social space of academia and in regards to the extension of academic activities towards other social spaces. This analysis is then mobilised to comment on Michael Burawoy’s typology of research as we attempt to correct some of the distinctions he makes between professional, critical, policy and public knowledge. Notably, we suggest that these “types” should be broken down into multiple postures understood in relation to a segmentation of academic discursive fields and a differentiation of extra-academic modes of intervention.

1235	Les risques découlant de la diffusion sur les plateformes néomédiatiques du point de vue des producteurs audiovisuels	The broadcasting of audiovisual works over new media platforms (for example : broadcasters’ websites, video on demand, mobile television or the distribution over the Internet) alters the risks producers  usually face when broadcasting over traditional platforms like television. The transformation of risks has four main sources: the market, the business practices, the laws and regulations and the technologies themselves. These sources may also engender standards to create a legal framework that can modulate or eliminate the risks. This thesis will analyze, from the point of view of audiovisual producers, the risks incurred by broadcasting audiovisual works over new media platforms. This analysis will be made under the theory of risk management. First, the modified risks will be identifying as well as the new risks the producers are confronted with. Then, these risks will be defining and the legal framework will be studied as well as the risk management strategy that could help producers limit or avoid risks incurred by their productions and their exploitation activities.	copyright , webcasting , risk management , business model , audiovisual work , practice , producer , broadcaster	en	8670.0
1236	Le système et la législation archivistiques en Russie : 20 ans après la fin de l’Union Soviétique	To administrate the records complexes generated during their history, countries create archival systems, composed of leading organs, conservation centers and auxiliary institutions. These systems interact with governments for the management of State’s organisms’ and historical records. They develop differently according to the circumstances of national political, social and economical evolution. During the 20th century, the Soviet Union possessed a unique archival system, based on maximalist principles of total archives’ centralisation. At the beginning of the 90’s, the political and economical transition provoked a succession of changes for the Russian archival system: introduction of an archival legislation, apparition of a private sector, etc. To a large extent, the Russian case illustrates the question of the adaptation of archival systems facing historical changes. The present thesis aims to give an overview of the changes that happened in the Russian archival system from 1991 to 2011, with a study of the historical context, a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the archival legislation’s evolution, a content analysis of the main acts of this legislation, and also an overview of the non-state archives’ situation, to illustrate the magnitude of the changes brought to this system. Thanks to these different steps, this thesis will allow a better comprehension of the adaptation’s processes of the Russian archival system, by illustrating the apparition and the content of the archival legislation, its effects and the problems encountered. It will show finally the special dynamics between the old and the new.

1237	Les droits fondamentaux des animaux : une approche anti-spéciste	In this thesis, I use well-established principles of justice to demonstrate that there exists no valid moral reason to deny nonhuman sentient beings the most fundamental moral and legal rights. I begin by going over the principles that will inform my discussion of these basic rights. I examine the principle of equality, which requires that similar cases be treated similarly; the notion of fundamental right, which is based on the concept of interest; the principle of equal consideration of interests, which the principle of equality entails; and, finally, the concept of interest, which is applicable to all sentient beings. This first section establishes the necessity of attributing the most fundamental rights to all beings who possess the basic interests these rights are designed to protect. I then delve into an examination of the three most fundamental rights and the interests underlying these. First, I discuss the right to physical integrity, demonstrating that numerous nonhuman animals are sentient beings, and that all sentient beings, by definition, have an interest in not suffering. Second, I examine the right to life. I argue that it is reasonable to assume that every sentient being, because he or she can benefit from the good things in life, has a certain interest in his or her continued existence. This interest, regardless of its intensity or nature, deserves to be protected by an equal right to life. Third, I establish that the interest in being free is generally interpreted negatively; it simply consists of having the ability to act without interference. I argue that based on this conceptualization of liberty, all sentient beings have an interest in being free. I go on to explore the republican interpretation of freedom, suggesting that it provides further grounds for the recognition that nonuhuman sentient beings also have an interest in benefiting from the same moral and legal status as human beings. I conclude that granting the right to physical integrity, life and freedom to all sentient beings implies that we abandon all forms of institutionalized animal exploitation and that we give to all conscious beings the equal status of person.

1238	Exploration du lien entre les dynamiques sociales et les perceptions de l’activité physique chez de jeunes Québécois de 12-14 ans	The early adolescent years mark an important drop in physical activity participation. Peers have frequently been identified as important social determinants of physical activity involvement (PAI) during this period of youth’s lives. This study explores the influence of adolescent peers’ social dynamics on perceptions related to PAI. Qualitative data were collected through semi-structured interviews which were conducted with 12 to 14 year old boys (n = 12) and girls (n = 10) attending schools of three different locations (urban, suburban and rural), socioeconomic statuses, and ethnic compositions. The interview guide broached topics such as friendship, teasing, emotions and social interactions relating to PAI. The analysis of participants’ accounts focused on the description of social interactions as they relate to physical activity in different settings. On one hand, coeducational school settings appear to promote the emergence of power relationships based on performance norms and to foster negative perceptions associated with physical activity. On the other hand, physical activity conducted outside of school with same sex peers who have similar abilities seem to promote relationships based on equality amongst adolescents and positive perceptions about physical activity. These results may provide guidance for professionals aiming to present youth with social environments which promote PAI.

1239	Macro-analyse quantitative des facteurs d’émergence des émeutes : une nouvelle approche de compréhension mondiale des violences collectives	Following the 2011 Arab Spring’s riots and apparent difficulty predicting such events worldwide, the study is interested in developing a new macroscopic approach that utilizes quantitative aspects of the issue to generate a systemic view. Building on existing knowledge, considering the design of an eclectic theoretical framework for the emergence of the riots, the study conducts an analysis of their political, economic, social and technological factors. From the analysis the study has considered three main categories of riots: the ethnic-religious riots, the socioeconomic riots, and the mass-political riots. In the second part of the research we have addressed the issue from quantitative perspective. Initially, we conducted bivariate analysis between the different categories of riots and the different variables grouped in the political, economic, social and technological areas. Statistical analysis of these variables points out that the different spheres of variables act differently on different categories of riots. The study has also remarked that the mass-political riots are mainly sensitive to countries' political factors. Socio-economic riots in our sample are tightly bound to social and economic variables. Finally, ethnic-religious riots are related to social variables, especially ethnical and religious homogeneity. These findings may seem tautological, but our study leads us to think otherwise. This study identifies an interesting relationships: various types of riots, as we have established, have a direct link to certain spheres of variables, following a quantitative logic.   Additionally, we developed statistical models through multiple linear regressions. For each type of riot, a specific model has been created. The study utilizes a comprehensive model to understand the riots as a whole, as well as specific models designed to analyze subcategories of riots. Second important point of the study: it is possible to build reliable statistical models to analyze the riots in a macroscopic approach and they vary based on the categories of riots. Thus, our main multivariate model explains 50% of the riots rate’s variance.	Violences collectives , Collective violence , Riots , Analyses quantitatives , Data Analysis , World	en	8604.0
1240	Évaluation de l'acuité visuelle chez la personne âgée atteinte de troubles de la cognition	Purpose: The evaluation of visual acuity (VA) in cognitively impaired older individuals may be limited by a reduced ability to cooperate or communicate. To date, no study has been performed to guide the clinician as to which VA chart to use in older individuals with moderate to severe dementia. This is important knowing that dementia affects more than 30% of seniors above 85 yrs of age, many of whom will be affected by the most severe stages of the disease. The objective of this research was to assess VA in older institutionalized individuals with moderate to severe dementia, using various acuity charts, and to verify their ability to respond to each of these charts. Methods: Three groups of 30 subjects each were recruited. The first group consisted of young subjects (Avg ± SD: 24.9 ± 3.5 yrs) and the second one, older subjects (70.0 ± 4.5 yrs) with no history of cognitive or communication disorders. The third group (85.6 ± 6.9 yrs) included subjects with mild to severe dementia residing in long-term care units. The Mini Mental-State Examination (MMSE) was performed for each institutionalized subject to verify their cognitive level. The VA of each participant was measured using six validated VA charts (Snellen, Teller cards, ETDRS-letters, -numbers, -Patty Pics, -Tumbling E's) presented in random order. Non parametric tests were used to compare VA scores obtained between the various charts, after Bonferroni-Holm corrections for multiple comparisons Results: The average MMSE scores of subjects with dementia was 9.8 ± 7.5, while it was 17.8 ± 3.7 and 5.2 ± 4.6, for those with mild to moderate (MMSE ≥ 13; n=11) and severe (MMSE < 13; n= 19) dementia. All subjects in groups 1 and 2 responded to each of the charts. A large proportion of subjects with dementia responded to all charts (n= 19) while only one did not respond to any chart. In group 3, VA charts with the lowest scores were the Teller cards (20/65) and Patty Pics (20/62), regardless of the level of dementia, while the best VA scores were obtained with the Snellen (20/35) and ETDRS-letter (20/36) charts. More subjects with severe dementia responded to the Teller cards (n= 18) but the VA obtained was the lowest (20/73). Across all groups, the ETDRS-letter chart was the only one whose scores did not differ from those obtained with the standard Snellen chart. Time to read the letter charts was faster than for the other optotypes. Conclusions: Visual acuity can be measured, and should at least be attempted, in older cognitively impaired individuals having a reduced ability to communicate. Our results indicate that the most universal scales, using letters as optotypes, can be used with good results in people with more severe dementia. Testing requires, however, more time and encouragement in individuals with more severe cognitive deficits in order to obtain and maintain their collaboration.

1241	Rôles et régulation du PI(4,5)P2 dans le remodelage cortical et la morphogénèse cellulaire en mitose	Cell division must be accurately controlled in time and space to permit the formation of two daughter cells whose genetic content is identical to that of the mother cell. This process requires successive modifications of cell shape, induced by cortical remodelling. Molecular mechanisms controlling cortical reorganization during mitosis remain partially uncharacterized. Our work in Drosophila cells demonstrates that PI(4,5)P2, a phosophoinositide of the plasma membrane, is enriched at the equatorial region at the onset of anaphase. This PI(4,5)P2 is necessary for the cortical stability of mitotic cells, and requires dMoesin activation. The dMoesin, linking actin to the plasma membrane, plays a critical role in the cortical organization of mitotic cells and in the regulation of its mechanical properties. We show that the interaction PI(4,5)P2/dMoesin participates in cellular contraction at the beginning of mitosis, then in cell elongation characteristic of subsequent steps. At the end of mitosis, the Pp1-87B phosphatase inactivates the dMoesin. By a systematic functional screen, we characterize the key role of two pathways acting in synergy to locally produce PI(4,5)P2, Skittles- and Pten-dependent, and the role of a third pathway requiring dOcrl activity to control PI(4,5)P2 homeostasis. Altogether, these results allow us to better understand the mechanisms controlling cortical remodelling and modifications of cell shape that occur during mitosis.

1242	L’évaluation du risque comme facteur influençant les opinions et comportements en lien avec le tabac et le cannabis	In the context of a pan-Canadian study pertaining to the normalization of cannabis and the stigmatization regarding tobacco, the main objective of this research was to understand the importance given in the evaluation of the risks in the understanding of the perceptions and behaviors as they relate to the aforementioned substances. Based on a mixed method, qualitative and quantitative, the process undertaken was 1) to describe the perceptions and opinions of respondents regarding their own use of cannabis and/or tobacco as well as the use of the same substances by the general public. We then 2) described how the respondents evaluate the risks as they relate to each substance.  Finally, knowing that the perception of the risks are intimately related to the behavior of an individual, we 3) sought to determine how the evaluation of risks affects the behaviors and opinions of the 50 study participants, all of whom are socially well adjusted men and women between the ages of 20 to 49, regarding tobacco and cannabis.  The cannabis smokers insisted on the importance of making a distinction between the way they use the substance versus an abusive use.  They ascertained that there was a degree of control regarding the use of cannabis.   The use of tobacco was perceived negatively for opposite reasons as it created a dependency to the smoker, an incapacity to control its use and the creation of a compulsive urge to smoke.  Given these optics, the risks related to use of cannabis were perceived by most as controllable with the exception of judgment from others which remained uncertain and which would be impossible to control.  The reaction of certain people within their surroundings was either unpredictable or negative which lead them to smoke mainly in private.  Finally, formal social control would very little influence on the respondents given the strong feeling they had that this did not apply to them.

1243	Malformation Chiari-Like : l’investigation d’une maladie complexe par l’utilisation d’un modèle canin	Chiari I malformation (CMI) represents a common congenital abnormality of the craniocerebral junction with an estimated incidence of 1 in 1280. CMI is characterized by a descent of the cerebellar tonsils into the foramen magnum, often in association with syringomyelia. The developmental defect in CMI is thought to be the result of an underdeveloped occipital bone and small posterior fossa. The etiology of CMI is thought to be multifactorial involving genetic factors. CMI in humans is similar to a condition in the dog called Chiari-like malformation (CM) that is particularly common in the Griffon Bruxellois (GB) breeds. A genome wide association study on a 56 GB cohort followed by a fine mapping in a 217 GB cohort have identified a locus on chromosome 2 that was strongly associated with CM (22 SNPs, P value= 7 x 10-8). Haploview analysis of this locus identified a haplotype of 1.9 Mb that was more frequent in non-affected dogs. A second genome wide association study in a 113 GB cohort lead to the identification of another locus on chromosome 13 that was strongly associated with CM (25 SNPs , P value= 3 x 10-7). Analysis of this region identified a 4Mb haplotype that was more frequent in non-affected dogs. Our study constitutes the first essential step towards identification of the causative genes in CM. Our study provides an entry point for better understanding of the molecular genetic mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of human CMI.

1244	Influence de l'initiation de la traduction sur le changement programmé du cadre de lecture en -1 responsable de la synthèse des enzymes du virus de l’immunodéficience humaine de type 1	The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is responsible for the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). HIV-1 develops a resistance towards the inhibitors used to treat infected patients. It is thus important to identify new targets for the development of novel antiretroviral agents. The aim of our work was to better characterize the programmed -1 ribosomal frameshift which generates the precursor of HIV-1 enzymes. The frameshift occurs at a specific sequence of HIV-1 full-length messenger RNA (mRNA), the slippery sequence, and is performed by a minority of the ribosomes translating this mRNA. The frameshift efficiency is controlled by the frameshift stimulatory signal (FSS), an irregular stem-loop located downstream of the slippery sequence. FSS structure is unfolded by every ribosome translating this region and can refold afterwards. We showed that HIV-1 frameshift efficiency is affected by changes in the rate of translation initiation. We transfected Jurkat-T and HEK 293T cells with a bicistronic reporter that contains the frameshift region of HIV-1 between the Renilla luciferase (Rluc) and the firefly luciferase (Fluc) genes. Rluc is produced by all ribosomes translating this reporter whereas only ribosomes that make a –1 frameshift produce Fluc. The translation of the reporter is initiated via a cap-dependant mode, like the majority of cellular mRNAs. We first determined the effect of three inhibitors of translation initiation. We showed that their presence increases the frameshift efficiency. We next determined the impact of the TAR stem loop, which is located at the 5’end of every HIV-1 mRNA. TAR is known to impair the binding of the small subunit of the ribosome (40S) to the mRNA. TAR also modulates the activity of the double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR). When PKR is activated, it phosphorylates the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2), inhibiting translation initiation. The inhibition of PKR has the opposite effect. We studied the effect of TAR on PKR by positioning TAR at a distance of the 5’ end where it cannot interfere with the binding of the 40S. Our results showed that a small amount of TAR, which activates PKR, increases the frameshift efficiency whereas a large amount of TAR, which inhibits PKR, decreases it. A model is presented where the variations of translation initiation modulate HIV-1 frameshift efficiency by altering the distance between the elongating ribosomes. This influences the probability that these ribosomes encounter or not a folded FSS. We next observed the effect of the 5’ untranslated region (UTR) of HIV-1 full length mRNA on its frameshift efficiency. This 5’UTR contains several structured parts, including TAR at the 5’end, which can inhibit translation initiation. This mRNA has a cap and an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) and could then use a cap dependent and an IRES-dependent mode of translation initiation. We replaced the 5’UTR of our bicistronic reporter mRNA by the complete 5’UTR of HIV-1 full-length mRNA or a part of it. Our results showed that the presence of the complete 5’UTR inhibits cap-dependent initiation of translation and increases the frameshift efficiency. Those effects are mostly due to the presence of TAR followed by a Poly(A) stem-loop. We also constructed a tricistronic reporter where the ribosomes translating the luciferases have to use an IRES-dependent initiation mode. The rate of this initiation was low and the frameshift efficiency obtained was also low. We proposed a hypothesis accounting for this situation. We also observed that when both initiation modes are available, the cap-dependent mode seems to be highly favored. Finally, we studied the impact of the Tat viral protein on translation initiation and frameshift efficiency. We showed that the presence of Tat increases translation initiation and decreases the frameshift efficiency. Those effects are more important when TAR is present at the 5’end of mRNA. We propose a model explaining the effects of Tat on translation initiation by the inhibition of PKR and by changes in the expression of cellular proteins that are able to unfold TAR. Our results allow us to better understand the mechanisms controlling HIV-1 frameshift, which will help in the development of drugs targeting the HIV-1 frameshift.	human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) , internal ribosome entry site (IRES) , programmed -1 ribosomal frameshift , translation	en	8568.0
1245	Perception de la douleur durant le traitement orthodontique avec boîtiers auto-ligaturants	Introduction  This research is a descriptive clinical study designed to assess pain during orthodontic treatment with self-ligating brackets. Materials and methods  This study was comprised of 39 patients (18 male, 21 female), mean age of 14 (range 11 to 19 yo). Two types of self-ligating brackets (SPEED n=20 and Damon n=19) were used. Pain was evaluated with a questionnaire developed by the research team. The study was divided into 4 phases. Pain was evaluated for 4 weeks following the insertion of the first 4 orthodontic wires for each patient (0.016 Supercable, 016 CuNiTi, 016X022 CuNiTi, 019X025 CuNiTi). The same questionnaire was used during each phase and included 6 different time-points following the insertion of each wire (T0: before insertion of orthodontic wire, T1: immediately after the insertion of the wire, T2: 5h after insertion, T3: 24h after insertion, T4: 3 days after insertion, T5: 1 week after insertion, T6: 4 weeks after insertion). The visual analogue scale (VAS) and the short version of Saint-Antoine’s questionnaire were used to evaluate the pain. VAS ratings between groups were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. Results and Discussion For the first two wires and for all the different time points, there was no statistical difference between both groups (SPEED and Damon).  However, at the insertion (T0) of the third wire (016X022 CuNiTi), among patients that reported pain (SPEED 47.1%, Damon 55.6%), Damon caused statistically significantly more pain than SPEED (p=0.018), (VAS mean SPEED=14.14±8.55, Damon=33.85±19.64). Three days after the insertion (T4) of the third wire, among the patients that reported pain (SPEED 23.5%, Damon 33.4%), the pain was statistically significantly higher with Damon than SPEED (p=0.008), (VAS mean SPEED=8.74±4.87, Damon=25.15±9.69). The most frequent use of pain medication occured with the first wire, at time-points T2 (5h) and T3 (24h). There was no statistical difference among the groups in terms of the number of patients taking medication. For the large majority of patients, the pain did not affect their life-style. The most frequently used sensorial words used by the patients to describe their pain were « pulling » (tiraillement), « cramping » (étau), « throbbing» (élancement). The most frequently used affective word was « annoying » (énervant). Conclusion The perception of pain for patients with Damon brackets was significantly higher than for those with the SPEED brackets at the insertion of the third wire and three days after placement of the third wire. More patients took pain médication with the first wire and the majority of patients did not report a change in their quality of life. « Pulling » (tiraillement), « cramping » (étau), « throbbing» (élancement) and « annoying » (énervant) were the words most frequently used by the patients to describe their pain.

1246	Les affrontements idéologiques nationalistes et stratégiques au Proche-Orient vus à travers le prisme de la Société des Nations et de l'Organisation des Nations Unies	The collapse and dismantling of the Ottoman Empire following World War I, led the great European powers to engage in a territorial division of the Middle East, legitimized by the mandates system of the League of Nations. Without any precedents, that international administration marked the beginning of the internationalization of Palestine’s thorny issue. The international law would serve as the pillar for a new form of colonialism. The day after World War II, the United Nations continued the action taken by the League of Nations, as well as for the demand of the British. In November 1947, the UN decided to divide Palestine into two States. If the Zionists had accepted that split, their neighbors, Arab States and Palestinian Arabs, would have rejected it. The clashes opposing the Arab Nationalists and the Palestine Zionists gave space to the Arab-Israeli conflict after the independence of Israel, on May 14, 1948. At the beginning of the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union became aware of the geo-strategic interest in this region, gradually divested by France and Great Britain. In this study, we will see how the interstate scene and the international community, successively composed by the League of Nations and the United Nations, have partially sealed the fate of the Near and the Middle East. We will also devote a preliminary analysis related to the role played by the Arabs and Zionists nationalist ideologies, which are central in this conflict.

1247	Accroissement de la prévalence du TDA/H, de la consommation de psychostimulants et des symptômes dépressifs : l’importance du contexte social évaluée à partir des effets d’âge, de période et de cohorte	This doctoral dissertation aimed to validate findings from previous studies indicating an increase in the prevalence of mental health problems, and to evaluate the importance of contextual factors in explaining this increase in prevalence. Age, period and cohort effects were considered proxies for social context factors. These objectives were achieved through two empirical studies, each one focusing on a specific mental health problem.   The first study analyzed data from the Statistics Canada National longitudinal survey on children and youth (NLSCY) and found significant increase in the prevalence of Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) diagnosis and the prescription of ADHD medications for Canadian children between 1994 and 2007. However, this tendency was not constant, or linear, as some period and age effects were found: an increase in prevalence was found only during the 2000s, and only for school-age children. These  differences in prevalence rate by historical period and children’s age underline the importance of the social context in the diagnosing of ADHD diagnosis and prescription of ADHD medications.   The second study used the data from the Panel Study of Belgian Households (PSBH) and aimed to explain the increase of depressive symptoms observed recently among Belgian adults. A longitudinal multilevel analysis, allowing for the disentanglement of age and cohort effects, was conducted. Our findings demonstrate that, despite a variation in the intensity of depressive symptoms within individuals during the 1990s, self-reported symptoms are mostly associated with a reaction to life conditions rather than with personality. The increase over time results from an effect of cohort succession, where individuals from the most recent cohort always report more depressive symptoms than individuals from the oldest cohorts. Members from the same cohort share common experiences at a similar age, which has a durable impact on their behaviors and mental health.   In general, results from our two empirical studies confirmed, each in their own way, that mental health problems have increased in contemporary Western societies. Moreover, findings demonstrated that prevalence differs according to age, birth cohort and historical period, thus reinforcing the importance of social factors in the etiology of mental health problems. Although the true nature of these social factors could not be directly examined, many social explanations were proposed. For example, the changes in behavioral norms associated with age, social norms, the conceptualization of mental health problems, and to the school system, as well as innovations in pharmacological, medical and technological fields across this period are all potential factors explaining these age, period and cohort effects.

1248	Étude de la fonction symbolique du paysage dans les tableaux dévotionnels de Giovanni Bellini	During the 1500's,the villa was as a safe alternative to the city, offering to men the possibility to establish a relationship with nature. The villa was for writers, architects, and doctors a safe haven equipped with curative as well as sacred virtues that contributed to the happiness of mankind. While villas where multiplying in the Venetians countryside, they also began to be integrated in landscape paintings. Giovanni Bellini used nature to create the religious character of his works and to give a sense of well-being to his public. The bucolique landscape in which the religious figures gravited were presented with many symbols of the Virgin Mary and Child. The images of the Madonna, widely collected in Flanders and in Italy, stimulated the devotion of worshippers.

1249	Les déterminants du succès subjectif de carrière : possibilités de mobilité externe et congruence personne-organisation	Career success has been the focus of much research. In the literature, two forms of success have been identified, subjective and objective career success. In our study, we are interested in subjective career success given its confirmed association with psychological well-being, quality of life at work (Nabi, 2003; Peluchette, 1993), intrinsic motivation, self confidence (Abele & Spurk, 2009b) and commitment to the organisation (Hennequin, 2009). In addition, according to various studies (Arthur, Khapova, & Wilderom, 2005; El Akremi, Guerrero, & Neveu, 2006), career success is more often examined on the basis of objective criteria (e.g., pay level, promotions) than in terms of the perception of the individual.   Furthermore, a meta-analysis of 140 studies published by Ng, Eby, Sorensen, and Feldman (2005) examined the predictors of objective and subjective career success in the light of the two theoretical perspectives advanced by Turner (1960), namely contest mobility and sponsored mobility. The authors of this synthesis concluded that «There is only a limited range of variables being examined as predictors of career success » (p. 396); hence the importance of examining other predictors of career success that relate to the theoretical perspectives developed by Turner (1960).  Our study is therefore situated in research that aims to analyze the predictors of career success. It examines the links between external marketability, person-organization fit and subjective career success. Based on the recommendations of Ng, Eby, Sorensen, and Feldman (2005), we associated external marketability to contest mobility and person-organization fit to sponsored mobility.   We used data collected from human resource professionals, all members of a professional association located in Quebec (Canada) (Saba & Dufour, 2005). The analysis tested the relationships that we hypothesized between the dependent variable (i.e., subjective career success) and the independent variables (i.e., person-organization fit and external marketability). Further analysis tested the mediating influence of organizational sponsorship in the association between person-organization fit and subjective career success. These analyses included age, gender, marital status, education, organisation tenure, and experience in the labour market as control variables.  Descriptive statistics, bivariate correlations, and multiple regressions were used to describe the sample and to test our hypotheses.  In general, our research hypotheses were supported. External marketability and person-organization fit are positively related to subjective career success. In addition, we have identified a partial mediation of organizational sponsorship in the relationship between person-organization fit and subjective career success.

1250	Socio-demographic, visual and psychological factors associated with adjustment to vision loss in retinitis pigmentosa	While there is extensive research on retinitis pigmentosa (RP) focusing on biological and hereditary aspects of the disease, little research regarding psychological adjustment has been conducted. These few studies suggest that people with RP adapt differently to vision impairment. This study investigated whether those with RP adapt differently to vision loss/impairment than those with other vision disorders.    Telephone interviews of those with RP, diabetic retinopathy (DR), and albinism were conducted. Demographic information was gathered and psychological wellbeing was assessed using the Visual Function-14, Centre of Epidemiology Studies Depression-10 symptoms index, Impact of Vision Impairment Profile, Brief COPE, and Adaptation to Vision Loss Scale.  In Experiment I it was found that individuals with RP did not differ from those with other diagnoses on any of the measures of psychological wellbeing and adaptation. Rather, demographic factors, visual factors such as declining and fluctuating vision, and pattern of vision loss, were better correlates of adaptation to and psychological wellbeing associated with vision loss/impairment.   In Experiment II there was no difference found between those with RP and other diagnoses on any of the measures. Rather, factors such as perceived visual ability, self-identity, fear of social stigma and level of dependence were more closely related to adaptation to and psychological wellbeing associated with vision loss/impairment.   The results of this study suggest that individuals with RP do not differ from those with other vision disorders in their adaptation to and psychological wellbeing associated with vision loss/impairment, but that other demographic, visual and psychological factors are more important.

1251	Postures et mutations du plan-séquence fixe, du cinéma des premiers temps à YouTube	"Favouring an approach at once genealogical and intertextual, this study explores the practice of the ""static sequence shot"" (plan-séquence caméra fixe) in cinema. It offers an overview of its significant moments in film history. It tries to show how its use since the 70's can be seen as a reappraisal of early cinema technique, and can also find strong echos in the works of experimental filmmakers, in particular structural filmmaking. For Andy Warhol, the static sequence shot was both a rediscovery and an enchantment of early cinema. In Jeanne Dielman Chantal Akerman's static shots extended Bazinian Modernism into the New York Avant-garde. Since the 80's, with the advent of video surveillance, the static sequence shot becomes associated with a carceral apparatus, posing ethical and aesthetic issues (voyeurism, degree zero mechanisms, etc.). These issues are at the core of the documentary films News from Home and Délits flagrants. Today, we can witness that the static sequence shot has become increasingly important and almost dominant in certain branches of auteur cinema as well as in contemporary popular media culture (web films, T.V. series, etc.) This master's thesis thus claims it allows us to analyse current as well as early practices of cinema, from the Lumière' s factory to YouTube."

1252	Modélisation bayésienne des changements aux niches écologiques causés par le réchauffement climatique	This thesis presents some estimation methods and algorithms to analyse count data in particular and discrete data in general. It is also part of an NSERC strategic project, named CC-Bio, which aims to assess the impact of climate change on the distribution of plant and animal species in Québec. After a brief introduction to the concepts and definitions of biogeography and those relative to the generalized linear mixed models in chapters 1 and 2 respectively, my thesis will focus on three major and new ideas. First, we introduce in chapter 3 a new form of distribution whose components have marginal distribution Poisson or Skellam. This new specification allows to incorporate relevant information about the nature of the correlations between all the components. In addition, we present some properties of this probability distribution function. Unlike the multivariate Poisson distribution initially introduced, this generalization enables to handle both positive and negative correlations. A simulation study illustrates the estimation in the two-dimensional case. The results obtained by Bayesian methods via Monte Carlo Markov chain (MCMC) suggest a fairly low relative bias of less than 5% for the regression coefficients of the mean. However, those of the covariance term seem a bit more volatile. Later, the chapter 4 presents an extension of the multivariate Poisson regression with random effects having a gamma density. Indeed, aware that the abundance data of species have a high dispersion, which would make misleading estimators and standard deviations, we introduce an approach based on integration by Monte Carlo sampling. The approach remains the same as in the previous chapter. Indeed, the objective is to simulate independent latent variables to transform the multivariate problem estimation in many generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) with conventional gamma random effects density. While the assumption of knowledge a priori dispersion parameters seems too strong and not realistic, a sensitivity analysis based on a measure of goodness of fit is used to demonstrate the robustness of the method.  Finally, in the last chapter, we focus on the definition and construction of a measure of concordance or a correlation measure for some zeros augmented count data with Gaussian copula models. In contrast to Kendall's tau whose values lie in an interval whose bounds depend on the frequency of ties observations, this measure has the advantage of taking its values on the interval (-1, 1). Originally introduced to model the correlations between continuous variables, its extension to the discrete case implies certain restrictions and its values are no longer in the entire interval (-1,1) but only on a subset. Indeed, the new measure could be interpreted as the correlation between continuous random variables before being transformed to discrete variables considered as our discrete non negative observations. Two methods of estimation based on integration via Gaussian quadrature and maximum likelihood are presented. Some simulation studies show the robustness and the limits of our approach.	bayesian model , discrete data , multivariate , Poisson , Poisson , Skellam , Skellam	en	8503.0
1253	Le chemin qui marche : la pensée et le geste d'écriture chez Benjamin Fondane	Benjamin Fondane is a thinker and an artist of the twentieth century who is still relatively unknown to the academic community. However, his poetry and essays reveal an unusual flow of language and a concrete vision of human duality and practice of thought. “Le mal des fantômes,” Fondane’s central poem, is a image-laden incarnation of the human’s mental uneasiness in creating a disjunction between his or her intellectual reflexes, such as reason and the spirit of non-contradiction, and an intimate experience of the world, a disjunction that necessarily limits the mind to a mere portion of a larger, integral reality. In studying the “fantôme” trope – that is, the haunting figures of the literary tradition – in conjunction with the poem's discursive economy of the sea voyage, we seek to unveil the rhetorical ploys that Fondane mobilizes to counteract this malaise. Through writing and reading experimentation, he seeks a new paradigm of thinking that follows more closely unfolding human existence. By virtue of writing itself, thought travels, moves along, and regains both its vitality and transformative power. Moreover, considering the workings of Fondane’s thought enables us to examine the ongoing relationship between our own intellectual activity, writing, and thought.

1254	"Factors that impact the sustainability of wait time management strategies for total
joint replacement surgeries in canadian provinces"	In response to federal government requirements regarding wait times for elective hip and knee surgery, hospitals have adopted wait list management strategies, with variable success. This research examined organizational and systemic factors that made it possible to keep wait times within federally established limits of 6-12 months. We used a model based on Parsons’ model. Four dimensions were used to analyze the following factors: governance, culture, resources, and tools. Three cases studies were done: Case 1 was able to meet the requirements for six months but unable to sustain this level; Case 2 was able to maintain compliance with requirements for > 18 months; and Case 3 was never able to meet the requirements. Documents were collected and interviews conducted with people involved in the strategies. In all, eight interviews were conducted at each site and all documents related to each strategy were collected. The results indicated that the one hospital that was able to maintain compliance with the wait time requirements had specific characteristics: an exclusive mandate to do only hip and knee replacement surgery; motivated staff who were not distracted by other concerns; and a strong team spirit. The two other cases had to contend with a medical culture that was less homogeneous and they were less focused on meeting targets and had resources that were dispersed as well as unclear inter-organizational policies. In the end, the hospital factory model is appealing in the context of superspecialized surgery. However, because patients are selected for simple surgeries, with little risk of complications, it cannot be promoted as a sustainable model of excellence.

1255	Rhythmic Masticatory Muscle Activity during Sleep: Etiology and Clinical Perspectives	Approximately 60% of the general adult population experiences rhythmic masticatory muscle activity (RMMA) during sleep. The etiology of this movement is not yet understood. However, it has been demonstrated that an increased frequency of RMMA may have detrimental consequences on the stomatognathic system. In this case, RMMA is considered the manifestation of a sleep-related motor disorder known as sleep bruxism (SB). According to the definition of the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, SB is the activity of tooth grinding and clenching during sleep. The occurrence of SB-related activity, i.e., RMMA, is associated with rises of sympathetic tone, heart rate, blood pressure, and it is frequently concomitant with larger respiratory breaths. All these events can be described within a sleep arousal.  The present thesis includes four research articles aimed to study i) the etiology of RMMA during sleep in relation to sleep arousal; and ii) the clinical perspectives of SB assessment and management.  To further investigate the etiology of RMMA and its association with sleep arousal fluctuations we analyzed the cyclic alternating pattern (CAP), a scoring method to assess sleep instability and describe sleep arousal pressure. CAP was scored in SB subjects and controls that participated in two experimental protocols in which sleep architecture and stability were altered by either a medication (i.e., clonidine), or sensory stimulations (i.e., vibratory/auditory). Under these experimental conditions known to increase sleep instability, we were able to show that sleep arousal is not the trigger or cause of RMMA, rather the “permissive window” that facilitates the occurrence of RMMA during sleep.  To evaluate the clinical relevance of SB, we conducted a survey on a 7-17 year old orthodontic population to investigate the prevalence and risk factors associated with SB. It appeared that SB is a highly prevalent sleep disorders in children (15% of prevalence), and is a risk factor for tooth wear (odds ratio, OR 8.8), jaw muscle fatigue (OR 10.5), frequent headache (OR 4.3), loud breathing during sleep (OR 3.1), and several sleep complaints, such as daytime sleepiness (OR 7.4). These findings led us to design an experimental trial using a mandibular advancement appliance (MAA) in adolescents in order to investigate the possible relationship between SB, snoring, and headache. We hypothesized that a common underlying mechanism related to breathing during sleep may be responsible for all concomitant conditions.  The short-term use of an MAA appeared to reduce SB (up to 60%), and improve snoring and headache complaints in adolescents. However, the precise mechanism of action of MAA remains under debate; its effectiveness can be either related to the improvement of breathing during sleep, or its influence on the masticatory system. The interactions between SB, breathing, and headache as well as the long-term effectiveness and safety of the MAA in adolescents need further investigations.

1256	"Association entre la dépression et les comportements reliés aux habitudes de vie et
aux soins du diabète dans la population diabétique du Québec"	Individuals with diabetes are at a greater risk of developing depression, an additional burden for their daily activities. The aim of our study is to determine the characteristics of individuals with depression, in a Quebec population of adults with diabetes. Hypothesis 1: adults in Quebec with diabetes and with depression (major and minor), compared to those without depression, will be more likely to have less healthy lifestyle and care related indicators, and poorer self-efficacy indicators related to control of body weight and amount of food eaten. Hypothesis 2: among adults in Quebec with type 2 diabetes, the association between depression and obesity will be affected by weight cycling and self-efficacy indicators. Hypothesis 3: adults in Quebec with type 2 diabetes who developed or maintained depression during a 12 month period will be more likely to worsen their lifestyle and self-efficacy related indicators. A telephone survey was conducted to recruit individuals with diabetes residing in Québec. Male and female adults, 18 to 80 years of age, were eligible to participate. A total of 3221 subjects were contacted at the beginning of the study; 2003 participated in the study (93% type 2) and 1234 participated in the 12 month follow-up survey. The prevalence of major and minor depression was 10.9% and 8.7%, respectively. Fifty three percent of subjects with major depression had two or three unhealthy indicators (smoking, inactivity or obesity), 33% of subjects were having minor depression and 21% of subjects were without depression. The results of logistic regression analyses indicated that depression was more likely to be associated with being female, less educated, not married, inactive, smoking, having a poor perception of controlling amount of food eaten, and testing blood glucose on a daily basis more frequently (p<0.05). Among individuals with type 2 diabetes, the association between depression and obesity was affected by the variables of weight cycling and self-efficacy. At the 12-month follow-up, 11.5% of subjects developed depression and 10% maintained their depressed state. Individuals who developed depression or maintained their depressed state were more likely to have been physically inactive at the start of the study or to have remained inactive at the 12-month follow-up, and to have maintained a perception of a poor control of body weight and amount of food eaten. However, changes in depression status were not associated with changes in body mass index. In conclusion, physical inactivity and poor self-efficacy play an important roles in the development and persistence of depression in diabetic patients,underlying the usefulness of acting on these multiple factors during treatment.

1257	Développement et validation de l'échelle de mesure du climat de santé mentale	This thesis has the objective to verify the construct validity and internal consistency of a new scale that measures mental health climate. It also aims to observe the convergent validity based on associations between dimensions of mental health climate and dimensions of burnout and well-being. The concept of mental health climate was developed by the Équipe de Recherche sur le Travail et la Santé Mentale. Therefore mental health climate is an important resource for workers to cope with difficulties that may arise in their workplace. Mental health climate is defined as the shared perceptions of policies, procedures and organizational practices that reflect a concern for stress and mental health at work. To validate this new scale of measurement we used the primary data of 40 civilians and police officers of the Service de Police de la Ville de Montréal (SPVM).    According to the results the original scale of ten items needs to be reworked. We made a few changes on this scale to provide an accurate measurement scale of mental health climate of eight items or a short scale of three items. The results highlight the importance of managers to ensure a positive mental health climate within their organization.	santé mentale , mental health climate , mental health , well-being , burnout	en	8462.0
1258	"The role of European Union integration in post-communist democratization
in Bulgaria and Macedonia"	This research focuses on the interpretative dimension of EU integration and on its role in post-communist democratization. It offers an understanding of the significance of taking part in political life, becoming politically competent and taking part in collective actions. This significance takes shape under specific circumstances, which are part of the asymmetrical power relation with the European Union (EU). I discuss the existing literature on the role of EU integration in post-communist democratization and discern two main theoretical paradigms, which put emphasis either on institutionalist learning or on the strategic instrumental process. Within these two approaches I present authors who see the EU either as a pro-democratic or anti-democratic factor in the context of post-communist political transition. This research does not follow exactly, theoretically or methodologically, in the footsteps of the studies presented in the literature review. It starts from a theoretical model, inspired by McFalls’ research on German cultural reunification after 1989. This model, without neglecting institutional and strategic approaches, emphasizes the importance of other theoretical schools, interpretative and constructivist. My findings are based on field trips in two post-communist countries that are situated at different stages of the EU integration process: Bulgaria, which became a EU member in 2007, and Macedonia, which is a candidate country. Methodologically, I use qualitative methods and ethnographic techniques that triangulate findings from different sources into converging dynamic trajectories of cultural change under the influence of EU integration. These findings show the specific conditions under which the conventional ideal-types of political change, institutionalist and strategic, represent useful theoretical models. I also display their limitations that call for an alternative approach. I conclude that EU integration, as a complex phenomenon within the world of meaning, acts simultaneously as a booster and an inhibitor of democratic political culture. People create different subcultures where different interpretations of the EU integration process lead to dissimilar effects on their political participation, competence and collective action. Discursive conversations between people representing these different subcultures may also produce dissimilar effects on the national level. This research is not an analysis of the EU as an institutional mechanism and therefore, it is not research that takes the EU as an institution affecting post-communist democratization. This research focuses on the way the process of EU integration as an interaction affects political culture in post-communist societies, and via this influence, how it affects the process of democratization. It is not about Europeanization, understood as becoming more European-like, unless this Europeanization becomes part of political culture, which affects political behavior.	postcommunisme , Eastern Europe , post-Communism , democracy , European Union , EU integration , political culture , Bulgaria , Macedonia	en	8452.0
1259	Deux mères, un donneur et des enfants : une reconfiguration des rôles familiaux?	It is generally acknowledged that today’s families come in a wide variety of forms. Reconstituted families, new reproductive technologies, international adoption and same-sex parents have become such a fixture in our social landscape that they are no longer surprising. The common characteristic of all these types of families is that they challenge the relationship between a couple’s sexuality and reproduction by introducing other people into the process of conceiving or educating children. In spite of the diversity of contemporary family structures, however, a certain representation of the family persists based on the blood relationship between its various members: a child’s “real” parents are still considered to be his or her biological parents (Déchaux, 2007; Deliège, 2005; Fine, 2010). There is also an emerging discourse centred on the importance of the father in a child’s development and well-being, to the extent that the absence of a father in the family home is increasingly conceptualized as a major social problem (Kelly, 2008). Research shows that father involvement benefits children as well as their mother and father. Of particular interest in this context are lesbian-parented families whose children were conceived by a known donor. The objective of this thesis is to better understand the role of the donor in lesbian-parented families—what place the mothers allow the donor in their parenting project. To better understand how this role is currently evolving, we interviewed nine lesbian couples and the nine donors who participated in their parenting project.

1260	Analyse du regard de trois quotidiens français sur l'Algérie postcoloniale : 1962-1971	The collapse of the French colonial empire begins in the 1950s. After losing its colonies in Morocco and Indochina, France was faced with the secession of its most important colony, Algeria. The French had difficulty accepting the separation as it not only represented the fall of the colonial empire, but the destruction of cherished dreams. More than fearing losing their status as a colonial power, the French fear they will also lose their world great power status and their vision of being a country with a mission civilisatrice. To understand the evolution in the perception the French had of Algeria after the Algerian decolonization through various schools of thought, this thesis looks at editorials published in three French newspapers (Le Figaro, L’Humanité and Le Monde) between 1962 and 1971, which covered events taking place in Algeria. More specifically, this thesis examines OAS terrorist action in the period between the Évian Accords and the Algerian referendum, the conflict within the National Liberation Front (FLN) to decide who would be in power, the conflict with the Socialist Forces Front (SFF), the war with Morocco, the Boumedienne coup d’état and the nationalization of Algerian oil.

1261	Agressivité physique à l'enfance et criminalité à l'âge adulte : effet modérateur de la consommation d'alcool et de cannabis à l'adolescence	Individuals exhibiting high levels of physical aggression during childhood are more at risk of criminal behaviors during adulthood regardless of the presence of several risk factors. Aggressive children are also more at risk of using psychoactive substances during adolescence. Studies of the relationship between substance use and crime have provided different conclusions, depending on the substance under consideration and depending on the category of crime. Alcohol consumption has been positively associated with crimes, both against people and against property. Cannabis consumption has been associated positively with crime against property and negatively with crime against people. This present study aimed at investigating the hypothesis that physical aggression manifested in childhood is associated with an increase in criminal charges during adulthood and that association is specific to the type of crime and moderated differentially by alcohol and cannabis use. To this end, 887 male participants from lower socioeconomic status were followed from age 6 to age 25. Multinomial logistic regressions indicate that individuals belonging to a moderate or a high trajectory of physical aggression during childhood are more likely to commit crimes later in adulthood. This association remains significant after control of family adversity and drug use. Alcohol and cannabis use during adolescence has no effect on this association. However, main effects of alcohol use on crimes against person and cannabis use on crimes against property are observed. The implications of these findings are discussed.

1262	Les systèmes super intégrables d’ordre trois séparables en coordonnées paraboliques	This thesis is a contribution to the study of classical and quantum superintegrability in a two-dimensional Euclidean space involving a third order integral of motion. It consists of an article. Because the classifications of all separable hamiltonians into Cartesian and polar coordinates are already complete, we bring to this picture the study of those systems in parabolic coordinates. First, we derive the determinating equations of a system into parabolic coordinates, after which we solve the obtained equations in order to find integrals of order three for potentials, which allow the separations of variables into the parabolic coordinates. Finally, we prove that all the third order integrals for separable potentials in parabolic coordinates in the Euclidean space of dimension two are reducible. In the conclusion of this article, we analyze the differences between the separable potentials in Cartesian and polar coordinates and the separable potentials in parabolic coordinates.

1263	Symbolique florale dans le tableau de Jean-Baptiste Belin de Fontenay Vase d’or, fleurs et buste de Louis XIV (1687)	The painting by Jean-Baptiste Belin de Fontenay, Vase d’or, fleurs et buste de Louis XIV, is a reception piece of the french academician painter to the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture in 1687.        Unfortunately having been little studied, this painting reveals three very interesting issues. First of all, it contain three kind of painting in one composition: still life, portrait and history painting, illustrated respectively by the flowers, the bust of Louis XIV and the piece of armor. The combination of these three types in a still life is uncommon in the 17th century French painting. It is therefore necessary to check if there is a link between the flowers, the picture of Louis XIV and the armor. Then, the contrast between the polychrome of the flowers and the monochrome of the sculpture and furniture is striking, it is possible to associate this contrast to the phenomenon of the debates between drawing and color of the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture during the second half of the 17th century. Moreover, the flowers, which were not the central subject in the original program of Le Brun, become the main subject of the table and occupy a more important place than the bust of Louis XIV. This change has not shocked the judges of the Academy since the painting was accepted without question. It therefore leads to think about the hierarchy of genres of painting, which was the official doctrine of the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture at the time.       The core of this research is to see if the flowers occupy a mere decorative function, or whether they may be associated with symbols. Our research will verify the employ of floral symbols in French culture of the 17th century and then developed this employ not only in the political field, which means the flowers are in praise of Louis XIV, but also in the aesthetics domain, that is to say how the painting reflects by employing floral symbols the evolution of the theories of art in France during the second half of the 17th century, the hierarchy of genres of painting and the debates between drawing and color.

1264	La face et la figuration: une analyse interactionnelle tirée de l’instruction de base des Forces canadiennes	The subject of this thesis originates from a desire to integrate my research with my personal experience with the Canadian Forces (CF). As a result, I had the idea to study how face and facework emerge during basic training. Taking a communicative/interactional approach, I focused on the facework of a student during three interactions with his superiors. Specifically, I used shadowing and conversation analysis (CA) to examine this issue. This project offers important contributions to a topic that has not yet been addressed from the perspective I develop in this study, and few studies have looked at this topic in the context of the CF. Hence, this study aims to enrich theory by refining the concepts of face and facework. In addition, is aims to inform practice by highlighting communicative practices that are difficult to observe in the ordinary course of military activities.

1265	Riboswitches : le cas des atténuateurs de la transcription du type terminateur/antiterminateur chez les bactéries	It is essential for each organism to have the possibility to regulate its functions to allow its survival and improve its capacity to reproduce in different environments. With the information available, it is apparent that most organisms dedicate an important piece of their genetic material to regulating functions. We could think that certain regulating mechanisms have most likely persisted over time because they fulfilled their roles.  The first prokaryotes studies indicated that there are few regulating mechanisms that take control over genes, but it has been proven that a variety of these mechanisms are used in the regulation of genes and operons. In particular, the bacterial operons involved in the biosynthesis of amino acids, tRNA synthetase, the degradation of amino acids, the ribosomal proteins and RNA ribosomal could be controlled by transcription attenuation. This mechanism of regulation differs from others for the creation of two different structures of the mRNA where one of these structures represses the gene in 3’ and the other one allows the transcription/translation to continue.  In this work, I’m interested in the mechanism of transcription attenuation in prokaryotes where no molecule appears to act as a regulatory factor. In particular, I’m interested in the regulation of bacterial operons. The principal goal of this work is to present a new method for detecting riboswitches that combines the traditional research of these elements with the structural research by incorporating the study of mRNA folding.    This thesis is divided into four chapters. Chapter 1 is a review of the literature on RNA and an overview of the regulatory mechanism of gene expression in prokaryotes. Chapter 2 and 3 present the method developed for this work and its implementation in new software, TA-Search. Finally, Chapter 4 is dedicated to providing a discussion and conclusion for this work.

1266	Native Spiritual Appropriation : Words of Power, Relations of Power - Creating Stories & Identities	Cultural appropriation is a very wide spread and essentially timeless phenomenon. Cultural appropriation is defined as “the taking- from a culture that is not one’s own- of intellectual property, cultural expressions or artifacts, history and ways of knowledge” (Ziff and Rao 1997: 1). This includes all aspects of spirituality, sacred items, values, stories and rites. Appropriation is closely linked to power relations and politics. With the rise of popularity of shamanism and neo-shamanism in Western society, the Indigenous people of North America (and Australia) are voicing their concerns, disapproval and opinions with regards to Western people appropriating Native ceremonies, rituals and sacred beliefs. Through the discourse of countering appropriation the Indigenous, people are (re)gaining and (re)creating an identity which had been neglected, suppressed and assimilated during the course of colonization. It is through the medium of writing in the academic, as well as non-academic, and the sharing of practices with other Natives (Pan-Indianism) that an identity is created. Native authors are challenging the status quo and engage, contribute and advance the debate of spiritual appropriation, power relations and neo-colonialism. The arguments and opinions with regards to spiritual appropriation presented here range from cultural genocide, sexual abuse, neo-colonialism, and disrespect to concern of improper use that can be dangerous for the user/practitioner. By engaging in the debate Indigenous culture is engaging in the healing process (Episkenew 2009).  By participating in the debate of spiritual appropriation the Indigenous people are actively engaging in (re)defining their identity. It is this active engagement that allows healing to take place. The thesis brings together some of the current, Native authors and examines their opinions. The importance of the story and the word as creating identities is explored. By using diverse literature, some texts focusing on medicine, sociology, religion and consumer culture the debate of spiritual appropriation and the link to identity and politics is made more explicit.

1267	Importance de la phosphorylation de la ligase Itch dans la reconnaissance et l'ubiquitylation des protéines à domaine SH3	Itch is an ubiquitin ligase involved in protein recognition and degradation by the proteasome. Itch has three phosphorylation sites targeted by JNK. These sites overlap a small proline rich domain responsible for Itch binding to SH3 domain proteins. Phosphorylation of Itch is important for Itch interaction with c-Jun and JunB. However, little is known about Itch interaction with SH3 proteins and the impact of phosphorylation on Itch ability to recognize and ubiquitinate SH3 proteins. We created a phosphomimic mutant of Itch and a mutant of Itch that cannot be phosphorylated by JNK. We tested these mutants in interaction and ubiquitination assays to determine their effect on Itch ability to bind and ubiquitinate Endophilin, an SH3 domain protein. Phosphorylation is not a prerequisite for Itch binding to Endophilin but phosphorylation of Itch modulates Itch ability to ubiquitinate Endophilin. Phosphorylation of Itch also modulates Endophilin fate, as phosphomimic Itch induces degradation of Endophilin compared to non-phosphorylated Itch. These results show that phosphorylation regulates Itch activity towards differents substrates in different ways.

1268	Étude sur l’oxygénation des lits capillaires du disque optique au cours du cycle menstruel chez les femmes	Postmenopausal women, when compared to men from the same age group, are more prone to develop ocular disease. It is thought that long term hormonal changes caused by ovarian senescence, and especially the drop in estradiol, are the etiological mechanism by which this phenomenon occurs. Whether variations in the levels of endogenous sexual hormones can produce short term effects in the tissues of the eye is less understood and, therefore, constitutes the main reason for carrying out the present study.  Given that non menopausal women have repeated short term changes in the levels of sex steroid hormones during their menstrual cycle, we have recruited such women as study subjects. We also reviewed the scientific literature to establish what would be the parameter of interest and found a well characterised phenomenon: estrogens promote vasodilation by increasing nitrogen oxide production and thus promote a rise in blood flow. As to measuring variations in blood flow within the eye, it was explained in the discussion of the present memoir that changes in the oxygenation of an organ with a constant metabolism are induced by changes in the blood flow irrigating that organ. Using a method based on spectroreflectometry, it is possible to measure oxyhaemoglobin levels (HbO2) in the capillaries of the optic disc. By studying the variation of the HbO2 levels during the menstrual cycle, we can appreciate the effect of the cyclic hormonal changes on the ocular blood flow.       The supply in oxygen and nutrients brought to an organ by its blood flow is essential for its metabolism. Therefore, the discovery of a correlation between sex hormone levels and the oxygenation of the retina would prove to be an important step towards understanding the higher frequency of certain ocular diseases in postmenopausal women, as compared to men of the same age group.   The results of our study show that HbO2 levels in the capillary beds of the optic disc do not undergo statistically significant variations during the menstrual cycle. The same results were found, during a similar observational period, for male subjects used in the study as controls. These results suggest that cyclic variations in the levels of sex hormones, which occur only in nonmenaopausal women, do not induce significant changes in the oxygenation of the optic disc. In short, despite the possible effect of estrogens on the arteriolar diameter, it seems that local regulatory mechanisms of the blood flow maintain a tissue in a state of equilibrium that is adapted to its specific metabolic demand.

1269	Le traitement du harcèlement discriminatoire et du harcèlement psychologique en milieu de travail : continuité ou rupture?	The Québec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms prohibits harassment on the basis of a discriminatory ground. Since June 2004, the Act respecting Labour Standards (ARLS) prohibits harassment in the workplace. By this provision, the legislature intended to increase the availability of recourse for employees. Now, the employee who is victim of discriminatory harassment in the workplace has access to both remedies. Currently, the victims rely almost exclusively on the action based on the ARLS. Indeed, the Human Rights Tribunal (HRT) has only pronounced one decision on the matter after 2004. This new remedy has also modified the legal treatment of discriminatory harassment in the workplace.   Our study focuses on the impact of a Labour Act on the protection of employees as well as on the concept of constitutionalized Labour Law. We examine the continuance of discriminatory harassment in the non-unionized workplace from 1990 to 2010.  Our study is based on various qualitative methods: comparison of existing remedies; review of the doctrine and comparative study of seventy (70) law cases of the HRT and the Commission des relations du travail (CRT). Our results show that failures exist in the treatment of complaints of discriminatory harassment in non-unionized workplace since the provisions enforcement of the ARLS. Except from the court seized, discontinuities are identified in the constitutive elements of the harassment and the sources of law. This research provides an essential assessment to understand the efficiency of the recent recourses available for employees who are victim of discriminatory harassment in the workplace.	travail , Commission des relations du travail , Discriminatory harassment , Psychological harassment , Rights , Workplace , Human Rights Tribunal	en	8345.0
1270	Étude qualitative sur les attitudes des bibliothécaires québécois vis-à-vis la liberté intellectuelle et la censure	The objective of this qualitative study is to understand the attitudes of Quebec librarians with respect to intellectual freedom and censorship in the public library arena. Data were collected through in-depth interviews with 11 librarians, including six directors. These staff were involved in varying degrees in the development process of their library collections and/or in the management of challenges. Their comments were subjected to a rigorous thematic analysis. Similar to previous studies which have focused on this topic, this research showcases the difference between participants’ attitudes regarding intellectual freedom as a concept, and intellectual freedom as an activity. In other words, the participants were in favor of freedom of expression, while at the same time being supportive, under certain circumstances, of restrictive measures. The analysis of the results shows that librarians, while proponents of intellectual freedom, serve primarly as guardians of societal consensus, continually drawing and redrawing the boundary between individual values and societal values. This research ultimately shows that Quebec librarians are less actively engaged than their Canadian and U.S. counterparts in efforts to defend and promote intellectual freedom. Analysis of the data leads to the hypothesis that this weak commitment is intimately related to cultural variables unique to Quebec. The contemporary absence of religious pressure groups and the tardy development of public libraries in Quebec have in fact been identified as two factors tied to the history of the province influencing the professional work environment and the behavior of librarians in the struggle for the defense and promotion of intellectual freedom.

1271	Kindergarten classroom engagement skills : the road to academic success in elementary school	How children begin school is an important predictor of their eventual academic attainment. Although kindergarten knowledge of numbers and vocabulary represent robust indicators of children’s readiness to learn at school entry, theory and research suggest that self-directed learning skills are also important for helping children meet the challenges of the elementary school classroom. In the present thesis, three papers examine the potential benefit of targeting classroom engagement skills in terms of task-orientation and industriousness to improve children’s academic outcomes. In Paper 1, kindergarten classroom engagement skills were found to predict later academic performance and psychosocial adjustment. These results remained significant even after adjusting for kindergarten mathematics, verbal, and attention skills and established child and family risk factors. Paper 2 addresses the origins of classroom engagement and shows that early childhood cognitive control skills represent robust predictors of school entry classroom engagement skills. These findings suggest that developmental continuity in cognitive control may culminate in better school entry engagement skills. Finally in Paper 3, person-centered analyses were used to identify three subgroups of children showing low, moderate, and high patterns of engagement across elementary school. Belongingness to the low engagement trajectory was predicted by early childhood cognitive control skills and parental risk factors. Taken together these results underscore the importance of considering classroom engagement skills in school readiness assessments. This research also has implications for the development of early interventions designed to bolster school readiness in order to circumvent later academic and social impairments.

1272	Développement de papier bioactif par couchage à grande échelle d’enzymes immobilisées par microencapsulation	The main objective of this research is the development of a commercial biosensor immobilized on paper surfaces, able to produce a colorimetric signal detected by human sensorial limits. This kind of biosensor could be used, for example, in the detection of toxic substances or pathogens. To achieve this objective, microencapsulated enzymes fixed on paper are proposed. Enzymes are biological catalysts with a high selectivity that can accelerate the speed of some chemical reactions up to a million times. However, the enzymes are very sensitive substances that lose their functionality easily; it is therefore necessary to protect them from conditions that could damage them. Microencapsulation is a technique that protects the enzymes without totally isolating them from their environment. In fact, microencapsulation entraps the enzymes into a micron size sphere, made of a porous polymer which prevents the enzyme to be released but allows the diffusion of its substrate inside. The microencapsulation process consists in making an emulsion containing a polymer dissolved in an aqueous phase with the desired enzyme, and the wall of the microcapsule is formed by adding a crosslinking agent that forms a polymer network at the interface of the emulsion. The crosslinked polymer solidifies and it encloses the enzyme in the interior of the capsule. Thereafter, this kind of microcapsules are used to give biosensor properties to the paper. Blade coating technique is used in order to immobilize the enzyme capsules on paper because it is the most widely used method in the paper industry. The microcapsules are mixed with a coating suspension and applied on sheets of paper. The viscosity parameters of the suspension and those of the coating are optimized to obtain a uniform coating in order to meet the industry standards. Bioactive paper obtained is first studied to assess whether the enzymes are still active or not after all the treatments because, as described above, enzymes are iii very sensitive substances. An enzyme known as laccase is used, which allows an easy evaluation of its activity. Enzymatic activity was evaluated through existing analytical techniques or new analysis techniques developed in the Rochefort lab. The results demonstrate the possibility to transfer microencapsulated enzyme systems onto paper by blade coating, by using large scale settings, with paper surfaces of 0.75 x 3 m2 modified at speeds ranging up to 800 m/min. Biosensors retained their activity, despite a drying process by evaporation of water using an IR lamp of 36 kW. The microencapsulation technique proposed here is an effective technique to increase the storage stability of the biosensor and its resistance to exposure to NaN3, which is a known inhibitor of this biosensor. This research is part of a national effort in order to develop a commercial device called bioactive paper; it is supported by the NSERC research network Sentinel.

1273	Did Gold Remain Relevant in the Post-1971 International Monetary System?	The central hypothesis to be tested is the relevance of gold in the determination of the value of the US dollar as an international reserve currency after 1971. In the first section the market value of the US dollar is analysed by looking at new forms of value (financial derivative products), the dollar as a safe haven, the choice of a standard of value and the role of SDRs in reforming the international monetary system. Based on dimensional analysis, the second section analyses the definition and meaning of a numéraire for international currency and the justification for a variable standard of value based on a commodity (gold). The second section is the theoretical foundation for the empirical and econometric analysis in the third and fourth sections. The third section is devoted to the specification of an econometric model and a graphical analysis of the data. It is clear that an inverse relation exists between the value of the US dollar and the price of gold. The fourth section shows the estimations of the different specifications of the model including linear regression and cointegration analysis. The most important econometric result is that the null hypothesis is rejected in favour of a significant link between the price of gold and the value of the US dollar. There is also a positive relationship between gold price and inflation. An inverse statistically significant relation between gold price and monetary policy is shown by applying a dynamic model of cointegration with lags.	money , value , benchmark , gold , dollar , regression , cointegration	en	8315.0
1274	L'endostatine et autres marqueurs angiogéniques de la prééclampsie	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate a new anti-angiogenic factor, endostatin, in relation to the risk of preeclampsia (PE).  STUDY DESIGN: We performed a case control study nested in two separate prospective cohorts. Serum samples were collected at 11-17 weeks and 18-26 weeks of gestation. Maternal endostatin levels were measured by ELISA. Results were expressed as multiples of the median (MoM) adjusted for maternal age, gestational age, ethnicity, and cohort of origin. Logistic regression was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (aORs) of PE.  RESULTS: A total of 77 PE and 150 controls of singleton pregnancies were studied, including 21 early-onset PE (diagnosis before 34 weeks) and 41 severe PE. Cases had a higher pre-pregnancy BMI and were more likely of African ethnicity than controls. Endostatin levels were significantly higher in women with PE compared to controls at both the first and second trimester (median 94.2 vs. 90.7 ng/ml p=0.004 and 105.8 vs. 99.3 ng/ml p= 0.002 respectively). Endostatin levels were even higher in women with early-onset PE. At a cut-off level of 75th percentile of endostatin MoMs, the adjusted ORs for PE were 1.33, 95CI [0.68-2.58] at 11-17 weeks and 1.77 [0.94-3.34] at 18-26 weeks. The aORs for early-onset PE were 3.51 [1.18-10.43] at 11-17 weeks and 2.17 [0.67-7.06] at 18-26 weeks, respectively.  CONCLUSION: Higher endostatin levels as early as in the first trimester may  indicate an increased risk of subsequent PE, especially early onset PE. However endostatin alone has a poor predictive value for clinical usefulness.	Preeclampsia , Angiogenic biomarker , Endostatin , Screening	en	8304.0
1275	(Minimally) 'epsilon'-incentive compatible competitive equilibria in economies with indivisibilities	We consider competitive and budget-balanced allocation rules for problems where a number of indivisible objects and a fixed amount of money is allocated among a group of agents. In 'small' economies, we identify under classical preferences each agent's maximal gain from manipulation. Using this result we find the competitive and budget-balanced allocation rules which are minimally manipulable for each preference profile in terms of any agent's maximal gain. If preferences are quasi-linear, then we can find a competitive and budget-balanced allocation rule such that for any problem, the maximal utility gain from manipulation is equalized among all agents.

1276	Représentation de la révolution grecque dans la presse écrite du Bas-Canada (1821-1831)	The thesis aims to analyse the Greek War of Independence as it was represented in the newspapers of Lower Canada during the years 1821 to 1831. I have identified five sorts of documents present in the newspapers which enable an empirical knowledge of the Greek people's struggle for independence, viz. foreign newspapers, works, letters, official documents and editorial opinion. The sales catalogues of the Montreal publishing house Fabre, for the period, have also been studied. The viewpoints and the arguments of the newspaper editors have been evaluated for their influence upon public opinion. Finally, what was written in Lower Canada concerning the Greek Revolution sheds light on the thought patterns of the well-read, their classical education, their construction of an image of the Orient, concepts of Liberty, History and the meanings given to a war of national liberation.

1277	Plasticité synaptique dans l’aire tegmentaire ventrale : implication des endocannabinoïdes	The meso-corticolimbic dopamine (DA) system of the brain, originating in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), is strongly implicated in reward, motivation and drug addiction. Drugs of abuse activate this system and cause significant long term plasticity. DA neurons in the VTA receive are densely innervated by glutamatergic inputs. All major classes of drugs of abuse have been found to cause a long term potentiation (LTP) of glutamate transmission onto DA neurons of the VTA. LTP is an enduring increase of synaptic transmission, hypothesized to underlie memory and learning.  Endocannabinoids (ECs) are transmitters that act in a retrograde fashion on pre-synaptic receptors leading to a decrease in neurotransmitter release. DA neurons can release ECs from their somatodendritic compartment in response to afferent stimulation or depolarization. Neurotensin (NT) is a neuropeptide that presents an extensive interaction with the DA system. It was discovered that NT can induce production of ECs in the striatum.  In the first study of this thesis, we used a combination of immunohistochemical, pharmacological and electrophysiological techniques in mouse brain slices to demonstrate that CB1 EC receptors are present on glutamatergic afferents to DA neurons. Their activation induces a depression of glutamate release. We further showed that trains of afferent stimulation induce EC release from DA neurons and that in the presence of the CB1 antagonist AM251, there is a marked facilitation of the induction of LTP, suggesting that ECs produced in response to activation of glutamate synapses normally negatively regulate the induction, but not the expression of LTP. Finally, we found that 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) is the main EC implicated in this negative regulation of LTP and that LTP induced in the presence of a CB1 receptor antagonist is otherwise also dependent on NMDA glutamate receptors.  In the second study, we report that NT is present in a subset of glutamatergic axon terminals in the VTA and that activation of NT receptors by exogenous NT induces a long-lasting decrease of the amplitude of excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in VTA DA neurons. This decrease was blocked by a broad-spectrum NTR antagonist, as well as by a specific antagonist of the type 1 NT receptor NTS1. The decrease was also blocked when CB1 receptors or 2-AG synthesis were blocked. Chelating intracellular calcium had no effect, but inhibiting G-proteins or phospholipase C blocked NT-mediated synaptic depression. The long-lasting nature of the synaptic depression induced by NT was due to protracted EC release and not to prolonged NT receptor activation. Finally, our observation that a NT receptor antagonist did not facilitate LTP induction, as did a CB1 receptor antagonist, suggests that repetitive stimulation of glutamatergic afferents required to induce LTP does not cause EC production through the release of NT, thus allowing us to conclude that secretion of NT does not act under such conditions as a negative regulator of LTP.

1278	Analyse de mouvements faciaux à partir d'images vidéo	In a face-to-face talk, language is supported by nonverbal communication, which plays a central role in human social behavior by adding cues to the meaning of speech, providing feedback, and managing synchronization. Information about the emotional state of a person is usually carried out by facial attributes. In fact, 55% of a message is communicated by facial expressions whereas only 7% is due to linguistic language and 38% to paralanguage. However, there are currently no established instruments to measure such behavior. The computer vision community is therefore interested in the development of automated techniques for prototypic facial expression analysis, for human computer interaction applications, meeting video analysis, security and clinical applications. For gathering observable cues, we try to design, in this research, a framework that can build a relatively comprehensive source of visual information, which will be able to distinguish the facial deformations, thus allowing to point out the presence or absence of a particular facial action. A detailed review of identified techniques led us to explore two different approaches. The first approach involves appearance modeling, in which we use the gradient orientations to generate a dense representation of facial attributes. Besides the facial representation problem, the main difficulty of a system, which is intended to be general, is the implementation of a generic model independent of individual identity, face geometry and size. We therefore introduce a concept of prototypic referential mapping through a SIFT-flow registration that demonstrates, in this thesis, its superiority to the conventional eyes-based alignment. In a second approach, we use a geometric model through which the facial primitives are represented by Gabor filtering. Motivated by the fact that facial expressions are not only ambiguous and inconsistent across human but also dependent on the behavioral context; in this approach, we present a personalized facial expression recognition system whose overall performance is directly related to the localization performance of a set of facial fiducial points. These points are tracked through a sequence of video frames by a modification of a fast Gabor phase-based disparity estimation technique. In this thesis, we revisit the confidence measure, and introduce an iterative conditional procedure for displacement estimation that improves the robustness of the original methods.

1279	Caractérisation de la translocation (12;13)(p12;q12-14) et l’insertion (X;6)(p11.23;q21q23.3) dans des leucémies aiguës pédiatriques	By a screening strategy combining standard cytogenetics and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), an insertion (X;6) in twins with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and a translocation (12;13) in 2 cases of AML and a case of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have been identified. Insertion (X;6) is not reported and could be a variant of translocation (X;6) described in 4 cases of AML, one of which is associated with a MYB-GATA1 fusion gene. We have identified the disruption of MYB and GATA1 in the insertion but no MYB-GATA1 fusion seems to be present. Other mechanisms could be in play for the disruption of these genes’ expression. Moreover, in the first case of translocation (12;13) identified, ETV6 is fused to either CDX2 or FLT3. The second case associates the deletion of miR-15a and miR-16-1 genes to an ETV6 fusion. In the third case, an ETV6- FOXO1 fusion seems to be involved.	Chromosomes , translocation , Fish , cytogenetics , karyotype , acute pediatric leukemia	en	7104.0
1280	La «crise» du recensement canadien en 2010 : pourquoi se mobiliser pour s’opposer à un changement méthodologique?	In 2010, the Canadian government announced the cancelation of the long-form mandatory census of 2011. It was replaced by the non-mandatory National Household Survey. Many protests were heard, because the data will be less accurate and there will be no continuity with the previous censuses. This data has many purposes, like the application of laws or governmental programs. Different groups also use it in research and advocacy activities. This master’s thesis analyses different situations of controversy over the census methodology, in various countries, to understand how it becomes a political conflict, who are the actors that get involved and why they do so. We find that 3 conditions are necessary to turn a census into a political battlefield. It is : (1) an identity concern; (2) an ideological dimension, about the role of the State and of affirmative action; and (3) the presence of laws or programs that depend directly on the census data. To test this affirmation, we interviewed groups that contested the decision of the cancelation of the mandatory long-form census in Canada in 2010. They took the case in front of the Courts, and think that the government has now the opportunity to escape from some of its obligations, one of which is the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. This controversy’s analysis shows patterns in the relations between the Canadian government and the civil society. Interest groups and minorities now face very little opportunity of doing advocacy activities before the federal government.

1281	The Discourse of Home Recording : Accessibility, Exclusion and Power	"This thesis proposes a critical analysis of the discourse of home recording. It aims to question home recording's will to truth by investigating what makes its statements possible, or what is the system of rules that authorize certain things to be said within the discourse. Driven by enunciations regarding home recording's ""accessibility"" and ""democratization"", this thesis analyzes the power/knowledge relations that have been produced and legitimized within the discourse, as well as what they enable and constrain, allow and exclude. Music magazines and Internet discussion forums form the corpus of this thesis. The methods used in this research are inspired by Michel Foucault's theory and method of discourse and by the approach known as critical interpretation (Johnson et al., 2004). This thesis' analysis shows that the government in home recording seems to be exerted by two main subjects: recording professionals and home recording ""pros"", who are overall characterized as well-off men. Moreover, the rules of home recording seem to be a replication and an adaptation to the home environment of the organizing principles of professional studios. This thesis suggests that ""democratization"" as enunciated and produced within and by the discourse of home recording articulates the discursive notion of a ""contemporary accessibility"" in terms of technology and knowledge to the exclusions – such as that of women and people of limited means – that make this discourse possible. These exclusions are legitimized through what is considered the ""truth"" within the discourse, as well as the norms and regulations established within it, which in turn follow the logic of the professional studio.  Keywords: home, recording, studios, democratization, technology, discourse analysis, power/knowledge relations, Michel Foucault."

1282	Diversité fonctionnelle du facteur de transcription Tbx5 dans le coeur	The vertebrate heart is a modular organ, which requires the complex patterning of the morphogenetic heart fields and the coordinated convergence of the diverse subpopulations of cardiogenic progenitors. At least 7 transcription factors of the T-box family cooperate within these numerous subpopulations of cardiogenic progenitors to regulate the morphogenesis and the layout of multiple structures along the primordial heart tube, which explains that the human mutations of these genes induce various congenital heart defects (CHDs). One of these T-box genes, Tbx5, whose haploinsufficiency generates the Holt-Oram syndrome (HOS), intervenes in a wide variety of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that orchestrate the morphogenesis of the atria, the left ventricle, the mitral valve, the inter-atrial and inter-ventricular septa, as well as the cardiac conduction system. The diversity of GRNs involved in the formation of these cardiac structures suggests that Tbx5 holds a profusion of functions which will be identifiable only by indexing its molecular activities in each separately examined cardiac lineage. To address this problem, a conditional knockout of Tbx5 in the endocardium was generated. This experiment demonstrated a crucial role of Tbx5 in the survival of the endocardial cells lining the septum primum and the cardiomyocytes within this embryonic structure, which will contribute to the morphogenesis of the inter-atrial septum. Moreover, this study revealed a crosstalk between the Tbx5-positive endocardial cells subpopulation and the myocardium at the level of the septum primum to ensure the survival of cardiomyocytes, and ultimately to guarantee the maturation of the inter-atrial septum. Our results also confirmed the importance of genetic interdependence (Tbx5 and Gata4 as well as Tbx5 and Nos3) between different loci in the morphogenesis of the inter-atrial septum, and particularly the influence that the environment can have on the penetrance and the expressivity of atrial septal defects (ASDs) in the HOS. Besides, since the functions of a gene usually depend on the different isoforms it can generate, a second study focused more on the transcriptional aspect of Tbx5. This approach led to the discovery of 6 alternative transcripts exhibiting both common and specific functions. The characterization of 2 of these isoforms revealed the role of the long isoform (Tbx5_v1) in the regulation of cardiomyocytes growth during cardiogenesis, whereas the short isoform (Tbx5_v2), preferentially expressed in the mature heart, represses cell growth. It is thus entirely conceivable that TBX5 mutations leading to a C-terminal truncation increase the concentration of a mutated protein, which, like Tbx5_v2, interferes with the growth of certain cardiac structures. On the other hand, the divergence of functions of these isoforms, characterized by the disparities of subcellular localization and interaction with other cardiac cofactors, suggests that mutations affecting more one isoform would favor the emergence of a particular type of CHD. Finally, a last objective was to identify one or several molecular mechanism(s) by which Tbx5 regulates its main target gene, Nppa, and to extract clues that might clarify its transcriptional function. This objective required in a first place to identify the various cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) coordinating the transcriptional regulation of Nppa and Nppb, two natriuretic genes whose tandem organization and expression pattern during cardiogenesis are preserved in most vertebrates. The phylogenetic footprint approach employed to scan the Nppb/Nppa locus allowed the identification of three CRMs evolutionary conserved between different mammals species, one of which (US3) is specific to eutherians. This study confirmed that the regulation of the tandem genes Nppb/Nppa required the transcriptional activity of enhancers in complement to Nppa and Nppb promoters. The almost perfect concordance between the expression profiles of Tbx5 and these two natriuretic genes in mammals, suggests that the ventricular expression gradient of Tbx5 is interpreted by the recruitment of this factor to the identified enhancers. Altogether, the studies presented in this thesis allowed clarifying the profusion of Tbx5 cardiac functions. Some of these functions emanate from the alternative splicing of Tbx5, which favors the synthesis of isoforms endowed with specific properties. The diverse combinatorial interactions between these isoforms and other cardiac factors within the various cardiogenic progenitor subpopulations contribute to the emergence of distinct cardiac RRGs.

1283	Identification et caractérisation des cibles transcriptionnelles de ETV6, un facteur de transcription impliqué dans la leucémie de l’enfant	Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) accounts for approximately 25% of all paediatric cancers. Approximately 85% of ALL cases happen in immature B precursors lymphocytes (pre-B ALL). Pre-B ALL is a sporadic cancer that leads to the massive proliferation of leukemia pre-B lymphocytes in the bone marrow. During the past 30 years, the scientific community has developed efficient therapeutic treatments against paediatric ALL, reaching more than 80% cure rate. However, these treatments lack specificity because of the lack of knowledge regarding the molecular mechanisms involved in the initiation and progression of paediatric pre-B ALL. In other words, we know little about the aetiology of this disease. Approximately 25% of children affected with pre-B ALL carry the chromosomal translocation t(12;21)(p13;q22) involving the ETV6 and AML1 genes. This translocation originates in utero and leads to the expression of the transcriptional chimera ETV6-AML1, which alone is insufficient to trigger the development of pre-B ALL. Therefore, other genetic events would be required to initiate paediatric leukemogenesis. The deletion of the residual allele of ETV6 is frequently observed at the diagnosis of pre-B ALL t(12;21)+. This leads to the complete inactivation of ETV6 in leukemia pre-B lymphocytes. ETV6 is a transcriptional repressor of the Ets family. My research hypothesis is that ETV6 acts as a tumour suppressor gene in paediatric pre-B ALL. The inactivation of ETV6 would lead to the deregulated expression of its transcriptional targets and, consequently, would favour the initiation and progression of paediatric leukemogenesis. Given the fact that only very few ETV6 transcriptional targets are known, I initially performed chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments and luciferase assays that enabled the identification of six novel transcriptional targets: TP53 (p53 and Δ133p53), SPHK1, IL-18, PTGER4 and LUM. The ETV6-mediated transcriptional regulation involves both functional domains: PNT (protein interactions) and ETS (DNA-binding domain). These functional domains facilitate the recognition of consensus EBS sites located in a region close to the basal promoter, a molecular mechanism used according to the target promoter and cellular context. Functional studies using leukemia pre-B lymphocytes were useful to understand the role of the ETV6 transcriptional targets during cell proliferation, induction of apoptosis and cell migration through the CXC12/CXCR4 signalling pathway. These functional studies showed the implication of SPHK1, IL-18 and PTGER4 genes during paediatric leukemogenesis. This study is one of the first to support the role of ETV6 as a tumour suppressor gene in paediatric pre-B ALL. Once ETV6 is inactivated, the increased expression of its transcriptional targets favours the proliferation and survival of leukemia pre-B lymphocytes in the bone marrow. The identification of new genes involved in the development of paediatric pre-B ALL opens new doors to the development of therapeutic treatments with a better specificity toward the aetiology of the disease.	paediatric cancer , acute lymphoblastic leukemia , oncogenesis , ETV6 transcription factor , transcriptional regulation , functional studies	en	7046.0
1284	Impact du bicarbonate de sodium sur la prévention de la néphropathie induite par le produit de contraste en chirurgie endovasculaire pour anévrysme de l’aorte	Background: The endovascular approach for the repair of aortic aneurysm involves the administration of large quantities of contrast media, which can cause contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) in the post operative period. The only proven strategy to prevent CIN is intravenous hydration, but what type of infusion to use is not clear. We evaluated the efficacy of sodium bicarbonate, compared with NaCl 0.9%, to reduce the incidence of postoperative renal failure. Methods: We conducted a prospective, controlled, double-blind, randomized study in patients presenting for endovascular aortic aneurysm surgery. Patients in group A (n = 17) received sodium bicarbonate 3 mL/kg/h for 1 h before the procedure and then 1 mL/kg/h until 6 h after surgery, whereas patients in group B (n= 17) received the same amount of NaCl 0.9%. All patients received N-acetylcysteine. The primary end point was CIN, defined by serum creatinine greater than 25 % above baseline 48 h post operatively.  Biomarkers of renal injury were measured. Results: CIN developed in one patient in the bicarbonate group (5,88%), compared with no patient in the NaCl 0,9% group (0%) (difference 5.88%;95% CI -5.3% to 17.06%, P = 0.31). Interleukin-18, N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase and Kidney Injury Molecule-1 increased significantly in both groups after exposure to contrast media.    Conclusions: We demonstrated a low rate of renal failure following endovascular aortic surgery using contrast media, regardless of whether bicarbonate or NaCl 0.9% was used for hydration, despite significant elevation in biomarkers of renal injury.	cystatine c , interleukine 18 , KidneyInjury Molecule-1 , N-acétyl-β-D-glucosaminidase , Neutrophilgelatinase-associatedlipocalin , Aortic aneurysm , creatinine , cystatin c , interleukin-18 , Kidney Injury Molecule-1 , N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase , Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin	en	7007.0
1285	La structure du sommeil et l’activité cardiaque nocturne chez les adolescents ayant un trouble anxieux	The aim of this thesis was to characterize, in a clinical group of children and adolescents with anxiety disorder as a primary diagnostic, the sleep period and to compare it to a control group. Firstly, we have verified if the nocturnal sleep pattern of children and adolescents could be grouped by psychiatric disorders. Sixty-seven children and adolescents with anxiety disorders and nineteen non anxious match controls were monitored using ambulatory recording equipment. Results showed that nocturnal heart rate pattern of anxious adolescents would vary accordingly with the diagnosis. While non anxious adolescents exhibit a flat nocturnal heart rate pattern through the night, anxious participants showed the following associations: a) increased nocturnal heart rate pattern associated with separation anxiety disorder; b) decreased nocturnal heart rate pattern associated with generalized anxiety disorder; and c) U shape nocturnal heart rate pattern associated with social phobia. Moreover, a significant association was found between anxiety diagnosis and presence of morning fatigue. The association between nocturnal heart rate patterns with anxiety suggests that the circadian modulation of heart rate is dysregulated, but what about the sleep macrostructure?  Secondly, we have monitored in a sleep laboratory a clinical sample of nineteen adolescents with pathological anxiety, comorbidity and medication, and compared it to nineteen non anxious match controls. Results showed that anxious participants had longer sleep latency, longer REM sleep latency and longer awake period during sleep when compared to control participants. Compared to control participants, anxious patients subjectively reported sleep disturbances, manifested objective sleep disorders and presented no adaptation to the laboratory environment.  Moreover, higher nocturnal heart rate and higher apnea-hypopnea index were observed in anxious group when compared to non anxious group. Significant positive associations were observed between Trait anxiety and apnea-hypopnea index as well as for sleep latency while manifest anxiety was associated to REM sleep latency. Results suggest that sleep of children and adolescents with pathological anxiety is altered, that signs of physiological hypervigilance are observed and that both are associated.   Following previous results, we have analyzed in a third study heart rate variability during nocturnal sleep using both, times and frequency domains in a clinical sample group of seventeen children and adolescents with anxiety disorder as primary diagnostic with comorbidity and medication. Results showed that anxious when compared to non anxious, had a shorter interbeat interval, and had lower rMSSD values, less high frequency in normalized units and higher low frequency/high frequency ratio. Correlations were observed between clinical anxiety scores and time and frequency domains of heart rate variability. These results add to the growing body of literature that pathological anxiety in a clinical group of children and adolescents impact on sleep process and heart rate regulation during sleep.  Overall findings add to the growing body of recent clinical literature, a sleep alteration description of a clinical sample of children and adolescents. From the three studies of this thesis, results showed that circadian heart rate pattern is altered, that sleep architecture is altered, and that the time and frequency domain of nocturnal heart rate variability is altered in a clinical group of children and adolescents with pathological anxiety.

1286	La capacité d'action collective des populations marginalisées dans le cadre des stratégies de lutte pour la reconnaissance : les cas de Cité de l'Éternel à Port-au-Prince (Haïti) et de la Sierra Santa Catarina (Mexico)	This thesis analyzes the collective action of marginalized populations located respectively in Cité de l’Éternel» in Port-au-Prince (Haiti) and in « Sierra Santa Catarina », Iztapalapa (Mexico City). In Port-au-Prince, before the fall of the dictatorship of Duvalier, the “tontons macoutes” invaded a terrain located on the edge of the quay of the capital, close to the boulevard Harry Truman. After being installed there, they proceeded to sell of lots intended for the construction of private housing. But after the fall of Jean-Claude Duvalier, in 1986, a part of the population took the opportunity to invade what remained of these marshes. After the occupation, they organized collectively to defend their property before undertaking actions to bring services and to obtain the regularization of their situation.  In the Sierra Santa Catarina (Mexico) populations led by militants of the Popular Front occupied ground at the foot of a sandy mountain in order to build their homes. Like the populations of «Cité de l’Éternel », these people organized to keep watch in order not to be evicted by the police. While working to gain access to the basic services, they undertake actions at the public institutions in order to obtain the regularization of their situation. In relation to the capacity for collective action of these populations, sociological theories are divided. On one side, certain authors support the thesis of the incapacity of these populations to have collective interests and to act consequently. According to them, without social mediation and without aggregation and a political representation, these populations are unable to acquire a collective subjectivity. Other authors think that at the basis of ties of friendship, family and vicinity, independently of their socio-economic situations, these populations can create strategies of subsistence and fight to find solutions that are individuals as well as collective. Concerning populations that invade territory to establish their homes, their actions are already a form of collective action. They are also involved in collective action either to bring basic services such as water and electricity, or to obtain public recognition of the invaded territories. This recognition implies not only the installation of regular services for the benefit of the population but also the granting to each owner of title. In the case of the Sierra Santa Catarina the actions undertaken with respect to public institutions, while in the case of Port-au-Prince, NGO’s or cooperation agencies are directly implicated.  We cannot conclude that populations are unable to have a collective subjectivity and shared interests without an aggregation and a political representation. Starting from various bonds between the individuals, associations are created which make it possible to establish mediation between the populations and other organizations. In the case of the Sierra Santa Catarina, collective action is certainly instrumentalised by leaders. That is part of a political tradition in Mexico. Nevertheless, some settlements people manage to resist their leaders. A part from  the socio-economic situation, the influence of certain leaders in Mexico and the indifference of the State (in the case of Port-au-Prince, in particular), these populations show an astonishing critical capacity with respect to their situation as well as their relations with the leaders of associations and the settlements. This suggests possibility for autonomous critical collective action where circumstances allow  Keys words: marginalization, collective action, recognition, smartness, critical capacity, slums fragmented recognition, denial recognition	Marginalization , Collective action , Recognition , Smartness , Critical capacity , Slums , Political intrumentalization , Fragmented recognition	en	6936.0
1287	La sécrétion de la protéine Tau : nouveau mécanisme de propagation de la pathologie de Tau dans la maladie d'Alzheimer	Tau, a microtubule-associated protein, is enriched in the axon. In Alzheimer’s disease, Tau becomes hyperphosphorylated, redistributes to the somato-dendritic compartment and forms aggregates called neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). The NFTs propagates in a predictable manner in particular neuronal networks. Indeed, they appear in the trans-entorhinal region and then propagate to the entorhinal cortex where the trans-entorhinal cortex projects. Then, the NFTs propagate to the hippocampus and to different regions of the cortex and neocortex. Recent studies have reported that Tau can be secreted by neuronal cell lines. Besides, when aggregates of Tau protein were injected in mouse brain, they could enter neurons and induced Tau pathology. Based on those observations, it was speculated that Tau could be secreted by neurons and then captured by neighbouring cells to propagate Tau pathology in the brain. The goal of the present study was to prove that Tau can be secreted by neurons and to find the secretory pathway involved in Tau secretion. Moreover, the phosphorylation state of Tau protein was examined and compared to intracellular non-secreted Tau. Our results showed that Tau is secreted by cortical neurons isolated from wild-type mice and by HeLa and PC12 cells overexpressing human Tau. Our results also indicated that autophagosomes would be involved in Tau secretion. Finally, we found that secreted Tau was dephosphorylated and cleaved compared to the non-secreted intracellular Tau.

1288	La logique déontique : une application de la logique à l'éthique et au discours juridique	In this essay we aim to provide a critical analysis of the literature regarding deontic logic. First of all, we wish to give a historical account of deontic logic's evolution, which will be done mainly by chapter 2. This chapter concerns the paradoxes of deontic logic and gives an overview of the usual systems and their origin. Our second objective is to provide a synthesis of the literature regarding the formal analysis of the normative discourse. The chapters 3, 4 and 5 give an account of the three principal ways which deal with deontic operators, that is the monadic deontic logic, the dyadic deontic logic and the temporal deontic logic. Finally, we propose a critical analysis of that literature and we show that these systems do not represent adequately some of the normative discourse's fundamental characteristics. We will accomplish this by providing an analysis of the legal discourse and show that the concept of obligation has some properties and behaves in a way that cannot be represented by the actual systems.

1289	L’évolution de la motivation pour les mathématiques au second cycle du secondaire selon la séquence scolaire et le sexe	Researchers have recently been interested in the evolution of student motivation in mathematics during the high school years. Many findings have underscored gender differences in student motivation. Research has yet to consider motivational differences according to skill level in mathematics during the final years of high school. Because performance-based streaming in mathematics is a conventional educational practice in its system, the Canadian province of Quebec offers an excellent opportunity to study such student differences over time, according to gender.  Thus, the main objective of this study is to document the evolution of student motivation in high school mathematics while attending to mathematics skill level and gender. Based on existing performance-based educational policy, participants (1864 girls and 1576 boys) were already grouped in two skill levels of mathematics courses: advanced and basic. They were enrolled in one of 30 French-language public high schools in the Montreal area. Between ninth and eleventh grade (mean ages 14.60 and 17.84, respectively), students completed a self-report questionnaire at five different time points. The questionnaire addressed the following five motivational variables at all five time points: competence beliefs, performance anxiety, perception of mathematics utility, interest for mathematics, and accomplishment goals (mastery-based, performance-based, and avoidance-based approach goals). Grade 11 represents the final year of high school in Quebec.   Hierarchical linear modeling analyses were employed to achieve the objective of this study. The results indicate that student motivation generally decreased by the end of high school. However, this decrement was particularly remarkable for students at the advanced mathematics skill level. More specifically, students in the advanced level showed a steeper decline in self-perceived competence, expressed interest, and perceptions of usefulness of mathematics at the end of high school. Their performance anxiety also increased during the same developmental period. Although the results revealed decrements in mastery-based approach goals for all students, those at the basic skill classification maintained generally lower levels of such goal-directed behaviors at the end of high school. Conversely, only students at the advanced skill level reported decreased performance-based approach goals. They also showed important increases in avoidance-based goals. Though students registered in the basic mathematics skill stream consistently reported lower motivation scores, their counterparts at advanced skill levels reported comparatively more important motivational decrements by the end of high school. Therefore, the results of this study suggest that decreases in mathematics motivation by the end of high school particularly affect students at more advanced mathematics levels. As for gender, motivational differences between girls and boys were not often found significant. This finding is above and beyond the fact that girls consistently maintained lower motivation scores than boys registered at the same mathematics skill level. This finding highlights the importance of considering possible gender differences when facing the challenges of the high school math curriculum, regardless of skill level. The most important findings suggest that pedagogical interventions be prospectively adjusted in tenth grade in order to circumvent decreases in student motivation at advanced levels by the end of high school.	school motivation , gender , school level , high school , mathematics	en	6910.0
1290	Étude exploratoire sur les espaces équivoques, leurs dynamiques d’appropriation et les enjeux urbanistiques à Montréal	This research takes an interest in the equivocal spaces, which means the ambiguous spaces resulting form different forms of spatial appropriation that take place in them. By a heuristic process and with an exploratory two case studies, which use ethnographic research methods, this master thesis aims to characterize the equivocal spaces. The two spaces considered, both situated in the north part of the Plateau-Mont-Royal’s borough in Montreal, are a wasteland informally called Parc sans Nom and an industrial vacant lot informally called Champ des Possibles. With a qualitative approach, the positions of the municipal authorities and of the users of the two sites, in terms of the physical constraints, the coercive measures and the perceptions of risk and potential of conflict in the two spaces, will be analyzed. The results of this analysis allow us to find that the equivocal spaces emerge from a co-construction process. The results allow us also to underline some considerations on the people’s relationship to urban space.

1291	Discussions politiques sur Internet : les raisons expliquant le degré de participation de jeunes adultes québécois	This master thesis deals with the reasons some young adult Quebecers have to be or not to be involved in political discussions on the Internet. It was written within the general context of the rise of Web 2.0 and within the specific context of the Canadian elections of May 2011. At the theoretical level, we have worked with German philosopher Jürgen Habermas' Theory of Communicative Action along with his conception of the Public Sphere. From a methodological standpoint, we have studied a sample made up of young adult Quebecers, both men and women, aged between 19 and 30, living in Montreal and its surroundings. These young citizens were questioned throughout four focus group sessions. The collected data was analysed with an argument extraction method in accordance with the rational reconstruction methodology. The results allowed us to expose many reasons that could explain the questioned young adults' level of involvement in online political discussion. These reasons were regrouped in four themes: the lack of knowledge and the public aspect; awareness and feedback; reaction based on content, the nature of the network and the value of information; face-­‐to-­‐face conversation, anonymity and controversial topics. In order to highlight the contributions of this study to the field of communication, the results were discussed while considering those obtained by other researchers. The discussion also allowed us to adopt a critical and theoretical point of view to explore what the results of this thesis reveal on the state of the Public Sphere in Quebec.

1292	Définition de la pastorale de la Création en tant que nouveau ministère dans l’Église catholique du Québec	This research attempts to define Creation Care so that it is recognized as a ministry in the Catholic Church in Quebec. I followed the method of pastoral praxeology inspired by the humanities so that this practice is both effective in the field and faithful to the Gospel of Jesus Christ. The object of analysis is the practice itself, specifically the parish activities on the theme of the environment. I closely observed some relevant activities, including a training session given to pastoral assistants. Then I interpreted these comments in light of the Christian Tradition by drawing on the Bible, several theological references and Church statements. After this reflection, I improved this practice by organizing a new training for the Church staff, the project of a practical guide and the outline of a course on Creation Care Ministry to be given in universities. Finally, the prospective allowed me to imagine in the long-term how the practice will ensure a sustainable church ... in every sense.	pastoral , environment , creation , church , ministry , Catholic , Quebec , praxeology	en	6902.0
1293	Les cours de danse africaine à Montréal, émergence d’une production socioculturelle et esthétique	This thesis deals with the teaching of African dance in France and in Canada. The research for this thesis began in 2007, when the author took part in a student exchange and ended with a consideration of African dance in Quebec as a consumer good and/or an imaginary sociocultural production. The analysis explores the benefits and the limits of the methodological approach embraced by the anthropologist (who is, in this case, a former dancer with training in classical dance), and the terms of the encounter between Africans and Westerners through dance. While it remains to be shown that the post-modernist critiques of mass art apply to this context, the analysis here points to the presence of a  professional consciousness in African dance lessons in Quebec. Critiques of dance and other arts as democratization tend to get lost in the fear of popular discourse. The main objective of this research is therefore to establish the limits of the fetishism associated with African dance and to discuss in further detail the « hantise du Troisième Homme », communicated by ethnographic research and anthropological analysis	African dance , Aestheticism , Fetishism , Postmodernism , World culture , Ethnochoreology	en	6894.0
1294	Ninon de Lenclos (1623-1705), le parcours d’une libertine au XVIIe siècle	Thanks to the concepts developed by the gender history, this Master's thesis seeks to re-evaluate the life of the seventeenth century libertine courtesan Anne de Lenclos, known as Ninon. The courtesan’s image promoted since the eighteenth century doesn’t reveal the complexity of the character: it only focuses on Ninon’s sexual behaviours or on her intellectual abilities and her role in the literary life of the “Grand Siècle”. A new reading of the courtesan’s correspondence and notarial acts (economical acts, testament, post-mortem inventory) allows us to gain a new understanding of the figure of Ninon. Indeed, our research demonstrates how the courtesan succeeded conciliate transgressions against the established order with an admired and respected “salonnière” reputation.

1295	Subepithelial collagen content in the peripheral airways of heaves-affected and control horses	Extracellular matrix remodelling is present in the human asthmatic lung, and is characterized by increased collagen or fibrosis of the subepithelial area of the airway. Heaves, a naturally occurring chronic lower airway inflammatory condition in horses shares aspects of pathophysiology with asthma, including features of airway remodelling. We thus hypothesize that airway fibrosis is a characteristic of remodelling in heaves. The aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of fibrosis in the subepithelial area of the peripheral airways of heaves-affected horses. Peripheral lung biopsies acquired under thoracoscopic guidance were obtained from 5 control and 6 heaves-affected horses, both before (T0) and after a 30 day antigenic challenge with mouldy hay and straw. Prior to the study, diseased horses were in clinical remission and exhibited no clinical signs of disease. Obtained samples were microscopically examined using picrosirius-red, a collagen specific histological staining technique. Collagen area in the subepithelial layer, e.g. the region between the airway smooth muscle and the epithelial layer was measured, and corrected for airway size using standard morphometric techniques. In comparison with controls, heaves-affected horses had an increased collagen content in the airway subepithelial area (p<0.1). No change in fibrosis of the subepithelial area was observed in diseased horses after the 30 day antigenic challenge. Peripheral airway subepithelial collagen at baseline was positively associated with maximal changes in transpulmonary pressure and pulmonary resistance in horses with heaves but not in controls. Results of this study indicate that fibrosis of the subepithelial area is present in the peripheral airways of heaves-affected horses, and may play a role in residual lung function deficits observed in diseased horses even while in clinical remission.

1296	Trajectoires de résilience chez des mères adolescentes victimes de violence de la part de leur partenaire amoureux : implications théoriques et pratiques pour le domaine de la promotion de la santé	Giving birth at a young age may represent a situation of adversity affecting the life of young women and their children. Being a victim of violence at the hands of an intimate partner also represents an important source of adversity, notably because this may lead to numerous consequences on health. Jointly, those two sources of adversity can seriously affect a life course trajectory. However, young mothers may overcome those obstacles. Based on a joint intersectional approach and a life course perspective, this study allows for a better understanding of the different components of a resilience trajectory in a context of dual adversity. As very few studies done in Quebec exist on this subject, an important part of this thesis is also devoted to expanding the literature on early pregnancy in a context of intimate violence.  Young mothers who gave birth in a context of adversity (victims of relational violence), who identified themselves as resilient and who were recognised as such by the counsellors with whom they are in contact, participated in this exploratory study. These 19 women shared their stories through in-depth and group interviews. Additionally, field observations allowed for a better understanding and contextualization of early pregnancy and its associated challenges. Their words and stories, transcribed and then analyzed sequentially in a manner inspired by grounded theory analysis strategies, are at the center of the analysis.  The theoretical model of a resilience trajectory presented in this thesis has five components: the source(s) of adversity, the turning point, the processes, the promoting factors, and the vulnerability factors. Indicators that can help identify a resilience trajectory are also proposed. One of the notable aspects that emerges from this study is the importance of maternity as a turning point. Indeed, motherhood accentuates the resilience of these women’s life course trajectory, mainly by allowing them to create a bond with their baby, who depends on them for his or her survival and needs. This study also provides a better understanding of the processes that helped these mothers overcome difficulties: 1) building a life setting better suited for their child ; 2) activating themselves in regards to their toxic relationships; 3) mobilizing and using existing resources and 4) using the past to move forward: (re)investing in skills and knowledge gained through previous adversities. The promoting factors, as well as the vulnerability factors, are rooted in a systemic lecture and can be associated to various ecological levels. While the formers represent elements upon which a resilience trajectory may originate and expand, the latters may weaken that trajectory. Possible outcomes of this study for health promotion research and intervention are discussed, notably in terms of future action and reflection.

1297	Régulation des processus de réparation de l’épithélium bronchique sain et Fibrose Kystique par le TNF-alpha	Cystic fibrosis (CF) pathology, caused by mutations of cftr gene, leads to ion and fluid transport dysfunction that results in mucus thickening and accumulation in the airways. This mucus accumulation promotes bacterial infection and airway inflammation associated with progressive airway epithelial damage in CF patients, unfortunately leading to respiratory failure. However, the effect of inflammatory products on the repair capacity of respiratory epithelia is unclear. Thus, the objective of my project was to study the regulation of normal and CF bronchial epithelial repair mechanisms by tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF)-alpha, a major component of inflammation initiation and propagation in CF. With a wound healing model, we observed that TNF-alpha stimulated the non-CF (NuLi-1) and CF (CuFi-1) bronchial wound healing rate. Surprisingly, chronic exposure to TNF-alpha enhanced this stimulation as well as the migration rate during repair. This wound healing rate stimulation by TNF-alpha seems to be due to metalloproteinase MMP-9 activation, EGF shedding by epithelial cells and subsequent EGFR transactivation. Furthermore, we recently reported a crucial relationship between the EGF response and K+ channel function, both controlling bronchial repair. We now show that TNF-alpha wound healing stimulation also implicated KvLQT1 and KATP currents activation. In contrast to its effect on cell migration, TNF-alpha downregulate cell proliferation. Thus, in addition to its recognized role in the inflammatory response leading to epithelial injury, TNF-a could exert complex actions on repair mechanisms of CF airway epithelia by upregulating cell migration while downregulating proliferation.

1298	Les pratiques parentales, le désengagement scolaire des amis et le rendement scolaire chez les élèves du secondaire nés en Haïti et fréquentant une école en milieu défavorisé	School underachievement has important consequences, both individual and societal. Haitian adolescents seem particularly at risk of experiencing such academic difficulties. Yet, very few Canadian studies have focused on the academic experience of students in this community. Studies conducted with other minority groups have however reported the important influence of friends and parents in regard to these adolescents’ achievement. The objective of this paper is to examine how school-related parenting practices moderate the relationship between peers’ disengagement in school and academic performance among economically disadvantaged Haitian adolescents.   In the first chapter, we have made a statistical portrait of immigration in Quebec and discussed different aspects related to achievement among immigrant students. These data indicate that the academic difficulties that some of these students experience are complex and involve many factors. The second chapter explains how parents and friends are key actors in the academic success of Haitian students coming from disadvantaged background. We then assessed the moderating effect of school-related parenting practices on the relationship between peers’ disengagement in school and adolescents’ achievement in literacy. Results reveal that parental practices and peers’ disengagement toward school contribute directly (positively or negatively) to adolescents’ academic experience. In the third chapter, we finally discussed the role of the psychoeducator who intervene with Haitian students. It appears that there are many interventions that can be implemented with friends, parents, and teachers to promote the academic success of these students.  Our results highlighted the importance of considering peers’ disengagement from school and parenting practices in the study of academic difficulties among Haitian students coming from disadvantaged backgrounds. Further studies are however needed to understand the mechanisms underlying the contribution of these actors on adolescents’ achievement. These studies ought to include larger samples of participants coming from all regions of Quebec and all socio-economical backgrounds. In addition, these studies ought to rely on several informants and consider factors intrinsic to the student, such as his academic motivation or self-esteem.

1299	Symptômes dépressifs et consommation problématique de substances psychoactives : effets modérateurs du contexte social	Of adolescents who use drugs, only a minority develops significant problems related to this drug use. It is then relevant to know and understand the processes by which this problematic consumption develops itself in order to be able to prevent it. This study examines the roles of depression symptoms and social relationships in the development of problematic drug use at the adolescence. More precisely, it aims at determining, with the help of a prospective correlational longitudinal design, if peers support, parental support and the quality of the teacher-student relationship have moderator effects on the relationship between depressive symptoms and problematic drug use. The sample used for this study is taken from the Stratégie d’Intervention Agir Autrement and is comprised of 4473 teenagers. Multiple linear regressions were completed and showed that depressive symptoms enhance the risk of a problematic drug use to be developed, whereas peers support impairs it. Contrary to what was expected, results show that parental support enhances the risk of developing a problematic drug use and that the teacher-student relationship has no significant impact. Moreover, peers support has a protective role, parental support intensifies the relationship between depressive symptoms and problematic drug use, whereas the quality of the teacher-student relationship attenuates it.

1300	Régulation dynamique de l’activité du récepteur des estrogènes beta (ERβ) par la phosphorylation,l’ubiquitination et la sumoylation	Estrogens play a pivotal role in reproductive physiology through direct interaction with the estrogen receptors ERα and ERβ, which belong to the nuclear hormone receptor family of ligand-activated transcription factors. Harbouring two activation domains (AF-1 and AF-2), gene expression can be controlled by ERs either in a hormone-dependent and/or independent manner. Disruption of ER transcriptional regulation is associated with pathological events such as breast and endometrial cancers. While ERα is considered a strong predictive factor in endocrine therapy of reproductive cancers, the clinical value of ERβ is still debated, although greater expression of ERβ has been associated with a favourable outcome since recent evidence has associated ERβ with anti-tumorigenic properties and a better response to anti-estrogenic compounds.  Along with others studies, those individual outcomes indicate that even though the two receptors can exert similar roles by sharing resemblances in terms of structure and general response to hormone, they can also carry out distinct functions. These variations can be attributed to the fact that most of the structural domains shared by ERs exhibit a low level of homology, especially at the AF-1 domain. Consequently, the majority of the post-translational modifications sites (PTMs) on ERs are not shared between both isoforms. In fact, ligand-induced and ligand-independent activities of ERs are critically influenced by PTMs. PTMs controls the multiple aspects of ER-dependent activation by modulating ERs ligand binding, specificity, cellular localization, dimerization, interaction with their cognate DNA response element, combinatory recruitment of transcriptional coregulators, stability and transcriptional arrest. Hence, by their discrepancies, ERs will be differently influenced by the cellular environment. Furthermore, as the deregulation of different signalling pathway in cancers is associated with ER-dependant tumour progression and in the acquisition of a therapeutic resistant phenotype, it is crucial to understand the how PTMs affect ERs transactivation in order to eventually propose and/or develop adequate treatment. The results presented in this thesis were carried out with the objective of gaining a better understanding of PTM’s roles on ERβ transcriptional control which, as opposed to ERα, remain unclear.        We demonstrate here a dynamic regulation of ERβ by phosphorylation, ubiquitination and sumoylation. Furthermore, as all the newly identified PTM are located within de AF-1 domain of ERβ, our results highlight the key role of this domain in the regulation of ligand-dependent and independent transcriptional properties of this receptor. The first study shows that in response to MAPK, specific serine residues in the AF-1 of ERβ are phosphorylated and play an important role in the regulation of ERβ ligand-independent activity by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. In fact, the activation-degradation cycle of ERβ induced by MAPK is regulated upon phosphorylation of these serines coordinating ERβ ubiquitination, subnuclear mobility and stability by promoting the recruitment of the ubiquitin ligase E6-AP. Moreover, this molecular process plays part in the differential regulation of ERα and ERβ activity upon proteasome inhibition. In the second paper, we demonstrate that ERβ activity and stability in presence of estrogen is closely regulated by the phosphorylation-dependent sumoylation of the AF-1 domain, amplified by GSK-3 action. SUMO-1 attachment prevents ERβ degradation by competing with ubiquitin at the same acceptor site and dictates ERβ transcriptional inhibition, as opposed to ERα, by altering estrogen-responsive target promoter occupancy and gene expression in breast cancer cells. Furthermore, these findings uncover a novel phosphorylated sumoylation motif (pSuM) and offer a valuable tool to predict novel SUMO substrates under protein kinase regulation. In combination to our better understanding on how intracellular signals controls ERβ transcriptional activity, our results highlight the significant role of PTMs in ERs isoforms discrepancies and allows supplementary comprehension of their respective physiopathologicals roles.

des lesbiennes d’origine libanaise à Montréal"	The main objective of this thesis is to better understand how gays and lesbians of Lebanese background (primo-migrants or their descents) living in Montreal articulate and negotiate their ethno-sexual identifications through the mobilization of diverse capitals (economical, social, cultural and symbolic). Based on seven semi-directed interviews with five lesbians and two gays of Lebanese origin, this research examines, with an intersectional approach, the ways in which their identitary discourses are structured by social axes of division such as class, gender, sexualities, ethnicity, age, etc., on which they occupy majority and minority positions. The stories of our participants reveal, among other things, that there are different ways of representing oneself and being homosexual, and that individuals sharing non-normative sexualities do not necessarily inscribe themselves in the «global gay discourse». Chapters 1 to 3 are devoted to a theoretical and practical contextualization of the research. Chapter 4 consists of an analysis of the ethno-sexual subjectivities of the informants.	intersectionality , identifications/identities , homosexualities , gays and lesbians , Lebanese , ethnicity	en	6257.0
1302	Étude observationnelle de la collision des vents dans les systèmes Wolf-Rayet+O	We present the results from three month-long observational campaigns related to WR+O colliding-wind binaries. This work focuses on southern-hemisphere systems that have not yet been previously studied in this context. To this we add the northern archetype colliding-wind system WR 140 (WC7pd + O5.5fc), which recently suffered another active periastron passage in 2009 January. The first two (spectroscopic) campaigns allowed us to update the orbital elements and to constrain the geometry of the colliding wind region and other fundamental parameters, for 6 binary systems: WR 12 (WN8h), WR 21 (WN5o+O7V), WR 30 (WC6+O7.5V), WR 31 (WN4o+O8), WR 47 (WN6o+O5) and WR 140. A short non-orbital (probably rotational) period was also detected in the WR component of one of our objects, WR 69 (WC9d+OB), with a much longer orbital period. The third (photometric) campaign revealed a surprisingly low level of variability in our sample of 20 WC8/9 stars. This supports the idea that pulsations are not very frequent in this type of star and are unlikely to be the main mechanism for dust formation, suggesting, by default, a predominant role of wind-wind collision.

1303	Between truth and traume : the work of art and memory in Adorno	Analyzing the dialectical processes through which art works through the past, Between Truth and Trauma: The Work of Art and Memory in Adorno examines Adorno’s concept of memory. I argue that, for Adorno, the work of art both has and is a Zeitkern (temporal nucleus). I demonstrate that the reciprocal immanence of history in the work and immanence of the work in history allows for the past to be worked through. The first chapter examines how the past is preserved and negated by the work of art. The second chapter examines how the past is transcended through the work of art via the interpretive process. The final chapter looks at Adorno’s reading of work by Beckett and Brecht in order to illustrate the ability of the work of art to navigate between truth and trauma.

1305	MAST3 : facteur de risque génétique aux maladies inflammatoires de l’intestin et modulateur d’inflammation	Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) refer to different chronic inflammatory diseases of the digestive tract mainly Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Mechanisms leading to the pathogenesis of IBD are not completely understood, but genetic and functional studies have highlighted interactions between genetic predispositions and environmental factors, such as the intestinal microbiota, as contributors to the deregulation of the immune response that leads to inflammation of the intestinal mucosa. Genome-wide and targeted association studies have identified several IBD susceptibility genes. However, estimations of the contribution of these genes to heritability of the disease suggest that more are to be discovered. Some of these genes may be in previously identified IBD linkage regions. The objective of my doctoral project was first, to identify risk factors in the 19p chromosomal region (IBD6), previously identified following a genome-wide linkage study, then to characterise them functionally.    We first performed a comprehensive association mapping study of the 19p region. Our two-stage genotyping strategy led to the identification of one intronic SNP and four coding SNP –including one non-synonymous SNP, rs8108738 – all located in the microtubule associated serine threonine kinase gene 3 (MAST3) and associated to IBD. Very limited functional information on MAST3 was available at that time. However MAST2 (a gene in the same family as MAST3), is involved in the regulation of inflammation master switch, transcription factor NF-B. We confirmed the involvement of MAST3 in the modulation of NF-B via a knockdown of MAST3 and gene reporter assays. In order to further characterize the function of MAST3, we chose a non-targeted approach to study the effects of the modulation of MAST3 levels on the cell. More specifically, we created a 1st cell model of MAST3 overexpression in HEK293 cells and analysed the resulting genome-wide endogenous gene expression. Validation in a 2nd cell model consisting of a knockdown of MAST3 in THP1 cells, allowed to identify non-specific gene expression due to non-physiological MAST3 levels. Our expression study led to the identification of a group of genes whose expression is modulated by MAST3. These genes are mainly involved in immune functions (pro-inflammatory cytokines, NF-B regulation, cellular migration, etc) and a majority is regulated by transcription factor NF-B. We evaluated the importance of this MAST3-regulated gene set in the clinical manifestation of IBD through an expression study on biopsies of UC patients. We found that the expression the MAST3-regulated gene set was significantly enriched in inflamed region of the intestinal mucosa of UC patients compared to healthy region. Taken together, the results of our study suggest that IBD risk factor MAST3 acts on the NF-B pathway to influence the expression of a group of genes involved in intestinal inflammation typical of IBD.  Every genetic study on IBD has the potential to lead functional research towards new causal biological pathways. The unravelling of the molecular mechanisms underlying these pathways aims to improve the comprehension of the pathogenesis of IBD and hopefully will allow for optimization of diagnostic and treatment of these diseases.	chromosome 19p , MAST3 , inflammation , Inflammatory bowel diseases , genetic susceptibility , genome-wide expression	en	6197.0
1306	Les liens sociaux entre les dépendants et le maître/patron dans la Correspondance de Cicéron	This paper will answer these questions: What were the social relationships between Roman masters/ingenui and slaves/freedmen? Were these relationships more often between ingenui and freedmen than ingenui and slaves? Did these relationships influence positively the slaves’ manumission in Cicero’s Letters? This paper will index and analyse the social relationships between ingenui and slaves/freedmen in the Letters. By social relationships, are meant friendships, marriage ties, sexual relations, masters’ and patrons’ estimation of their slaves/freedmen behaviours. Some pages will be devoted to the slaves and freedmen not mentioned in the Letters to explain this absence in the context of Rome in the last century BC. The study of social relationships between slaves/freedmen and masters, patrons and ingenui, in a social approach rather than a purely legal one, permitted the conclusion that friendships and affection often existed between slaves/freedmen and their masters/patrons or other ingenui of the Letters. In addition, this study proves that friendships and affectionate ties were more numerous and lasting between ingenui and freedmen than between ingenui and slaves. Accordingly, I defend the importance of friendships and affections ties in the manumission’s strategies of certain slaves.	slavery , slave , Cicero , Social Relationships , marriage , Friendships , Freedman , Manumission , Mariage	en	6164.0
1307	Les déficits cognitifs peuvent-ils aider à distinguer un trouble psychotique avec toxicomanie d’une psychose induite par consommation de méthamphétamines?	Introduction - Dissociating a primary psychotic disorder (PPD) with concurrent substance use from substance-induced psychosis (SIP) can be a difficult task since several symptoms are similar. The dichotomy between negative and positive symptoms in schizophrenia has been hypothesized as a predictor, as the former is not typically a feature of a dual disorder (Potvin, Sepehry, & Stip, 2006). Objective - This study explored the possibility of distinguishing subgroups within our sample using cognitive functioning to further identify factors that could help the differential diagnosis between a PPD co-occurring with substance-use and a methamphetamine (MA) induced psychosis. The hypothesis stipulates that individuals with a PPD should present with different cognitive deficits compared to individuals with SIP. Methods - This study used the data collected as part of a longitudinal study (the MAPS project) that took place in Vancouver BC, Canada. 172 individuals presenting with psychosis and MA abuse were recruited. Substance use, symptoms severity and cognitive deficits were assessed. Results - Cluster analyses revealed two profiles: individuals in Cluster 1 had a poorer performance on the Gambling task net score (M=-28,1) as well as on the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test - Revised (HVLT-R; M=63) % of retention score compared to those in Cluster 2. Individuals in Cluster 1 also had more negative symptoms than individuals in Cluster 2, t=2,29, p<0.05 and were more likely to have had a psychiatric diagnosis, X2(3) = 16.26, p< 0.001. Conclusion - Results suggest that cognitive predictors might help identify PPD that co-occur with MA abuse.	Cognition , Dual-disorder , Schizophrenia , Methamphetamine-induced psychosis	en	6160.0
1308	Examen des liens entre les comportements de soutien affectif maternel et les profils d'apprentissage en contexte de prise de décisions affectives chez les enfants de 48 mois	Research suggests that the quality of mother-child interactions play a role in the development of executive functioning (EF) during the preschool years. Most studies have examined cool EF, which represent general decision-making abilities during problem solving activities. The present study is concerned with hot EF, which is typically elicited by problem solving situations that require emotional regulation. Hot EF plays a role in affective decision-making (ADM). Prior research on ADM has examined its relation to sex, age, and neurological factors. Studies have not examined whether mother-child interactions play a role in the development of ADM ability. Thus, the importance of proximal environmental factors such as maternal responsiveness remains to be examined. The present study first examines the main effect of the quality of maternal responsiveness on the ADM ability. Second, the effect of sex and the interaction between the quality of maternal responsiveness and learning profiles of 48-month-old children were examined. Finally, this study also examines whether there were differences between the maternal responsiveness of children who abandoned the ADM test and those who completed the task. A subsample of 191 children (109 girls and 82 boys) and their mothers participated in a lab visit as part of the Pilot-Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child Development (P-QLSCD, Quebec Health, 1997).  Children completed several activities both individually and with their mothers. ADM was evaluated using the Children’s Gambling Task (CGT, Kerr & Zelazo, 2001). Maternal responsiveness was assessed using the MacArthur Story-Stem Battery (MSSB , Bretherton, Oppenheim, Buchsbaum, Emde & the MacArthur Narrative Group, 1990) and the Affective climate coding scheme (Boutin, Parent, et Lapalme-L’Heureux, 1998). Results revealed no significant principal effect between the quality of maternal responsiveness and ADM ability but a significant interaction between the quality of maternal responsiveness and child learning profiles. However, this interaction was only significant for boys. Boys who received medium to high levels of responsiveness showed better learning profiles during hot EF tasks than those who received low levels of responsiveness. In addition, children who abandoned the experiment (N=26) received lower scores on maternal responsiveness than those who completed the task. The present results suggest that high quality mother-child interactions are important for the development of cognitive processing in emotional contexts.

1309	Characterization of the unfolding of a weak focus and modulus of analytic classification	The thesis gives a geometric description for the germ of the singular holomorphic foliation associated with the complexification of a germ of generic analytic family unfolding a real analytic vector field with a weak focus at the origin. We show that two such germs of families are orbitally analytically equivalent if and only if the germs of families of diffeomorphisms unfolding the complexified Poincaré map of the singularities are conjugate by a real analytic conjugacy. The Z2-equivariance of the family of real vector fields in R^4 is called the “real character” of the system. It is expressed by the invariance of the real plane under the flow of the system which, in turn, carries the real asymptotic expansion of the Poincaré map when the parameter is real. After blowing up the singularity, the pullback of the real plane by the standard monoidal map intersects the foliation in a real Möbius strip.  The blow up technique allows to “realize” a germ of generic family unfolding a germ of diffeomorphism of codimension one and multiplier −1 at the origin as the semi-monodromy of a generic family unfolding an order one weak focus. In order to study the orbit space of the Poincaré map, we perform a trade-off between geometry and dynamics under the Glutsyuk point of view (where the dynamics is linearizable near the singular points): in the resulting “unwrapping coordinate” the dynamics becomes much simpler, but the price we pay is that the local geometry of the ambient complex plane turns into a much more involved Riemann surface. Over the latter, two notions of translations are defined. After taking the quotient by the lifted dynamics we get the orbit space, which turns out to be the union of three complex tori and the singular points (this space is non- Hausdorff). The Glutsyuk invariant is then defined over annular-like regions on the tori. The translations, the real character and the fact that the Poincaré map is the square of the semi-monodromy map, relate the different components of the Glutsyuk modulus. That property yields only one independent component of the Glutsyuk invariant.

1310	Architecture et mission pédagogique : regards sur le campus de l'Université de Montréal et de l'école des HEC à l'ère d'une société de la connaissance	In the era of the knowledge society characterized by the importance of constant innovation, various dimensions of social life are going through notable renewals. The New Technologies of Information and Communication (NTIC) are offering a large panel of new possibilities that affects the traditional mode of operating of various institutions. In this context, Universities become fundamental actor, by contributing to the high education of the population through their activities of teaching and research. It seems that the traditional mission of universities is going through major changes. Lots of new possibilities permit by the NTIC affects the traditional way of teaching and doing research and we also talk about new kind of unprecedented relations between universities, state and the industry. We offer to explore the impact of all these changes on the physical development of universities through a look at a case study of the campus of Université de Montréal and the business school of HEC Montreal. Our work discuss about the influence of these changes in the physical organization of the university, more specifically on the architecture of the buildings. Through a look at the project of construction of a new campus situated at Outremont, we have attended to study actual tendencies and concerns about university buildings. We then attended to analyse the impacts of these developments on the organisation of universities buildings through a study of the architectural features of the new school of HEC Montréal.

1311	Vers une intégration écologique des technologies de l’information et de la communication en éducation en Afrique du Centre et de l’Ouest : une approche culturelle	In an increasingly interconnected world, developing countries need to be active participants in the information society. Contact between different cultures is on the rise; cultural resources have become consumer resources; and cultural minorities across the globe who have integrated information and communications technology (ICT) into their societies risk domination by the cultures of developed countries on the global communication networks. In order for a culture to stand its ground online, it is essential that its educational institutions train learners in their own cultural context, and promote and encourage the development and use of endogenous educational content. It is from this perspective that this qualitative study seeks, as a first objective, to assess the cultural content being accessed and distributed via ICT in schools of developing African countries; as a second objective, to describe existing barriers to an integration of ICT that would encourage online cultural promotion in these schools; and finally as a third and final objective, to identify practical strategies for an ecological ICT integration in these schools. Such an integration would be sustainable, adapted to local contexts, and foster the full participation of its teachers and students. To achieve these objectives, we have used a multi-case study based on interviews with 168 teachers and 230 students from 34 pioneer ICT schools located in five West and Central African countries; which content was analyzed according to each specific objective. Adopting the strategies described in our results would allow these schools to overcome some of the barriers they are facing, and to favour the ecological integration of ICT necessary for developing a more equitable information society, thus reducing the digital divide between the ‘information haves and have-nots’.	culture , TIC , ICT , education , Africa , digital divide	en	6071.0
1312	"Chanter le développement au Burkina Faso :
ethnographie de la rencontre entre deux champs d'action"	In the urban context of Burkina Faso, music and songs with a message for social education have become an intersection for traditionnal social practice, news cultural economies and participative development programs. This practice responds to specific local and international issues. As a common resource of social and artistic communication, music represents a strategic resource for musicians and local associations. For the former, we can discuss the role of the musician in contemporary society, between impoverisation and globalization. For the latter, music and songs with a message for social education are an innovative approach of Information, Éducation et Communication pour la santé (IEC/santé) and Communication pour le Changement de Comportement (CCC). In this research, we present the diverse levels of collaboration between musicians artist and local associations working in the healthcare sector in Burkina Faso. The ethnography presents the particular sphere of each group and analyzes the social negociations that results from their encounter. The research question proposed here falls between cultural studies and the study of social change. Hence, the chain of creation-production-diffusion commoditization allows us to study the history of complex concepts such as culture and developpement in a particular setting in Frenchspeaking West Africa.

1313	La logique et les logiques : la question du pluralisme	Starting from the seminal work of Boole, Frege and Russell, the dissertation seeks to clarify the issue of logical pluralism in the era of the proliferation of non-classical logics and the developments in theoretical computer science and proof theory. Two “historical” chapters are scheduled: the first chapter articulate the absolutism of Frege and Russell, taking care to show how it condemns the possibility to consider alternative structures and logics; the fourth chapter describes the path that led Carnap from the adoption of the syntactic method to the formulation of the principle of tolerance, then goes on to display Carnap‟s instrumentalism in philosophy of Logic and mathematics. Opening with the analysis of an intuitive interpretation of linear logic, the second chapter then turns to the establishment of a form of logico-mathematical pluralism with the help of order theory and category theory. The third chapter delineates the playground of revisionism (philosophical positions surrounding the debate between monism and pluralism) and then provides an argument against the thesis that denies the reality of the conflict between rival logics, all this being done by adopting the substructural logic point of view. The fifth chapter shows that each of the three main approaches to the concept of logical consequence (model-theoretic, proof-theoretic and dialogical) supplies a framework sufficiently general to establish pluralism. In short, the dissertation is a defence of logical pluralism.

1314	L'utopie numérique : discours et réalités sur la numérisation des salles de cinéma illustrés par le cas de l'entreprise DigiScreen	"The goal of this thesis is to demonstrate the impossible realization of the ""myth of Hollywood digital disruption"" as described by Kira Kitsopanidou. This idea put simply suggests the enlargement of film diversity in theaters due to the advent of digital technology. This myth, which perpetuates the idea of Hollywood’s death, was carried by several texts (espacially thoses produced by mass media) and participate in what can be qualified, following Foucault, as a ""discursive formation"" revolving around technology. The first chapter will analyze the main differences between this utopic discourse and reality based on the socio-economic factors affecting the processes of innovation’s implementation, particulary thoses related to the movie theaters. Secondly, we will consider the realities that affect the implementation of digital technology in movie theaters. Advantagously, these also explain the slowness of this process, a situation that was interpreted by the discourse as a delay. The third chapter will illustrate the concepts discussed in the previous chapters, using as a case study the example of DigiScreen, a company that wanted to increase film diversity in movie theaters by providing theatre owners with digital equipment at discounted prices. DigiScreen in some ways encapsulates the hopes generated by the digital utopia. Finally, we will look at different cases which draw a portrait of the digitization of theatres in the early years of the twenty-first century."	distribution , DigiScreen , movie theatre , digital	en	6053.0
1315	Bases génétiques de la sténose valvulaire aortique calcifiée	Aortic valve stenosis (AVS) is a valvular heart disease caused by calcification leading to incomplete opening of the aortic valve. Calcification of valve leaflets associated with aging is the most common cause of AVS. AVS pathogenesis involves lipoprotein deposits, chronic inflammation and calcification of the aortic valve leaflets. Our study aims to identify genes associated with AVS in order to better understand its mechanisms and potentially identify new therapeutic targets.  We recruited 190 cases with AVS of different severity and 192 controls matched for age and sex. Then we conducted a candidate gene association study using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The candidate genes selected include: (1) those with polymorphisms putatively implicated in previous genetic association studies of AVS (APOB, APOE, ESR1, PTH  and VDR); (2) those with validated associations to inflammatory diseases (IL-10, TNFAIP3) or lipid metabolism (LDLR ,PCSK9) in genome-wide association studies and, (3) genes impliated in AVS pathogenesis from studies with animal models and thought to be involved in calcification (BMP2, CCR5, CTGF, LRP5, MXS2, WNT3); tissue remodeling (CTSS, MMP9) or lipid metabolism (SMPD1).  For the first two categories of genes, we tested the SNPs reported to be associated in the literature and, in the third category we used a tag-SNP approach which consists of selecting a subset of SNPs to capture variability in the target region. Finally, 81 SNPs in 18 genes were tested. We found a nominal association of BMP2 (OR=1.55, CI: 1.14 – 2.10, p=0.004) and LRP5 (OR=1.47, CI: 1.06 – 2.03, p=0.023) with presence of AVS after adjustment for coronary heart disease.  The genes BMP2 and LRP5, which are known to be involved in calcification based on animal models, are associated with AVS. The result of the current study should be validated in a larger independent cohort in the near future and then, it could also be extended to the study of other genes.

1316	Être motard : Hells Angels malgré tout	Regardless of the intense public focus, members of the Hells Angels organization in Quebec continue to be active in illegal markets. What does it means to be a Hells Angels and how has the organization remained resilient to law enforcement and internal conflicts in the criminal underworld? Although financial and organizational strengths help the members overcome difficulties, the main argument in this study places a focus on the Hells Angels reputation as the key element accounting for their continuity. I embrace Gambetta’s thesis (2009) which states that the persistence of belief in the immortality of the criminal group generates a self-fulfilling prophecy that renders the organization increasingly resilient. This thesis is extended to the Hells Angels context and applied to interviews conducted with bikers, non-biker inmates and staff members in Quebec penitentiaries. Findings support the main thesis in that the organization’s reputation for being dangerous offers that group an effective economic and symbolic value. However, there is a drawback of this reputation that has to be considered. The Hells Angels label in Quebec generates negative aspects for individuals who endorse it. It is interesting to understand the impact of such a labelling phenomenon, through different phases of their collective career.

1317	Complexes pinceurs de type POCOP de Nickel (II) : synthèse, caractérisation, réactivité et applications catalytiques	This thesis describes the synthesis, spectroscopic characterization and the catalytic activities of a new family of pincer complexes of Ni (II) starting from the ligand POCOPPh (P,C,P-2,6-{Ph2PO}2C6H4) for which very few nickel complexes have been reported previsouly. We discuss the influence of P-substituents on the spectroscopic, electrochemical and catalytic activities of these complexes. The synthesis of POCOPPh has been improved comparatively to the procedure reported in the literature by reducing the reaction time to 30 minutes and the temperature to room temperature. The complex (P,C,P-2,6-{Ph2PO}2C6H3)NiBr was obtained with 88% yield by reacting the precursor NiBr2(NCCH3)x with POCOPPh . This complex was then reacted with various silver and potassium salts to give the following complexes (POCOPPh)NiCN, (POCOPPh)NiOTf, (POCOPPh)NiOAc and (POCOPPh)NiONO2 (OTf = triflate et  OAc = acetate). The limited reactivity of the bromo derivative led us to use (POCOPPh)NiOTf for the preparation of some of the desired derivatives, such as (POCOPPh)NiCCPh. Attempts to prepare the desired alkyl derivatives (POCOPPh)NiR were not successful, but we were able to detect these derivatives using NMR. The thermal instability of (POCOPPh)NiR led to formation of new (POCOPPh)NiX complexes by halogen exchange with  MgX2 or (POCOPPh)NiOH by hydrolysis. The cationic species [(POCOPPh)NiNCR][OTf] (R = Me, CHCH2, CHCHMe, C(Me)CH2, NCCH2CH2N(Ph)H) also were obtained easily from the (POCOPPh)NiOTf with good yields.      All these complexes were characterized by elemental analysis, NMR spectroscopy (1H, 13C{1H} 31P{1H}, 19F{1H}), IR spectroscopy and UV-vis spectroscopy. For most  complexes analysis by X-ray diffraction allowed us to establish their solid state structures. A few studies by cyclic voltammetry have been done to determine the electronic density of the metal center and the P-substituent influence on this characteristic. In order to investigate the effect of phosphine substituents on the catalytic activities of this type of complexes, catalytic studies were undertaken with the following two complexes (POCOPPh)NiOTf and (POCOPi-Pr)NiOTf in hydroamination of activated olefins specifically acrylonitrile. After optimization of experimental conditions, it was found that both complexes have similar activities but what makes a huge difference is the use of additives. Indeed, (POCOPi-Pr)NiOTf showed good catalytic activity in the presence of triethylamine as base but this activity decreased significantly in the presence of water. The opposite was observed with (POCOPPh)NiOTf complex: it was  shown that triethylamine coordinates to the nickel center in this complex and hence reduces its activity in some cases. We Also explored other reactions such as the addition of the O-H bond in aromatic alcohols to acrylonitrile, and it was surprising that (POCOPPh)NiOTf is much more active than its homologous (POCOPi-Pr)-NiOTf. However aliphatic alcohols remain a major challenge for this kind of complex. Mechanistic studies suggest that this reaction passes through the following intermediates (POCOPPh)NiOAr and [(POCOPPh)NiOAr][HOAr]. These species were observed by NMR but not isolated.	nickel , pincer complex , POCOP , POCOP-type , catalyse , catalysis , hydroamination , hydroalcoxylation , hydroalkoxylation , cyclic voltammetry , alcoholysis , X-ray diffraction , GC-MS , NMR	en	6033.0
1318	Étude empirique des commentaires et application des techniques de résumé par extraction pour la redocumentation	Programs documentation is very useful to programmers during maintenance tasks, especially for program comprehension. However, the documentation is not always available or it may be badly written. In such cases, redocumentation becomes so necessary.      In this work, we propose a redocumentation technique that consists in generating comments by using extraction  summary techniques.      For this purpose, we conducted an empirical study to analyze the quantitave and qualitative aspects of comments. Particularly, we were interested in studying comment distribution over different types of construct and studying the frequency of documentation for each construct type. We propose a comment taxonomy to classify them according to their content and quality.      Given the results of the empirical study, we decided to summarize Java classes by extracting the comments of methods and constructors. We defined several heuristics in order to determine the most relevant comments to be extracted. After that, we applied these heuristics to Java classes from three projects in order to generate summaries. Finally, we compared the generated summaries (generated comments) to the reference ones (original comments) by using the metric ROUGE.

1319	Prédiction de l'attrition en date de renouvellement en assurance automobile avec processus gaussiens	The field of auto insurance is working by cycles with phases of profitability and other of non-profitability. In the phases of non-profitability, insurance companies generally have the reflex to increase the cost of premiums in an attempt to reduce losses. For cons, very large increases may have the effect of massive attrition of the customers. A too high attrition rate could have a negative effect on long-term profitability of the company. Proper management of rate increases thus appears crucial to an insurance company. This thesis aims to build a simulation tool to predict the content of the insurance portfolio held by an insurer based on the rate change proposed to each insured. A proce- dure using univariate Gaussian Processes regression is developed. This procedure offers a superior performance than the logistic regression model typically used to perform such tasks.	attrition , data mining , gaussian process , churn , automobile insurance	en	5982.0
1320	Écrire la théorie littéraire : l'œuvre littéraire de John Cage et la révision du commentaire critique	The following text, despite its onomastic labelling (the name “John Cage”), its disciplinary orientation (“literary theory”), and its thematic aim (“the revision of the literary commentary”), positions itself as a writing and creative venture. It starts by stating the strict identity of texts and metatexts, in other words, of the quoted, analyzed voice, with the quoting, analyzing other voice. This premise derives from a specific confrontation: the specificities and idiosyncrasies of John Cage’s literary production since the late 1940s (the literary scores from the anthologies Silence and A Year from Monday, the mesostics from M and X, the rewritings and “Writing through’s” from Empty Words…). Indeed, the examination by literary theory of a body of work as disseminated and “neological” as John Cage’s encourages the literary critic or theoretician to ask the question of his own writing (“self-reflexivity”) and also to make possible an original artistic realization (“performativity”). It is therefore through the possibilities of a language and of a subjectivity at work that the (textual) theorization of texts tries herein to elucidate and to write itself.    This work starts by setting up the modalities both circular and circulatory of literary theory—a rhetorical and epistemological tension that will be identified as the “self-reflexive aporia” (the theoretical text is primarily concerned by the question of itself). It then tries to analyze the novelty of Cage’s literary work, using a dialectical and antagonistic configuration: on one hand, an “objective textuality”, original and orthographical; on the other hand, a “subjective textuality”, disseminating and intertextual, anarchic and unrestrained. Finally, this text proposes the revision, recomposition and “rewriting” of the critical commentary on the basis of a new self-reflexive and performative textology. That is: a sort of undiscipline in  writing that knowingly manoeuvres the linguistic coordinates of its elocution (neology, typographism, quotation processes…) and that does not try to conceal or repress the intertextual, contextual, heterogenous and disparate personality of its author. Through a sort of “textual exemplarity” (Cage), this work insists on a synthesis both productive and expressive between the voices analyzing and the voices being analyzed. We will see accordingly that this proposition implies, from time to time, that the text be marginalized.

1321	Les marques du diable et les signes de l'Autre : rhétorique du dire démonologique à la fin de la Renaissance	How did the motive of the Devil's Mark wend its way through the theological, legal and medical discourse at the end of the Renaissance to such a point that it became a critical component of the crime of witchcraft? Through what mechanisms and what belief systems did this idea of the Devil's Mark become so widely disseminated and greatly accepted among both the scholars and the general public? In a period marked by the Great Witch Hunt, as well as the development of scientific investigation, the fact that the scholars are interested in this strange semiotics is a very interesting starting point to address head-on the shift in boundaries that demonology brought about within these different fields of knowledge. The purpose of this thesis is to study the network of the epistemological mutations that shaped how the Devil's Mark emerged in French demonological knowledge between the end of the 16th century and the beginning of the 17th century. We will review how diabolical otherness gradually became internalized in the individuals' heart and soul under the increasingly powerful influence of empiricism, experimental method, and observation. We will analyze the rhetorical construction surrounding the Devil's Mark theory and relate it to the changes that took place in the intellectual platform of the Ancien Régime in order to shed light on the new classification that appeared between natural and supernatural facts, as well as on the rhetorical strategies used to report on them.

1322	Modèle novateur de conception d’interface humain-ordinateur centrée sur l’utilisateur : le designer en tant que médiateur	In complex design projects, problems typically arise when the design process is undertaken by multi-disciplinary groups of experts as well as non-experts because they do not share a common vision about the user’s needs, do not have identical goals related to the task, and do not have a common language to have productive dialogues as the design process progresses.   This research addressed issues related to the human-centered design approach within the context of human-computer interfaces (HCI). It explored ways in which a designer can create conditions whereby various contributors involved in the design process can benefit from the potential that the multi-disciplinary context afford to enrich their personal knowledge and reflection and at the same time work efficiently and collaboratively to design an interface that is user centered.  The research used a mixed methodology. In the first instance, a project-grounded research (research through design) was used in three successive case studies with increasing degrees of intervention and control by the researcher. Project-grounded research involves the development of knowledge and theory related to the design activity in an authentic design project. The focus of the first case was for the designer/researcher to observe her role and interaction with others during the design process. In the second case, the focus shifted to the collaborative interactions. The design process was used as a method to foster consensus building and the adoption of a common language to communicate and mutual goals to aim for. Limitations identified in these two cases led to the design of an intervention that was implemented in the third case. This intervention comprised an intensive workshop whereby team members engaged in an interdisciplinary attitude building exercise leading to joint-reflective practice toward achieving the goal which was to create a website. Data generated from these three cases informed the development of a theoretical model that represents steps of “optimal” collaborative design process, focusing on user-centeredness. In this model, the designer is attributed the additional and central role of mediator (designer as mediator) that facilitates the convergence of disparate foci and ways of thinking.  In the second instance, the model was presented to three design experts individually for validation purposes. Interview data collected from this process affirmed the validity of the concepts and relations depicted in the model as well as its transferability potential to other complex contexts. The proposed model has the promise of structuring design activities to unfold in a more efficient and timely manner while being sustainable.

1323	La enseñanza del español a adultos mayores en Quebec : experiencia de talleres prácticos	The demographic growth of the senior population in the last third of the XX century, and their desire to choose a productive retirement which allows them to reinvent themselves in this new stage of their life, have resulted in changes in the environment in the classroom of formal and informal educational institutions in Quebec. Today’s seniors return to school with very different objectives from the time they were teenagers or university students, when education was connected to career goals and social advancement. They want to return for personal growth through life-long learning. Actually, as our population ages, Third Age Education has become increasingly important along with the area of Gerontagogy (branch of Gerontology) which addresses the learning needs of seniors. In addition, the role of the Universities of Third Age and other institutions such the Elder Hostels and Community Centers dedicated to seniors becomes more important. In this context, and based on our own experience as an instructor of Spanish workshops at a university in the province of Quebec, we introduce some of the methodologies and strategies applied in our courses of Spanish foreign language (ELE). These methodologies and strategies are summarized in our teacher diary. The teacher diary will help us to observe the level of effectiveness of these strategies in conversation workshops, which in turn, will allow for the creation of our own methodological approach. Hopefully this will help other Spanish teachers of seniors.	Seniors , Second language acquisition , Spanish foreign language , Conversation workshops , University of Third Age	en	5963.0
1324	Cioran ou le mal de foi : les vestiges du sacré dans l'écriture	The secularization process characteristic of 20th century Western thought has wrought profound change in our modern view of the sacred. Indeed, The disintegration of traditional representations of the sacred has left a mainly existential and spiritual void where, previously, certain contents of these representations allowed one to find a personal space in relation to, and within, the Universal – in other words, to find one’s place in the world and its organizing institutions – and to invest such a space with shared, accepted and understood meaning. However, this decaying process is not without producing a residual which literature can gather: vestiges of a sacred in transformation – a sacred which also remains the object of a search. Cioran’s writing is exemplary in this respect. Not only is it a depository for the remains of the sacred, it is also the tool or the medium, the striving path of its pursuit. His torn writing, ridden with existential angst and profound doubt, bears witness to a refusal – presented as an inability – to subscribe to outdated traditional representations of the sacred. Neither completely philosophical nor literary, thereby generally considered unclassifiable by scholars, Cioran’s oeuvre brings attention to the importance of literature as a modality of the mind. Cioran’s oeuvre brings to light literature’s role within thought as a space where a search for a sacred that lies beyond its traditional framework might manifest itself, but also as a means of undertaking a freer, more personal, search for the sacred. Literature thus becomes as much a receptacle as a means of a wholly existential quest that is neither represented nor confessed, but acted out. The “I” found throughout Cioran’s works is not the “I” of a confession, but the “I” of a narrative, which is not to say it is the “I” of the author. It is precisely in the gap created by dramatization that arises the paradox inherent to the particular knowledge literature conveys: the personal, incarnate, particular character of this knowledge becomes the vehicle for a universal experience which has the power or potential of harboring the reader’s personal experience as he performs – or acts out, #! as it were – the text for himself. In this sense, reading and writing are intertwined – are two sides of a single reality – in this quest for a sacred that comes forth, in Cioran’s thought, in this space of exception, outside of institutions. Taking as its starting point the exemplarity of Cioran’s oeuvre in these respects, this thesis proposes a reflection on literature as a mode of inscription of what remains of the sacred, as well as a manifestation and a means of a yearning or a quest for the sacred unhindered by institutional boundaries. It aims thereby to shed light on the type of knowledge peculiar to literature by taking into account the literary dramatization that takes place in the context of this search.

1325	Caractérisation structurale et fonctionnelle des interactions impliquant TFIIH et la machinerie de réparation de l’ADN	The nucleotide excision repair pathway (NER) is a mechanism capable of removing a wide variety of helix-distorting lesions, such as those caused by ultraviolet irradiation (UV). As all DNA repair pathways, NER contributes to the prevention of carcinogenesis by preventing DNA mutation. During this process, the lesion is first recognized by the protein XPC/Rad4 (human/yeast), which then recruits TFIIH. This complex unwinds the DNA with its helicase activity and then recruits the endonuclease XPG/Rad2 and other proteins necessary for DNA excision. Upon arrival at the lesion site, XPG/Rad2 displaces XPC/Rad4. TFIIH also acts in DNA transcription, using its helicase activity. In addition to the similarity of the presence of TFIIH in transcription and DNA repair, it is possible to ask ourselves how the two pathways are similar. We were interested in the interactions involving TFIIH and the DNA repair machinery. We have therefore undertaken a structural and functional characterization of these interactions. We have found that Rad2 and Rad4 have a motif of interaction based on other interactions of the Tfb1 subunit of TFIIH. Using isothermal titration calorimetry, we found that segments of these two proteins containing this motif interact with high affinity to the PH domain of Tfb1. The binding site of these segments is very similar to Tfb1PH binding site of transactivation domain of p53  and the carboxyl-terminal domain of TFIIEα with Tfb1PH, as demonstrated by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). In addition, these segments can compete with each other for binding to Tfb1PH. We also demonstrated in vivo that deletion of Tfb1PH in yeast creates a sensitivity to UV irradiation. In addition, the deletion of multiple segments of Rad2 and Rad4, including segments of interaction Tfb1PH, is required to observe a sensitivity to UV. Thus, multiple interactions are involved in the binding of TFIIH to Rad2 and Rad4. Finally, the structures of the Rad2-Tfb1PH and Rad4-Tfb1PH complexes were solved by NMR. These structures are identical to each other and involve hydrophobic residues interacting with shallow grooves on Tfb1PH. These structures are very similar to the structure of TFIIEα-p62PH.  These findings provide an important mechanistic link between transcription and DNA repair. In addition, they provide a model of the mechanism of the displacement of XPC/Rad4 by XPG/Rad2 at the damaged site. This knowledge helps to better understand the mechanisms of genomic stability and can lead to novel cancer therapies.

1326	Évaluation d’indices de comparaison pour la substitution des solvants en milieu de travail	Substitution is a primary preventive method which allows the elimination of hazards to workers at the source. One of the steps in substitution analysis is the comparison between options in order to choose the best alternative. Various comparison indices based on physicochemical, health and environmental parameters of substances may facilitate the choice. However, no evaluation of theses indices has been done in the case of solvent substitution. Development research was undertaken in order to propose an improved methodology for solvent substitution.  A systematic procedure of solvent substitution was applied to a real workplace case and the comparison between options was made using the Vapour Hazard Ratio (VHR). Three Overexposure Potential Indices (OPIs) (VHR, « Måleteknisk Arbejdshygiejnisk Luftbehov » (MAL) and SUBstitution FACtor (SUBFAC)) and three comprehensive hazard screening indices (air index (ψiair), Indiana Relative Chemical Hazard Score (IRCHS) and Final Hazard Score (FHS)) were evaluated and compared using a list of 56 and 67 solvents respectively. In the case of mixtures, the effect of nonideality on OPIs was also investigated by comparing 50 solvent mixtures. Quantitative property-property relationship (QPPR) models were developed for estimating Occupational Exposure Limits (OELs) for solvents without OELs. QPPR models were made from octanol:air, blood:air and metabolic constants using a list of 88 solvents.  The case study showed that the use of the VHR made comparison of replacement options easier, although it was limited by the absence of an OEL for a solvent. VHR and SUBFAC were shown to be close with excellent correlation between the two indices (R=0.99) but a worse correlation was calculated between MAL and VHR (R=0.75). This was attributed to the discrete nature of the volatility parameter in MAL. The impact of nonideality, evaluated by the calculation of activity coefficients on 50 solvent mixtures, resulted in ratios between corrected and non corrected VHRs varying between 0.57 and 2.7, suggesting that a safety factor of five could be used when comparing solvent mixtures. Correlation and sensitivity analysis showed that hazard screening indices differed in the way they integrate key substitution factors such as volatility, OEL, skin exposure, flammability, carcinogenicity and various environmental parameters. No index was found to be suitable for performing solvent substitution. Two QPPR modeling approaches were developed for computing OELs and VHRs; and 61 % and 87 % of the predicted VHRs were within a factor of two and five, respectively, of the calculated VHRs.  Our results lead us to propose an improved comparison procedure using a two-tier approach. In the first tier, a selection would eliminate solvent candidates having crucial health, safety and environmental impacts. In the second tier, the comparison would emphasize the VHR but also consider other parameters which are relevant to the specific context. Comparison would also take into account nonideality for mixtures and predicted OELs for solvents without such values.

1327	De l'aide au lien : des enfants adultes nous parlent de leurs parents âgés	This thesis studies elderly parents and the involvement of their adult children whenever help is needed. More precisely, the goal has been to understand the signification attributed, by the adult children, to what they consider to be a need of their parents. The study stands at the crossroads of three sociological fields: aging, family relationship and family solidarity, and care provided to the dependent elderly.   The process consisted in extracting from the children’s discourse, the diversity of significations attributed to the sense of need, on both parts. Also, the complex evolution of the bond between the elderly parents and their children will be questioned, for it is hard to clearly distinguish autonomy from dependence.   Three specific questions will be asked. Firstly, how do children perceive the autonomy of their parents? How do they express their point of view? Secondly, to what extent is the care brought to «autonomous» parents differing from that brought to parents with «decreasing autonomy»? Lastly, in what measure does residential proximity play a role; does it respond to a specific need and/or does it demonstrate a specific type of relationship?  The methodology employed in this study consisted in discourse analysis.  The results shed light on three elements. Firstly, the eminently subjective understandings of the notion of help/need, when having to care about elderly parents, especially when they are losing autonomy. Secondly, the great plasticity of the notion of parental autonomy, spoken or not, in the case that care need be offered to one's parents: more care is not necessarily brought to more dependent parents. Thirdly, the major implications of the double status of child and carer make it complicated to bring out the numerous motivations that intervene when a child decides to help.	relations familiales , Aging , family relationships , care , elderly parents , discourse analysis	en	5905.0
1328	A historical case study analysis of the establishment of charismatic leadership in a Protestant Reformation cultic group and its role in the recourse to violence	Research surrounding questions regarding cultic behaviors, leadership and issues of sectarian violence has lead to the study of charismatic leadership. Prominent cultic scholars have identified that there remains a rather large void in research when analyzing charismatic leadership within the context of sectarian groups and new religious movements. This thesis will attempt to bridge that gap through a historical case study analysis of a 16th century protestant reformation group, the Anabaptist Kingdom of Münster (AKM), under the influence of a charismatic leader, Jan van Leiden. More specifically, this research will focus on the various means utilized by the group’s leader, to establish charismatic leadership and how this affected the group’s recourse to acts of violence. The case material was obtained through two primary source accounts from participants in the events that unfolded in Münster during Leiden’s reign. The analysis of this material was made using three current theoretical concepts on cultic behavior and violence, that is Casoni (2000), Robbins (2002) and Dawson (2010). It appears that four major strategies were utilized by Jan van Leiden to establish his charismatic leadership over his followers: (1) the threat of millenarianism, (2) the exploitation of a bilateral parasitic relationship with his followers, (3) the use of religious ecstasy and prophecy, and (4) the use of their desire for social and religious change. By contrasting the results of the analyses undertaken in chapters three and four, three factors that have played a crucial role in Leiden’s charismatic leadership, as it relates to the recourse to violence in the AKM, will be identified. These are: (1) millennial violence, (2) shared identity, and (3) macro-level dimensions.

1329	Facteurs associés à l’implantation d’un programme de formation interprofessionnelle au sein d’un Centre de santé et de services sociaux au Québec	INTRODUCTION: Interprofessional collaboration emerged as one of the key aspects that have to be consolidated to improve the organization of primary care and to ensure an appropriate access to available resources. In order to increase interprofessional collaboration, it has been suggested that health sciences professionals should be trained in an interdisciplinary fashion, especially during clinical training.  OBJECTIVES: The aim of this research is to measure the degree of implementation of an initiative in interprofessional education (IPE) which takes place in the Health and social service centre (HSSC) studied, as compared to the initially proposed model. Furthermore, the objective of this research is to understand how systemic factors, organizational factors and the training program’s attributes influence the IPE initiative’s implementation. METHODS: This is a case study based on an HSSC located in the greater Montreal region in Quebec, Canada. Data was collected through 11 semi-structured interviews performed with professionals and administrators responsible for the IPE initiative’s implementation, together with one student who participated in the IPE initiative during his clinical training. An analysis of administrative and clinical documents regarding the IPE initiative’s implementation was also performed.  RESULTS: The implementation of the IPE initiative is still an ongoing process as it is showed by the medium-high presence of the different elements which define the IPE implementation and the generally low intensity of these elements. Systemic factors, organizational factors and the training program’s attributes influence the implementation of the IPE initiative in a clinical setting and there is an interaction between all of these factors. An analysis of the different factors influencing the implementation of an IPE initiative in a clinical setting should also consider the different factors influencing the development of collaborative practice in this environment.	étude qualitative , interprofessional education , implementation analysis , qualitative research , interprofessional collaboration , clinical setting	en	5893.0
1330	Évaluation d'un programme alternatif de formation de médecins généralistes en Gynécologie et Obstétrique au Sénégal	In order to reduce high level of maternal mortality rate estimated in 2005 at 401/100 000 live births, and following task shifting innovative strategies already initiated in the country to increase access to emergency obstetric care in Senegal, an alternative training program has been implemented for general medical doctors working in remote areas, to be effective obstetricians gynecologists.  Adapted from the normal curriculum, this program combines distance learning using new information and communication technology, practical training in university facilities, coaching and mentoring by university teachers in learners’ heath centers, on line evaluations and also formal annual evaluations such as the normal program. The program has been implemented in two districts in Senegal by Obstetrics and Gynecology Unit of Dakar University.  This midterm evaluation analyzes the program implementation and effects using case study with qualitative and quantitative data.  Results show a positive evolution of emergency obstetric care indicators compared with two control districts, an increased level of trainees’ knowledge and skills, and also satisfaction of trainees, trainers and beneficiaries. However, some weaknesses have been identified in the program implementation particularly regarding implementation of new training innovations, coordination and sustainability by Ministry of Health.

1331	Le Service à la famille de l'organisme Dans la rue : points de vue et expériences de jeunes qui y ont fait appel	Event though there has been an increased public and research interest in the street youth phenomenon in the past two decades, some aspects of their lives, one of them being parenthood, have not been yet thoroughly examined and therefore, remain unknown to a certain extent.  In order to gain a better understanding of street youth’s needs related to becoming a parent, as well as an understanding of the extent to which a service specifically tailored for such a population manages to satisfy their needs, this study had the purpose of describing and understanding the service utilization experience of the Service à la famille from the Montreal street youth agency Dans la rue.  More specifically, the objectives were to: gain an awareness and understanding of the persons and resources street youths who become parents turn to for help, and the significance of the Service à la famille among these resources; understand what brings a youth to the Service à la famille and what makes him or her use the services and activities offered; and finally, describe the perceptions and estimate the level of appreciation of the Service à la famille.  Semi-structured phone interviews were conducted with nine youths who had used the Service à la famille and had had a follow-up.  During the interview, the following themes were explored: help seeking related to becoming a parent, the utilization experience of the services and activities offered by the Service à la famille, the portrait of the service, and level of satisfaction regarding the service utilization experience.    At the time of the interview, all youths were parents of at least one child, and the majority had first sought help at the Service à la famille during pregnancy to satisfy different needs related to becoming a parent.   A variety of needs brought the youths to seek help at the Service à la famille.  These needs could be satisfied, but not necessarily at all times, through meetings with the staff and participation in group activities offered by the service.  At times, their needs corresponded to the explicit intervention goals of the service.  In general, the interviews suggest that youths have a positive perception of the Service à la famille, and more precisely, of the staff.  The interviewees named a considerable number of elements they appreciated from their service utilization experience.  Youths nevertheless perceive limitations in the ability of the Service à la famille to give help, especially budgetary constraints and the staff’s workload related to high demand of services.  Even though youths did not necessarily seek help from the service in order to prevent family violence or negligence, which is the mandate of the Service à la famille, much of them acknowledge having received valuable assistance in this regard on the part of the staff, especially when they reported having been in a violent intimate relationship.  They also recognize different ways through which the staff encouraged them to feel good and take care of themselves in order to do the same with their child or children.  All interviewees were satisfied with the follow-up they received from the Service à la famille and claimed they would recommend the service to others.  The intervention approach advocated by the service is considered to be a strong element in responding appropriately to youths’ needs.  This approach appears to have allowed youths who became parents to get the help they needed at a specific moment in time.  According to youths, an aspect of service utilization which could be improved is access to help; since the help interviewees needed was not always available when they asked for it.  Since youths perceive a lack of staff availability, they offer suggestions for improvement that would allow the aid supplied by the service to be more accessible to youths when they seek help.

1332	Facteurs contextuels influençant l’implantation d’un modèle de hiérarchisation des soins en santé mentale : une étude de cas en milieu montréalais	The purpose of the present study was to compare the care model of one Montreal local territory to the stepped-care model and to investigate factors influencing the implementation of this model. A qualitative case-study approach was employed involving 13 semi-structured interviews with services providers and managers from primary and specialist mental healthcare. Results showed that the hierarchical care model in place in this territory is compared in several points with the stepped-care model. However, some elements of these models have to be integrated to improve efficiency and quality of care, including the introduction of objective evaluation criteria and the specification of evidence-based interventions. Furthermore, some factors influenced the implementation of this hierarchical care model. Thus, the presence of collaborative working and learning strategies were identified to be a key condition. However, some elements must be considered to facilitate its success like the standardization of the referral criteria and process, the clarification of the mental health guichet d’accès (centralized access point) roles and the general practitioners' adherence to the care model. In conclusion, the use of the reference and analysis frames of this study may guide managers on issues to be considered to support the implementation of an evidence-based care model which may facilitate mental healthcare efficiency and its adequacy with the population needs.

"The purpose of this study is to determine whether air transport in Europe is a shared competence between European Union (EU) and the Member States, or whether it is an a field under the jurisdiction of the EU in this specific area. We will review the EU regulatory framework on air transport in Europe. Initially, we will focus on issues concerning aviation in general in Europe, such as the establishment of a single market for aviation and ""open skies"" agreements. Then, we will analyze the specific regulatory framework such as the environment, protection of air passengers, the security and safety."

1334	Des typologies mécaniques à l'expérience esthétique : fonctions et mutations du genre dans le jeu vidéo	This thesis provides an in-depth examination of the nature and application of the concept of genre for the video game. It is divided in three parts. Part one features an overview of genre theory in literature and film studies. The essential properties of genre as a concept are identified: it is an intuitive and “thumbnail” classification method, discursive rather than systemic in nature, and that owes its existence to a common cultural consensus rather than theoretical divisions. More importantly, the notions of tradition, innovation and hybridity are found to be central to genre.  In part two, these findings are applied to the case of video game genre. A few typologies are examined to show that authoritative classifications are impossible. A model of the development of genres is laid out, based on three modalities: imitation, reiteration and innovation. By studying the history of the first-person shooter, the traditional conception of genre being based on formal mechanics is replaced by a new definition centered on player experience.  Part three details experience as a theoretical concept and places it at the center of a new conception of genre, the pragmatics of generic effects. In this view, any object is a matrix of generic anchors bound to become generic effects, provided the player possesses the generic competences required to recognize them. This new approach is demonstrated through an examination of the survival-horror videogame genre. This case study showcases the potential of the pragmatics of generic effects for other fields, and provides a testimony for the recursion of the questions of genre between the video game, literature, and film.

1336	Optimisation du processus de développement du médicament grâce à la modélisation PK et les simulations d’études cliniques	Drug development is complex with results often differing from those anticipated or sought after.  Despite technological advances in the many fields which are a part of drug development, there are still many drugs that fail in the late stages of clinical development.  Indeed, the success rate of drugs reaching commercialization is declining.  Improvements to the conventional drug process are therefore required in order to facilitate development and allow new medications to be provided more rapidly to patients who require them.  The aim of this Ph.D. project was to explore and propose ways to improve this inefficient drug development process with the use of advanced modeling and clinical trial simulations. For the first part of this research, new algorithms available in ADAPT 5® were tested against other available algorithms in order to determine their potential strengths and weaknesses.  The two new algorithms tested were the iterative two-stage and the maximum likelihood expectation maximization (MLEM) methods.  Our results demonstrated that the MLEM algorithm was consistently better than the iterative two-stage algorithm.  It was also comparable with the first order conditional estimate method available in NONMEM®, with significantly fewer shrinkage issues in the estimation of the variances.  Therefore, these new tools were used for the clinical trial simulations performed during the course of this Ph.D. research. In order to calculate appropriate noncompartmental pharmacokinetic parameter estimates during the drug development process, it is essential that the terminal elimination half-life be well characterized.  Properly conducted and analyzed pharmacokinetic studies are essential to any drug development plan, and even more so for generic and supergeneric (a formulation similar to the reference product, containing the same active ingredient; however differing from the original reference product it its delivery process) submission where they often are the only pivotal studies that need to be done to decide if a drug product is good or not.  Thus, the purpose of the second part of the research was to determine if the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters obtained from a subject whose half-life is calculated from a sampling scheme duration that is considered too short could bias the bioequivalence conclusions of a study and if these parameters should be removed from statistical analyses.  Results demonstrated that subjects with a long half-life relative to the duration of the sampling scheme negatively influenced results when these were maintained in the analysis of variance.  Therefore, these subjects should be removed from the analyses and guidelines to this effect are required a priori.  Pivotal pharmacokinetic studies done within the drug development process should therefore follow this recommendation to make sure that the right decision be taken on a drug product formulation.  This information was utilized with the clinical trial simulations that were subsequently performed in this research in order to ensure the most accurate conclusions. Finally, clinical trial simulations were used to improve the development process of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug.  A supergeneric was being developed and results from a pilot study were promising.  However, some results from the pilot study required closer attention to determine if the test and reference compounds were indeed equivalent and if the test compound would meet the equivalence criteria of the different required pivotal studies.  Clinical trial simulations were therefore undertaken to address the multiple questions left unanswered by the pilot study and these suggested that the test compound would probably not meet the equivalence criteria.  In addition, these results helped determine what modifications to the test drug would be required to meet the equivalence criteria.  This research brought forward solutions to improve different aspects of the drug development process.  Notably, clinical trial simulations reduced the number of studies that would have been done for a supergeneric, decreased the number of subjects unnecessarily exposed to a drug, lowered costs and helped established new criteria for the exclusion of subjects from analyses. Research conducted during this Ph.D. provided concrete ways to improve the drug development process by evaluating some newly available tools for compartmental analyses, setting standards stipulating which estimated PK parameters should be excluded from certain PK analyses and illustrating how clinical trial simulations are useful to throughout the process.

1337	Traits psychopathiques et délinquance autorapportée chez des adolescents suivis en Centre jeunesse	This thesis is interested in personality traits associated with delinquent behavior. More specifically, it seeks to clarify the contribution of psychopathic personality traits assessed in adolescence to predict antisocials behaviors in early adulthood, when are also considered behavioral indices. It is part of a broader longitudinal study aimed at describing adolescents in the care of Quebec Youth Centres. For research purposes, a subgroup of young males has been selected; those with a conduct disorder or who have exhibited delinquent behaviors during adolescence. The purpose of such a selection was to identify young people who are most likely to have psychopathic traits, given the low prevalence of the disorder in the general population. Forty-eight teenagers have agreed to participate in the interview using the PCL-SV (Psychopathy Checklist Screening Version). A first shutter of the thesis validates, in Quebec, a French version of a measurement of psychopathy adapted for a use with teenagers, the PCL-SV. Results show indices of fidelity and validity satisfactory and comparable with what is brought back with other versions of the PCL used with teenagers and adults. They support the relevance of its use with teenagers. A second part of the dissertation verifies the contribution of psychopathic traits in adolescence to predict antisocial conduct in early adulthood. Results show that psychopathic traits, as measured by the PCL-SV, make a significant contribution above and beyond indices of delinquent behavior to predict self-reported antisocial conduct two years later. Finally, a last chapter explores a dimensional approach in the conceptualization of psychopathy, in terms of a general model of personality: the Five Factor Model (FFM). It seeks to determine its ability to distinguish youths with conduct disorders in terms of the severity of their delinquency. Results show that youths with a serious delinquency have a higher propensity to seek sensations than those whose delinquency is weak. Results highlight the importance of impulsivity as a characteristic element of a subgroup of youths with serious delinquency. The study supports the use of a general model of personality to capture features associated with psychopathy and to identify a hard core of delinquents. The entire project establishes the added-value of a measure of psychopathic traits in adolescence in predicting antisocial behavior. It highlights the importance of a component of impulsivity among youth involved in serious delinquency. This is one of the few longitudinal studies concerned with self-reported delinquency and psychopathy in terms of the facets of the FFM in adolescents. There is such heterogeneity among young offenders; a valid measure of psychopathy in adolescence will allow more specific types and a more reliable identification of young people likely to continue their criminal career into adulthood. Clinical implications of the findings and recommendations for future research are included in the conclusion of the thesis.

1338	Réfugiés climatiques : statut et traitement	Current works on the forced migration area does not reveal the magnitude of the philosophical  and moral issues raised by the appearance of climate refugees on the international scene . Yet it is urgent to provide protection to them through international agreements. Philosophers who have studied the subject have been misled by both the multiplicity of terms and the lack of definitions. This work criticizes the current trend set by environmental activists who want to include people with various issues under the term of refugee. Trivializing the term of refugee is not only misleading but also dangerous. Eventually, the activists will turn to the Geneva Convention to demand that displaced populations be treated as refugees. But the Geneva Convention is not an appropriate tool to address the plight of these people. Moreover, we can not extend the status of refugees to include those people without losing the credibility and efficiency. Following the path taken by activists would lead us to give equal treatment to climate refugees and political refugees, which is a mistake. Our hypothesis is that the inhabitants of small island countries, in contrast to other populations require a broadening of the Geneva Convention. We shall argue that we have duties and responsibilities to them that we do not have to political refugees. To defend this view, we must clearly define what a climate refugee is and justify this term. We must therefore confront the notion of climate refugee to other competing concepts. Once the terms are defined, we will consider the ethical issues through the prism of global justice issues.  We will see that it is not enough to refer to causal responsibility to determine the members who should address the plight of climate refugees. This will lead us to argue that although attractive, the polluter pays principle is not an appropriate tool to guide our reflection. We will also be led to question the relevance of a global environmental institution.	philosophy , climate refugees , global ethics , global justice , environmental refugees	en	5505.0
1339	La conception herméneutique du langage : pour une mise en dialogue des herméneutiques de Gadamer et Ricoeur	The aim of this thesis is to open a dialogue between the works of Hans-Georg Gadamer and Paul Ricœur in order to reveal the main characteristics of their hermeneutical conception of language and to underline its relevance. Our principal thesis is that it is imperative to go beyond the dichotomous readings of the two works by proposing a more dialectical one, which seems to be the only approach able to grasp the extent, richness and importance of the hermeneutical understanding of language. Thus, in this thesis, we will argue that, beyond their undeniable differences, valuable in themselves since there would be no dialogue without them, the hermeneutics of Gadamer and Ricœur are characterized by a reflection on our primordial belongingness to language, which represents the central focus of their hermeneutical conception of language. We will propose a confrontation of Gadamer’s and Ricœur’s philosophy based on the dialectics of belongingness and distanciation, which will enable us to take into account more objectifying approaches to language and combine them with  the lived experience of language on which hermeneutics puts the emphasis. Before putting this dialectic in motion, we have deemed it appropriate to recall the essential phenomenological heritage out of which Gadamer and Ricœur have developed their respective approaches to language. This basis will allow us to stress the fundamental agreement between the two hermeneuts concerning our irreducible belongingness to language. This accord doesn’t exclude the possibility of dialectically integrating an element of distance into this essential belongingness. On the contrary, it makes it necessary. In this regard, we will argue that it is precisely by virtue of this distanciation that, through a reflective movement, hermeneutical thinking can describe and make explicit our linguistic experience of the world. This hermeneutical reflection on language relies on three main models : those of dialogue, text and translation. We will establish how each of these models contributes to a better understanding of the life of language and our relation to meaning. This will lead us to consider the efforts of Gadamer and Ricœur to shed light on the creative power of language, as it emerges of their several works on metaphor, poetry and narrative. We will defend the thesis that this reflection on semantic innovation and the essential metaphoricity of language leads to an original conception of imagination. This thesis will focus finally on the Gadamerian and Ricœurian accounts of the connections between language and experience, where the ontological dimension of language will be a paramount concern. In this discussion, it will be important to insist on the idea, shared by the two philosophers, that we need to resist any hypostasis or absolutization of language and to think of our linguistic predicament as an opening on being and the possibility to say what is.

1340	Epithelial-Mesenchymal-Transition : a proposed mechanism in the development of Bronchiolitis Obliterans	For patients with end-stage lung disease, lung transplantation is their only hope for survival. Unfortunately, some of the lung transplant recipients (LTRs) might face obstacles following lung transplantation, one of which is chronic lung transplant rejection also known as bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) histologically and bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) clinically. The exact etiology behind BO development remains poorly understood. Speculations have suggested the involvement of epithelial cells in the airway remodeling process leading to airway obstruction. One of the proposed mechanisms is a transitional process, known as epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT). In this process epithelial cells lose their properties and acquire mesenchymal ones causing them to be more mobile and invasive which allow them to take part of the airway remodeling process in BO. Induction of EMT can be due to several factors such as inflammation, apoptosis. In our study we try to detect in vivo the presence of EMT in transbronchial biopsies (TBB) obtained from LTRs and associates it with their clinical conditions. We also try to manipulate and induce EMT in vitro in small airway epithelial cells (SAEC) using conditioned apoptotic (SSC4h) and non apoptotic (ZVAD) media produced from human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC) from lung. In addition, we worked on detecting possible mediators such as connective-tissue growth factor (CTGF), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), and perlecan in produced media.

1341	Cru ; suivi de Cruauté nécessaire :  le devoir d'une vérité autobiographique chez Guibert, Dustan et Rémès	A mix between a novel and a personal journal, Cru. is a cross-section between fiction and autobiography. The text, built around a type of writing that is dry and sometimes brutal, presents two gay characters in the « post AIDS » era, who are trying to figure out what it's like to be a man in a social context where contempt (towards others, as well as self-loathing) still exists. Perhaps even more than before, because this contempt is hidden under a false global acceptance.  In the end, Cru. raises questions about the definition of «  truth » in an autobiographical approach and the implication of cruelty in a literary piece that not only concerns the writer, but it's surrounding too.   Cruauté nécessaire : le devoir d'une vérité autobiographique chez Guibert, Dustan et Rémès is an essay that analyses the stakes at work in gay autobiographical writings of the 1990's, especially AIDS-related literature.  If one of the main aspects of autobiography is to disclose the truth, how can we not talk about cruelty when the writers are revealing things that concern not only themselves? If the whole process of autobiography  involves « healing », how can we not see the final product as « painful »?  It will be relevant to first define what we mean by « truth » and « cruelty » (also « good » and « evil »).  Regarding Good and Evil (le Bien et le Mal), Bataille and Nietzsche's writings will help us define two concepts that are, way too often, relative.  When confronting the three French writers that we are studying here – all HIV-positive when writing their texts –  with different theories on autobiography (Doubrovsky, Lejeune, Miraux), identity (Foucault, Schecter, Butler), obligation and responsibility (Donner, Brooks), we will seek to demonstrate that the cruelty used by Guibert, Dustan and Rémès is, in fact, essential to the autobiographical writing process.	autobiography , cruauté , cruelty , identity , France , XXe siècle , XXth century , Guibert , Dustan , Rémès , Wojnarowicz	en	5477.0
1342	Étude des annotations d’un enseignant à la suite de l’enseignement explicite des stratégies de résolution de problèmes mathématiques	The Programme de formation de l’école québécoise (PFEQ) places the student in the center of his learning. The teacher can facilitate the development of the student’s skills by offering a feedback that allows the student to progress in his learning. It is difficult for the teacher’s to make relevant and effective annotations in math, because the emphasis is placed on the concept that was worked on and not on the mathematical process. This is the reason why we decided to concentrate our research on the incidence the teacher’s annotations can have on the development of the student’s mathematical skills.  We opted for a qualitative and collaborative research to experiment an exchange with the teacher and live an inter influence between the practitioner and the researcher. The quality of the subjects was favoured. The teacher was chosen according to the sampling of exemplary case techniques and the students were chosen according to the intentional criteria sampling technique. The research lasted from november till may of the school year 2008-2009. Interviews with the teacher and mini interviews with the students at two moments of the research were used to collect data. We also consulted the corrected work placed in the pupil’s portfolios.  Our study highlights the contribution of strategic teaching of the mathematical approach. The results specify that methodological annotation was mostly used and aims at a better understanding of the student. Furthermore, this type allows the transfer from a situation to another and allows the student to obtain better results.	annotations , progression , Direct teaching , assessment , feedback , annotation , resolution mathematical problems , student and teacher learning , intervention , role of the student , role of the teacher	en	5428.0
1343	Evaluation of a novel transcortical pin-sleeve system in a calf model	Pin loosening is a common complication of transfixation pincasts (TP) in large animals, often necessitating premature removal before fracture healing. The excessive loads centered on the proximo-external and disto-internal cortices of the bone-pin interface cause osteolysis. Using a neonatal calf model, this project evaluated a novel pin-sleeve and ring cast system (PS) optimized to decrease peri-implant strain and evenly share stress at the bone-implant interface. It was hypothesized that PS would result in less peri-implant osteolysis compared to TP. Ten, 3-week-old, healthy calves were implanted with either TP or PS in the right metacarpus, 2 implants per calf. Calves were scored daily for lameness and were euthanized at day 28. Collected data included radiographs at surgery and euthanasia and histomorphometric measures of bone-implant contact on non-decalcified specimens with the implants in situ. Data was analyzed using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test; a P-value <.05 was considered significant. The cortical thickness was larger for distal implants than proximal implants for both groups at surgery (P = 0.03), but were similar between groups (P > 0.3). TP calves developed lameness sooner, at day 21, than PS calves (P = 0.04). Histologically, there was more direct cortical bone-implant contact for PS distal implants than TP implants (P = 0.04). The metaphyseal-diaphyseal junction where the proximal implants were situated is unsuitable bone for either system; each had minimal bone-implant contact and extensive osteolysis. The PS system did not cause significant osteolysis when instrumented in diaphyseal bone and is a suitable alternative to TP for comminuted distal limb fractures.

1344	Facteurs influençant la consolidation et l’apprentissage d’une habileté motrice chez l’humain	Physical practice has long been regarded as the single most determinant factor of motor skill acquisition. Often expressed by the old adage “practice makes perfect,” this idea easily relates to the common observation that extensive practice is necessary to master complex motor skills. Although the importance of physical practice for motor skill learning is undeniable, recent evidence demonstrates that the neurobiological changes that constitute the foundation of memory occur after physical practice. Regrouped under the term “consolidation”, these changes are essential for the memory storage of motor skills. The objective of this thesis was to identify factors that influence motor skill consolidation. Using a visuomotor adaptation task with two levels of difficulty, we showed that a good performance must be attained during practice to trigger certain consolidation processes. In addition, our results indicate that the learner’s subjective evaluation of his/her own performance can also modulate consolidation. Finally, we showed that observation triggers consolidation processes, indicating that consolidation is not exclusive to physical practice. Together, the results presented in this thesis demonstrate that consolidation regroups several distinct processes that each plays an important role for motor skill learning. Physical education teachers, athletic coaches and rehabilitation specialists should therefore plan training schedules favoring not only motor skill acquisition but also motor skill consolidation.

1345	Les effets de la violence organisée sur le processus d'intégration des réfugiés : le cas des Colombiens au Québec	 The armed conflict in Colombia is the third longest conflict in the world after the problem between Palestine and Israel and the one between India and Pakistan. Organized violence that characterizes this conflict has consequences at the individual level (psychological distress, etc.) and the collective (social demobilization by terror, modification of critical thinking, increased common violence).This kind of violence has forced thousands of Colombians into exile. Some of these people come to Quebec as refugees. This study describes and analyzes the effects of organized violence suffered by these persons in Colombia. It links these consequences and the integration of Colombian refugees in a region of Quebec, Haute-Yamaska. The main objective of this master’s thesis is to answer this question: According to the experiences of refugee Colombian victims of organized violence, what are the effects of this experience on their lives today in Quebec? Twelve stories were collected and analyzed based on interviews with Colombian refugees. The results of this study show that refugees need to work out their own identity trough these particular experiences; the presence of withdrawal and isolation as protective mechanisms that occur in their host country; the reproduction, for a minority, of some behaviors that are considered violent in their host country but, in the context of their land of origin, had another meaning. This difference is accompanied by a different tolerance for violence for refugees and the host society. A personal positive attitude in face of difficulties and the support of a family network or friends are enablers of integration. Finally, the effects of a long-term bereavement slow emotional and personal investment in the new country.	organized violence , refugee , integration , Colombia , Quebec	en	5417.0
1346	Banquet festif et banquet macabre : analyse narrative et structurelle d’Ap 19	Due to its constant use of symbolism within a loose narrative framework, John’s Revelation poses a formidable exegetic challenge. Moreover, this book reuses a large amount of Old Testament material while never quoting from the OT. This M.A. thesis posits that Rev 19 is a significant literary unit encased in the larger context of the complex Book of Revelation, although its narrative frame is not closely argued, even displaying some contradictions with other parts of the book. However, on a theological level, a coherent, consistent message can be unveiled, when adding a structural analysis to the narrative analysis. The combination of these two synchronic approaches highlights some striking parallels and describes a plot that talks about the certain achievement of God’s justice, symbolized by the contrast of two feasts, one joyous and the other gruesome. Finally, this research leaves intact the evocative nature of the symbols and advocates an ironic reading of some passages.

1347	Fidélité et validité de la mesure clinique du déjettement du tronc auprès d’enfants et d’adolescents présentant une scoliose idiopathique	Measurement of trunk list is an important component of an evaluation of posture in idiopathic scoliosis.  However, there is little information regarding its measurement and  the associations between trunk list and other relevant indicators or factors.  The objectives of this study were to: 1) evaluate the validity and test-retest reliability of the plumbline to measure trunk list from C7 - S1 in persons with idiopathic scoliosis and 2) to explore the  association between trunk list and the following factors: pain, Cobb angle, type of scoliosis, mental health and self-image, in persons with idiopathic scoliosis.      We recruited 55 participants aged from 10 to 21 years old with idiopathic scoliosis (Cobb angle: 15º to 60º) from the scoliosis clinic at a tertiary care pediatric hospital.  Trunk list was measured directly on participants on two occasions by the same physiotherapist and also on radiographs taken that day. Two measurements were taken each time: with feet together (FT) and feet apart (FA). The participants answered the Scoliosis Research Society-22 patient questionnaire, which addresses pain, self-image and mental health. Type of scoliosis and Cobb angle were measured on radiographs taken that day. We used generalizability theory to calculate test-retest reliability for FT and FA, reporting Dependability Coefficients (f) and Standard Errors of Measurement (SEM).   Validity of the plumbline measurement was calculated by comparing to measurements taken directly on radiographs using the Pearson correlation coefficient. Pearson correlations were calculated between trunk list and pain, Cobb angle, self-image and mental health. Spearman correlations were calculated between trunk list and type of scoliosis.  We then used multiple linear regression models to determine associations between these variables.   Our results indicated that the plumbline measurements of trunk list correlated highly (r=0.87) with the measure obtained via radiograph. Plumbline measurements of  trunk list demonstrated excellent test-retest reliability (f: 0.98 for FT and 0.99 for FA) and SEMs were 2.0 mm for FT and 1.8mm for FA.  Trunk list was positively correlated with Cobb angle (r=0.32, p=0.02) but it was not correlated with pain, mental health, self-image,  or type of scoliosis.   The conclusions of our study were that the clinical measurement of trunk list using a plumbline is both reliable and valid and that trunk list was associated with Cobb angle.  A longitudinal study is needed to determine whether trunk list is a prognostic indicator of scoliosis progression.

1348	"Le traitement de l’espace dans Badlands et 
Days of Heaven, de Terrence Malick"	This Master’s thesis studies the treatment of space in Terrence Malick’s films Badlands (1973) and Days of Heaven (1978). First I apply myself to show how the treatment of space in these films distinguishes itself from classical cinematographic conventions, developing on the multitude of strategies used by Malick to make space (both visual and sound) sensitive and reflexive in the two films. Space here is created to be literally «inhabited» by the characters as well as the spectators. I then observe and comment on the implications (esthetical, narrative, iconological, philosophical, poetical, etc.) of this peculiar treatment of film space by showing how the filmmaker creates different types of sensations and constructs his discourse with and through space of his films. The thesis pays special attention to the concept of «film landscape» and structures itself in three chapters, which respectively study space in Malick’s work in terms of «sensation» (space sensitivity, «mise en vue» of the landscape in both films studied), of «relationship» (relationships between the different spaces and relationships between characters and space), and of «memory» («iconological» density of the landscape). In the project I also touch other important questions, coming back several times on the «poetical» dimension of Malick’s cinema and on the «space reflexivity» of his films (reflexivity and «attractional» aspect of the landscape, reflexivity of the voice-over, reflexivity of the organization and space structure of the story, iconological reflexivity). Finally, throughout the thesis I try to show that through filmmaking, and therefore through space and landscape, Malick creates a true space of thoughts that goes «beyond» his films.

1349	Vers une politique de conciliation travail- famille au Québec : des enjeux complexes et en évolution	"In recent decades, the topic of balancing work and family has earned an important place in popular discourse, media and politics in Québec, as well as in industrialized countries and in international organizations. The term refers to the challenges for individuals, couples, families, workplaces and society in general, and the new relationship that has developed between these two spheres of life with the transition from an industrial to a post-industrial society. These perceived challenges, identified and defined differently by each of these players have resulted in the inclusion of this issue on the political agenda of governments, both here and abroad.  The purpose of this research is to understand the dynamics surrounding the development of actions by the Québec government on the issue of reconciling work and family.

1350	Les Signaux Post Mortem (SPM) de l’apoptose endothéliale : des acteurs du remodelage vasculaire	Immunosuppression regiments improved steadily the incidence of acute rejection with minimal positive effects on chronic rejection.  The latter is characterized by a transplant vasculopathy (TV) similar to native atherosclerosis, accompanied with fibrosis throughout the vascular wall of the allograft.  The pathophysiology associated to TV arose from pionnering work of Russell Ross in 1977.  He proposed the 'Response to Injury' hypothesis revealing that endothelium injury initiated by immunological and non immunological factors favors a vascular repair response through neo-intima thickening at the sites of cellular injury.  However, when endothelial insult is maintained, apoptosis ensues and the vascular repair process perpetuates.  Since inhibition of endothelial apoptosis prevents TV development in vivo, we hypothesized that endothelial apoptosis regulates the vascular repair process through a paracrine program active on the cellular components of the vessel wall.  We have generated an in vitro experimental system to induce endothelial apoptosis in absence of necrosis.  Using a multifunctional and comparative proteomic approach, we have identified 27 post mortem signals (PMS) specifically exported by apoptotic endothelial cells. Some of these PMS display anti-apoptotic function (TCTP and EGF), whereas CTGF was identified as a fibrogenic factor, recapitulating the cellular events associated to the development of TV.  Interestingly, 16 of these SPM did not contain a peptide signal, suggesting that non conventional secretion mechanisms could be favored during the effector phase of apoptosis.  We demonstrated that activated caspase-3 regulates the exosomal secretion pathway associated to the export of nanovesicles TCTP +ve, anti-apoptotic and biochemically different from apoptotic blebs.  Finally, the overall proteomic data  generated a new hypothesis suggesting that in response to apoptotic stress, the cell exports different mediators (soluble and vesicular) by non conventional mechanism through the fusion of endocytic organelles and autophagic vacuoles with the plasma membrane, releasing their content into the extracellular milieu.  This mechanism should be regulated during the effector phase of apoptosis favoring a vascular repair response only when cell’s demise reaches a point of no return.  Therefore, these PMS could be used both as biomarkers of apoptosis or as biopharmaceutical targets to decrease the incidence of chronic vascular repair.

1351	Écologie de la besnoitiose chez les populations de caribous (Rangifer tarandus) des régions subarctiques	Although Besnoitia tarandi has been described in Rangifer sp. for over 80 years, understanding of its ecology and distribution is still relatively limited. The objectives of this study were (i) to determine the anatomical sampling site that enhances detection of Besnoitia tarandi infections in caribou populations; (ii) to evaluate the relative sensitivity and specificity of the in situ macroscopic assessment for diagnosis of besnoitiosis compared to the microscopic evaluation; and (iii) to identify potential risks factors associated with the prevalence and intensity of B. tarandi cysts and compare these across different populations. Our results suggest that calculating the number of cysts present in the superficial dermis of a skin section of the anterior mid-third of the metatarsus region by microscopic examination should be favored in order to monitor the presence and intensity of B. tarandi infections. Macroscopic assessment of B. tarandi cysts was not a sensitive method compared to that of a microscopic analysis. Besnoitia tarandi seems to be absent from Greenland but has been encountered in approximately one third of North-American caribou. A seasonal effect was noticed in the prevalence and intensity of B. tarandi infections; the parasite being more abundant in caribou sampled during the fall/winter period compared to the spring/summer period. This effect could reflect the increase abundance of B. tarandi following the end of the insect season (i.e. summer), supporting the role of arthropods as vectors of transmission. Reduction of the parasite burden by the immune system and/or a lower winter survival rate of severely infected caribou could explain the seasonal difference. The slightly higher prevalence in males suggests lower mortality rate, higher exposure and/or higher susceptibility to the parasite in infected males when compared to infected females. The apparent higher density of infection by B. tarandi in the Rivière-aux-Feuilles herd (Nunavik, Québec) suggests either higher exposure to the parasite or reduced resistance of caribou from this herd. The findings of this study suggest that infection by B. tarandi might reduce survival of individual animals; hence, the dynamic between this parasite and its hosts is worth further investigation, especially in these days of changing Arctic environment.

1352	Analyse spectroscopique d'étoiles naines blanches riches en hydrogène(DA) : vers des modèles d'atmosphère améliorés sans paramètres libres	The goal of this thesis is to refine and to understand better the spectroscopic method, which compares optical spectra of hydrogen-atmosphere white dwarfs (DA) with synthetic spectra to determine the atmospheric parameters (effective temperature and surface gravity). Our approach rests mainly on the development of improved model spectra, which come themselves from DA model atmospheres. We present a new grid of DA synthetic spectra with the first consistent implementation of the non-ideal gas theory of Hummer & Mihalas and the unified theory of Stark broadening from Vidal, Cooper & Smith. This allows for an adequate treatment of the quenching effects in Balmer lines, without the need of a free parameter. We show that these improved spectra predict surface gravities that are much more stable as a function of the effective temperature. We then study the long-standing problem that surface gravities in cool DA stars are significantly higher than those found in hotter DA white dwarfs. The hypothesis of Bergeron et al., according to which the atmospheres are contaminated by small amounts of helium, is constrained with observations. Using high-resolution spectra collected at the Keck in Hawaii, we find superior limits on the helium abundances in the atmospheres that are nearly 10 times lower than those required to sustain the Bergeron et al. scenario. The grid of spectra calculated in this work is then applied to a new spectroscopic analysis of the DA in the SDSS. Our careful analysis allows us to define a cleaner sample and to identify a large number of double degenerates. We find that a cutoff at a signal-to-noise ratio S/N > 15 optimizes the size and quality of the sample for computing the average mass, for which we find a value of 0.613 solar mass. Finally, eight new 3D white dwarf models with a radiative-hydrodynamics treatment of the convection are presented. We also calculated models with the same physics, except for a treatment of the convection with the standard mixing-length theory. A differential analysis between these two sets of models shows that the 3D models predict considerably lower surface gravities. We conclude that the high-log g problem in cool DA white dwarfs is caused by a weakness in the mixing-length theory.

1353	Modèle de la compatibilité fondé sur l’attachement et la personnalité chez des couples en détresse	The first goal of this thesis is to propose a new model of compatibility. Partner’s compatibility is conceptualized from two attachment dimensions (avoidance and anxiety) as well as personality trait (neurotism). The second goal was to test this model on a sample of couples seeking marital therapy. A critical literature review on the role of compatibility in the understanding of couples’ dynamics is completed, underlining the relevance of improving this concept’s definition by taking attachment and neurotism into account. Methodological and statistical issues to consider are also discussed.  To evaluate the predictive validity of the model, 365 couples completed the Dyadic adjustment scale (Spanier, 1976), the NEO-FFI (Costa & McCrae, 1992) and the Experiences in close relationships questionnaire (Brennan, Clark, & Shaver, 1998) at intake. The association between personality, attachment and marital satisfaction is first examined with the Actor-Partner Interdependence Model (Kashy & Snyder, 1995). Results show that attachment avoidance is negatively associated with marital satisfaction for spouses themselves as well as for their partners. Analysis of similarities and differences is then performed, revealing that differences between partners on the combination of avoidance and neurotism are correlated with marital insatisfaction. To examine the patterns of natural groupings between partners in the sample, clusters analyses were conducted. Seven different types of couples exhibiting significant differences in their marital satisfaction were found. Three main groups of couples were identified within these types, the first one regrouping mostly satisfied couples, a second one including very dissatisfied partners and a last one presenting a difference between the man’s and the women’s satisfaction. These results could be considered as provinding preliminary confirmation of our compatibility model based on attachment and neurotism, but these propositions must be validated.  Some elements of the present findings suggest that it is the combination of attachment anxiety, avoidance and neurotism between partners that is linked to severity of marital distress. However, many challenges, conceptual, theoretical, as well as methodological, are then discussed and future scientific contributions are proposed in order to consolidate the conceptual base of compatibility.

1354	Évaluation in vitro de la stérilisation au peroxyde d'hydrogène sur les propriétés biologiques de prothèses utilisées lors de stabilisation du genou chez le chien	Objective—To compare the effects of hydrogen peroxide gas plasma (HPGP), ethylene oxide (EO) and steam (ST) sterilizations on the physicochemical and bioadhesive properties of nylon and polyethylene lines used for stabilization of the canine stifle joint. Study Design—In vitro study. Samples—Non-sterilized, HPGP-, EO- and ST- sterilized samples of 36.3-kg test nylon leader line (NLL), 57.8-kg test nylon fishing line (NFL) and 2-mm Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene (UHMPE) were used. Methods—Surface analysis of NLL, NFL and UHMPE non-sterilized and HPGP-, EO- and ST-sterilized samples was carried out by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), contact angle (CA) measurement, and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Staphylococcus intermedius and Escherichia Coli bacterial adherence were also tested. Results—Surface oxidation was observed on all samples sterilized with HPGP, EO or ST process. All sterilization methods significantly increased the CA for the NLL, NFL and UHMPE. The roughness was not significantly affected by the method of sterilization for NLL, NFL and UHMPE. Bacterial adherence was significantly affected by the method of sterilization for NLL, NFL and UHMPE. UHMPE had significantly higher CA, roughness and bacterial adherence compared to NLL and NFL, no matter which sterilization method was used. Conclusion—The effects of HPGP on the chemico-physical and bioadhesive properties of nylon and polyethylene lines compared positively to EO or ST, making HPGP an attractive alternative. UHMPE may not be a suitable material for suture prostheses regarding bacterial adherence properties. Future studies are required to determine the clinical significance of these findings.

1355	Le pessimisme dans trois romans de Catulle Mendès : Le roi vierge, Méphistophéla et Le chercheur de tares	This thesis tries to make sense of the ambiguity of pessimism in three of Catulle Mendès’s novels. On the one hand, the construction of the hero indicates a criticism of pessimism based on psychopathology, typical of late nineteenth-century moralism as it denies the doctrine any speculative value. On the other hand, the representation of a society full of liars against which the hero leads a struggle bestows upon him a power of revelation. This tension is condensed in the concept of monster which is submitted here to both a pathological and an hermeneutic reading. The hero’s conscience conforms to the type of decadent conscience as defined by Jankélévitch: the system of thought produced by it cannot be considered other than monstous. In addition, the primary feature of the pessimistic monster lies in the inhuman nature of the truth, as search and as revelation. Only a monster can profess the truth because it is made to his measure that is: intolerable. The truth reflects the supremacy of instinct and negates all ideals. Based on a thoroughly pessimistic conception, Mendès’point lies in an idealistic morals which advocates the universal lying against universal vice.

1356	Bcl-xL regulation and function in cell cycle checkpoints and progression	Accumulating evidence suggest that Bcl-xL, an anti-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family, also functions in cell cycle progression and cell cycle checkpoints. To further understand Bcl-xL regulation and function in cell cycle progression, we first expressed a series of single-point Bcl-xL cDNA phospho-mutants, including Thr41Ala, Ser43Ala, Thr47Ala, Ser49Ala, Ser56Ala, Ser62Ala and Thr115Ala in human cancer cell lines and investigated their impact on cell cycle progression.         Analysis of this series of phosphorylation mutants reveals that cells expressing Bcl-xL(Ser62Ala) mutant are less stable at the G2 checkpoint and enter mitosis more rapidly than cells expressing wild type Bcl-xL or Bcl-xL phosphorylation mutants, including Thr41Ala, Ser43Ala, Thr47Ala, Ser56Ala and Thr115Ala. Dynamic phosphorylation and location studies on phospho-Bcl-xL(Ser62) in unperturbed, synchronized cells and during DNA damage-induced G2 arrest revealed that phospho-Bcl-xL(Ser62) translocates into nucleolar structures in VP16-exposed cells during G2 arrest. Using in vitro kinase assays, pharmacological inhibitors and specific siRNAs experiments, we found that Polo kinase 1 and MAPK9/JNK2 are major protein kinases involved in Bcl-xL(Ser62) phosphorylation and accumulation into nucleolar structures during the G2 checkpoint. In nucleoli, phospho-Bcl-xL(Ser62) binds to and co-localizes with CDK1(CDC2), the key cyclin-dependent kinase required for entry into mitosis. These data indicate that, during G2 checkpoint, phospho-Bcl-xL(Ser62) stabilizes G2 arrest by timely trapping CDK1(CDC2) in nucleolar structures to slow mitotic entry. It also highlights that DNA damage affects the dynamic composition of the nucleolus, which now emerges as a key event in the DNA damage response.  In a second study, we describe that cells expressing Bcl-xL(Ser62Ala) are also more stable at a sustained spindle-assembly checkpoint (SAC) after exposure to taxol than cells expressing wild-type Bcl-xL or other mutants, an effect that appears to be independent of its anti-apoptotic activity. Bcl-xL(Ser62) is strongly phosphorylated by PLK1 and MAPK14/SAPKp38α at prometaphase, metaphase and the anaphase boundary, while it is dephosphorylated at telophase and cytokinesis. Phospho-Bcl-xL(Ser62) localizes in centrosomes with γ-tubulin, along the mitotic spindle with dynein motor protein and in cytosol with SAC signaling components. In taxol-exposed cells, phospho-Bcl-xL(Ser62) binds to the CDC20/MAD2/BUBR1/BUB3 complex, while Bcl-xL(Ser62Ala) does not. The data indicate that during SAC, Bcl-xL(Ser62) phosphorylation accelerates SAC resolution and cell entry into anaphase, even in the presence of unattached or misaligned chromosomes. Silencing Bcl-xL expression also leads nocodazole-exposed cells to tetraploidy and binucleation, consistent with a Bcl-xL function in SAC and genomic stability.      In the third study, the functional analysis of a Bcl-xL phosphorylation mutant series has revealed that cells expressing Bcl-xL(Ser49Ala) mutant are less stable at G2 checkpoint after DNA damage and enter cytokinesis much more slowly after microtubule poisoning than cells expressing wild-type Bcl-xL. These effects of Bcl-xL(Ser49Ala) mutant seem to be distinct from Bcl-xL function in apoptosis. Bcl-xL(Ser49) phosphorylation is cell cycle-dependent. In synchronized cells, phospho-Bcl-xL(Ser49) appears during the S phase and G2, whereas it disappears rapidly in early mitosis during prometaphase, metaphase and early anaphase, and re-appears during telophase and cytokinesis. During DNA damage-induced G2 arrest, an important pool of phospho-Bcl-xL(Ser49) accumulates in centrosomes which act as essential decision centers for progression from G2 to mitosis. During telophase/cytokinesis, phospho-Bcl-xL(Ser49) is found along microtubules and at midbody with dynein motor protein. In a series of in vitro kinase assays, specific small interfering RNA and pharmacological inhibition experiments, polo kinase 3 (PLK3) was implicated in Bcl-xL(Ser49) phosphorylation. These data indicate that during G2 checkpoint phospho-Bcl-xL(Ser49) is another downstream target of PLK3, acting to stabilize G2 arrest. Bcl-xL phosphorylation at Ser49 also correlates with essential PLK3 activity and function, enabling cytokinesis and mitotic exit.

1357	La mise à l’agenda du « problème » de la sous-représentation des Autochtones dans l’enseignement de l’histoire nationale au Québec, 1960-2010	With the emergence of a territorially-based Quebec identity in the 1960s intellectuals and pressure groups began to construct the “problem” of aboriginal under-representation in Quebec’s national history program. We compare the importance of this “problem” on the agenda of the designers of the last two high school national history teaching programs in Quebec: History of Quebec and Canada (1982-2008) and History and Education Citizenship (2007/2008-). We show that this “problem” only gained prominence on the agenda of the second program’s designers.  To explain this difference between the agenda of the two programs’ designers, we use John Kingdon’s Multiple Streams approach.  We show that in the 1990s and 2000s, all the elements favouring the agenda setting of this “problem” were present: the problem stream, the policy stream, the politics stream, the political entrepreneur and the policy window. In contrast, we argue that in the late 1970s, one element was missing: the politics stream, more specifically the national mood. To make the concept of national mood less a-historical, we use Sabatier and Jenkins-Smith’s typology (1993) and distinguish three levels of beliefs constitutive of the national mood.  We assert that a change occurred at the deepest and most unalterable level of beliefs held by Quebec’s intellectual and political élite between the late 1970s and the 1990s in favour of the recognition of aboriginal peoples.

1358	La réception d’un nouveau produit écoconçu durant la commercialisation dans un contexte de PME québécoise par les détaillants : le cas d’un meuble de salle de bain	There are still very few new eco-designed products (NEP) commercialized by SMEs and commercial successes are even more rare in Quebec. In this context, this study examines how the eco-design process could be integrated more easily with people working in SMEs in Quebec, specifically studying the retailer’s reception of NEP during the commercialization. Therefore, a major question from this dissertation in learning research is: how a product designed according to the life cycle approach is received by the SMEs’ network of retailers? Also, our research explores how the role of designer, which normally ends at the beginning of the commercialization, could evolve during this phase to help receive a NEP.  This case study, examines the first phase of the commercialization of bathroom furniture eco-designed by a Quebec manufacturing SME in 2010 and 2011. The researcher observed the reception of a NEP, which in summary translates in the perception and appreciation of NEP. These observations were lead with people working in an SME manufacturing bathroom furniture and with people working in his network of retailers. It was observed that the understanding of the notion of eco-design is an important issue in the reception of a NEP. For this reason, the training of the retailers and the education of the consumers are an essential part for the positive reception of a NEP. Also, because of his/her knowledge of eco-design, the designer could become a major contributor during the phase of commercialization.

1359	Caractérisation de l’infection naturelle à Cryptosporidium spp. chez le chien et le chat vus en établissement vétérinaire	Cryptosporidium spp. is a protozoan parasite from the gastro-intestinal tract with a large range of vertebrate hosts causing cryptosporidiosis, a zoonotic disease which may lead to severe digestive troubles and sometimes death for immunocompromised people. It is a noticeable disease in Canada since 2000. It is thus relevant to study the infection in cats and dogs as they may represent an important zoonotic reservoir for the parasite. A total of 1,202 stool samples from cats (n = 371) and dogs (n = 831) from the province of Quebec were examined during the year 2008 for this research. The prevalence of Cryptosporidium spp. was calculated using coprology tests using centrifugation in a zinc sulfate solution. The prevalence in cats (28/371: 7,55 %) and dogs (88/831: 10,59%) corroborates that pets living in the province of Quebec may be a reservoir for Cryptosporidium spp. While we did not find a significant difference in the prevalence of Cryptosporidium spp. between cats and dogs, cats may represent a larger reservoir as they represent a larger population within the province. We identified age (p = 0,0001) and concomitant infection with Giardia spp.      (p =0,0001) as risk factors for dogs. Among all the variables tested on cats (age, sex, season, concomitant infection with Giardia spp.), none were significantly associated with the presence of the parasite in cats. This may be caused in part by the small number that was analyzed. A follow-up study with two cats showed the excretion of oocysts can last for a minimum of seven months and varies in intensity through time. The molecular diagnostic of species and genotypes of Cryptosporidium spp. isolated from fecal samples should have been done by using the amplification of the gene fragments ARNr 18S and HSP70 nested PCR reactions and the sequencing of PCR products. Although this technique was attempted in this study, no positive result was obtained. It is recommended to work on larger animal populations to increase the statistical power of epidemiological analysis of the prevalence of Cryptosporidium spp.	Cryptosporidium spp. , Cat , Dog , Zoonosis , Oocyst , Prevalence , Risk factors	en	5272.0
1360	Les représentations chrétiennes et la culture juive dans l'art pictural moderne : le cas de Marc Chagall	Marc Chagall is a Jewish artist who challenged the Mosaic interdiction to represent the deity. He has among others in the modern period made several paintings on the theme of the Crucifixion, a particularly sensitive issue for an artist attached to his Jewish identity and practising an art with a strong autobiographical component. This dissertation examines the conditions which allowed the adoption and the development, by Chagall, of an important Christian subject whose iconography he freely revisited. Among the circumstances that facilitated the cultural hybridization in which Chagall engaged in his Crucifixion, we must point out the new freedom, both at the level of figurative devices and pictorial treatment, brought by modernism in the approach of major traditional genres to which religious painting belongs. On a quite different register, the dissertation examines the exceptional historic circumstances met by Chagall before and during the execution of the Crucifixions. These circumstances have exerted pressure that allowed the tragic experience of the Jews of the XXth century to find expression in images of universal significance.

1361	Étude du mécanisme de protection des spermatozoïdes de mammifères par le lait	Skim milk is being used as a protective agent for mammalian semen conservation over half a century. Recently, there has been increased interest in developing extenders free of animal products. However, it is difficult to find suitable component in order to replace milk as an extender, because the mechanisms by which milk protect sperm against cooling and freezing damages during the storage is unknown. The Binder of SPerm (BSP) proteins are the major proteins of bull seminal plasma and they are harmful during sperm storage. In fact, sperm would be in contact with a large quantity of BSP proteins that induce a continuous cholesterol and phospholipids efflux from the sperm membrane during storage. When bull sperm is diluted with an extender containing egg yolk, another compound frequently used in extender, the low-density lipoproteins (LDL) present in the egg yolk prevent the binding of the BSP proteins to the sperm membrane, thus, preventing the lipid efflux from the sperm membrane induced by the BSP proteins. Our hypothesis was that milk proteins would protect sperm during storage by binding BSP proteins. First, we demonstrated by gel filtration that bovine BSP proteins could bind the milk proteins. Skim milk was fractionated into three fractions: F1 (alpha-lactalbumin and beta- lactoglobulin, the major whey proteins and kappa-casein), F2 (mainly caseins and all other milk proteins in small amounts) and F3 (salts, sugars and small peptides). Bovine BSP1 and BSP5 have more affinity for F1 as compared to BSP3 and all the BSP proteins have affinity for F2. We confirmed the interaction between bovine BSP proteins and milk proteins by isothermal titration calorimetry. The binding of BSP1 to casein micelles is characterized by an affinity constant (Ka) of 3.5 × 10^5 M-1 and of a stoichiometric parameter for the association (n) of 4.5 BSP1 per casein. The association between BSP1 and alpha-lactalbumin (one of the major whey proteins) is characterized by a Ka of 2.4 × 10^5 M-1 and a “n” value of 0.8. These results support our contention that milk can protect sperm by preventing the BSP proteins’ binding to the sperm membrane attributable to a protein : protein interaction, while egg yolk sperm protection is attributable to a protein : lipoprotein interaction. Second, our studies showed that the homologous BSP proteins found in the boar, stallion and ram seminal plasma can bind the milk proteins. These results indicate that the mechanism of sperm protection by milk in these species should be similar to the one in bovine species. Third, we characterized the interaction between bovine BSP1 protein and LDL from hen’s egg yolk. The binding was characterized by a Ka of 3.4 ± 0.4 × 10^6 M-1 and a « n » value of 104 BSP1 per LDL particle. Our results indicated that there is difference between the mechanism of sperm protection by milk and egg yolk. We believe that the results presented in this thesis may help to create new extenders free of animal product for mammal sperm preservation in liquid or frozen state.	cryoconservation , cryopreservation , milk , sperm protection , casein micelles , whey proteins , alpha-lactalbumin , beta-lactoglobulin , egg yolk , low-density lipoproteins , BSP proteins	en	5265.0
1362	Études de type structure fonction du couplage électromécanique et de la coopérativité sous-unitaire chez les canaux potassiques dépendants du voltage	"Voltage-gated potassium channels are tetramers and each subunit is formed of six transmembrane segments (S1 to S6). The pore, formed by the S5-S6 segments of each subunit, is surrounded by four modules responsible for sensitivity to the membrane potential, the voltage sensors (VS, S1-S4). During membrane depolarization, the movement of charged residues located in the VS causes a detectable charge movement called the gating current. The activation of the VS led to the opening of the pore, resulting in a conformational change in the C-terminal segment of S6. To elucidate the principles underlying the electromechanical coupling between these two domains, we examined two regions presumed responsible for the coupling among channels of the Shaker K + family: the carboxy-terminal region of S6 and the peptide bond linking the transmembrane segments S4-S5 (S4-5L). Using the cut-open voltage clamp fluorometry (COVCF), we have determined that the RELY inter-subunit interaction, formed by amino acids located on the S4-5L linker and S6 of two neighboring subunits, is involved in the development of the slow component observed during the return of the gating charges (OFF-gating) to their resting state. The introduction of mutations in the RELY region modulates the strength of these molecular interactions and eliminates the asymmetry observed in the wild type gating currents. Moreover, we demonstrate that this inter-subunit coupling is responsible for stabilizing the pore in the open state. We have also identified an intra-subunit interaction between residues I384 located on the S4-5L linker and F484 on the S6 segment of the same subunit. The destabilization of this hydrophobic interaction uncouples completely the movement of voltage sensors from pore opening. Without this interaction, the energy required to activate the VS is diminished due to the absence of mechanical weight applied by the pore. Furthermore, this  uncoupling also eliminates the ""mode shift"", defined as an amplified shift of the voltage dependence of gating charge (QV) to hyperpolarizing potentials during prolonged depolarization, thus indicating that the mechanical load of the pore influences the entry of the VS into this shifted mode  by modulating the conformation of the VS threw an intrinsic allosteric process."

1363	Caractérisation de l’ADNc et de l’ADN génomique codant l’intégrine plaquettaire αIIb‐β3 chez un cheval atteint de Thrombasthénie de Glanzmann	Glanzmann thrombasthenia (GT) is  characterized by a defect of platelet aggregation. This autosomal recessive genetic disorder is caused by an abnormality of the platelet receptor for fibrinogen. This receptor is an integrin located on the plasma membrane formed by a complex of αIIb‐β3 subunits. Recently, we identified a horse with clinical and pathological features of GT. Flow cytometry studies revealed a deficiency of the αIIb subunit suggesting the presence of one or several mutations in the gene encoding for the αIIb subunit. The aim of this study was to describe this case of GT at the molecular level by characterizing the cDNAs encoding for the β3 (ITGB3) and αIIb (ITGA2B) subunits. Total RNA was extracted from platelets and converted into cDNA by reverse transcription using a poly‐dT primer. Genomic DNA was extracted from white blood cells. Specific primers for αIIb and β3 sequences were used to amplify by PCR the corresponding cDNA or genomic regions that were further characterized by sequencing and compared by BLAST analysis (GenBank). A point mutation from G to C in exon 2 of ITGA2B was identified, causing a substitution of the expected amino acid arginine 72 (Arg72) by a proline (Pro72). This amino acid change may result in abnormal structural conformations that yield an inactive αIIb subunit. The analysis of genomic DNA showed that this horse was homozygous for the missense mutation. The genomic DNA sequences encoding exon 2 of the dam, grand dam and the sire were heterozygous for this nucleic acid change and were clinically normal. The analysis of ITGB3 was unremarkable.

1364	Essai d’amélioration du taux de rétention de la tétracycline dans un polymère à empreinte moléculaire formé de co-polymères fonctionnalisés de l’acide lactique	The veterinarian is helping the dairy farmer to keep his flock healthy. When a cow is sick, he may prescribe antibiotics. But in that case, the cow milk treated with antibiotics is discarded, and not sold for consumption. All milk products are analyzed before being pasteurized and processed to ensure that dairy products do not contain residues of antibiotics. If the analyses show that milk contains traces of antibiotics, it is discarded and the producer must bear the loss. On place, the current screening tests for drug residues are expensive and inapplicable.  To resolve this problem at the feet of the cow, the solution proposed in this project is the production of a detection kit based on molecular imprinted polymers. These are polymers whose molecular conformation is complementary to that of antibiotics. This project is about improving the effectiveness of screening tests for residues of tetracyclines by increasing the number of interaction sites between the antibiotic and polyester. Three polymers are used respectively, aromatic, carboxyl and hydroxyl groups.  A previous study in our laboratory had already shown a tetracycline retention percentage of 50% for a composition of 1 / 3 PLAOH-1 / 3 PLACOOH-1 / 3 PLAOBn. After variation in the polymers ratio, the percentage obtained is, 38.93 % for a composition of   1 / 4 PLAOH-1 / 2 PLACOOH-1 / 4 PLAOPh, 44.81 % for a composition of 1 / 4 PLACOOH- 1 / 2 PLAOH- 1 / 4 PLAOPh, 66.34 % for a composition of 1/4 PLAOH- 1/4 PLACOOH- 1/4 PLAOPh and 78.07 % for a composition of 1/6 PLAOH- 1 / 6 PLACOOH- 2 / 3 PLAPh. Our hypothesis was that the increase of the amount of the phenyl group, increases the number of specific interaction sites with the antibiotic, and so increases the percentage of retention of the antibiotic through the MIP. The results confirmed this hypothesis.	PLA , tetracycline , PLA , molecular imprinted polymer	en	5229.0
1365	Parent-youth associations of physical activity and the influence of family and neighbourhood social factors	Objective: To examine the association between parental involvement in their child’s physical activity (PA) and child lifestyle behaviours and weight status.  Methods: Data were from the 1999 Quebec Child and Adolescent Health and Social Survey, comprising representative samples of youth aged 9, 13, and 16 years. Parental involvement in PA with their child was assessed and measured as both, one, or neither parent engaging in PA with their child ≥once/week, based on parent reports. A 7-day PA recall was used to categorize youth as inactive, moderately-active, or highly-active. Screen time was classified as ≤14 and >14 hours of TV and video viewing/week. Overweight status was defined according to Cole’s sex- and age-specific BMI cut-points.  Results: Participants (n=2511) with both parents engaging in PA with them ≥once/week (vs. neither parent) were more likely to be highly-active at ages 13 (OR 3.89, 95% CI: 1.85-8.18) and 16 (OR 3.45, 95% CI: 1.32-9.01), and to report ≤14 hours/week of screen time at age 13 (OR 2.36, 95% CI: 1.30-4.25). No associations were observed for weight status. We examined effect modification in post-hoc analyses; the association between parental involvement and youth PA was present in two-parent households only, while the association between parental involvement and screen time was only present in neighbourhoods perceived to be safe by parents.   Conclusion: Health promotion strategies targeting parental involvement in youth PA may reduce the future burden of chronic disease, given the favorable association of parental involvement with several youth lifestyle behaviours.	structure familiale , physical activity , screen time , overweight , neighbourhood safety , family structure	en	5187.0
1366	Actin cytoskeleton regulates pollen tube growth and tropism	Fertilization in plants depends on the delivery of the sperm cells in the pollen grain through the pollen tube to the ovule. The pollen tube is a highly anisotropic, fast growing cellular protuberance. Because the pollen tube is non autotrophic, it requires a steady supply of carbohydrates and minerals supplied by the pistil to sustain its growth. These elements serve for the synthesis of cell wall material, delivered to the site of cell wall assembly in secretory vesicles that are transported along the actin cytoskeleton and deposited at the growing apex of the tube. The tube has to resist external deformation forces in order to maintain its cylindrical shape and to respond to various directional signals in order to reach its target. My objectives were to identify the role of the cytoskeleton in the anisotropic growth of the pollen tube and to determine how the tube responds to directional cues. The cytoskeleton in the pollen tube consists of microfilaments and microtubules, both forming long filamentous elements. For in vitro growing pollen tubes, carbohydrates and growth minerals have to be added to the growth medium in specific amounts order to sustain pollen tube growth. I optimized the growth conditions of Arabidopsis thaliana and Camellia japonica pollen tubes which, in addition to pollen from Lilium longiflorum, were used as model species for my experiments. I developed a microwave based, fast and efficient fixation and labelling protocol for pollen tubes. I used pharmacological, mechanical, molecular and microscopical tools to study the role of the cytoskeleton in pollen tube growth and tropism. I found that the actin cytoskeleton, and more specifically the subapical actin fringe, plays an important role in the regulation of pollen tube growth and architecture through the controlled delivery of secretory vesicles to the growing apex. I constructed a galvanotropic chamber that can be mounted on an inverted microscope to induce controlled tropic triggers. I found that the actin cytoskeleton is also involved in the ability of the pollen tube to change its direction. This tropic behaviour was shown to be dependent on the concentration of calcium ions in the growth medium and calcium influx through calcium channels. The cytosolic calcium gradient in the pollen tube regulates the activity of various actin binding proteins that are responsible for remodelling the actin cytoskeleton. Among these proteins are two Arabidopsis gametophyte-specific actin depolymerizing factors (ADFs) that I tagged with two intrinsically fluorescent proteins. I found that ADF7 and ADF10 are differentially expressed during microsporogenesis and pollen tube germination and growth and that they likely divide important functions between them.

1367	Évaluation de la densité osseuse péri acétabulaire après resurfaçage versus prothèse totale de la hanche métal-métal non cimentée	We undertook a retrospective study to evaluate bone remodeling around two uncemented press-fit acetabular components: (1. Hip resurfacing (HR) and 2. total hip replacement (THR)) at a minimum of 21 months after implantation.  We measured by DEXA (Dual energy X ray absorptiometry) the bone mineral density (BMD) in the supra acetabular area in 60 patients (44 HR, 16 THR). We found no significant difference in the average BMD of the global zone and central zone of the acetabulum between the operated hip and the opposite non-operated hip in both treatment groups. However, the BMD of the medial and lateral cortico-cancellous areas on the side of surgery was significantly higher compared to non-operated side in HR group with the cobalt chrome cup; (p=0,014 and 0,031 respectively) As for THR with a titanium cup, we found no significant difference in BMD at these areas (p=0,130 and 0,733). These data show that with more rigid cups, there seems to be greater load transfer to the periphery of the acetabulum without significant stress shielding.  This is the first study to assess peri-acetabular bone remodeling with HR. We showed that BMD is relatively preserved. Stress transfer to the periphery may be beneficial in maintaining the stability of the primary implant while conserving bone stock for possible revisions of the press-fit cup of the HR.

1368	Évaluation des effets de l'administration de fer intramusculaire sur l'anémie chez les oiseaux de proie	A 10 mg/kg intramuscular (IM) administration of iron dextran is a common empirical treatment recommended in avian medicine for hemorrhage and anemia. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of this treatment on anemia in birds of prey. Two kinds of specimen were used: the American kestrel (Falco sparverius) where an acute external blood loss anemia was created (with two phlebotomies of 20-40 % of the total blood volume at 6 hours interval) and other various species of wild birds of prey suffering from different types of anemia. All subjects were randomized into a treatment (iron dextran 10 mg/kg IM) or a control (NaCl 0,9 % IM) group. Monitoring was carried out to evaluate the evolution of the anemia, presence of side effects and impact of an iron administration on their iron reserve. No significant differences were observed between the two treatment groups for clinical signs, packed cell volume, the percentage of reticulocytes/polychromatophilic erythrocytes, bone marrow cellularity and iron, plasmatic iron and creatine kinase. Most kestrels had a myositis at the iron injection site. Our results suggest that an IM injection of 10 mg/kg iron dextran has no effect on raptor erythropoiesis after an acute external blood loss anemia, that it has no effect on iron reserve, and that it can cause mild inflammation at the injection site. The polychromatophilic erythrocytes and the reticulocytes ring form count were two equivalent methods.

1369	Effet de la source du sélénium sur le statut du sélénium, de la GSH-Px et sur le système immunitaire des bovins de boucherie	Abstract The aims of this study were to determine the effects of selenium (Se) supplementation sources (organic and inorganic) on Se and GSH-Px concentrations of beef cows (n=33) and their calves and on immune parameters of the calves. Two groups of cows were given daily 3 mg of either organic or inorganic Se in mineral supplement starting from 12 weeks before calving until weaning. The third group had no Se added into the diet and their calves were divided into two subgroups either injected or not with 0.087 mg/kg of sodium selenite after birth. Serum Se and whole blood GSH-Px were respectively measured by HPLC-UV and by kinetic-enzymatic technique. Calves immune parameters were evaluated using commercial kits for phagocytosis, respiratory burst and CD4:CD8 ratio and radial immunodiffusion for total IgG concentrations. In cows and calves, Se supplementation increased significantly serum and colostrum Se concentrations (P<.02) with significant higher effect for organic source. However, milk Se concentrations increased significantly only with the organic source (P≤.0007). Se supplementation increased GSH-Px concentrations in cows (P≤.04) and their calves (P≤.0004); organic source induced a higher effect than inorganic one in calves (P≤.0004). Se injection in calves allowed a temporary increase (P<.0001) of serum Se concentrations. No significant differences were noticed throughout the experiment for all of the immune parameters measured (P>.01, not significant after Bonferroni adjustment). Our results showed that Se supplementation improved colostrum, milk and serum Se and GSH-Px concentrations in cows and their calves without effect on the measured immune parameters in calves.

1370	Regard sur le projet migratoire et d’intégration et sur le processus identitaire de jeunes réfugiés au Québec	The purpose of this qualitative exploratory study was to examine refugee youths’ immigration trajectories and their integration and identity work as newcomers to Quebec. Their perceptions were explored in terms of social integration, school integration, the development of peer networks, and their future outlook and aspirations. Employed identity strategies were explored in contexts such as schooling, religion, and community organizations.   Five refugee youth, ranging in age from 15 to 21 years, were solicited for the study. They participated in two in-depth semi-structured interviews, facilitated by the use of personal artefacts and pictures. Results underline the uniqueness of each of the cases, both in terms of reasons for departure and subsequent trajectories and identity work. Despite this diversity, some commonalities could be noted. The immigration trajectories were emotionally charged and difficult for all youth interviewed. They all struggled with their social integration both within and outside of school, as well as in terms of ensuring continued academic success. Yet, they all exhibited the capacity to overcome adversity, despite repeated and on-going challenges, and showed much resilience. In terms of their identity strategies, some developed a hybrid identity, integrating past and current identity work into a coherent whole, while others were still in a stage of exploration or actively involved in working towards a coherent sense of self that could accommodate the complexity of their life experiences. Longitudinal studies are needed to document the development of identity strategies that facilitate refugee youths’ integration while ensuring on-going resilience, academic success and psychological well-being.

1371	"De l'animation des images fixes dans ""Me and You and Everyone we Know"" : photographie, vidéo, cinéma"	"This Master’s thesis deals with the animation of still images in Miranda July’s 2005 film, Me and You and Everyone we Know. More specifically, it analyses the artistic practices of Christine Jeperson, a video artist who is the main character of the film. This study focuses on the materials utilized by the artist-protagonist and looks at her particular use of photography: her video works all revolve around amateur photographs, clichés, banal images, that she animates via the remediation of video and ""narrativization"" (""mise en récit""). These two principles of animation, that give time and motion to the still images she uses, also produce a displacement of value by turning these images into art and, by the same token, open a specific space i.e. the aesthetic experience of the spectator, for it is in his or her imaginary, in the end, that this animation is produced. Thus, in this study, I wish to look at these “details” within the films — the video works of Christine — whilst seeking to show the relations they entertain with other elements of the film, with Miranda July’s body of works, as well as with other moments in art history that relate to this animation apparatus, in order to historicize the practices of Christine / July. This Master’s Thesis wishes to illuminate a specific kind of contemporary visual practice, at the intersection of photography, video and film."

1372	Bits et Rarezas : deux compositions assistées par ordinateur	This project consists in the composition of two electroacoustic pieces for fixed media entitled Bits and Rarezas. Both works are based on sounds created in Max/MSP programming environment, a tool that has enabled an approach based mainly on the composition of sound by the manipulation and organization of very simple sound materials, such as microsounds and sinusoidal waves. The algorithms implemented in Max were used to efficiently control these sounds, building the complex sound textures used in the pieces.  The first chapter is centered on the basic technical and aesthetic ideas that have guided me. These concepts include microsound, granular synthesis and electronic minimalism. For the second chapter I begin with an overview on the Max patches used, focusing on the concepts behind the algorithms as well as on the interaction strategies used to model the sound. The remaining part of the second chapter discusses in more detail the five patches Max used in the project, presenting a description of the user interfaces, as well as a discussion of the typical procedures to compose different types of sounds. A few sound excerpts have been included in the accompanying CD to illustrate the possibilities shown. Finally, the last chapter analyses in detail the pieces Bits and Rarezas. In order to describe the sounds and textures included in the pieces, I have used as a reference the terms proposed by Pierre Schaeffer in his seminal work: Traité des objets musicaux.

1373	Technologies de l'information et de la communication (TIC) et rendement académique en contexte universitaires béninois : cas des apprenants en droit de l'Université d'Abomey-Calavi	This study attempted to determine whether a qualitative relationship existed between information and communication technologies (ICT) and academic performance in universities in Benin. The aim was to understand how ICT may be used to significantly improve inadequate student grades, particularly in bachelor programs. This study is particularly relevant at a time when ICT are increasingly part of university life, and when students use ICT more than their professors do.  The research framework is therefore structured around the concepts of teaching and learning with ICT, motivation in education, and academic performance.  To achieve our objectives, we used a mixed quantitative and qualitative approach to conduct a descriptive and explicative study. We administered a survey questionnaire to 156 students and 15 professors and held interviews with 11 students and 6 professors.  The main results are presented in articles on the impact of ICT on motivation and academic success, the most frequent uses of ICT by students, and the role of ICT in the teaching practices of law professors at the Université d’Abomey-Calavi, Benin. More precisely, the results show that most of the participants had an overall positive perception of the motivational potential of ICT for teaching and learning. Nevertheless, out of a maximum score of 7 (very strong), respondents rated their perception of the positive impact of ICT use on academic performance at 4 (moderate) on average. Hence, their perception of the relationship between learning with ICT and success was generally middling. Crossing the results of the quantitative data with the results of the qualitative analysis concerning this aspect revealed a pronounced positive perception of the relationship between ICT and performance. Results also show that the most frequent uses of ICT by students are email (heading the list), followed by research and word processing, at once a week on average. These uses do not really amount to ICT for academic purposes.  Among professors, results also showed that ICT are not yet being fully applied to teaching practices. They are used more for personal than for pedagogical purposes.  The conclusion is that we have not yet found a direct qualitative relationship between ICT and academic performance in universities in Benin.

1374	Indicateurs de durabilité urbaine selon une approche épidémiologique : la ville de Maringá, au Brésil	The aim of this research is to contrast the effects of urban development with environmental conservation practices. The investigation focuses on socio-economic segregation and its impact on sustainability, as measured by specific sustainability indicators. The city of Maringa in Central Brazil was selected as a case study, applying a targeted analysis to certain neighbourhoods. The study set out to determine which urban sustainability indicators are most appropriate to identify those neighbourhoods with the most sustainable practices and life-styles, assuming a fundamental link between sustainability practices and awareness of social and environmental responsibility.  Using a epidemiological, but not anthopocentric, approach, this research contributes to and enriches the urban sustainability discourse by proposing a theoretical framework and model for the systemic construction of viable urban sustainability indicators. Applying these indicators to demographic and socio-economic data analysis results in a way of assessing urban sustainability that diverges from the socio-economic stratification approach of the HDI. This approach to sustainability assessment is validated through being applied to two sample areas of Maringa: the neighbourhoods of Conjunto Residencial Inocente Villanova Júnior and of Zona 05, using corrélations between ecological footprint, satisfaction index, social integration index, residents' health habits and body weight. Results suggest that income has a strong influence on household ecological footprint. However, in 10 % of cases a sustainable footprint is possible even in households with high incomes. Additional studies are recommended to refine the proposed model.	socio-economic analysis , urban sustainability indicators , epidemiological method , healthy communities , tropical sustainable cities , Brazil	en	5138.0
1375	Portée et limites du principe de non refoulement de l'article 33 de la Convention relative au statut des réfugiés dans le contexte du traitement extraterritorial des demandes de statut de réfugié	For the past few years, States have been adopting policies aimed at separating the admission of refugees on a territory from the determination of their refugee status. In Europe, this kind of political choice is usually designated by the term externalization. However, we have used the term extraterritorial to qualify this process, as we felt that externalization lacked objectivity. Indeed, externalization contains an implicit criticism of our research object.    In Europe, these extraterritorial policies have not yet attained a legal status.  Indeed, no legal rules are being currently applied which provide for the dissociation between admission and determination. Nevertheless, this idea is part of ongoing reflections and it remains an objective of the European agenda.    This thesis analyzes the legality of the European proposal related to an extraterritorial treatment of the status of refugee, in light of the theoretical principle of non-refoulement which is at the heart of the protection granted to refugees by international refugee law. To this end, it is necessary to analyze the scope and the legal limits of the non-refoulement principle in regards to its interpretation and implementation. Although there exists a lively debate on this issue, extraterritorial treatment of refugee claims does not, at least prima facie, violate the principle of non-refoulement enshrined in s. 33, para. 1 of the Convention relating to refugee status.

1376	Assymétries cérébrales lors de traitement de l’information visuelle rapide : investigations chez une population clinique et neurologiquement saine	The Attentional Blink (AB) refers to a transient impairment in the accurate report of a second target (T2) if it closely follows the presentation of a first target (T1) in a rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP), when both targets must be reported. This study investigated both the possibility of hemispheric asymmetries of attentional processes as well as the possibility that presenting targets to different hemispheres could diminish the AB in neurologically intact participants and abolish it in the case of a split-brain patient. To do so, a modified AB paradigm was used in which targets could appear in any of four simultaneous RSVP streams, one in each quadrant of the visual field, so as to have trials in which both targets were presented to the same hemispheres and trials in which targets were presented to different hemispheres. Although no evidence of a diminished AB was observed by presenting targets to separate hemispheres, in both neurologically intact individuals and the split-brain patient, overall accuracy was higher when targets were presented to separate hemispheres. A left hemisphere advantage was only observed in the split-brain patient.	cognitive neuroscience , visual-spatial attention , Split-Brain , attentional blink , hemispheric asymmetries , neurosciences cognitives	en	5132.0
1377	Morphological and functional characterization of placenta during gestation in bovine clones derived by somatic nuclear transfer	Although somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) has been shown to be successful, there are still problems with this technique that is inhibiting its use in industry.  Altered placental formation and development results in the high incidence of pregnancy loss and prenatal morbidity and mortality found in SCNT pregnancies.   The objective of the initial study was to characterize morphological changes in fetal membranes of a group of bovine recipients carrying cloned fetuses and comparing them with control AI fetuses at various stages of gestation. Several morphological anomalies of placentomes such as edematous chorioallantoic membrane, hyper-echodense spikes or irregularities in the amniotic membrane as well as the pathological presence of degenerated inflammatory cells accompanied by disappearance of the placental epithelium were observed. It was concluded that these anomalies compromise fetal development. The results of this work also showed that ultrasonography may be a reliable technique to monitor and to characterize the placental changes in bovine pregnancies that can be used to assess fetal well-being.  The next study compared the functionality of the placenta of cloned fetuses with controls. The concentration of three steroids (progesterone (P4), estrone sulphate (E1S), and estradiol (E2)) and pregnancy-specific protein B (PSPB) in maternal peripheral circulation were assessed and their associations with gestational anomalies were determined. The hormones profiles in the SCNT recipients deviated from the control group at certain stages of pregnancy.  We observed higher concentrations of E2 throughout the study period, lower levels of P4 at day 80 as well as elevated PSPB concentrations at day 150 in SCNT recipients which coincided with high rate of abortion in these animals shortly after this stage. So, it is proposed that these hormonal changes together with the morphological anomalies of the placenta result in compromised fetal development.  Finally, the molecular mechanism that could be responsible for the abnormal disappearance of the epithelial layer observed in SCNT placenta was investigated. To do so, we measured the expression of two major epithelial adherens junction proteins (E-cadherin and β-catenin) and determined if their expression is altered in relation to the aberrant placentation in SCNT embryos. Cotyledonary tissues from SCNT gestations and control pregnancies were analyzed by Western blot, quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemical analysis. Both candidates were significantly (P < 0.05) under-expressed in SCNT trophoblast cells at the protein level. Also, qRT-PCR confirmed that the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway target genes CCND1, CLDN1 and MSX1 were significantly down-regulated in SCNT placentas. So, we inferred that impaired E-cadherin and β-catenin protein expression, along with defective β-catenin signaling during embryo attachment, specifically in the window of placentation, results in loose attachment and contributes to insufficient placentation in bovine SCNT-derived embryos.  Overall, we concluded that during the high-risk pregnancy of cloned fetuses, characterization of the morphological and functional changes of the placenta is critical to enable us to predict normal fetal development and wellbeing through a standardized procedure during clone gestations and to intervene medically in emergency cases to improve the overall efficiency of cloning in cattle.

1378	Causes multiples de décès chez les personnes âgées au Québec, 2000-2004	To this day, mortality analysis has primarily focused on the underlying cause of death which represents the disease or injury which initiated the sequence of morbid events leading to the death. But since death is due to a complex process, especially at advanced ages, analysis based solely on this concept has its limitations and some causes are more likely to be identified as the underlying cause than others. Selecting only one cause per death may influence the relative importance of the various causes of death. Multiple causes of death statistics provide a more complete view of mortality patterns.   The analysis of multiple causes of death among the elderly in Quebec for 2000-2004 identifies certain conditions that contributed to death, but have not been selected as the cause that initiated the disease process. This is particularly the case of hypertension, atherosclerosis, sepsis, influenza and pneumonia, diabetes mellitus and nephritis, nephrotic syndrome and nephrosis.   This research therefore demonstrates the importance of taking into account multiple causes in order to provide a more accurate portrait of Quebec's mortality at older ages that allows analysis of the underlying cause alone.

1379	"Une architecture parallèle distribuée et tolérante aux pannes pour le protocole 
interdomaine BGP au cœur de l’Internet"	The increasing number of end users has led to an exponential growth in the Internet routing table. The routing table is expected to reach a size of one million prefixes within the coming few years. Besides, current core routers may easily attain hundreds of connected BGP peers simultaneously. In classical monolithic architecture, the BGP protocol runs as a single entity inside the router.  This architecture suffers from two drawbacks: scalability and reliability. BGP scalability can be measured in terms of the number of connected peers that can be handled and the size of the routing table. On the other hand, the reliability is a critical issue in core routers. If the BGP instance inside the router fails, all peers’ connections will shutdown and the new reachability state will be propagated across the Internet in a non trivial convergence delay. Although, in current core routers, the resiliency is increased considerably, it’s mainly implemented via a primary-backup redundancy scheme which limits the BGP scalability. In this thesis we address the two mentioned BGP drawbacks by proposing a novel distributed approach to increase both scalability and reliability of BGP without changing the semantic of the protocol. The BGP distributed architecture in the first paper is built to satisfy both requirements: scalability and reliability by adequately exploiting parallelism and module separation. In our model, BGP functionalities are split in a master-slave manner and the RIB (Routing Information Base) is replicated to multiple controller cards, to form a cluster of parallel computing entities. In the second paper, we address the fault tolerance of BGP within the distributed architecture presented in the first paper. We prove analytically that, by adopting the distributed architecture of BGP the availability of BGP will be increased considerably versus a monolithic architecture. In the third paper we propose a distributed parallel scheme called DRTP to partition the BGP routing table on multiple controller cards. DRTP aims at increasing the BGP scalability and the parallelization of the Best Match Prefix algorithm.

1380	Vers une théorie philosophique du processus créatif artistique	Despite the otherwise noteworthy efforts for honorific theorisation on the part of contemporary philosophers, it is our concern here that nothing much has been done in this field concerning the growing but still misunderstood field of creativity in terms of “descriptive” accounts. Recent discoveries in the arts and psychology have witnessed a growing and justified interest for this very kind of research, which has earned, we believe, its rightful place alongside the most debated philosophical questions. This theory tries to point out some of the most intricate psycho-phenomenological structures of real-life creativity, some of it general (all domains combined) and some more institution-specific. For the sake of this thesis, we have limited the field of our inquiry to the most notorious case, which is now considered to be the arts. It is our belief that every descriptive theoretical enterprise wishing to initiate an understanding of these worlds in a truthful and respectful way should, at least, be mindful of this structure.	art , processus , philosophy , creativity , art , theory , psycho-phenomenological , process	en	5061.0
1381	Analyse des tendances et configurations de la criminalité au Québec à l’aide d’un indice de gravité de la criminalité	"The traditional measure of the criminality (rate for 100 000 inhabitants) raises problem in the analysis of the variations of the criminality in time or space. The problem is due to the fact that the rate of criminality is essentially determined by less serious and very frequent crimes. The present study allowed testing the utility of a new tool developed by Statistics Canada which gets an index of ""severity of criminality"" in which every crime is weighted by its score of severity (based on the sentencielles decisions average in Canada from 2002 till 2007 for every kind of crime. Applied to the official statistics of Quebec from 1977 till 2008, our analyses show that the indication of gravity turns out to be a useful measure to draw up a more realistic portrait of the trends of violent crimes from one year to the next. More precisely, the crime seriousness index shows that the rate of violent crimes remained stable from 1977 till 1992, on contradiction to what is shown by traditional rate which rather demonstrates a huge rise during this period. Crime seriousness index can also be used towards violent crimes, in order to compare more adequately territories, to establish those who show more serious crimes. However, among global criminality and crimes without violence, the indication of gravity is of no utility and presents the same reading of the criminality as traditional measures. It explains that it is always the same crimes (thefts, mischief and breaking and entering) that contribute mainly to each of both measures of the criminality."	crime analysis , trends of criminality , crime seriousness , weighted crime severity index	en	5048.0
1382	Mémoire de la culture, mémoire de la barbarie : l’intertextualité dans le témoignage de Jorge Semprun sur le camp de Buchenwald	This essay covers the issue of intertextuality in the four works that Jorge Semprun (1923-) wrote about his memories from Buchenwald : Le grand voyage (1963), Quel beau dimanche! (1980), L’écriture ou la vie (1994) and Le mort qu’il faut (2001). Each work stems from the search of an apropriate language for narrating an experience that poses a radical challenge to its représentation. Intertextuality, as well as memories of works of art, yield a complex image of the experience of a survivor, where shadow and light, anguish and joy, Radical Evil and fraternity coexist, far away from the traditional cliché. The objective here is to read Semprun’s wounderfull testimonies as a profound dialogue between art and the Holocaust, creation and destruction, cultural memory and traumatic memory.

In this study, we test the hypothesis that DWI recidivists (R) will exhibit poorer decision-making performance on the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), and in line with the Somatic Marker Hypothesis, weaker anticipatory somatic activation (using skin conductance response as index) than non-offenders (C, comparison group).   Methods: DWI recidivists and non-DWI control drivers were recruited, [R (n=23) and C (n=24), mean ages (± SD) 44.17(10.03) and 37.29 (10.60) years respectively]. Participant selection criteria included ≥ 18 years old and ≥2 DWI convictions for group R and 0 DWI convictions lifetime and a driver’s license for group C. The participants performed the IGT, a decision-making neurocognitive task containing 100 card selection trials that we divided into 5 blocks for analyses. A 2 (group) x 5 (blocks) repeated measures ANOVA was used to compare group R performance on the IGT versus group C, followed by post hoc independent t-tests on aggregated blocks 1-2 (decision under ambiguity) & 3-5 (decision under high risk) to identify the source of group X block significant interactions. Two 3 (group) x 5 (blocks) repeated measures ANOVAs (for good decks and for bad decks) were used to compare the aSCR of groups C and R. Results: ANOVA repeated measures on blocks 1 to 5 produced a significant effect of group by block interaction F(1,45)=5.28, p=.03, partial ƞ2 =.11.  Post hoc t-tests on aggregated blocks 3 to 5 were statistically significant, t(45) = 3.38, p = .002. A significant group x block interaction effect was found for good decks aSCR, F(8,160)=2.33, p=.02, partial ƞ2 =.10 .  Conclusion:  DWI recidivists performed more poorly than controls on the IGT, persistently making decisions based on potential immediate gains and neglecting associated loss risks and long-term outcome. This suggests they have reduced neurocognitive decision-making capacities distinguishable from the general population.  While DWI recidivists’ behaviour appears as impulsive, these results suggest that their behaviour pattern involves decision-making difficulties.  Larger sample sizes may be needed to detect a between-group effect in the aSCR analyses, as they were considerably underpowered.	driving while impaired , recidivists , decision making , driving under the influence , relapse , alcohol dependence , neurocognitive function	en	5035.0
1384	Accès social à l'eau : étude de cas dans un village mossi du Yatenga	The purpose of this report is to examine access to water, not from a technological but from a social point of view. Any human society has had to cope with the issue of access to water. This is especially true for the people living under arid climates such as in Sahel, where water is a limiting resource. The village under study is located in the Yatenga region, north of Burkina Faso. I will first examine the space and time distribution of wells and of human groups in this territory, then I will question the regulation of access to water as a political issue within traditional structures. I will show that it contributes to sometimes strengthen and sometimes circumvent patterns of social hierarchy. Then I will study access to water in different social groups: women, men, younger and older people, elders, farmers, herders. I will show that their access to water is implicitly checked, thus limiting opportunities of economical improvement for some of them. In this developing society, disadvantaged users may develop tactics to circumvent these constraints. Thus access to water is taken between conflicting strategies, pertaining to social reproduction as opposed to social change.

1385	"Développement d’un microréacteur à base d’enzyme microencapsulée en vue d’un
couplage en ligne à un système d’électrophorèse capillaire"	The principal objective of this research project is to study the efficiency of microencapsulation, technique used for enzyme immobilization in order to create new types of electrochemical biosensors. Generally, the target analyte involved either produces or consumes electrons and the electrochemical response is measured to identify or quantify the analyte. In the development of a biosensor, it is desirable to quantify the conversion of substrate (analyte) and/or the formation of product of the enzymatic reaction. The structural similarity between substrate and product in redox reactions means that the technique used to determine these species must be very selective. The high resolving power of capillary electrophoresis (CE) for rapidly separating similar compounds is thus an attractive method, particularly if substrate and product can both be monitored during or following the reaction catalyzed by microencapsulated enzyme. A judicious choice of substrate with respect to its behaviour in CE separations can help provide information on enzyme activity as well as microencapsulation efficiency. To achieve this, we chose the substrate o-phenylenediamine (OPD), which is oxidized by laccase to form the product 2,3-diaminophenazine (DAP) concomitant with the reduction of molecular oxygen to water. We firstly prepared the microcapsules and evaluate the impact of microencapsulation on the behaviour of the enzyme. After that, we developed a CE based separation method to quantify the conversion of OPD to DAP by free laccase. We also used the CE method to characterize laccase immobilized in microcapsules. Subsequent, the microencapsulated laccase was packed into a microreactor format permitting its off-line coupling with CE as a means to follow the enzymatic reaction. Finally, we tried to implement the on-line system and the preliminaries results are presented.

1386	Mise à jour et étude de sources de variation des niveaux d’exposition au chlordane, au BPC, au toxaphène et au mercure chez les Inuits de l’Arctique canadien	Traditional food is a part of Inuit culture. Nevertheless, contamination of this food by organochlorines and heavy metals is the subject of constant attention since it’s exceeding Canadians guidelines in some cases. The purpose of this work is to do an update of the exposure estimates for chlordane, PCB, toxaphene and mercury and to explore sources of variation. To do so, new data on concentration of contaminants in traditional food have been combined to dietary recalls collected in the Canadian arctic in 1998 and 1999 assuming that the quantity and the type of traditional food consumed didn’t change.   According to the new estimates, changes in the contaminant database affected more the extremes of the distributions rather than the measures of central tendency. The estimates of organochlorines intakes can be considered updated since the five types of food for which data are available represent the majority of total exposure. For mercury, additional data are necessary for caribou, narwhal, beluga muktuk and lake trout to generate more exact estimates of exposure.   The sources of variation of the exposure estimates have been explored by evaluating the coefficients of variation related to the measure of the dietary intake and those related to the contaminant concentrations in traditional food. The variation attributable to the methods of collecting food intake data is higher than the variability attributable to the contaminant database.  New methods to measure the levels of traditional food consumption should be developed.

1387	Dépistage prénatal de la trisomie 21 et autres aneuploïdies au premier trimestre	In this thesis by articles, we explore different facets of first trimester prenatal screening of aneuploidy. Introduction retraces the origin of prenatal screening and enunciates current biochemical and ultrasound markers associated with aneuploidy. In the first article, impact of maternal smoking on first-trimester prenatal screening results is assessed for Down syndrome and trisomy 18. Both maternal blood levels of PAPP-A and free β-hCG are significantly decreased by maternal smoking while fetal nuchal translucency (NT) thickness is significantly increased. Without adjustment, this results in an increase of false positives, at least for trisomy 18. Based on these results, adjustment for smoking should be mandatory in first-trimester prenatal screening. In the second article, we identify NT threshold values above which biochemical screening provides no additional benefit. In pregnancies in which NT is above the proposed upper cut-offs, invasive prenatal screening should be offered without undue delay. In the third and last article, maternal plasma levels of follistatin- related gene protein (FLRG) are determined for the first time in first trimester of pregnancy. Its potential role as a new marker for Down syndrome is assessed. Although FLRG can be successfully detected in maternal plasma, its levels are not significantly altered by the presence of Down syndrome fetuses. In the general discussion, articles are mainly addressed under a Quebec standpoint. Additional and complementary original data are presented and different clinical research avenues are proposed.

1388	Étude de variabilité photométrique infrarouge de naines brunes	Brown dwarfs are astronomical objects of low mass ( 0.012 - 0.075 M_Sun  ) and low temperature ( T < 3,500 K ).  While they do form like stars through gravitational collapse of a molecular gas cloud, they do not have sufficient mass to sustain nuclear fusion reactions in their core. Relatively hot brown dwarfs (type L) are covered by an homogeneous dust cloud cover that progressively disappears from their atmosphere when the temperature falls below 1,500 K (type T).  Therefore, brown dwarfs near the L/T transition should be partially covered with clouds. Due to the fast rotation of brown dwarfs (2 h - 12 h), this inhomogeneous cloud cover should produce photometric variability observable in the J band (1.2 um), the wavelength at which the clouds have the strongest opacity.  This thesis presents the results of a search for infrared photometric variability in brown dwarfs near the L/T transition. The observations, obtained at the Observatoire du Mont-Mégantic, have allowed the photometric follow-up of nine targets in the J band.  Only one of them, SDSS J105213.51+442255.7 (T0.5), showed periodic variations with a period of about 3 hours with a peak-to-peak amplitude ranging from 40 to 80 mmag.  For the remaining eight targets, we can place upper limits (3 sigma) of 15 mmag for the amplitude of periodic variability over a period range betwen 1 and 6 hours.  While these results support the hypothesis that partial dust cloud covers do exist among L/T dwarfs, this phenomenon is by no means ubiquitous.

1389	Semisynthetic aminoglycoside antibiotics : toward biomimetic synthesis, evasion of bacterial resistance and reduced toxicity	Aminoglycosides are valuable and effective broad-spectrum bactericidal antibiotics against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens, with several members of natural and semisynthetic origin occupying prominent roles in clinical practice since 1950. Nobel-prize winning crystallographic studies on the ribosome have revealed how their diverse polyaminated sugar framework is tailored to target a RNA helix within the decoding centre of the bacterial 30S subunit. By interfering with the affinity and kinetics of the tRNA selection and proof-reading steps, they induce error-prone protein synthesis, and translocation inhibition and lead to a lethal cycle of antibiotic uptake and membrane stress. In retaliation, bacterial pathogens have evolved and disseminated a number of enzymatic and efflux resistance mechanisms. These include N acetyl-transferases, O phosphotransferases and O nucleotidyltransferases, which target the core hydroxyl and amino groups of aminoglycosides promiscuously; methyltransferases, which target the ribosomal binding-site; and energy-dependent drug efflux pumps for aminoglycoside-selective elimination, in Gram-negative pathogens.  The most problematic infectious pathogens which are currently resilient to most unrelated antibiotic classes and in the verge of pan-resistance have been defined ‘ESKAPE’ bacteria, a mnemonic for Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacteriaceae. The world-wide spread of aminoglycoside resistance to current clinical standards, such as tobramycin, amikacin and gentamicin, ranges from 20 to 60% of clinical isolates. Hence, the contemporary 4,6-disubstituted-2-deoxystreptamine aminoglycosides are currently inadequate as broad-spectrum anti-infective therapies. The 4,5-disubstituted class of aminoglycosides are a challenging framework for medicinal chemistry, which includes butirosin, neomycin and paromomycin. Exploring the potential of these alternatives, colleagues in the Hanessian group and collaborators of Achaogen Inc. have demonstrated that paromomycin and neomycin analogs modified by deoxygenation of positions 3' and 4', as well as N1-substituted analogs possesing the α hydroxy-γ-aminobutyryl amide (HABA) chain of butirosin, could produce promising antibiotics. Chapter 4 of this dissertation features the conception and development of an expedient semi-synthetic strategy to access novel aminoglycosides of the 4,5 disubstituted class, inspired from biosynthetic modifications of the sisomicin subfamily, that surmount the wide-spread bacterial resistance mechanisms. This synthetic methodology relies on a novel Tsuji palladium-catalyzed hydrogenolysis developed on model monosaccharides, which was applied to generate a library of aminoglycosides comprising ring A hybrids of the neomycin and sisomicin families. The structure-activity relationships of this new class were assessed against a panel of 26 bacterial strains expressing modifying enzymes and efflux systems to provide an overview of ESKAPE pathogens. Two novel hybrid aminoglycoside analogs exhibited excellent antibacterial coverage, and may be promising candidates for preclinical development. Aminoglycoside therapy is also invariably associated with a probability of nephrotoxic complications. Aminoglycoside toxicity has been largely correlated with the number of amino groups, and more loosely with the extent of deoxygenation. A long standing hypothesis in the field states that because the foremost interactions are effected by ammonium group salts, the tuning of pKa parameters could provide a higher target dissociation rate, more effective clearance and overall less nephrotoxic analogs. Chapter 5 in this dissertation features the conception and asymmetric synthesis of isosteric β substituted N1 HABA chains, modified by mono- and bis-fluorination. These chains covering a range of γ-N pKa values from 10 to 7.5 were applied to advanced tetra-deoxygenated neomycin antibiotics. In spite of the important reduction in γ N pKa, broad spectrum antimicrobial activity was not significantly disrupted for isosteric fluorinated analogs. Furthermore, structure-toxicity relationships, assessed by Achaogen’s proprietary luciferase-coupled apoptosis assay, revealed that the novel β,β difluoro-N1-HABA chain is less harmful in a Human Kidney 2 cell-line model and promising for the development as new generation neomycin antibiotics with improved therapeutic properties. The final chapter in this dissertation features the proposal and validation of the concise biomimetic synthesis and self-assembly of aminoglycoside 66-40C, a remarkable C2-symmetric 16 membered macrocyclic bis-imine dimer. The proposed structure was spectroscopically characterized as an anti-parallel s-trans-bis-azadiene macrocyclic system. Calculations indicate the anomeric effect of the α glycosidic bond between rings A and B is important for pre-organization of the monomeric sisomicin 6' aldehyde and favors the observed macrocycle product. Self-assembly in aqueous solutions was studied through the dimerization of three diverse analogs and cross-over experiments, which demonstrated the generality and stability of the macrocyclic motif of aminoglycoside 66-40C.

1390	Souveraineté, démocratie et gouvernance mondiale chez David Held : le problème de la démocratie au-delà de l’État national	In the context of contemporary globalization, the development of a multi-layered structure of governance forces us to reexamine our understanding of the sovereignty of states and of the practice of democracy. Our objective consists in outlining the thinking of David Held concerning the consequences of these transformations of political governance on democratic theory. First, we shall analyze the consequences of the weakening of the sovereignty of states, from now on shared with diverse supranational organizations, on the theory of the modern democratic state. We shall see how Held responds to the democratic deficit noticed within these organizations, by adapting the principle of subsidiarity to the emerging multilayered system of governance, in order to restore the congruence between decision-makers and the recipients of political decisions, characteristic of the (liberal) democratic activity. Secondly, we shall present the normative foundations of the theoretical model which he recommends to ensure the democratization of this new system of governance. We shall see why today, according to Held, the pursuit of the democratic ideal requires the enactment of clusters of rights, inspired by social-democratic values, which it is necessary to set in the constitutional framework of all the institutions of governance of the contemporary world. Furthermore, we shall see what institutional objectives it is necessary to meet for the realization of a global social democracy. We shall end with a brief critical analysis of his interpretation of the principle of subsidiarity and of his top-down approach to processes leading to the democratization of supranational institutions.

1391	Le rôle du paysage dans l’évolution d’une ville industrielle : la géographie structurale de Drummondville	This research project aims to demonstrate the role of the landscape in the structuring of industrial cities in order to justify its consideration in planning tools. To reach this goal, we will study a factory town located in the Centre-du-Québec region: Drummondville. A three tiered methodology will be applied. Firstly, a historical analysis will be presented, followed by a landscape analysis. Going beyond a mere description of the landscape and of the evolution of the urban form, we will subsequently interpret the results according to the areas of consistency of the structural geography. According to this theory, Drummondville constitutes an area of cohabitation. The role of the landscape in the development and structuring of this type of territory varies according to the prevailing sensitivities. Thus, it is more important during periods that enhance the aesthetic and cultural forms and is less structural when the dominant values favour the rational forms. In the areas of cohabitation where the industrial forces are more constant, utilitarian developments are sometimes created into the landscape. Considering their low value and their struggle against utilitarian interests, landscapes are more often threatened. In this sense, it is even more important to consider them into the planning documentation.

1392	De la typicité des différentes mesures de tendance centrale dans la représentation mentale des catégories implicites	What is the nature of the representations people form of the categories they learn? It is generally accepted that the type of learning task has an influence on the answer to that question. That being said, most of the categorization theories elaborated during the last decades have focused almost exclusively on classification-learning tasks. The master thesis presented here had four objectives. First, to verify if a classification-learning task leads to the integration of more diagnostic dimensions than an inference-learning task in the context of implicit categories. Second, to verify if an inference-learning task leads to the integration of more typical dimensions than a classification-learning task, once again in the context of implicit categories. Third, to evaluate if a prototype enhancement effect can be observed in an inference-learning task. Fourth, to clarify which central tendency measure really presents a prototype enhancement effect: the mode, the median or the mean. Given the results obtained, implications for three categorization theories are discussed. The three theories are prototype theory, exemplar theory and decision-bound theory.

1393	Expression des cotransporteurs cation-chlorure KCC2 et NKCC1 au cours du développement de la moelle épinière de l’opossum Monodelphis domestica	Inhibition is necessary to generate coordinated outputs between antagonistic muscles during locomotion. Inhibition is set by a lowering in neuronal chloride concentration during mammalian development. This lowering relies on the proper balance between two cation-chloride cotransporters, KCC2 and NKCC1. KCC2 extrudes Cl- out of the cell while NKCC1 pumps Cl- into the cell. The opossum Monodelphis domestica is born at a very rudimentary stage of development. Newborn opossums show rhythmic and alternate movements of the forelimbs as they crawl on the mother's belly to a nipple. The hindlimbs are immobile paddle-shaped buds and their development is mostly postnatal. Thus, this species is an ideal model to study motor development. In order to investigate the mechanisms involved in the appearance of inhibition during motor development, we described the developmental expression of KCC2 and NKCC1 on postnatal opossums using immunohistochemistry in the spinal cord enlargements. Motoneurons and primary sensory afferents were identified using retrograde labeling with TRDA. Immunolabeling for both KCC2 and NKCC1 is detected in the ventral spinal cord in the presumptive grey and white matter from birth on, suggesting that the development of inhibition begins before birth, enabling the alternate movements exhibited by the newborns. The developmental expression of KCC2 and NKCC1 follows ventrodorsal and mediolateral gradients, similar to those demonstrated in rodents (rats and mice). The mature pattern for both cotransporters is observed around the 5th week at a time when opossums demonstrate mature patterns of locomotion. Between birth and P5, dendrites expressing KCC2 in the dorsal horn superimpose on the primary afferents, suggesting a role for KCC2 in the establishment of sensorimotor circuits.

1394	Le risque de mortalité périnatale associé à l’asthme et à l’utilisation de corticostéroïdes inhalés pendant la grossesse	Maternal asthma is one of the most common medical conditions in developed contries that can cause serious problems for the mother and the foetus with 3.4% to 12.4% of pregnancies complicated by asthma.  On the other hand, a relatively important rate of of pregnant women, 4% to 7%, uses anti-asthmatic drugs. Stillbirth, neonatal mortality and/or perinatal mortality are the most dramatic perinatal pregnancy outcomes for children and families. However, the effect of asthma and the use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) during pregnancy on these perinatal outcomes have been inadequately evaluated. Most studies that have evaluated these associations suffer from a lack of statistical power and/or a lack or an inadequate adjustment for potential confounding variables.  The objectives of this thesis were to evaluate the risk of perinatal mortality among asthmatic women compared to non-asthmatic women. This thesis also aims at evaluating whether or not asthmatic women exposed to ICS during pregnancy are more at risk of perinatal mortality than asthmatic women who are not exposed to ICS as well as estimating the risk of perinatal mortality as a function of the daily dose of ICS taken by the mother during pregnancy.   From the linkage of three of Quebec’s administrative databases, a large cohort was created including asthmatics and non-asthmatic women who had at least one pregnancy between 1990 and 2002 (n=41 142). From this cohort, two cohorts of pregnancies were constructed. The first two studies presented in this thesis were based on the entire cohort, whereas the third study was based only on the pregnancies of asthmatic women.  A cohort study was first conducted to evaluate the effect of maternal asthma on the risk of perinatal mortality while adjusting for confounding variables derived from the administrative databases. To better quantify the association between maternal asthma and the risk of perinatal mortality, a two-stage sampling cohort design was conducted using additional information on smoking, illicit drug use and history of stillbirths, which were gathered from the medical charts of a sampling of mothers. Finally, the risk of perinatal mortality among asthmatic women exposed to ICS during pregnancy and the risk of perinatal mortality according to the daily dose of ICS taken during pregnancy were evaluated with a two-stage sampling cohort design among asthmatics women only.  Firstly, we observed that asthma during pregnancy may increase the risk of perinatal mortality due to an increased risk of low birth weight and premature delivery among asthmatic women (OR=1.30; 95%CI: 1.05-1.57). However, after adjusting for cigarette smoking, the relative risk of perinatal mortality decreased to 12% and did not remain statistically significant. Finally, no significant increased risk of perinatal mortality among asthmatic women exposed to ICS during pregnancy (any doses) as compared to asthmatic women who were not exposed to ICS during pregnancy was observed (OR=1.07 (95% CI: 0.70 -1.61)) and a non-significant protective effect was observed among women who used 250 ug or less of ICS per day (OR=0.89; 95% CI: 0.55 -1.44)). However, the use of more than 250 ug/day of ICS was associated with a 52% increased risk of perinatal mortality, but the association was not significant (OR=1.52; 95% CI: 0.62-3.76). This increased risk may be explain by an inadequate adjustment for asthma severity and control (asthmatic women who used more than 250 ug/day of ICS may have more severe and uncontrolled asthma).    The conclusions of our work which is rather reassuring can contribute to a better management of asthma during pregnancy, assist physicians in prescribing ICS during pregnancy and reassure pregnant women with asthma and pregnant women who should use ICS. However, additional studies are needed before we can conclude that higher doses of ICS (> 250 ug/day) are safe during pregnancy.	asthma , pregnancy , perinatal mortality , inhaled corticosteroids , cohort , two-stage sampling , administrative databases of Quebec , medical chart , epidemiology	en	4899.0
1395	Web2.0, knowledge sharing and privacy in E-learning	E-learning emerged over 20 years ago, and was merely book like text displayed on a computer screen. With the changes and advances in technology, E-learning has come a long way, providing personal and interactive rich content. Today, E-learning is again going through major changes. Indeed, with the proliferation of E-learning systems and content authoring tools, as well as established standards, it has become easier to share and reuse learning content. Moreover, with the shift to learner centered education and the effect of Web2.0 techniques and technologies, learners are no longer just recipients of the learning content, but can play an active role into enriching such content. Additionally, with the amount of information E-learning systems can gather about learners, and the impact this has on their privacy, concerns are being raised in order to protect learners’ privacy. Nonetheless, to the best of our knowledge, there is no existing work that supports the various challenges raised by these changes. In this work, we address these issues by presenting Cadmus, SHAREK, and privacy preserving E-learning. Specifically, Cadmus is an IMS QTI compliant web based assessment authoring tool, offering the proper framework and tools to enable tutors author and share questions and exams. In detail, Cadmus provides functionalities such as the EQRS (Exam Questions Recommender System) to help tutors locate suitable questions, ICE (Identification of Conflicts in Exams) to help resolve conflicts between questions within the same exam, and the topic tree, designed to help tutors better organize their exam questions and easily ensure the content coverage of their exams. On the other hand, SHAREK (Sharing REsources and Knowledge) provides the framework to take advantage of both the rigidity of E-learning systems and the flexibility of PLEs (Personal Learning Environment) while enabling learners to enrich the learning content, and helping them locate new learning resources. Specifically, SHAREK utilizes a multi-criteria content based recommender system, and combines Web2.0 technologies and techniques such as RSS and social web to promote new learning resources and help learners locate suitable content. Lastly, in order to address the various needs for privacy in E-learning, we propose a framework with four levels of privacy, and four levels of tracking, and we detail ACES (Anonymous Credentials for E-learning Systems), a set of protocols, based on well established cryptographic techniques, to help learners achieve their desired level of privacy.

1396	La responsabilité civile des conseillers en génétique au Québec et les conséquences juridiques de la non-reconnaissance : vers un encadrement juridique?	In recent decades, genetic counselors have played an increasingly important role in the field of medical genetics. Today, their contribution and the importance of their role are indisputable. Their legal status, however, remains uncertain and requires further analysis. Indeed, not being recognized by the Professional Code of Quebec, the practice of genetic counselors is consequently deprived of the protection granted by this Code to other professionals, notably the exclusivity of their titles and acts. Given this status quo and with the aim of protecting the public, a study of the civil liability of genetic counselors becomes necessary. Three main duties of genetic counselors emerge from this analysis: the duty to proficiency, the duty to inform, and the duty of confidentiality. Moreover, there are several legal consequences for non-recognition of this emerging profession. Indeed, the inaction of the Quebec legislator has resulted in a confusing relationship between the genetic counselor and the other members of the multidisciplinary team, especially with regard to the delimitation of services which the counselor can provide. Indeed, the latter may infringe on certain aspects of the medical practice and nursing, thereby engendering his penal liability. This situation leads us to foreign jurisdictions in an effort to find possible solutions which can be transposed in Quebec. The situation in France comes as a relevant example, since the French legislature has legally recognized the genetic counselor as a professional and has protected his title as well as the exclusivity of his practice.

1397	Formulation interactive des requêtes pour l’analyse et la compréhension du code source	We propose an interactive querying approach for program analysis and comprehension tasks. In our approach, an analyst uses a set of basic filters (linguistic, structural, quantitative, and user selection) to define complex queries. These queries are built following an interactive and iterative process where basic filters are selected and executed, and their results displayed, changed, and combined using predefined operators. We evaluated our querying approach by implementing recent state-of-the-art contributions on feature location and design defect detection. Our results show that, in addition to be generic; our approach helps improving existing solutions implemented by fully-automated tools.	program comprehension , source code analysis , source code querying , interactive visualization	en	4856.0
1398	Usages et compétence TIC en formation initiale à l'ENS d'Abidjan (Côte d'Ivoire : le cas des formateurs et des futurs enseignants	Information and communications technologies (ICT) play an ever-increasing role in every aspect of our lives, including education. To encourage teachers to make effective use of ICT in their classrooms, it is important to consider how teacher educators and preservice teachers employ them in initial training programs. The research objective was therefore to conduct a qualitative exploratory study to document ICT use and competence in an initial teacher training program at the École normale supérieure (ENS) d’Abidjan, Ivory Coast. We held individual, semi-directed interviews with teacher educators (n = 9) and preservice teachers (n = 15) and analyzed them using a content analysis approach. Results are presented as scientific articles.  We also attempted to describe ICT use by preservice teachers and to develop a profile of teacher educators who used ICT in the initial teacher training program at ENS d’Abidjan. In addition, we examined ICT use by preservice teachers in their initial training in terms of specific components of ICT competence.  Based on the results, we developed a typology of ICT use by preservice teachers in their initial training program. We also developed three profiles of teacher educators, as follows:  1. Beginners, who used ICT solely to do research and produce documents 2. Intermediates, who, in addition to research and document production, used computerized communication tools in their professional practice, and frequently used ICT in the classroom  3. Adepts, who, in addition to communication for professional purposes and integration of ICT in the classroom, used educational Web pages.  Moreover, from the analysis of the interviews with preservice teachers concerning their ICT use, ICT competence appears to vary across four of its components. Furthermore, although preservice teachers did not have a critical attitude toward ICT, they were aware that ICT could benefit their training. Thus, they used ICT to communicate, find information and interpret it in order to solve problems, and set up networks for exchange and continuing professional development. Although effective integration of ICT into initial teacher training in Ivory Coast has not been fully realized, teacher educators and preservice teachers are nevertheless using ICT in teacher training.

1399	Évaluation des coûts de traitement de la tyrosinémie de type I	Introduction : Tyrosinemia type I is a severe genetic disorder. Symptoms include hepatic,renal and neurological manifestations. NTBC became the first-line therapy in 1994. This drug has led to a drastic improvement in the prognosis. Objective : To evaluate direct medical costs of healthcare services related to the treatment for this disease. This economic evaluation was conducted among the 3 following groups: an historical group of untreated patients, a late-treatment group and an early-treatment group with NTBC. Methods : The costs-consequences analysis includes costs incurred by hospitalizations, medical services and related treatments. Data are derived from the RAMQ and Med-Echo administrative databases and patients’ hospital charts. Results : NTBC treatment is associated with a significant reduction in hospitalizations, intensive care unit stays and liver transplantations. The cost of hospitalizations is significantly less for both treated groups (13,979 $, 6,347 $ and 673 $ per year-patient for the historical group, the late-treatment and the early-treatment group, respectively; pvalue< 0,0001). The cost of hospitalizations for liver transplantations per year-patient is 4,676 $ for the historical group and 3,567 $ for the late-treatment group. The cost of NTBC per year-patient is 66,965$ and 51,493$ for the late-treatment and the earlytreatment groups, respectively. Conclusion : These results demonstrate that NTBC treatment results in a major reduction in healthcare resources utilization, liver transplantations and associated costs.

1400	Las capacidades ético-discursivas como capacidades para el reconocimiento recíproco: bases de un modelo de desarrollo humano	I defend three discourse ethical capabilities for human development: 1) Capability for selfunderstanding; 2) Capability to ground judgements in a dialogue with the affected; 3) Capability to carry out, with others, the justice projects agreed by common consent. Here I interpret them as capabilities for “reciprocal recognition.” I claim that the forms of selfrelation of the subject, defined by Axel Honneth, complement the capability for selfunderstanding. Honneth also offers an idea of justice that reviews the second mentioned capability. But I question the concept of “struggle” in Honneth from the perspective of the third capability, showing the advantages of co-responsibility. Then, I show that the three capabilities can be specified in indicators in each one of the spheres of the society where important ethical issues are confronted, and I give the example of what happens within the business sector. Finally, I defend a procedure to measure such indicators with concrete data. This procedure will allow us to evaluate the ethical level of a society evaluating the “ethical capabilities” of their citizens.

1401	Una propuesta de ética del desarrollo	The ethics of development comprises both fieldwork and consideration of the theoretical frameworks that guide practical action. In this article, such a framework for development ethics is presented, in an effort to link two traditions: those associated with economists Denis Goulet and Amartya Sen, and the present author's own conceptions regarding applied ethics, which are rooted in MacIntyre's concept of practice along with the discourse ethics originally proposed by Karl-Otto Apel and Jürgen Habermas. Within such a framework it becomes possible to emphasize the ethical element of human development work, the goal of the ethics of development.

1402	Moral Loopholes in the Global Economic Environment: Why Well-Intentioned Organizations Act in Harmful Ways	Thomas Pogge’s notion of moral loopholes serves to provide support for two claims: first, that the ethical code of the global economic order contains moral loopholes that allow participants in special social arrangements to reduce their obligations to those outside the social arrangement, which leads to morally objectionable actions for which no party feels responsible and that are also counterproductive to the overall objective of the economic system; and, second, that these moral loopholes are more likely to exist as our economic order becomes more global. Finally, it will be shown that attempts to rectify the situation with voluntary corporate codes of conduct are inadequate. The argument proceeds through analysis of one case study, concerning action by the executive of the Cerrejón mining operation at La Guajira Penisular, Colombia.

1403	Narrative in the music of Jay Chou : a case study of music, globalization and semantics	Can an audience consisting of a variety of different national cultures and traditions come to a common understanding of a single pop song? Using musematic analysis, a methodology devised by Tagg (in Tagg & Clarida 2003), we cross-referenced musical structures not only with other pieces of music in varying musical styles but also with the results from simple reception tests. A piece by Taiwanese artist Jay Chou was played to respondents from various cultural backgrounds. The results were surprising, how was it that respondents from quite disparate cultural backgrounds associated in similar directions?  Does globalization play a role in prompting such similar reactions? What differences in interpretation, nevertheless exist between listeners from different cultural backgrounds? The empirical basis for my study is twofold: 1) reception data based on listening tests and online surveys; 2) detailed structural analysis, including full transcriptions. Relationships between these two information categories will be examined using Tagg’s musematic analysis techniques. It is obvious that it will be necessary to put the above-mentioned semiotic aspects in their particular socio-cultural context, specifically that relating to the Chinese diaspora; more specifically, I shall concentrate this part of the study on members of the Chinese community in Montreal.

It is not only a legislative analysis on the implementation of the Common European Asylum System  as a consequence of the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice by the Amsterdam Treaty, but also it is an assessment of the harmonization level that this Common European Asylum System has reached within the EU, and finally it is an appraisal of the relationship between  the implementation of this Common European Asylum System  on one side and the respect for human rights of asylum seekers and international protection seekers  by Member States and by the Community on the other side.

1405	Notions d'éthique dans la brevetabilité des inventions : une étude de droit comparé	Patent law has for primary goals to promote new tehnological and industrial developments. However, patent law has been currently confronted to some questioning about its role raised particulary by the new advancement made in biotechnologies. Difficult fondamental questions must be addressed at different levels: socialy, moraly and legaly. Following these obersvations, the question to answer, in this study, is whether regulation should be more significant by taking into account some moral and ethical considerations in the process of patentability.  The goal of this study is to compare and estimate the various solutions provided by Europe, the USA and Canada, to determine what could be the answer of that problematic. For exemple, in this context, we can point out the European approach, where the EPC and the Directive of the European Parliamment on the Legal Protection of Biotechnological Inventions (98/44/CE) seem to introduce ethical notions in their legislation. Such approach brings elements which can be discribed as indistinct and progressive in a process apparently defined as technical. But if we take the North American approach, its patentability critea are not based on any moral consideration. So by analysing these elements, an approach could be defined to a more appropriate patent legislation fitting the actual necessities.

1406	Analyse des réponses neuronales du cortex visuel primaire du chat à la fréquence spatiale suite à des adaptations répétées	Primary visual cortex neurons in adult cat are selective to different image properties as orientation, contrast and spatial frequency. This selectivity is characterized by action potentials as electrical activity from the visual neurons. This response occurs during the presentation of a luminous bar in the receptive fields of the neurons. Spatial frequency is the amount of luminous bars in a grating presented from a precise distance from the eyes and is measured in cycles per degree. Furthermore, it was establish until recently that cortical organisation in the adult remains inflexible following the critical period after birth. However, our results have revealed that spatial frequency selectivity is able to change after an imposition of a non-preferred spatial frequency, also called adapter. Following cortical activity recordings, there is a shift of the spatial frequency tuning curves in the direction of the adapter. A second adaptation at the same non-preferred spatial frequency produced a different neural response from the first adaptation. This “short-term plasticity” was already observed in the primary visual cortex for orientation selective neurons but not yet for spatial frequency. The results presented in this study suggest that such plasticity is possible and that visual neurons regulate their electrical responses through modulation of the weights of their synaptic afferences.

1407	Codage de l’information visuelle par la plasticité et la synchronisation des réponses neuronales dans le cortex visuel primaire du chat	Sensory systems encode information about our environment into electrical impulses that propagate in networks of neurons. Understanding the neural code – the principles by which information is represented in neuronal activity – is one of the most fundamental issues in neuroscience. This thesis investigates in a series of 3 studies (S) two coding mechanisms, synchrony and adaptation, in neurons of the cat primary visual cortex (V1). In V1, neurons display selectivity for image features such as contour orientation, motion direction and velocity. Each neuron has at least one combination of features that elicits its maximum firing rate. Visual information is thus distributed among numerous neurons within and across cortical columns, modules and areas. Synchronized electrical activity between cells was proposed as a potential mechanism underlying the binding of related features to form coherent perception. However, the precise nature of the relations between image features that may elicit neuronal synchrony remains unclear (S1). In another coding strategy, sensory neurons display transient changes of their response properties following prolonged exposure to an appropriate stimulus (adaptation). In adult cat V1, orientation-selective neurons shift their preferred orientation after being exposed to a non-preferred orientation. How the adaptive behavior of a neuron is related to that of its neighbors remains unclear (S2). Finally, we investigated the relationship between synchrony and orientation tuning in neuron pairs, especially how synchrony is modulated during adaptation-induced plasticity (S3).  Main results — (S1) We show that two stimuli in either convergent or divergent motion elicit significantly more synchrony in V1 neuron pairs than two stimuli with the same motion direction. Synchronization seems to encode the relation of cocircularity, of which convergent (centripetal) and divergent (centrifugal) motion are two special instances, and could thus play a role in contour integration. Our results suggest that V1 neuron pairs transmit specific information on distinct image configurations through stimulus-dependent synchrony of their action potentials.  (S2) We show that after being adapted to a non-preferred orientation, cells shift their preferred orientation in the same direction as their neighbors in most cases (75%). Several response properties of V1 neurons depend on their location within the cortical orientation map. The differences we found between cell clusters that shift in the same direction and cell clusters with both attractive and repulsive shifts suggest a different cortical location, iso-orientation domains for the former and pinwheel centers for the latter.   (S3) We found that after adaptation, neuron pairs that share closer tuning properties display a significant increase of synchronization. Recovery from adaptation is accompanied by a return to the initial synchrony level. Synchrony therefore seems to reflect the similarity in neurons’ response properties, and varies accordingly when these properties change. Conclusions — This thesis further advances our understanding of how visual neurons adapt to a changing environment, especially regarding cortical network dynamics. We also propose novel data about the potential role of synchrony. Especially, synchrony appears capable of binding various features, whether similar or dissimilar, suggesting superimposed neural assemblies.

1408	Justice pour les crimes contre l’humanité et génocides : point de vue et attentes des victimes	Human rights violations cause thousands of victims every year. Justice mechanisms, such as the International Criminal Court, have been developed to respond to these crimes, but victims remain under consulted. In this study, semi-structured interviews were conducted with Rwandan and Cambodian victims of crimes against humanity. Using social justice theories as a theoretical framework, this study examines victims’ perceptions of justice. The results show that while criminal justice is central in victims’ definition of justice, reparation and truth also are essential components. However, the criminal court’s ability to achieve truth is criticized by respondents creating a gap between the truth that they seek and the truth that they obtain. The quality of decision-making as well as how victims are treated also contribute to victims’ perception of justice. However, victims’ justice objectives vary according to the social and historic context.	justice post-conflit , Rwanda , victims , crimes against humanity , international criminal justice , post-conflict justice , procedural justice , distributive justice , Cambodia , justice distributive	en	4752.0
1409	Obstacles à la persévérance scolaire d’adultes ayant des problèmes d’apprentissage lors de leur passage à l’éducation des adultes	In Quebec, there are many adults whithout a highschool diploma. Among them, several have learning disabilities. Few researches adress the question of their participation to adult education programs. The purpose of this study is to identify the barriers faced by adults with learning disabilities when participating in the public adult  education system. In this qualitive study, twelve learning-disabled adults between the age 18-50 were interviewed. From the analyses of these interviews we observed that the most frequently cited obstacles are dispositionnal and institutionnal. Interpreting these results leads us to conclude that the adjustment and diversification of the institutionnal practices  in the adult education system could increase school perseverance and success among adults with learning disabilities.

1410	Préparation d'échantillons pour l'étude par GISAXS des mécanismes de déformation des matériaux par faisceaux d'ions lourds de haute énergie	The machanisms underlying structural deformations following swift heavy ion beam a-Si irradiation are subject of debate. We investigated the hypothesis of the presence of a liquid phase in the wake of the energetic ions in the thermal spike framework. a-Si samples were prepared in order to track a transient liquid phase by implanting Cu or Ag on the a-Si surface and exposing the sample to a 70 MeV Ag12+ beam. Cu and Ag are both very sensitive to segregation in Si and are therefore thought to be capable of keeping track of a molten transient state by concentrating on the ion track. Samples are to be investigated with GISAXS. Nanoscale implantation masks were developed from nanoporous alumina membranes in order to impose a pattern on the ion impact sites and thus improve GISAXS sensitivitity. An alignment method is also developed for the positioning of pores parallel to the ion beam direction. A nearly equidistant impact sites pattern was achieved by irradiating fused silica through these implantation masks.

These compositions each support a visual project. A choreography, two short films and a theatrical piece were created in a collaborative effort to explore the range and diversity of visual media. An acoustic score played by a small ensemble was used for the choreography X/Y. Both acoustic and digital instruments were used in recording sessions for the score of the two short films Mi Feng and Motel Pluton. The score for L'Araignée, the theatrical piece, is electro-acoustic, using samples, audio files, and digital signal processing (DSP).

1412	Banque mondiale et développement. Pertinences scientifiques des discours et pratiques de développement de la Banque mondiale dans les PED des années 80 à nos jours	 « Our days, Samoff and Carrol note, the World Bank must be considered at the same time as a bank, an agency of development and an institute of research” (2004, p9). The institution of Bretton Woods indeed became in particular within the framework of the development of the Developing Countries, at the same time “ a bank of loan” and a “bank of knowing”. « The laboratory of ideas on the most significant development in the world”, Wilks and Lefrançois (2002) specify.  Ideological and financial partner for the development of the Developing Countries, the World Bank is in addition also, an important figure of world predominance today;  in the landscape of the contemporary international economic relations, a true super power. And so the programs of development which it professes and implements in the Developing Countries, are there also the speeches and practical development dominant.  But this speech of development of the World Bank in the Developing Countries, in addition to it is the dominant ideology of the development there, wants to be an erudite speech also: a body of knowledge of development of scholarship, which in its formulation as in its contents, asserts the membership of a certain rationality, aims at a certain “scientificity”. Therefore, the question which organizes the present thesis is as follows: is the program of development which the World Bank intends for the Developing Countries, for as much rational and reasonable? In other words: which scientific and moral credit this program can enjoy; of which coherence, of which realism, and which social adequacy, can be prevailed such a system of thoughts and actions of development? But to question the epistemological cogency of the PDBM in the Developing Countries, also amounts questioning this position of predominance which the World Bank in these countries occupies. Also we also wonder: this capacity of authority of the World Bank in the Developing Countries, does it draw its legitimacy from a rational base? Can it in this direction resist a critical examination  who wants to be rational?  The feeling which animates us here and which is also the general assumption that this work of thesis tries to validate, is that with good of regards the PDBM enracine rather in a knowingly founded and maintained ideological confusion, that in a rational step convincing, able to resist criticism. Here as in other similar registers, it could be well that indeed, like Gilbert Rist writes it, “the truth or orthodoxy hardly depends on the contents of the speech but rather of the capacity of that which manages to impose it.” (2003)	World Bank , Developping countries , Development policies , Virtual Development	en	4722.0
1413	Le financement public de l’enseignement supérieur et ses impacts au Pérou : une analyse longitudinale (1993 – 2003)	This research deals with public financing of higher education in Peru and its impacts in a longitudinal perspective. It covers a ten-year period from 1993 to 2003. This period is important since this country witnessed major changes in public financing of higher education and in the configuration of its higher education system. The research is based mainly in secondary analyses of relevant data published by national as well as international agencies. Analyses are conducted within an input-output scheme. Financial and human resources (professors and students) are considered inputs, and graduation rates (internal effectiveness) and market labour demands as outputs (external effectiveness). Dependency theory is used as framework for the interpretation of the relationships between public financing and institutional responses and its consequences. In the period considered, public financing diminished by 32% resulting from a progressive disengagement of the State. A major consequence of this disengagement was the rapid growth of the private sector of higher education. While in 1993 there were 24 private institutions of higher education, ten years later there were 46 institutions. The decline in public financing and the growth of the private sector of higher education had measurable consequences on selectivity rates, professorial status, research involvement, and graduation rates. Selectivity rates in the period considered increased in public institutions but decreased in the private ones. Thus the public sector reacted to the decline in financing by becoming more selective; the private sector responded to the increase in selectivity in the public sector by decreasing its rates which translates into a higher student market share. Also, in both sectors, professors are hired on a part-time basis which impacts on participation to academic life and on research production. Moreover, universities, both public and private, favoured applied contractual research as a means of gaining alternative funding to compensate for scarce financial resources. Paradoxically, whereas in the private sector selectivity rates diminished in the decade considered, graduation rates increased and so more than in the public sector. Finally, training programs with higher enrolments in both public and private sectors are those which require less investment in infrastructure and equipments without consideration of societal relevancy. This research reveals that higher education organisations which face an environment with diminishing financial resources devise survival strategies which might have a negative impact on the quality and relevance of higher education.

1414	Développement et évaluation d’une intervention visant la prise optimale d’un traitement antirétroviral des personnes vivant avec le VIH	The key to the success of antiretroviral treatment is optimal treatment taking. At least 95% of prescribed antiretroviral treatments (ARV) have to be taken to achieve long-term suppression of viral replication and so restore and preserve immunologic functioning. However, people living with acquired immunodeficiency virus (PLHIV) have problems adopting and sustaining this level of medication taking over time. Although some interventions have demonstrated they can facilitate this behaviour, in Quebec there are no systematic interventions to support PLHIV in daily treatment taking. The goal of this study was to develop and evaluate an intervention to facilitate optimal antiretroviral-treatment-taking behaviour among people living with HIV. Development of the intervention was guided by an approach known as “intervention mapping.” Accordingly, the theoretical framework put forward by Godin and his colleagues (2005), which includes the factors of self-efficacy and attitudes, was used not only to predict and explain treatment-taking behaviour but also to develop the intervention. In the model, self-efficacy and attitudes are associated with a number of modifiable factors: social support, satisfaction with health professionals and not feeling adverse effects. The goal of the intervention was therefore the acquisition and mobilization of skills in order to affect these factors and, consequently, enhance self-efficacy and positive attitudes towards taking one’s ARV treatment, thus facilitating the desired behaviour. The individualized intervention was structured as four 45- to 75-minute meetings held over a 12-week period with a nurse who had expertise in HIV. A randomized trial was conducted to evaluate the effect of the intervention on behaviour and on the explanatory variables. A self-administered questionnaire, viral load and CD4 count were used to measure the principal outcome variable. vi Measurements of the principal outcome and the explanatory variables were made before the intervention and at 12 weeks and at 24 weeks post-intervention. The sample comprised 51 people living with HIV who were being followed at a clinic in Montreal: 23 in the control group and 28 in the experimental group. Data were subjected to repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). The intervention was found to have a positively trend (p = 0.056) in terms of achieving an undetectable viral load : 43.8 % more persons of the experimental group compared with the group control (78.6 % versus 34.8 %) had an undetectable viral load at 12 weeks and 32.8 % more at 24 weeks (89.3 % versus 56.5 %). Probably the lack of statistical power meant no significant effect was found on the explanatory variables, but the small increases observed in the experimental group are consistent with the theoretical model (Godin et al., 2005). This study contributes to knowledge by proposing an intervention to facilitate optimal antiretroviral-treatment taking among PLHIV.	attitudes , intervention mapping , randomized trial , intervention development , optimal antiretroviral-treatment taking , adherence , management skills , self-efficacy , relations with health professionals , social support	en	4692.0
1415	L’élaboration d’un langage musical basé sur la musique traditionnelle québécoise et influencé par les musiques savantes	This work explains and elaborates the artistic approach of a composer that works primarily with traditional Quebec music and wishes to give momentum to his work by inspiring himself with the jazz and classical idiom. It is divided in three chapters in which pieces of the traditional repertoire and of the classical and jazz repertoires are analyzed in detail. The first chapter describes works of Joseph Allard, Louis « Pitou » Boudreault, Jos Bouchard, and Aimé Gagnon and aims at defining some stylistic elements specific to Quebec's traditional style. The second chapter addresses the pieces Stolen Moments by Oliver Nelson and Waltz for Debby by Bill Evans and explores a jazz in balance between conservatism and innovation. The third chapter deals with original approaches to modality through the analysis of two musical pieces rich in variations: Pagodes by Claude Debussy and Ostinato by Béla Bartók. The fourth chapter presents my own creative process.

1416	Rôle de GPR40 dans la survie et la prolifération cellulaires induites par l’oléate dans les cellules de cancer du sein MDA-MB-231 et de cancer de la prostate DU145	The relationship between obesity and cancer, although established by epidemiological studies, remains relatively unknown. However, about 25 % of cancers could be attributed to obesity. Among cancers that are affected by obesity, colon cancer, post-menopausal breast cancer and prostate cancer are the more frequent. Studies on animal models have suggested a positive association between high fat diets and de development of mammary and prostate cancer.   We have studied the molecular mechanisms by which fatty acids influence breast and prostate cancer cells fate. This work has shown that unsaturated fatty acids, including oleate, can induce cellular proliferation while saturated fatty acids, including palmitate, reduce proliferation. An oleate treatment stimulates lipid droplets formation in the cytoplasm of breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231 and prostate cancer cells DU145 while a palmitate treatment induces apoptosis. The action mechanism of oleate on proliferation was studied more closely. Using pharmacological inhibitors, we determine that oleate-induced cell proliferation involves PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, ERK1/2 signaling pathway and the activation of one or many G protein coupled receptor(s) (GPCR). Oleate induces rapid Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231 and prostate cancer cells DU145.   In the last few years, two GPCRs were identified as being activated by medium and long chain fatty acids, GPR40 and GPR120. GPR40 being expressed in many breast and prostate cancer cell lines while GPR120 expression was null in most cell lines tested, we studied the role of GPR40 in oleate-induced proliferation. Human epithelial mammary cells in primary culture did not express GPR40 nor GPR120 and failed to respond to oleate-induced cell proliferation or activation of signaling pathways. Akt and ERK1/2 signaling pathways activation by oleate in MDA-MB-231 and DU145 cells is potentiated by GPR40 over-expression and inhibited by the use of an siRNA directed against that receptor. However, oleate-induced cell proliferation does not seem to be affected by the presence of the siRNA directed against GPR40. Oleate being a fatty acid, it can enter cells freely by crossing the plasma membrane and part of its effects on proliferation could be attributed to its metabolism. A GPR40 agonist, GW9508, is able to activate GPR40 without entering the cells nor activating oleate’s metabolism. GW9508 stimulates Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231 and prostate cancer cells DU145, but does not induce cell proliferation as does oleate.   These results help us to understand the action mechanism of oleate in breast and prostate cancer cells. Oleate induces GPR40 signalization which is involved in the rapid Akt and ERK1/2 signaling pathways activation. On the other hand, oleate-induced cell proliferation is carried out by a GPR40-independent mechanism, possibly linked to oleate’s metabolism.

1417	Téléphone, phonographe et radio : l'imaginaire sonore entre textualité et reproduction technique	This thesis focuses on sound reproduction devices (telephone, phonograph and radio) that emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. These aural technologies brought forth a new social and cultural context in which hearing became a distinctive characteristic of modern communication. But more importantly, they present new figures which translate different modalities of technological mediation. Technical means to inscribe, preserve, and broadcast matter are embedded socially in a constellation of institutions, practices and discourses ; they also configure particular relations that present a singular worldview that literary thought articulates. Understanding the unfolding of modern sound technologies and how we embody them calls for a critical account of a cordoned off visualist imaginary that accompanies technocultural analysis. This study takes up this question by elaborating a concept which encompasses the imaginary intertwined with sound reproduction media. The telephone, the phonograph and radio use a device called a « transducer ». By conceiving this specific object’s tropological and material structure, I argue that this transduction apparatus presents a new interpretative model that conveys the resonance of modern auditory cultural productions.

1418	La représentation sociale des soins palliatifs chez un groupe de professionels de CLSC	In the present social context, the identification and the comprehension of palliative care workers representations is at the base of their professional education and behaviours as well as of the many changes occurring in health care institutions. The aim of the present research is to describe and better comprehend the representations of a group of health care professionals working in a continuum of palliative care services in the Quebec health care and social services network. It is also to propose educational and organizational interventions in order to bring workers closer to the palliative care philosophy. Semi directed interviews and a content analysis revealed a large variety of representations that were both similar and different in each group as well as in the different groups. Many different meanings were given to each theme explored.  The health care workers palliative care representations contain a variety of highly practical knowings and knowledges that bring together a vast majority of common sense meanings. One point is crucial: palliative care philosophy education should be at the base of palliative care interventions. The education content should take into account the multiple non scientific and ambiguous components of daily work in a palliative care settings since they are part of the process conducting to the appropriation of the palliative care philosophy.	representations sociales , continuum de services , social representations , socio constructivism , palliative care , health care workers , professional practivce , local community health centres , continuum of services	en	4640.0
1419	Variabilité stylistique des occupations du Sylvicole moyen ancien (400 av. n.è. – 500 de n.è.) sur la station 3-arrière de Pointe-du-Buisson : approche typologique	This thesis focuses on the variability observed within an assemblage, made up of lithic and ceramic artefacts, that is felt to be representative of the largest collection dominated by an Early Middle Woodland component known in Quebec. The characteristic traits of the pots transported, discarded, and partly manufactured on the station 3-arrière of the Pointe-du-Buisson complex, are apprehended via a holistic understanding of the notion of «style» which includes all aspects of the attributes it covers, i.e. technological, morphological, decorative and functional ones. Thanks to the application of a typological method, a long forsaken approach, at least in eastern north America, whose specific merit resides in its ability to treat the artefact as a whole, behavioural (cognitive and procedural) patterns visible on the decorated rim sherds have been identified. These are intimately related to the decorative techniques used by the makers, and seem to have changed through time as follows: «vertical or simple» type, preceding the more recent «push-pull» and «rocker-stamp» types.  A comparative analysis, based on a sample of sites located in the Upper St-Lawrence and neighbouring regions, has also revealed great similarities between the ceramic assemblage of the Early Middle Woodland component of BhFl-1d’ and those of Vieux-Pont (Eastern Townships, QC), Oka (Ottawa River), Pointe-du-Gouvernement (Upper Richelieu) and Winooski (Lake Champlain area, Vermont) sites. These results argue for the existence of a cultural manifestation that is very closely related to both the Canoe Point and Winooski phases of the Point Peninsula tradition.  Following the aforementioned conclusions and based on others resulting from recent inquiries, further taxonomic considerations have emerged. While a complete overhaul of the Middle Woodland pattern would be premature, rethinking this taxon appears necessary. Therefore, taxa such as Early Horticultural Period (Snow) or Initial Woodland (Wright, Clermont) are revived and discussed since they may prove to be useful in defining more general, but also maybe more appropriate, anthropological traits concerning the populations that lived along the Saint Lawrence River and its tributaries from the Early Woodland to the end of the Late Middle Woodland.

1420	La diminution des espaces ouverts en Israël depuis 1948 : exploration et discussion des facteurs contribuant à un problème de société	This research examines the loss of open space in Israel, one of the most acute environmental problems facing this country, according to several Israeli environmental organizations. This situation is peculiarly ominous since the beginning of the 1990s while the area occupied by open space has decreased significantly. Fears linked to the proliferation of built area have led to the implementation of national outline plans (NOP 31, NOP 35) which aim specifically to concentrate future development into the main metropolitan regions (Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, Haifa, Beersheba) to ensure that the remaining open spaces will be protected optimally. Several factors are responsible for the loss of open space in Israel. Thus, one of the research objectives is to identify and analyze how these factors have influenced the extent of open spaces. Furthermore, this research provides an update of the open spaces’ evolution over the years. Finally, the last chapter discusses the current issues regarding open space as well as some solutions to enhance its protection. In order to obtain a thorough picture of the situation, the temporal field of this study spans from 1948, founding year of the State of Israel, to 2010.

1421	Le rôle des collections dans la légitimation de l'art marginal : le cas de la collection d'art pathologique Prinzhorn	Modern art began its rise at the beginning of the twentieth century in both France and Germany. Somme art theorists like Francastel, propose an identifying characteristic of modern art is the deconstruction of the classic plastic space. During the two World Wars, many artists used this deconstructive process, thus reinvigorating art with ‘‘primitive’’ styles which challenged the ‘‘civilized’’ art of the day. This fascination with the ‘‘primitive’’, including art from children, amateurs, and the ‘‘mentally ill’’, is apparent in many art collections of the time. By collecting these forms of art, the collectors were supporting this new ideology in opposition to occidental rationalism. The psychiatrist Hans Prinzhorn, along with the art sellers Wilhelm Udhe and the artists Andre Breton, Jean Dubuffet and Arnulf Rainer, are a few of the notable collectors. They each influenced the progress of Modern Art; the impact of which is now evident in contemporary art.

1422	Étude de Necdin par un modèle de carcinogénèse lié à l’antigène grand T du Virus du polyome	Viruses have been used extensively in cancer research and have contributed greatly to the advancement of knowledge as well as to the establishment of important concepts still valid in the field today.  Currently, one of the challenges in cancer research is to better define the individual steps that contribute to the transition of a normal cell to a transformed cell.  To address this important issue, we characterized a model system based on the expression of polyomavirus large-T antigen (PyLT), derived from a virus capable of inducing tumors in rodents.  Importantly, PyLT is able to induce tumors in transgenic mice, although only after a latent period, suggesting that additional transforming events are necessary.  Hence, the PyLT viral oncogene possesses several interesting properties, which suggest that, beside its role in immortalization, PyLT can contribute to the early events of carcinogenesis.  Here, we used a cell culture model to dissect the early changes associated with the presence of PyLT.   The establishment of a gene expression profile associated with PyLT expression in a mouse cell line model allowed us to select a number of genes whose levels were modulated by the presence of this viral oncogene.  Among candidate genes, we chose to further study Necdin in more details because even if only a limited number of reports existed for this protein, there was evidence suggesting that Necdin displays either tumor suppressor or oncogenic functions within different contexts.  We demonstrated that, despite the proposed growth suppressor function of Necdin, its expression was not incompatible with the proliferation in the mouse NIH 3T3 cell line and in human IMR90 primary cells.  Nonetheless, the inhibition of Necdin expression by shRNA confered a proliferative advantage.  We confirmed that Necdin was a p53 target gene inducible by different genotoxic stresses, although its expression was also regulated in a p53-independent manner.  Moreover, Necdin acted negatively on cell cycle arrest in response to p53 activation.  These results suggest that Necdin is involved in a negative feedback loop of the p53 pathway and that abnormal elevation of Necdin expression could contribute to the disruption of the p53 tumor suppressor pathway. p53 activation allows transitory cell cycle arrest under stress conditions and it is also involved in the establishment of a permanent growth arrest called senescence.  Senescence represents a protective mechanism preventing the accumulation of mutations that could contribute to cancer initiation.  As our research supports a role for Necdin in the regulation of p53 activity, we transposed the knowledge acquired from our mouse model to a human model more suitable to study senescence.  The characterization of Necdin expression in human primary fibroblasts at different passages revealed that Necdin was expressed in actively proliferating young cells and its expression decreased gradually during the establishment of replicative senescence.  The same phenomenon was observed during premature senescence induced by both oncogene expression and ionizing radiation exposure.  Moreover, in normal growth conditions, Necdin modulation by gain- and loss-of-function assays did not affect the life span of primary cells.  However, in a genotoxic stress conditions caused by irradiation, Necdin overexpressing cells presented an increase radioresistance comparable to when p53 was directly inactivated.  These results in human cells supports the effect observed in mouse cells relative to the impact of Necdin levels on a p53 response under stress conditions.  We initiated preliminary experiments to address whether our results in cell culture could be translated to human cancer models.  We characterized Necdin expression in two types of human cancers.  First, in ovarian cancer, we observed elevated levels of Necdin expression in low malignant potential serous ovarian cancers (LMP) when compared to aggressive serous ovarian cancers.  Our results suggest that Necdin expression was limited to LMPs, which usually present a wild type p53 gene.  Necdin expression was also found in two ovarian cancer cell lines, which were both non-tumorigenic in a mouse xenograft assay, and interestingly one of the cell line had a functional p53.  Moreover, the characterization of Necdin expression in four prostate cancer cell lines also suggested a relationship between its expression and the presence of functional p53.  In prostate cancer, as in ovarian cancer, Necdin expression seems to be detected in cell lines representing less aggressive forms of the disease.   The use of the PyLT viral oncoprotein allowed us to reveal interesting properties for Necdin.  We propose that, in some contexts, the constitutive expression of Necdin could contribute to cancer promotion by delaying appropriate p53 responses and possibly promoting genomic instability.  The potential oncogenic function of Necdin, and its relationship with p53 as revealed by the research described in this dissertation, requires more investigation.  Preliminary results suggest that human ovarian and prostate cancers could be good models to address the role of Necdin in carcinogenesis.

1423	The institutional choices of politicians : how and why legislators shape Lower Chambers	This thesis is about the institutional choices of legislators. It provides a comparative and diachronic analysis of the institutional development of the National Chambers of Deputies of Argentina and Chile from the 1940s to the 2000s. Based on Cartel Theory (Cox and McCubbins 1993), it focuses on the role played by parties in this institutional development. It demonstrates that despite their differences, the various majorities and pluralities, single-parties and coalitions that ruled these Chambers have maintained and adopted a constellation of organizational rules and norms that advantaged their interests. In other words, they have behaved as procedural coalitions. The analysis of the reforms to the rules of these Chambers and of their directing board and committee systems indicates that ruling parties and coalitions have increased their power during the period, controlled the legislative agenda, structured the committee system, and adopted rules that benefit them on the floor.  In particular, the results suggest that Chilean ruling coalitions have endowed several offices, such as the Presidency, the Chairs of committees, the committee on Finance (Hacienda) and on Rules, with negative agenda-setting power, and that some of them are more powerful than their Argentine’s counterparts. In the case of the Argentine Chamber, specifically since the 1960s, ruling parties have kept control of the Chamber not only by reforming the rules and structuring the committee system but also creating and distributing powerless but permanent positions to the opposition.  The analysis also confirms previous findings made by recent studies in the subfield, specially the professionalism of the Chilean Committee system and the amateur character of Argentine legislators. By contrast, it shows differences in the agenda control between the Argentine and Chilean Chambers that were overlooked.    The thesis is divided into seven chapters. Chapter I introduces the general hypothesis, the purposes and main questions of the thesis, and explains why the institutional choices of legislators matter. Chapter II presents the theory and the methodology. It provides the definition of institutional development and the criteria and predictions used to test the general hypothesis. Chapters III (Argentina) and V (Chile) offer an account of each country’s politics and a description of the Chambers’ organization during the period. Chapters IV (Argentina) and VI (Chile) analyze the reforms to the rules of the Chambers, and the evolution of the directing board and committee systems and conclude with a summary of the patterns found and a preliminary assessment of the general hypothesis. Chapter VII concludes. It sums up the findings, provides a final assessment of the theory, and suggests further avenues of research.

1424	Configuration et exploitation d'une machine émotionnelle	This work explores the feasibility of equipping computers with the ability to predict, in a context of a human computer interaction, the probable user’s emotion and its intensity for a wide variety of emotion-eliciting situations. More specifically, an online framework, the Emotional Machine, is developed enabling computers to «understand» situations using OCC model of emotion and to predict user’s reaction by combining refined versions of Artificial Neural Network and k Nearest Neighbours algorithms. An empirical procedure including a web-based anonymous questionnaire for data acquisition was designed to provide the chosen machine learning algorithms with a consistent knowledge and to test the application’s recognition performance. Results from the empirical investigation show that the proposed Emotional Machine is capable of producing accurate predictions. Such an achievement may encourage future using of our framework for automated emotion recognition in various application fields.

1425	L’intégration professionnelle : perception des médecins immigrants	" Problem: In spite of the increasing number of immigrant physicians who choose to live in Quebec, and of the shortage of physicians, many will not succeed in establishing themselves as physicians in Quebec. Previous studies were often not specific to the professional integration of immigrant physicians in Quebec. And new barriers emerged in each study, justifying the need for an exploratory approach to better understand the subject. Objectives: The objective of this study is to identify and analyze barriers to professional integration and facilitating factors perceived by immigrant international medical graduates who choose to install themselves as physicians in Quebec. Method: The strategy adopted is a case study. It is a qualitative research based primarily on analysis of 22 semi-structured interviews, realized with immigrant international medical graduates, native of 15 different countries. The sample retained is of maximum variation type, according to the country of origin, initial training, professional experience and according to the professional stage of integration in Quebec. Recruitment was conducted primarily with the collaboration of the Centre for Evaluation of Health Sciences at Laval University, the organization ""l’Hirondelle"" and the Department of Health Administration of the University of Montreal. The various themes that were addressed in the interview were derived from the perceived barriers cited in literature, most of which are not specific to immigrant physicians. These general themes are represented by linguistic constraints, socio-cultural, informational, financial, procedural and discriminatory barriers. Facilitating factors that were examined are: financial factors, informational factors, assistance and support to professional integration. Results: The 22 participants consisted of 13 men and 9 women, aged 29-53 years from 15 different countries and with a length of stay in Quebec from 2-15 years. The professional integration barriers perceived by immigrant physicians are primarily procedural, but also institutional, and to a lesser extent, sociocultural. The principal procedural barriers relate to the informational factors, to the assessment of medical knowledge and skills, but especially to the absence of guarantee of residency matching, even after having succeeded in all the required exams. The most important facilitating iv factors are the harmonization of provincial and federal procedures, the relative improvement of information, language support for non-French speakers and the shortage of physicians. Conclusions: The reduction of the many barriers identified in this research, will not only allow to facilitate the professional integration of the immigrant physicians, but also to contribute to reduce the shortage of these healthcare professionals in Quebec."

1426	Le cycle des astres : oeuvre de création suivi d'un essai sur la mise en récit du quotidien	The source/matter for Le Cycle des astres stems from a stenography of the present, snapshots of daily-life that leave trace through diversified forms of writing that I called écriture-temps. The inscription of the present becoming signs from the past represent the double temporality of the texts used as material used in my creative work where drafts, poetry and autography co-occur, and leave trace of a writing project in which the construction of Meaning unfolds through the process. I studied the recycling of archives and the interplay of temporalities, but mostly the construction of the narrative put forward by the text, and its effect on subjectivity. Du surgissement à l’oeuvre furthers this exploration of fragmentary and heteregeneous writing through a critical reading of Annie Ernaux's L’Événement. Writing is shown here as a means by which the essence of a subjective experience is embodied in a text that reestablishes its coherence.

1427	Réflexion sur la mise en œuvre du programme de suivis intensifs différenciés (SID) dans la communauté	In 2005, in the wake of the adoption of the Youth Criminal Justice Act (YCJA) and its attendant restrictions on incarceration, the Centre jeunesse de Montréal - Institut universitaire (CJM-IU) [Montreal youth centre - University institute] launched a community-oriented intensive differential case management program (IDCMP). The clinical internship reported here had the following objectives: allow participation in the cross-sectional implementation of the program, improve the program’s robustness, support program specialists, and develop an assessment tool that would improve this program’s referral process. The results of this internship indicated the necessity of reviewing the IDCMP’s implementation process, specifically through constructive, pedagogical assessment of the congruence of the plan’s theoretical model and day-to-day application, as well of the obstacles encountered. A qualitative methodology appeared appropriate for these purposes. Two techniques were used: field participant observation, and content analysis of written documents (committee minutes). Chen's Program Action Model and the Texas Christian University (TCU) Program Change Model provided the conceptual framework for the internship report. The former’s six components were the basis for an assessment checklist and oriented the global overview of the implementation of the IDCMP, while the latter provided a model of the main stages of change and the individual, organizational, and program-specific factors that favour or hinder innovation. The results indicate that overcoming obstacles to the application of the IDCMP would not require any significant changes to the program’s underlying theoretical basis. Modifications of the program’s implementation process are presented. In conclusion, we consider that the successful implementation of the IDCMP is dependent on certain conditions, and will always be subject to constraints.	Probation , Huey T.

1428	Rôle des ressources humaines dans la performance du système de référence-évacuation de Kayes au Mali	Although proven effective interventions have been transferred from the developed world, developing countries still face high maternal and perinatal deaths. Weak health systems and human resources crisis hinder the scaling up of those interventions. This study is aimed at improving the understanding of the role of human resources, especially the first line staff in a maternal referral system, the evacuation and referral system (ERS) of Kayes (Mali). The implantation of the ERS as part of major strategies for fighting maternal and perinatal deaths has been generalised in Mali’s eight administrative regions. The ERS main components are: upgrading of emergency obstetric care (EmOC); funding by a solidarity fund; and improving transport and communication by ambulance. These components allows for joint action regarding the supply and the use of maternal and perinatal services. Yet, due to the shortages in skilled birth attendants, the extension of the coverage in emergency obstetric services has been made with less qualified staff.  Kayes is Mali’s first administrative region and a cradle of emigration. It therefore offers, with the support of its immigrants, a more diversified primary care provision than elsewhere in Mali. This gives an opportunity of studying the role of primary care staff in the ERS performance. More precisely, the objectives of this research were to: 1 identify characteristics of primary care teams that influenced the ERS performance assessed by the joint mother-child survival and 2) improve the understanding of human resources practices associated with ERS performance.  We combined a systematic literature review with a mixed quantitative and qualitative research design. Kayes  ERS performance was modelised using Michie and West conceptual framework and the motivational process was explored with Vroom’s expectancy theory.  Data for the quantitative analyses derived from an ongoing system of registering all obstetric emergencies implemented since 2004 (GESYRE: Gestion du Système de Référence Évacuation / Management of the Evacuation Referral System) and periodic surveys. A biprobit regression model has been fitted to estimate the effects of the point of entry in the ERS and the primary care team composition on the joint mother-newborn survival. We also conducted semi structured interviews and non participant observations in order to explore human resources practices in purposely selected community health centers.  This research confirmed the importance of human resources in ERS performance. When women’ individual risk factors are controlled for, there is a combined effect of distance traveled and the point of entry in the ERS on one side and the community health centers staff on the other hand, on the mother-child joint survival. The best prognosis of care was found in women who directly accessed care at the regional hospital. Having been transferred from a community health center where there is a physician or more than three professionals increased the mother-child survival probability. Physicians in community health centers develop strategies for a better performance of the health centers they managed: direct implication in care and a competitive care environment.  Primary care managers set up incentives to motivate staff. The motivation process remains however a variable and complex one. The desirability of good results was common for all staff though its motivations varied according to the type of staff. Besides, due to insufficiency of material and multiples intermediate factors, perception of a linkage between effort and result was low.  This increased understanding of the role of primary care human resources in the ERS performance would focus the management of ERS performance on targeted but effective interventions. The workforce could benefit from the study conclusions in identifying and applying best practices. Further research challenges would also be more precisely identified.

1429	Marquage fluorescent des protéines pour étudier les enzymes protéolytiques solubles et immobilisées par la cartographie peptidique électrophorétique	Peptide mapping is a routine method for identifying post-translational modifications of proteins. It involves three steps: 1) enzymatic proteolysis, 2) separation of the peptide fragments by capillary electrophoresis (CE) or high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), 3) identification of the peptide fragments by photometric methods or mass spectrometry (MS). During the past decade, immobilized enzymes for proteolysis have been gaining in popularity because they can be reused and they provide fast protein digestion due to the high ratio of enzyme-to-substrate. In order to study new immobilization techniques developed in the Waldron laboratory, peptide mapping by CE is frequently used, where the total number of peptides detected and their abundance are related to enzymatic activity. CE allows very high resolution separations and, when coupled to laser-induced fluorescence (LIF), provides excellent detection limits that are 1000 times lower than with UV-Vis absorbance. In the typical method, the peptides produced in step 1) above are derivatized with a fluorophore before separation by CE-LIF. Although the detection sensitivity of LIF can approach 10 12 M for a highly efficient fluorophore, a major disadvantage is that the derivatization reaction requires analyte concentrations to be approx. 10 7 M or higher. Therefore, it is not feasible to study enzymes using CE-LIF of the peptides derivatized after proteolysis if the initial protein substrate concentration is <10-7 M because additional dilution occurs during proteolysis. Instead, to take advantage of CE-LIF to evaluate the efficiency of immobilized enzyme digestion of low concentrations of substrate, we propose using fluorescently derivatized protein substrates that can be purified then diluted. Three methods for conjugating fluorophore to protein were investigated in this work as a means to study both soluble and immobilized enzymes. The fluorophores studied for derivatization of protein standards included naphthalene-2,3-dicarboxaldehyde (NDA), fluoresceine-5-isothiocyanate (FITC) and 6-carboxyfluorescein N-succinimide ester (FAMSE). The FAMSE was found to be an excellent reagent that conjugates quickly with primary amines and the derivatized substrate was stable over time. The studied substrates were -lactalbumin (LACT), carbonic anhydrase (CA) and insulin chain-B (INB). The CE-LIF peptide maps were generated from digestion of the fluorescently derivatized substrates by trypsin (T), chymotrypsin (CT) or pepsin (PEP), either in soluble or insoluble forms. The soluble form of an enzyme is more active than the immobilized form and this allowed us to verify that the conjugated proteins were still recognized as substrates by each enzyme. The digestion of the derivatized substrates with different types of chymotrypsin (CT) was compared: free (i.e., soluble) chymotrypsin, chymotrypsin cross-linked with glutaraldehyde (GACT) and chymotrypsin immobilized on agarose gel particles (GELCT), which was available commercially. The study showed that, according to the chymotrypsin used, the peptide map would vary in the number of peaks and their intensities. It also showed that the digestion by immobilized enzymes was quite reproducible. Several quantitative parameters were studied to evaluate the efficacy of the methods. The detection limit of the overall method (CE-LIF peptide mapping of FAM-derivatized protein digested by chymotrypsin) was 3.010-10 M (S/N = 2.7) carbonic anhydrase using insoluble GACT and 2.010-10 M (S/N = 4.3) CA using free chymotrypsin. Our studies also showed that the standard curve was linear in the working region (1.0×10-9-1.0×10-6 M) with a correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.9991.	α-Lactalbumine , Glutaraldéhyde (GA) , α-Lactalbumin , Carbonic anhydrase , Insulin chain B , Naphthalene-2,3-dicarboxaldehyde (NDA) , Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate (FITC) , 6-carboxyfluorescein , Fluorescent conjugation , Immobilized enzymes , Glutaraldehyde (GA) , Peptide mapping	en	4510.0
1430	Infrastructures urbaines et participation publique : le cas de la modernisation de la rue Notre-Dame	This master's thesis is an analysis of participative mechanisms in the planning of road infrastructures in urban zones. The modernization of Notre-Dame Street, in Montréal, for which a decision has yet to be made, and which has been the object of controversy over the past thirty years, serves as a case study.  In order to arrive at a compromise, elected representatives agreed to have several actors participate in public consultations. The analysis centers around requests formulated by participants in the course of these consultations. While the requests that were made were quite similar, they were also very different, thus rendering the actors' other characteristics irrelevant from an analytical standpoint. Municipal and provincial representatives were then placed in a difficult position if they were to modernize the main highway. This entailed arriving at a sociopolitical compromise. In fact, three main discourses characterized the debate. Each of them dismissed, in various ways, matters related to social regulation and public policy. This analysis finally illustrates the limits of public consultation on actors' participation.	discours , public participation , governance , urban highway , discourses	en	4504.0
1431	Régulation du cycle cellulaire par le récepteur natriurétique de type C dans les cellules du muscle lisse vasculaire : mécanismes moléculaires	We have previously shown that natriuretic peptide receptor-C (NPR-C) activation by C-ANP4-23 decreased the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) induced by vasoactive peptides (Ang II, ET-1 and AVP). Since, VSMC from SHR also exhibit an enhanced proliferation as compared to VSMC from WKY, we undertook the present study to investigate if C-ANP4-23 could also attenuate the enhanced proliferation of VSMC from SHR and to further explore the underlying mechanisms responsible for this response. The proliferation of VSMC from SHR was significantly increased as compared to VSMC from WKY as determined by [3H]thymidine incorporation and was attenuated by C-ANP4-23 in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore the expression of cyclin D1, cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (cdk2) and phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein (pRb) was enhanced in VSMC from SHR compared to WKY which was attenuated by C-ANP4-23. In addition, the inhibitor of cdk4/cyclinD1 (NSC 625987) and cdk2 (NU2058) also attenuated the enhanced proliferation of VSMC from SHR in a concentration-dependent manner. VSMC from SHR also exhibited the enhanced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and AKT as compared to WKY which was attenuated by C-ANP4-23.. Furthermore, the enhanced expression of cyclin D1, cdk2 and pRb in VSMC from SHR were also attenuated by pertussis toxin that inactivates Giα protein, PD 98095, a MEK kinase inhibitor, wortmannin, PI3K inhibitor as well as by losartan, an AT1 receptor antagonist. These results suggest that NPR-C activation attenuates the enhanced proliferation of VSMC from SHR which may be attributed to Giα /MAP kinase/PI3K-mediated inhibition of the expression of cell cycle components.	hypertension , SHR , NPR-C , Gi , AKT , cell cycle	en	4494.0
1432	Régulation transcriptionnelle du gène HSPG2 codant pour Perlecan et son implication dans l’ostéoarthrite	Recent work has shown an increase of Perlecan production associated with the terminal stage of osteoarthritis (OA). Dr Moreau’s team demonstrated a loss of expression of the transcription factor Pitx1 in osteoarthritis suggesting its putative role as a negative regulator of the HSPG2 gene coding for Perlecan. To study the transcriptional regulation of this gene, promoter fragments were cloned upstream of a luciferase reporter gene and tested in transient transfection assays. Co-transfections with variable quantities of pSI-mPitx1 and with constructs made with fragments of different lengths of the mHSPG2 promoter demonstrated a transcriptional activity and enhancement of this activity in presence of Pitx1, with variable results depending on cell types. In addition, expression analysis by qPCR on transgenic mice osteoblasts that overexpress Pitx1 showed that the overexpression of Pitx1 correlates with an augmentation of p53, a known Pitx1 target and Perlecan expression. The link between Pitx1 and Perlecan is still poorly understood and a clear pathway involving those two players is not yet established. A better understanding of mechanisms regulating normal and pathological transcription of the HSPG2 gene encoding for Perlecan would allow a better comprehension of osteoarthritis development and the putative role of Perlecan in its progression.

1433	Mécanismes de subversion de l'immunité innée par le virus de l'Hépatite C (VHC)	Hepatitis C infection is a worldwide health problem since the risk to develop a persistent infection is relatively elevated (40 to 60%) and nearly half of the infected patients do not respond to the classical anti-HCV therapy based on a combination of PEG-IFNα and ribavirin. Viral persistence is based on powerful evasion strategies of the host’s innate immune system. In our study, we characterized antiviral response in primary human normal and chronically HCV-infected hepatocytes, a cutting-edge in our field due to the difficulty to isolate this particular cell type. In order to better define the antiviral response in freshly isolated human primary hepatocytes, we stimulated these cells with extracellular and intracellular dsRNA to trigger TLR3/TRIF and RIG-I-MDA5/CARDIF-mediated antiviral signaling pathways. By using qRT-PCR and microarray analysis, we report that both detection pathways are functional in normal human hepatocytes, their activation leading to the expression of both common (IFIT1, OASL, ISG15 and CXCL10) and specific genes (IL28A, IL28B and IL29), these last ones being a signature of the intracellular dsRNA-mediated pathway. HCV NS3/4A plays a key role in the viral polyprotein processing and upon viral RNA detection by interfering with the host’s antiviral signalling cascades. We report that major antiviral genes induction following activation of RIG-I mediated pathway are severely impaired in ectopically NS3/4A expressing normal hepatocytes due to CARDIF cleavage, but can be restored by specific NS3/4A inhibitor BILN2061. Our microarray analysis also revealed a role for NS3/4A following TRL3-mediated pathway activation on regulation of apoptosis and programmed cell death, which could be linked to strategies for the virus to persist in its host. Despite HCV strategies to circumvent the host’s immune defense system, we observed significant upregulation of ISGs and chemokines in liver biopsies and corresponding isolated hepatocytes from chronically HCV-infected patients. However, no type I and III interferon, neither key-antiviral genes (e.g., CCL5) were detected, underlying an ongoing –but inefficient- antiviral response unable to eradicate the virus. Moreover, we obtained significant inverse correlations between ISGs mRNAs and viral RNA in addition to CARDIF decrease, clearly unravelling efficient viral interfering strategies in a context of chronic HCV infection. This sustained -albeit incomplete- hepatic innate immune response is certainly associated to the failure of the classical IFN-based therapy in half of the infected patients and to the chronic inflammation causing liver damages and eventually leading to hepatocarcinoma which is often observed at late stage of the disease.

1434	Pathogenèse moléculaire de la neuropathie sensitive et motrice héréditaire avec agénésie du corps calleux	Heredirary motor and sensory neuropathy with agenesis of the corpus callosum (HMSN/ACC) is a severe neurodegenerative disease associated with developmental anomalies in the central nervous system and mental retardation. Although rare worldwide, this autosomal-recessive disorder is frequent in the French-Canadian population of Quebec because of a founder effect. Different mutations in the gene coding for the potassiumchloride co-transporter 3 (KCC3) have been associated with the disease; however, little is known about the mechanisms leading to the inactivation of the co-transporter. We sequenced 26 exons of the KCC3 gene in individuals recruited worldwide and suspected to be affected by the disease. We identified three new mutations. The functional study of these mutations gave confirmation of a systematic loss-of-function of the mutant co-transporters. As the loss of function occurs mainly via the elimination of C-terminal peptide fragments, we focused on the identification of C-terminal interacting partners. Using different biochemical approaches, such as yeast two-hydbrid, pull-down, and immunostaining, we established that KCC3 interacts with the brain-type creatine kinase CK-B and that this interaction is disrupted by the HMSN/ACC truncation mutations. In addition, a specific creatine kinase inhibitor inactivates KCC3 and shows for the first time the functional link between KCC3 and its C-terminal partners. In addition, we found that anomalies in KCC3 transit—as seen in cultured cells, in Xenopus oocytes, and in human brain samples—is a major pathogenic mechanism that also leads to the disease manifestations.

1435	Mortuaires suivi de La mort-vivance comme motif d'écriture dans Aurélia de Gérard de Nerval	In Mortuaires, a drama in fragments, two sisters meet in a hotel room; Jiji, the oldest, has just found their mother's ashes, dead 10 years ago; she would like to bury the urn, but the youngest, Ge, intends to keep it. It will be the occasion for them to emphasize on their own desire and, much more, to celebrate the dead mother, to reconnect with what remains of her in their memory. The text presents small scenes without continuity, although linked, like an interrupted dialogue, a ceremony replaying the body's breaking into pieces. The memory's fragmentation is the esthetic project of the drama, whose basic dramatic's spring turns around remembering, mourning, and the place of the dead body.      La mort-vivance comme motif d'écriture dans « Aurélia » de Gérard de Nerval is an essay studying the connexion between Nerval and the dead ones. In the story, these ones are very important in the process of writing. Using theories such as psychoanalysis (Freud, Jackson), sociology (Muray) and reading theory (Picard), it will be shown that Nerval, in Aurélia, is a medium and tries to take the dead ones back through dream. The writing of his dreams creates for Nerval a place where the living and the dead ones can meet, a place where everyone has to become a living dead to be in contact with others. In that way, boundaries are blurring and it becomes increasingly hard for Nerval, as for the reader, to distinguish dream from reality.	fragment , Gérard de Nerval , mort , theatre , mourning , memory , mother , dream , death , living dead	en	4455.0
1436	Vers une poétique de la narration : films populaires et romance au cinéma bollywoodien des années 1990	In this dissertation, we study Bollywood productions from the prolific Mumbai film industry. We explore this popular cinema’s form and the new trend that appears in the 1990s, through which representations related to the new Indian middle-class are developed.  In this study, we interrogate the most successful films of the 1990s in order to understand how they deploy their narratives and their storytelling. Proceeding to descriptive and poetical analysis of their narratives, this study is mainly concerned with the treatment of romance, a major theme of this decade. Through this theme, we analyze narrative patterns, stylistic processes, obliquely expressed feelings and the dynamics of the private, public and family spheres. Essentially, we illustrate how the distribution of narrative information situates the spectator in a privileged position organizing the pleasures of his participation in Bollywood movies.

1437	Les mécanismes d’oxygénation sanguine de l’œil en corrélation avec le système respiratoire	Abstract Oxygen is an integral part of the environment. It has a major role to play in the cellular structures of the human body.  The two systems, which are closely related to the distribution of oxygen within the body are the cardiovascular and the respiratory systems.  The transparency of the eye can be used as a way to non-invasively measure the concentration of oxyhemoglobin in the blood which feeds the central nervous system. The capillary oxygenation of the eye was measured using multichannel spectro-reflectometry technology.  Two areas of the eye were studied: the capillaries of the optical nerve which represent retinal circulation as well as the capillaries of the eye at the corneal limbus. Five healthy non-smoking volunteers aged 20-45 years and five healthy smoking volunteers aged 20-40 years took part in this study. All subjects were exposed to hypo and hyper oxygenation conditions.  The experimental session was composed of a continuous recording of 360 seconds.  In the first 60 seconds, volunteers breathed ambient air, followed by a second phase of 180 seconds during which the subjects were either exposed to a condition of hyper (60% O2) or hypo oxygenation (15% O2).  The final phase of the experimental session was an exposure to ambient air.  Cardiac rhythm and arterial oxygenation were measured at the tip of the finger with a sphygmo-oxymeter. Clearly, variations in the oxyhemoglobin blood concentration in the capillaries of the optic nerve or the sclerotic are always directly correlated with variations in the arterial oxyhemoglobin levels.  However, the optic nerve capillaries offer more precision for measurements of oxygenation as compared to the sclerotic capillaries.  In this study, accurate information has been provided on the oxyhemoglobin concentration using spectro-reflectometry of the eye. This technology could become a tool in the diagnosis of various pulmonary or ocular pathologies.	spectro-reflectometry	en	4451.0
1438	Intégration du contexte en traduction statistique à l’aide d’un perceptron à plusieurs couches	Phrase-based statistical machine translation systems translate source sentences one phrase at a time, conditioning the choice of each phrase on very little information. Bilingual phrase table scores are computed regardless of the context in which the phrases are used and language models only look at few words surrounding the target phrases. In this thesis, we propose a novel model to predict words that should appear in a translation given the source sentence as a whole. Our model differs from previous works by its use of mlp (multilayer perceptrons). Our interest in mlp lies in their hidden layer that encodes source sentences in a representation that is only loosely tied to words. We observed that this hidden layer was able to cluster some sentences having similar translations even if they were formulated differently. In a first set of experiments, we compared favorably our mlp to ibm1, a well known model in statistical machine translation. In a second set of experiments, we embedded our ppc in our English to French statistical machine translation system. Our MLP improved translations quality over our baseline system and a second system embedding an IBM1 model.	Global lexicon , Multilayer perceptron , Statistical machine translation	en	4444.0
1439	"Creep show suivi de ""Je est des autres"" : de l'esthétique borderline chez Marie-Sissi Labrèche"	In Creep show, the narrator presents his creeps – some family members who are schizophrenics and inadequately appointed – and revives them by its words. By remembering certain moments when the insanity showed itself to him, he wants to dig up the buried and make them speak by lending them his writing. In a split narrative, which could evoke a collection of portraits in movement, the protagonists are presented as monsters, dreamers or sources of inspiration according to the narrator who literally dives back into the past. Presenting mental illness as the shame and the fear of the words, Creep show is a novel about silence and about the importance to understand adequately the insanity; it is a short narrative of seventeen scenes where the writing of a traumatism is experienced as a love story. The essay entitled “Je est des autres.” De l’esthétique borderline chez Marie-Sissi Labrèche describes the genesis of a “borderline” aesthetic. In a psychoanalytical and narratological approach established on the concepts of the melancholy, the kitsch and the crypt, the analysis tries to show which type of thematic and formal construction supports this aesthetic. With representative elements of the universe of Marie-Sissi Labrèche (the question of the limit, the death drive, the body obsession and the instability), the essay is interested in the way the narrator of Borderline ( 2000 ) offers a reading of the sedimentary identity and a misleading self-portrait. According to these elements of reflection, the hypothesis of a textual machine working in and by the instability (and the otherness) leads the analysis to the idea that writing the trauma could represent an attempt at reclaiming identity through the aesthetic called “borderline”.

1440	L’apolipoprotéine A-I interagit avec l’adhésine impliquée dans l’adhérence diffuse (AIDA-I) d’Escherichia coli : rôle lors du processus d’adhésion et d’invasion	The adhesin involved in diffuse adherence (AIDA-I) is a bacterial adhesin associated with some Escherichia coli strains that might, when associated with toxin Stx2e or STb, contribute to the development of edema disease or post-weaning diarrhea in piglets. AIDA-I is an autotransporter that mediates various phenotypes such as adhesion, autoaggregation and biofilm formation. The main aim of our project was to find potential receptor(s) for AIDA-I.  Pathogens can either bind cell directly by targeting exposed cell surface molecules or use an intermediate molecule as a bridge to lessen the space separating them from their target cell. Serum is known to contain a wide range of molecules so it has been used as raw material for the isolation of a putative receptor for AIDA-I. We isolated a putative receptor for AIDA-I: the apolipoprotein A-I. The interaction between the apolipoprotein A-I and AIDA-I was confirmed by ELISA and fluorescent microscopy.     The capacity to invade epithelial cell enables pathogens to create an intracellular niche that protects them against attacks from the extracellular environment. The present report has shown that the presence of AIDA-I as the sole virulence factor in a laboratory strain, enable bacteria to invade cultured cells but does not promote intracellular survival. Studies conducted on wild-type strain 2787, which express AIDA-I in association with other virulence factors, has shown a significant difference in invasion and intracellular survival phenotypes compared to the laboratory strain expressing AIDA-I.

1441	Classification analytique de systèmes différentiels linéaires déployant une singularité irrégulière de rang de Poincaré 1	This thesis deals with the analytic classification of unfoldings of linear differential systems with an irregular singularity. It contains two papers related to this subject: the first paper presents results concerning the confluence of the hypergeometric equation and may be viewed as a particular case of the second one; the second paper contains the main theorems and results.   In both papers, we study the confluence of two regular singular points into an irregular one and we give consequences of the divergence of solutions at the irregular singular point for the unfolded system. For this study, a full neighborhood of the origin is covered (in a ramified way) in the space of the unfolding parameter $\epsilon$. Monodromy of a well chosen basis of solutions around the regular singular points is directly linked to the unfolded Stokes matrices. These matrices give a complete geometric interpretation to the well-known Stokes matrices: this includes the link (existing at least for the generic cases) between the divergence of the solutions at $\epsilon=0$ and the presence of logarithmic terms in the solutions for resonant values of $\epsilon$. Monodromy of first integrals of related Riccati systems are also interpreted in terms of the elements of the unfolded Stokes matrices.  The second paper goes further into the subject, giving the complete system of analytic invariants for the unfoldings of nonresonant linear differential systems $x^2y'=A(x)y$ with an irregular singularity of Poincaré rank $1$ at the origin over a fixed neighborhood $\mathbb{D}_r$ in the space of the variable $x$. It consists of a formal part, given by polynomials, and an analytic part, given by an equivalence class of unfolded Stokes matrices. For each parameter value $\epsilon$ taken in a sector pointed at the origin of opening larger than $2\pi$, we cover the space of the variable, $\mathbb{D}_r$, with two sectors and, over each of them, we construct a well chosen basis of solutions of the unfolded differential system. This basis is used to define the unfolded Stokes matrices. Finally, we give a realization theorem for the invariants satisfying a necessary and sufficient condition, thus identifying the set of modules.

1442	Étude des propriétés de liquides ioniques protiques en tant qu'électrolytes pour des supercapacités à base de dioxyde de ruthénium	This thesis on the development of room temperature protic ionic liquids as electrolytes in ruthenium-dioxide based faradaic superpacitors consists of three separate studies. The first one establishes which properties of molten salts need to be optimized for this application by using the data obtained from the analysis of a series of protic ionic liquids composed of trifluoroacetic acid and N-heterocyclic bases. The second study elaborates on the effect of colored impurities on the properties of ionic liquids and also reports practical aspects which need to be accounted for during their synthesis. The third study focuses on important structure–property relationships for a series of protic ionic liquids with pyridinium cations and various anions. Altogether, the results presented in here should allow a more efficient design of ionic liquids with desirable properties for application as electrolytes in the future.

1443	Effets d’un dispositif de formation exploitant des vidéos d’exemples de pratiques sur le développement d’une compétence professionnelle chez des enseignants du primaire	The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of a web-based professional teacher development application called “Zooming in on Teaching Expertise”. More precisely, our aim was to evaluate the effect of a training course entailing examples of practice on video and created within the application. In particular, the study focused on participating elementary school teachers’ learning and their intentions to modify their practice with respect to the professional competency: “To pilot teaching/learning situations”. The education reform that has been progressively introduced since 2001 has been changing the direction of teacher training considerably. Its success relies particularly on the acquisition of new professional competencies that are often difficult to develop for in-service teachers. However, the training methods in place at the start of the reform did not seem to be meeting this need as well as expected. The web-based application used in this research project was developed to support teachers embrace this pedagogical renewal by proposing new training strategies based primarily on the observation and analysis of filmed practices, along with a variety of tools aimed at stimulating reflection on the teaching practice itself. The application emerged along others with a similar nature. Yet, still today, little is known about their effectiveness on the professional development of teachers. To examine these questions, we developed a training course that was then undertaken by six teachers. These teachers also participated in two semi-structured interviews and shared notes taken during training. Grounded in an evaluation based theoretical framework, the following three research questions emerged and were pursued: First, in what ways did the model have an effect on the development of the teacher competency it was intended for? Second, what was its effect on teachers’ intentions to change their practice? And third, in what ways could the professional teacher development application be improved in better supporting teachers’ professional development? This framework was later used to guide the analysis and interpretation of the data collected. A substantial amount of data was collected, enabling us to document and increase our understanding of the role of this web-based video mediated application. This allowed us to confirm the positive effect of online video based professional teacher development applications. In particular, we observed that the teachers were able to define the components of the targeted competency more clearly. The participants confirmed having learned from the video examples and training and expressed the intention to bring change in their own practice. All teachers greatly appreciated the training course and its videos, particularly the opportunity to observe peers who struggled like them, and to explore ways of putting the knowledge into practice in their own classrooms. In addition, the participants’ comments and suggestions helped identify areas for improvement of the application, such as reducing the number of videos and competency elements presented, or increasing the complementary educational content accompanying the videos. These suggestions for improvement should however still be further explored and discussed, and may lead to new research questions and further follow-up studies.

1444	Violence, sexualité et double : les représentations féminines dans Perfect Blue et Paprika de Kon Satoshi	The present thesis consists of a thematic analysis of the feminine representations in Satoshi Kon’s work, from Perfect Blue to Paprika. Our objective is to demonstrate that these female depictions reflect the status of women in contemporary japanese society. To this end, we examined the director’s movies according to feminist film theory. Also, we separated our analysis in three themes : violence, sexuality and the double.  It seems that Kon’s feminine representations possess parallels to the present Japanese society. Indeed, the director uses figures and narrative motifs common to Japan and anime in order to produce and reproduce gender stereotypes. In addition, he utilizes filmic elements and the particularities of the anime medium to support these definitions of sexual roles.  This study is original in its feminist and psychoanalytic approach which is rarely employed by anime theorists. Furthermore, the studies regarding this medium are fairly new and usually focus on the anime easthetic and the establishment of a Japanese national identity rather than the construction of gender in a popular culture media.

1445	"L'altérité selon Lévinas et Ricoeur comme
prémisse éthique au dialogue judéo-chrétien"	The Otherness is the focus of my thesis, a notion that emanates from Emmanuel Levinas’ and Paul Ricoeur’s philosophies; I’m interested more precisely about the concept of ethics and to discover how it improves the reflection upon Jewish and Christian dialogue. The initial point of my reflexion is the biblical hermeneutics that Emmanuel Lévinas and Paul Ricoeur structure, to my point of view, variously depending their religious background: Jewish for Lévinas and Christian for Ricoeur. Nevertheless, the ethical signification of the Bible perpetuates for both of them as a commonplace, even if the signification is different and inherent to their own religious traditions. In my thesis, the Otherness, as elaborated by Lévinas, will be compared with Ricoeur’s thoughts, whom conception is more Christian as his biblical works let us guess. Even if Lévinas and Ricoeur have tried to distinguish their philosophical work from their theological one, claiming a neutrality about theology, my initial hypothesis take an hermeneutical freedom which often oscillates between theology and philosophy and which try to recount the alterity and its intrinsic link to ethics. A comparatist reading will lead me to think that the ethics of the Otherness is the basis of Jewish and Christian dialogue because of Levinas’ and Ricoeur’s works. My work in religious studies is based upon hermeneutics and turns toward an ethical and dialogical perspective; it is this interreligious mediation aim which confers to my thesis a belonging in this discipline.

pour l'évaluation de la lecture en français langue seconde 
des nouveaux arrivants au Québec"	This research has been conducted within the assessment procedure of the language competence of adult immigrants, for placement purposes in French courses. It relates to the dimensionality as well as the objective and subjective difficulty of discrete or integrated reading tasks at different proficiency levels.  Analyses of linguistic proficiency estimates are proposed in relation with candidates’ linguistic groups. In order to conduct this study successfully, a 6-text and 30-item test has been constructed and administered to 118 immigrants.  These immigrants were enrolled in French courses offered by the Ministry of Immigration and Cultural Communities (MICC) in language schools at the Université de Montreal and the Université du Québec à Montréal. After the administration, analyses have been made on the dimensionality and difficulty of the discrete and integrated tasks and on the interactions between the tasks and different groups of candidates.  More detailed analyses have been made on candidates and items at similar levels. Finally, we were able to study the candidates’ perceptions of task difficulty. Although the study is based on a provisional test, the dimensionality of discrete and integrated tasks has been distinguished. Differences in the way the 2 types of task work have been shown. Finally, the candidates’ interpretation of difficulty and therefore, their view of the test, are better understood. In fine, proposals are made in regard with the proper use of discrete and integrated tasks in an adaptive placement test in second language.	immigration , MICC , Rasch , lecture , measurement , IRT , task , language , assessment , reading , DIF	en	4374.0
1447	Évolution du droit et de la fonction de juger dans la tradition juridique occidentale : une étude sociohistorique de l’indépendance judiciaire	This thesis examines the function of the judiciary in the legal system in a historical and sociological perspective. Through the lens of history and sociology, the author reviews and considers the changes in the role of the judge in the development of law. The heuristic benefit of this approach borrowed from history and systemic theory, is invaluable. Firstly, it demonstrates that the place reserved for the judicial creation of law in the legal system is tributary to what is considered as the source and legitimacy of law. Secondly, it sets in an evolutionary perspective the significant changes that occurred in the development of law and the judicial function. The characterization of the judicial function evolves from a political science’s viewpoint to a legal perspective. Through this reappropriation by the legal science, the judicial production of law can now be examined in its systemic function. As well, exploration of the sources of the function of justice renders possible and understanding of the rationale used by judges throughout history to legitimize their position in the legal system.  The thesis supports the proposition that, along with legal conditions relating to the status of judges, a set of sociological conditions must exist in order for judicial independence to be fully protected and the rule of law upheld. These conditions are social differentiation, a structure of conditional programs for law, and limitation in the social system of the responsibility and accountability of judges following the fulfillment of their judicial function.  Finally, in the final stage of her socio-historical research, the author demonstrates how the current judicial interpretation of the conditions for judicial independence enhances the theoretical foundations that situate the judicial function at the centre of the legal system.	bureaucracy , constitutional law , functional differentiation , independence of the judiciary , judges , legal history , legitimacy of law , separation of powers , sociology of law , system theory	en	4372.0
1448	L’identité mandchoue et son rôle dans la construction identitaire chinoise : étude historiographique	The importance of the identity concept is now recognized by the scholarship in History. The feeling of belonging, being at the same time a personal and a collective process, is at the cornerstone of a group identity. In this dissertation, we intend to study the growth of Manchu identity’s awareness, and what part it plaid in the Chinese identity construction process, up to the 1911 Revolution.  An Historiographic analysis will allow us to follow the evolution of western scholarship outlook on the Qing dynasty, and to substitute the thesis of their sinicization by the idea of their acculturation. Our first hypothesis is that a parallel comparison between both identity constructions will lead to the conclusion that they are inseparable from one another.   Secondly, we will suggest that as long as the dynasty could pretend to a universal representation, China benefited from Manchu rule.   Finally, our last assumption will demonstrate that the ethnic component was, and still is, a key factor in the rulership of a multicultural and multiethnic empire.

1449	La melancolía en Atlántida de Oscar Villegas : representación teatral del carácter nacional mexicano	Mexican men and women are commonly depicted as extremely melancholic beings bound to a tragic fate. Numerous myths about them, direct products of their own culture, are linked to sadness and fear which are the two basic components of melancholy. The anthropologist Roger Bartra, in his work La jaula de la melancolia; identidad y metamorfosis del Mexicano, analyses these culturally acquired elements of the personality of Mexicans.  The objective of this investigation is to demonstrate that Oscar Villegas' Atlántida is an exemplary representation of Mexican melancholy. In this play, Villegas tells the story of a young cabaret exotic dancer who lives constant disillusions in a vulgar and perverted world where human values are lacking. The playwright takes us to the poor neighbourhoods of Mexico City in the Forties to portray people in despair who are unable to change the course of their lives.  Besides being a theatre play about melancholy, Atlántida outlines the very caracteristics that have become the national feature of Mexicans throughout time. The study of this work is based on Anne Ubersfeld's theories of theatrical text analysis, suggesting an approach that centers on the line of action and contexts of communication found in the dialogues.  The study of both Villegas' play and Bartra's essay allows us to explore the intrinsic correlation that seems to exist between Mexicans and melancholy.

1450	La surveillance de l'utilisation d'Internet au travail : guide des droits et obligations des employeurs	All employers providing Internet access to their employees should implement Internet monitoring in the workplace, to increase the benefits and reduce the risks related to Internet use at work. Employers have the right to implement this kind of monitoring subject, however, to the rights of employees and third parties. The implementation of Internet monitoring within the workplace can affect employees' privacy and the right to fair and reasonable conditions of employment, as well as the rights of third parties who may be indirectly subject to monitoring. In this context, the employer should go through two steps of reasoning. The employer should first determine the level of reasonable expectation of privacy of all individuals monitored, which level is assessed in the light of numerous factors. The employer must also meet the criteria of rationality and proportionality. These criteria require that the employer identifies the reasons behind monitoring, and how monitoring will be exercised. After these two steps, the employer will be able to identify the obligations to which he is submitted through the implementation of Internet monitoring.

1451	Globin Gene Expression: Role of Transcription Factors	Aberrant gene expression is an underlying pathophysiology in many disease conditions. Lineage-specification and -commitment is tightly dependent on lineage-specific transcription factors to regulate the expression of target genes. Using human β-globin locus as a model, we investigated how the transcriptional machinery is set and regulated during erythropoiesis and how it impacts globally on gene expression. Class I bHLH proteins are important transcription factors whose binding sites are frequently clustered throughout the β-globin gene locus, suggesting their role in globin gene regulation. We showed that, in hematopoietic progenitor (HPC) and erythroid cells (EryC) of the transgenic mouse for human β-globin locus and human HPC cells (CD34+); HEB, E2A and ETO-2 significantly interact with locus control region (LCR) and promoters of globin genes, and their relative ratio is altered during erythropoiesis. For the first time, we found that in other hematopoietic lineages, human β-globin locus is in active chromatin and interacts with transcription factors involved in repression. Strikingly and consistent with the expression of globin genes, we characterized transcription factors involved in open chromatin configuration and basal level of globin gene expression in lymphoid progenitor cells. Further, with the genetic power of E2A and HEB knockout mice, our findings were clarified in mutant backgrounds.

1452	La gouvernance des projets d’architecture : une typologie de la multi-organisation temporaire	Traditional approaches to ethics in architecture have focused on three characteristics of the object: durability, convenience and beauty (firmitas, utilitas and venustas). On the other hand, recent knowledge derived from the fields of project management and sustainable development has made significant contributions to the understanding of project governance. However, the relationships of governance within architectural projects are linked to the characteristics of the construction industry, a sector that operates through the creation of temporary teams formed by highly specialized organizations. We present in this article some of these characteristics and their influence on the relations between project participants. A systems approach based on the review of case studies helps us identify the complexity of the temporary teams involved in archi- tectural projects. The identification of various types of organizational configurations highlights some ethical issues related to formal and informal relationships between stakeholders and those between the architect and complex construction clients. We argue that the architect is faced with the challenge of working on an architectural project that is —increasingly— the subject of negotiation between stakeholders. Faced with this challenge, it is crucial for the architect to understand the complexity of the relationships between participants within the project social system and to create the appropriate mechanisms of participation, negotiation and exchange between them.	architecture	en	4341.0

Based on an examination of four novels written by a French physician writer, first published in 1989, and on an exclusive inter- view with the author, this paper addresses the ways throug which a caregiver's professional experience feeds his fictions and how they, in turn, carry the author's views of healthcare ethics.	imagination	en	4329.0
1454	Solutions de rang k et invariants de Riemann pour les systèmes de type hydrodynamique multidimensionnels	In this work, the conditional symmetry method is adapted in order to construct solutions expressed in terms of Riemann invariants.  Nonelliptic quasilinear homogeneous systems of multidimensional partial differential equations of hydrodynamic type are considered.  A detailed description of the necessary and sufficient conditions for the local existence of these types of solutions is given.  The relationship between the structure of integral elements and the possibility of constructing certain classes of rank-k solutions is discussed.   These classes of solutions include nonlinear superpositions of Riemann waves and multisolitonic solutions.  This approach is generalized to first-order inhomogeneous hyperbolic quasilinear systems.  These methods are applied to the equations describing an isentropic fluid flow in (3+1) dimensions.  Several new classes of rank-2 and rank-3 solutions are obtained which contain double and triple solitonic solutions.  New nonlinear and linear superpositions of Riemann waves are described.  Finally, certain aspects of the construction of rank-2 solutions through an application to the dispersionless Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation are discussed.

1455	Continuatio et renovatio : l'idéologie impériale de Septimius Severus	Septimius Severus reigned from 193 to 211 A.D., between the Golden Age of the Antonine dynasty and the third century crisis of the Roman Empire. He was saluted  emperor by his legions of Upper Pannonia but was compelled to fight two civil wars to retain power. From this, and his African origin, it could be interpreted that the imperial rule of Severus was the genesis of the evolution from the Principate to the Dominate, expressed through his imperial ideology.     This Master’s thesis examines how an emperor of African origin adhered to the iconographic traditions inaugurated under the reign of Augustus, and establishes the degree and nature of his ideological innovations. Founded on literary, epigraphic and iconographical sources, this research will demonstrate that the ideology of Severus was part of the continued evolution of the Romans’ perception of imperial power.

1456	Effet de la symétrie sur la supraconductivité de LaRhSi3 et la frustration magnétique du SrRE2O4 (RE = Dy ou Ho)	In the first part of this thesis, we present our muon spectroscopy results of the non-centrosymmetric superconductor LaRhSi3. Zero magnetic field measurements showed no internal field, suggesting at most a very small triplet component in the superconducting wave function. A temperature scan taken in 35G transverse-field geometry showed a phase transition at Hc1. The asymmetry of the muon relaxation spectrum measured at 20mK and field of 150G, which is between the lower and upper critical fields, shows a faster relaxation rate compared to the spectrum obtained at 4K, a behaviour expected in the presence of vortices in the type II superconductor. However, the temperature dependence of the relaxation rate begins to increase all the way to a temperature twice Tc of LaRhSi3 in a field of 150G. In the second part of this document, we present the interpretation of inelastic neutron scattering by crystalline electric fields. These measurements were carried out on powder samples of frustrated quantum magnets SrHo2O4 and SrDy2O4. Using Stevens operators method, we determined the level scheme du to crystalline electric field effects using a point charge model and fitted it to the experimental data. For the SrDy2O4 we found a ground state that appears to be composed of four quasi-accidental degenerate states that carry a non zero magnetic moment even though susceptibility measurements did not indicate magnetic order above 50mK. For the SrHo2O4, the ground state is a pair with a 6.98(8)$\mu_B$ magnetic moment.

1457	Les caractéristiques des agresseurs comme facteurs de risque associés au développement du sentiment de solitude chez les adolescents victimes de harcèlement par les pairs	The goal of the present study is to examine to what extend bullies’ behavioral and relational characteristics account for changes over time in loneliness feelings among victimized middle school students. The sample was composed of 538 grade 7 and 8 students from two middle schools in Montreal. During two consecutive years, students’ level of victimization and bullies’ characteristics (gender, aggressive behaviors, popularity and victimization) were evaluated with self-reported measures and peer nominations. Results show that, beyond the frequency to which students are victimized, bullies’ gender was associated with an increase over a one year period in loneliness feelings for girls and boys. Specifically, the number of females bullies identified by the students, constitutes a risk factor closely linked to the development of loneliness feelings. Moreover, the behavioral and relational characteristics of the bullies were not associated with an increase over time of loneliness feelings. However, being bullied by students characterized by social adjustment difficulties (aggressive and victimized bullies) was negatively associated with concurrent loneliness feelings. The discussion highlights the intra- and interpersonal processes explaining why the loneliness feelings linked to victimization by peers are likely to vary according to the bullies’ characteristics.

1458	Les habiletés spatio-cognitives des aveugles de naissance : résolution de labyrinthes tactiles	Navigation is predominately based on vision as it gathers spatial information simultaneously and allows a continuous update of our position relative to space. For many blind people who rely mainly on auditive, haptic, proprioceptive, olfactive and echolocating cues to navigate, leaving outside their home can be a challenge. Research on the navigational neural network in this particular population is therefore crucial to better adapt resources for visually impaired people and free them from isolation. Congenitally blind subjects are also an interesting population for the study of neuroplasticity. As their brain was built without any visual input, most structures related to vision are reduced in volume compared to those of seeing subjects. Moreover, their occipital cortex, a region normally dedicated to vision, has a suprametabolic activity at rest, which could represent a virgin territory that can be recruited by other modalities to accomplish various sensory tasks. Recently some researchers have demonstrated the involvement of this region in sensory tasks such as tactile discrimination and auditive localisation. Other intramodal plastic changes have also been observed in the blind’s navigational neural network. The posterior part of hippocampus, involved in cognitive mapping, is reduced in volume while the anterior section is enlarged in blind subjects. Although some anatomical plastic changes have been observed in congenitally blind’s brain navigational system, their functional aspect remains to be elucidated. The purpose of this study was to investigate the neural correlates of navigation in congenital blindness and to link them with the blinds’ spatio-cognitive skills. The first behavioral study identified route learning difficulties in congenitally blind participants when they were ask to navigate inside small-scaled tactile mazes. Using functional magnetic resonance imagery in the second study, these problems were associated with the recruitment of brain regions involved in an egocentric perspective processing, such as right superior parietal lobule. While blindfolded seeing subjects excelled in the maze task, they recruited structures involved in allocentric processing, such as hippocampus and parahippocampus. Moreover, the second study confirmed the recruitment of occipital cortex in a navigation task for blind subjects only. This strengthens the involvement of crossmodal plasticity in higher level cognitive tasks, such as navigation.	navigation , navigation , hippocampus , blindness , maze , haptic , functional imaging	en	4279.0
1459	Étude des gènes d'Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae exprimés en conditions d'infection	Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae is the etiological agent of porcine pleuropneumonia. Transmission of the disease occurs through direct contact or aerosols. The bacteria possess many virulence factors, namely capsular polysaccharides, lipopolysaccharides, four Apx toxins and iron acquisition mechanisms. To this day, an efficient cross-serotype vaccine has yet to be developed.  In order to investigate regulation mechanisms in A. pleuropneumoniae and to identify new potential targets for the synthesis of subunit vaccines, the transcriptomic profile of the bacteria under conditions that simulate the infection and following a natural acute infection in vivo were studied. The experiences relied on first and second generation microarrays (AppChip1 and AppChip2) designed using 2025 ORFs of the draft version of the A. pleuropneumoniae serotype 5b strain L20 genome and 2033 ORFs of the final and annotated version of the same genome respectively. First, experiments were conducted under iron-restricted conditions and 210 genes were deemed differentially expressed, 92 of which were up-regulated. Some new putative iron acquisition mechanisms were identified, including genes homologous to those of the Yersinia pestis YfeABCD chelated-iron acquisition system, as well as other genes homologous to components of the HmbR iron uptake from hemoglobin system of Neisseria meningitidis.   When cultured in conditions promoting biofilm production, genes tadC and tadD from a putative tad (« tight adherence locus ») operon, genes pgaABC involved in the biosynthesis of a polysaccharide of the biofilm matrix as well as two ORFs encoding a putative autotransporter adhesins similar to the Haemophilus influenzae Hsf adhesin were all significantly overexpressed. Many of these genes were also overexpressed when lung epithelial cells were infected with A. pleuropneumoniae. While 170 genes were differentially expressed after planktonic growth in the culture medium above the cells, another 131 were identified following direct adhesion to the cells. Genes tadB and rcpA of the tad locus, as well as genes pgaBC and an ORF coding for the Hsf homolog where all found among overexpressed genes. When A. pleuropneumoniae was cultured in contact with broncho-alveolar lavage fluids (BALF), 156 genes were significantly differentially expressed and gene apxIVA, which was up-regulated, was detected for the first time during in in vitro growth conditions. Finally, experiments were conducted in vivo in animals naturally infected with A. pleuropneumoniae in the late stage of the acute phase in order to identify genes that are expressed during the infection of the natural host. While 150 genes were deemed differentially expressed, genes apxIVA as well as two genes from an operon coding for a putative type IV fimbriae were up-regulated. Out of those 72 genes that were overexpressed, 3 encode proteins or lipoproteins of the outer membrane which are conserved among all serotypes of the bacteria.  Overall, we were able to identify several new potential virulence factors for A. pleuropneumoniae in the course of our experiments, as well as several new potential targets for the elaboration of an efficient cross-serotype vaccine.

1460	Espace et récit : l’inscription des temps dans la ville : parcours stochastiques chez Julio Cortázar	"From the shift of contemporary literature towards labyrinthine, fragmentary self expression, emerges a meaningful correspondence between the characters of a narrative and the spaces they inhabit : spaces as multiple and discontinuous figures inscribed in history and myth.  This interactive construction linking place and subject renders space of primary significance and in so doing, redefines the importance of time in the act of writing.  Time does not unfold only in ""what is told"", as Ricoeur suggests, but in the successive layers of its inscription in place: which is lived through the combining art of experimentation with attachment to place. The expression of the subject of the narrative emerges from the continual and imperfect project of the subject to locate himself in the city, in those places with which he identifies and which construct him.  Through three texts by writer Julio Cortázar, time will be considered as a modality of “accumulatable” fragments, inscribed in significant places, from which a consciousness emerges through the city's porousness and its capacity for leaps and passageways.  What connects the architectonic spaces and the imprint of time within them and a subject who must express himself to exist and create narratives to unify the discontinuous parts of his being, will emerge through ""becoming in action"", the addition of narrative and real life experience in Cortazarian figures of experimentation, play, passageway et language.   Herein a dynamic specific to the city emerges in the creative act that fulfills and guides the subject: his plural singularity."

1461	Comparative safety respiratory pharmacology : validation of a head-out plethysmograph – pneumotachometer testing device in male Sprague–Dawley rats, Beagle dogs and Cynomolgus monkeys	The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance qualifications of the FlexiWare® system in conscious Sprague-Dawley rats, Cynomolgus monkeys, as well as awake and anesthetized Beagle dogs following the administration of pharmacological substances with known effects on the respiratory system. The pharmacological substances included albuterol administered by inhalation; methacholine and remifentanil, both administered intravenously. A preparation of saline solution administered intravenously was used as control. Respiratory monitoring included: respiratory rate (RR), tidal volume (TV), minute ventilation (MV), in rats, dogs and monkeys. Additional time-, flow-, and ratio-derived variables were used in the rat model. Those variables included inspiratory (IT) and expiratory (ET) times, time to peak expiratory flow, peak inspiratory and expiratory flows, mid-tidal expiratory flow (EF50), inspiratory:expiratory (I:E) and inspiratory to total breath (I:TB) ratios. The results of this study have proven that the FlexiWare® was a reliable method and should be considered in the core battery recommended in safety pharmacology studies (ICH 2000) to assess the broncho-dilative, -constrictive, and central depressant effects of drugs on the respiratory system of the common laboratory animal specie. The animals appeared to adapt well to the restraint unit. The variables evaluated, particularly RR, TV and MV, were adequate and allowed to characterize the response of the animals following the administration of the pharmacological substances. They are judiciously completed with flowderived variables. The addition of within-breath time parameters was not primordial to detect drug effects but offered complementary tools to interpret physiological changes. However the evaluation period should be limited to the first 2 hours post treatment. These studies represent a performance qualifications evaluation of the system and have originally demonstrated the precision (sensitivity and specificity) as well as repeatability for different variables and on different specie of interest.

1462	Impact du stress oxydant et de l’athérosclérose sur la fonction vasculaire cérébrale au cours du vieillissement	Reactive oxygen species can have different roles in neurons and cerebral vascular cells as low concentrations are beneficial while unlikable effects are observed at higher concentrations. Mice cerebral circulation is different from other vascular beds as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a major endogenous endothelium-derived relaxing factor. The objective of our first study was to characterize the physiological implication of H2O2 derived from eNOS activation in mice cerebral arteries. We tried to identify the mechanisms implicated in flow-mediated dilation (FMD), the most physiological reactive endothelial function. Our study suggested that H2O2, but not nitric oxide, derived from cerebral eNOS activity was the main factor implicated in the regulation of FMD. However, the evolution of this dilatory pathway through ageing associated or not with risk factors for cardiovascular diseases is poorly understood. Ageing is associated with increase oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction, the later characterized by an imbalance in the release of endothelial constricting and relaxing factors. Risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, such as hypercholesterolemia, can increase oxidative stress and could hasten endothelial dysfunction. However, the evolution of the endothelial factors through ageing, particularly H2O2 dilatory pathway, in the cerebral circulation is still not well described. In our second study, we hypothesise that alterations in endothelial factors might be responsible for (1) cerebral endothelial dysfunction observed during ageing and (2) the accelerated endothelial dysfunction associated with atherosclerosis. Our results suggested that increased in oxidative stress associated with ageing leads to the release of endogenous TXA2, which in turn, reduces eNOS activity and, consequently, reduces endothelial-dependent dilation. Furthermore, we found that oxidative stress increase associated with atherosclerosis hastens cerebral endothelial dysfunction in mice. The implication of oxidative stress was confirmed by the beneficial effect of the antioxidant catechin on atherosclerosis associated cerebral endothelial function. Finally, premature cerebral endothelial dysfunction observed during atherosclerosis could not only be associated with increase stroke incidence but also associated with a reduction in cerebral blood flow and, ultimately, a decrease in cognitive function. For our third study, we hypothesise that oxidative stress increase during atherosclerosis is associated with reduced cerebral blood flow and an accelerated cognitive function decline normally associated with ageing. We treated 3 month-old atherosclerotic mice with the antioxidant catechin and used untreated mice as controls. Our results suggested that catechin treatment can prevent the decrease in FMD, the decrease in cerebral blood flow and cognitive function decline observed during atherosclerosis. Taken together, our study allows to distinguish the effect of ageing and atherosclerosis on cerebrovascular function. Catechin treatment had beneficial effects on endothelial dilation, cerebral blood flow and cognitive function suggesting that the redox environment is a key player in the regulation of cerebral function.

1463	Le remodelage cardiaque lors de la gestation chez la rate : implication du récepteur aux minéralocorticoïdes et altérations par un supplément sodique	Pregnancy is characterized by marked hemodynamic and metabolic changes, which have consequences on the heart. The adaptation of the heart to this physiological situation requires a remodeling of its structure, and consequently functioning adjustments. Mechanisms responsible for these adaptations are largely unknown. However, this knowledge is essential for the understanding of cardiovascular complications, such as gestational hypertension (GH), which represents a risk for the mother and the fœtus. To characterize cardiac adaptations to pregnancy, our experimental approach consisted in studying this remodelling at the level of left ventricle cardiomyocytes. Therefore, our first objective was to determine structural and functional modifications of cardiomyocytes in pregnant rats to be able to identify their variations in GH. In pregnant rats, structural remodelling of cardiomyocytes was characterized by a proportional volume expansion. GH was induced by a high sodium supplement (0.9% NaCl). In hypertensive rats, we observe significant cell volume shrinkage. The study of functional modifications elicited a strong relationship between metabolic adaptations and cell contractility. According to our results, in pregnant rats cardiomyocyte contractility was increased in presence of energy substrates lactate and pyruvate. This effect was weaker in the cells from hypertensive rats. This suggested modifications of the excitation-contraction coupling, in which L-type calcium currents (ICa-L) play an important role. Unexpectedly, lactate and pyruvate induced a significant increase in ICa-L only in hypertensive rats.  In pathological conditions, mineralocorticoid receptors (MR) have been shown to mediate structural as well as functional remodelling of the heart. Our study is the first to investigate MR involvement in cardiac remodelling during pregnancy. Thus, our second objective was to determine MR involvement in cardiomyocyte remodelling. For this study, pregnant rats were treated with potassium canrenoate of (20 mg / kg / day), a MR antagonist. Our results revealed that MR inhibition during the pregnancy elicited a significant decrease of cell volume. MR inhibition has also affected metabolism and cellular functioning relationship. Indeed, plasma concentration of lactate was lower, which was in correlation with its blunted effect on cell contractility.  In women, pregnancy-induced hypertrophy is associated with changes in electrical properties of the heart. Indeed, repolarisation is prolonged, which is characterised by a longer duration of QTc interval on the electrocardiogram. Regulation mechanisms involved in this adaptation are still largely unknown. Our third objective was therefore to determine the role of MR in the adaptation of repolarisation to pregnancy. Pregnancy induced a prolongation in QTc interval, which correlates with a decrease in potassium currents Ito and IK1. MR inhibition prevented QTc interval prolongation and the lowering of Ito.  Our study gives a new insight of pregnancy-induced cardiac hypertrophy, which is provided by investigations at the cellular level. Our results demonstrate that pregnancy and GH are characterised by opposite remodellings. Moreover, in pregnancy the contractile function is dependent on metabolic adaptations. This is all the more glaring in GH as metabolic alterations induced modifications of electric properties to maintain contractile functioning. Furthermore, our work reveals MR involvement in the regulation of morphology, metabolism/contractility relationship, and repolarisation. By improving the knowledge of hypertrophy during pregnancy, this work contributes to improve the understanding of pregnancy-induced cardiac complications.	coeur , pregnancy , cardiomyocytes , hypertrophic remodelling , mineralocorticoid receptors , glucose metabolism , ionic currents	en	4218.0
1464	Cardiologie nucléaire du 21ième siècle : nouveautés et réalités	Cardiovascular diseases remain a major cause of mortality and morbidity in developed countries. The search for predictive determinants of vascular events represents a relevant and timely goal, considering the increasing costs of medical care and the progress in developing countries such as India, Brazil and China. Nuclear cardiology has, for 30 years, played an essential role in the diagnosis and prognosis of various cardiac and vascular diseases. Moreover, new developments will allow earlier and more specific detection of cardiac and peripheral atherosclerosis disease in affected individuals and in primary prevention. In this thesis, we will focus on advances in two major themes of nuclear cardiology. Endothelial dysfunction is regarded as the earliest pathological markers of atherosclerosis. Traditional cardiovascular risks factors impair endothelial function and can initiate the atherosclerosis process, even in the absence of overt endothelial disruption. Quantification of coronary endothelial function is, therefore, of considerable interest as an early biomarker for coronary disease. The radionuclide plethysmography methodology developed during the course of my doctoral studies allows the quantification of peripheral endothelial function, which has been correlated with coronary endothelial function. This methodology is detailed in the first manuscript (Harel et. al., Physiol Meas., 2007). The use of red blood cell radio-labeling permits arterial flow to be measured in the upper limb during local reactive hyperemia. This new procedure was validated against strain gauge plethysmography in a cohort of 26 patients with excellent reproducibility (intraclass coefficient of correlation = 0.89). Moreover, the arterial measurements of flow during the hyperemic reaction correlated well with the reference method (r=0.87). The second manuscript exposes the basis of infrared spectroscopy as a method for measuring arterial flow and quantifying the hyperemic reaction (Harel et. al., Physiol Meas., 2008). The study protocol consisted of simultaneous measurements by strain gauge, radionuclide and infrared spectroscopy plethysmography. The spectroscopy technique was shown to be precise and reproducible for forearm measurement of arterial blood flow. This novel procedure came major advantages in reducing artifacts and in its ease of use. The second axis of my thesis relates to the analysis of cardiac contraction synchrony. Indeed, more than 30% of patients receiving resynchronization therapy do not show clinical improvement. Moreover, this non-response rate is even higher if we consider morphological criteria of resynchronization (end-systolic volume reduction). There is therefore, an urgent need to improve a methodology to reliably and precisely measure cardiac dynamics so as to identify and monitor potential responders. The third manuscript exposes the basis of a new radionuclide technique to quantify left ventricle ejection fraction (Harel et. al. J Nucl Cardiol., 2007). The study of 202 patients showed an excellent correlation (r=0.84) with the reference method (planar ventriculography). The comparison with QBS software (Cedar-Sinai), showed a lower standard deviation of bias (7.44% vs 9.36%). Moreover, unlike the alternative software, the bias did not correlate with the magnitude of the ejection fraction. The fourth manuscript relates to the quantification of the left intra-ventricular synchronism (Harel et. al. J Nucl Cardiol, 2008). A new three-dimensional parameter (CHI: contraction homogeneity index) (median 73.8%; IQ 58.7% - 84.9%) was defined to allow the integration of amplitude and synchrony components of ventricular contraction. Validation of this parameter was undertaken out by comparing the standard deviation of the histogram of phase (SDΦ) (median 28.2º; IQ 17.5º- 46.8º) obtained by planar ventriculography in a study of 235 patients.   These four manuscripts, already published in the specialized scientific literature, summarize a fraction of the research tasks that we have carried out during the three last years, representing two major axes of nuclear cardiology advancement in the 21st century.

1465	Influence du sommeil sur l'analgésie placebo	Pain is a multidimensional experience which can be modulated by many cognitive factors. The impact of expectations associated with an impending painful experience was largely studied in the context of placebo analgesia, and it was suggested that the presence of conscious relief expectation was necessary for the production of pain reduction. On the other hand, some clinical studies have observed therapeutic improvements following the administration of a placebo, even during sleep, which suggest that a placebo effect can be seen even in the absence of explicit relief expectation. The first study of this thesis aims at examining if a pain reduction, as well as a decrease in sleep disturbances associated with the experimental pain stimuli, can be seen following the induction of night-time expectations. The results indeed showed a significant reduction in pain and associated sleep disturbances evaluated retrospectively following the application of a placebo. In addition, placebo treatment appears to modulate responses to experimental pain during sleep, in a manner dependent of the sleep stage in which they are presented. Although the development of placebo analgesia relies on the production of relief expectations, previous exposure to efficient treatment appears to augment the magnitude of the effect. This suggests that associative learning processes might also be implicated in the genesis of these effects. As a role of sleep was shown in the learning of different aptitudes, the objective of the second study was to examine whether the presence of a sleep episode between the placebo induction and the evaluation of the effect can reinforce the integration of expectations and consequently, favour the production of expectation-dependent effects. The results show that sleep increases the association between expectation and relief, and that the level of expectation appears to be linked to the relative duration of REM sleep measured after the induction. Globally, this thesis demonstrates that sleep can influence placebo analgesia at many levels.	Placebo analgesia , Sleep , Expectation , REM sleep , Conditioning	en	4208.0
1466	Identification de biomarqueurs protéiques prédictifs et diagnostiques des maladies coronariennes pour une population de souche canadienne-française	Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a major cause of mortality in Canada. Biomarkers are precious tools to diagnosis and risk stratification, and the identification of new candidates may substantially impact on public health and health economics. Due to its complexity, the human blood proteome remains challenging to explore. Our study aims at combining various complementary methods to determine the plasma proteome signature of patients at various stages of CAD.   The total cohort includes 1006 French-Canadian, 500 controls with a normal coronary angiography, and 506 patients with documented CAD. Two pools were reconstituted to represent the extremes of our population: 1) patients with a previous myocardial infarction (MI) and a recurrent MI over a 5 years follow-up and 2) controls without CAD and no events during follow-up matched for age and sex to the CAD pool (N=18). After a depletion of highly abundant proteins, pools were analyzed using 3 different proteomic methods: i) PF2D system followed by a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry analysis (LC-MS/MS); ii) 1D-SDS-PAGE followed by LC-MS/MS; iii) Further depletion of proteins followed by 1D-SDS-PAGE and LC-MS/MS analysis of both flow through (3a) and retained fractions (3b).  Methods 2, 3a, and 3b allowed identification of 108, 125 and 91 proteins respectively. Overlapping proteins (31% between methods 2 and 3a, 61% between 2 and 3b and 19% between 3a and 3b) showed significant absolute and relative expressions with various methods. A total of 12 proteins were significantly (p<0.05) different in amounts (number of peptides identified) between the 2 pools. Analyses with the PF2D elution spectra (method 1) displayed numerous different profiles between the two groups. Over a total of 1156 fractions (control: 1172 peaks ACS: 926 peaks) generated, 370 fractions (674 peaks) overlapped between the two pools. 15 fractions (23 peaks) differed significantly (p<0,05) in amounts while some other peaks were uniquely present in one pool, representing biomarkers of potential interest.   We conclude that plasma proteome signatures are significantly modeled by the methods serving their recognition. Cost of analyses can be reduced with the PF2D method by performing a pre-selection before MS analysis. Detection of less abundant proteins can be improved by using further depletion.  Taking profit of these finding, we are now testing in our population the hypothesis that a combination of methods will sharpen our ability to detect clinically relevant proteins tailored to various clinical situations and to disease staging.

1467	Évaluation d’un programme de promotion de la santé des jeunes au Cameroun	Early sexual initiation and delayed marriage are concurrently happening in most environments in Africa where traditionally early marriage and sexual initiation within marital union were more prevalent. This lengthens the time of exposure of young people to the risk of premarital sex and unwanted pregnancies as well as sexually transmitted infections including HIV/AIDS. Hence, several interventions have been carried out to promote the sexual and reproductive health of adolescents and young people. The Population Observatory in Socio-Clinical Epidemiology (POSE) designed and implemented since 1995 in Cameroon, had targeted the reproductive health promotion of adolescents and young people as one of its priorities, through the Cameroon Adolescent and Youth Reproductive Health Promotion Program (CAREH). The CAREH Program has been carrying out a series of intervention activities in the prefecture of Bandjoun since July 2000 and many other parts of Cameroon since 2003. This thesis evaluates some aspects of this intervention by examining the extent to which the intervention activities undertaken between 2000 and 2002 have contributed to: 1) delaying first sexual intercourse among adolescents aged 10 to 20 years, 2) preventing unwanted pregnancies among young people aged 10 to 29 years, and 3) preventing HIV infection among young people aged 10 to 29 years.  Data came from the 2002 Cameroon Family and Health Surveys (CFHS). A post-test design was used which divided adolescents and youth into four intervention groups (out-of-school youth unexposed to the intervention, young people enrolled in schools and unexposed to the intervention, young people exposed to the intervention in the community and young people exposed to the intervention in school settings). Descriptive analyses and multivariate logistic regression were used to assess the possible associations between intervention and outcomes variables, given the enunciated research hypotheses. Adolescents attending school who reported no exposure to the intervention (OR = 1.973; CI = 1.195 to 3.260) were more likely to have a negative perception of premarital sex than out-of-school and unexposed adolescents. However, there were no significant differences in delaying the first sexual intercourse among adolescents exposed to the intervention compared to those not exposed. Knowledge about the prevention of pregnancy was significantly higher among unexposed students (OR = 1.953, CI = 1.452-2.627), youth exposed to the intervention in the community (OR = 3.074; CI = 2.157-4.382) and youth exposed to the intervention in school (OR = 4.962, CI = 3.367 to 7.311) than among those not exposed and not in school. No statistically significant difference was found between these groups regarding the use of modern contraception. The discussion about  pregnancy prevention or contraceptive use led by a CAREH peer-educator significantly improved knowledge about pregnancy prevention for youth exposed to the intervention in school compared to their peers exposed in community where such discussion did not occur (OR = 1.549, CI = 1.056 to 2.272). Young people exposed to the intervention in community settings (OR = 2.106, CI = 1.514-2.930) and those exposed in school settings (OR = 3.117, CI = 2.192-4.433) significantly improved their knowledge about HIV prevention more than out-of-school youth unexposed to the intervention. Nevertheless, there were no significant differences between groups regarding the use of condom.  These findings should be interpreted within the limits of available data. Indeed, it was not possible to determine the level of knowledge about pregnancy prevention or HIV prevention among young people exposed to the intervention before hand.  Therefore, it is impossible to know what level of knowledge young people exposed to the intervention would have had in the absence of the intervention. However, given the results comparing the four stratified groups, it is likely that the intervention had more beneficial effects on improving knowledge than behaviours.	sexuality , contraception , IST , Bandjoun , HIV , AIDS	en	4189.0
1468	L'impact d'un accident vasculaire cérébral léger sur la qualité de vie des proches	Introduction: Mild stroke clients are often independent in basic activities of daily living but may present subtle deficits that impact on complex activities and roles. The purpose of this study was to explore the perceived quality of life of close family members three months after the stroke client was discharged home. Method: Qualitative design based on a constructivist paradigm. Interviews were conducted with family members of mild stroke clients three months after discharge. An interview guide was used and the audio content was transcribed, followed by a content analysis. Results: Eight interviews were conducted (mean age 56.9 ± 9.2 years; men=2/8). Six essential themes emerged from the data. According to participants, mild stroke clients present sequelae that interfere with complex tasks (patient), increasing the burden on other family members who have to limit their personal activities (daily living). Spouses reported sometimes acting like a parent, which caused tensions in the relationship (conjugal relationship). Anxiety is related to the risk of stroke recurrence (relapse) and some family members present physical symptoms and a lack of energy (health). However, family members do not have access to services despite support from their relatives (services). Conclusion: The results of this exploratory study strongly suggest that even a ‘mild’ stroke has an impact on the daily lives of close family members and affects their quality of life.	mild stroke , close family member , quality of life , qualitative design , constructivist paradigm	en	4186.0
1469	"Tables de concertation et préservation du patrimoine, solution porteuse ou chimère ? :
deux cas d’étude, le Vieux-Montréal et le mont Royal"	Consensus building is a recent and increasingly widespread phenomenon. It is used in many areas, including urban planning, and more recently heritage protection. Consensus building appears to be an appropriate tool for municipal authorities to handle conflicts in development projects, especially those projects that are related to heritage protection. Our research focuses on the contribution of consensus building in the area of heritage preservation, and on the means put in place to achieve such a goal. Are round tables, as part of the consensus building process, appropriate in managing heritage sites?  Based on a theoretical discussion on consensus building in development issues, we compare two case studies, namely the Old Montréal and the Mount Royal round tables on consensus building. This analysis focuses on assessing the consensus building process and on developing a global vision for the future of the two heritage sectors under study. Our goal is to characterize the consensus building process used in Montréal and to evaluate its contribution to the field of heritage protection. The analysis of our two case studies reveals the existence of a distinctive consensus building process specific to Montréal, a process which however needs to be optimized.  We conclude our research with the need to improve the assessed consensus building process through a number of avenues to explore.

1470	Les figures de la divinité chez Sartre, Giraudoux et Camus : trois pièces écrites sous l’Occupation allemande	Les mouches, Sodome et Gomorrhe, and Caligula present divinities parodying and criticizing the political leaders of the Occupation (1940-1944), as well as the use by dictators of traditional religious ideologies for subjugating humanity to totalitarian regimes. Theatrical divinities once infallible and all-powerful, the figures analyzed in this study are the product of the questioning of the divinity and political powers of the twentieth century. Our thesis is comprised of three chapters which examine the discourses of these figures of the divinity from dramaturgical, semiological, philosophical and pragmatic perspectives in order to consider the following hypothesis : everything leads to believe that by limiting the ascendency of fictional divinities, largely by the means of weaknesses in their discourses, Sartre, Giraudoux and Camus tried to neutralize the corresponding discourses of real men in the collective conscience of the period. The authors studied profoundly modified the traditional image of theatrical divinities by undermining the force of their language and by questioning their identity. The divinities chosen for this study announce the decomposition of the personnage which took place after 1950 : their status is undermined and the perlocutionary force of their language is lessened. Without a real stronghold on humanity, depending on theatre, pretence, histrionics, and human weaknesses, these caricatured divinities expose themselves to compromising their regimes and are reduced to an influence highly limited by man’s liberty. By updating these myths and accounts in this way, Sartre, Giraudoux and Camus tried, by extension, to discredit the European leaders of the period.

1471	L’expérience de vieillir au quotidien de femmes âgées montréalaises vivant seules à domicile dans un contexte de précarité économique	Little attention has been given to the investigation of experiences and specific realities of the sub-group and sub-culture of aging women living in poverty. In this context, the objective of this research was to explore and analyze the daily experiences of women growing old and living alone at home in poverty. To reach this objective, the theory of Culture Care Diversity and Universality of Madeleine Leininger was used as the theoretical foundation while a qualitative approach and an ethnonursing method were retained. The sample was collected by a “snowball” strategy in two community groups located on the Montreal territory.  A total of seven women aged 65 years and over, living alone at home in poverty were recruited.  Individual semi-directed interviews were conducted with each woman completed by a short socio-demographic questionnaire and field notes. The qualitative content analysis was structured according to the four steps of the data analysis guide proposed by Leininger. These steps are: (1) the raw data analysis, (2) the grouping of these in re-occurring patterns, (3) the emergence of subthemes and themes and (4) the formulation of the study results in the form of theoretical expressions or recommendations. Results from this research explains the daily aging experience of women according to six cultural factors of their social structure, namely: (1) environment, (2) cultural values, (3) lifestyle, (4) human relations, (5) economic factor and (6) ethnohistory; as well as in relation to their health/illness and aging experience, and their relation with the healthcare system. Results related to the cultural factors underline that the aging experience: (1) is settled mainly in the intimate home environment of these women, (2) provides a sense of liberty, control and independence, (3) is enriched by giving to others, (4) is bounded inside a small and weak social network and (5) blossomed through a positive vision of life and the refusal to be considered as poor and dependent. Results related to the human experience and healthcare system dimensions, reveal that the aging experience is embedded in a desire to maintain the body functionalities, to stay independent and to act as experts of its own health in relation with professional care received. The daily experience of growing old for these women relies on their autodetermination, their resilience and on the meaning they give to life. These results support clinical recommendations promoting nursing care that is based on an empowerment approach which is culturally coherent with the culture of these women.

1472	La rencontre des contraires : attraction/narration et immersion/réflexivité dans le film en IMAX 3-D	This thesis examines the ways in which IMAX 3-D films positions its spectator. First, we look at the history of 3-D cinema, from its origins to the inauguration of IMAX 3-D in 1986. We argue that for the first 70 years of its history, 3-D cinema was staged as a return to the cinema of attractions, and that this aesthetic was an obstacle to its institutionalization in the mid-50’s and 80’s. Then, we describe the “IMAX experience” and argue that IMAX films induce a state of immersion and, at the same time, draw the viewer’s attention to the presence of the apparatus and the act of mediation. In analysing the movies Sea Monsters: a Prehistoric Adventure and Haunted Castle, we demonstrate that this tension between viewer immersion and medium reflexivity serves to glorify the IMAX trademark. Furthermore, we examine the relationship between the punctual structure imposed by the logic of attractions and the narrative line held by each and every IMAX film.

1473	Mécanismes d'activation de la voie lysosomale durant l'apoptose chimio-induite	Apoptosis is a distinct form of regulated cell death which is essential for the development and homeostasis maintenance of multicellular animals. Apoptosis is an evolutionary conserved process involving a specific molecular pathway, known as the caspase cascade, and the different cytoplasmic organelles. A lysosomal pathway, characterized by partial rupture, labilization of lysosomal membranes (LML), and cathepsin activation in the cytoplasm, is evoked during camptothecin-induced apoptosis in human cancer cells, including human histiocytic lymphoma U-937 cells. These lysosomal events begin rapidly and simultaneously with mitochondrial permeabilization and caspase activation within 3 h after drug treatment. Comparative and quantitative proteome analyses were performed to identify early changes in lysosomal protein expression/localization from U-937 cells undergoing apoptosis. In two independent experiments, among a total of more than 538 proteins putatively identified and quantitated by iTRAQ isobaric labelling and LC-ESI-MS/MS, 18 proteins were found to be upregulated and 9 downregulated in lysosomes purified from early apoptotic compared to control cells. Protein expression was validated by Western blotting on enriched lysosome fractions, and protein localization confirmed by fluorescence confocal microscopy of representative protein candidates, whose functions are associated with lysosomal membrane fluidity and dynamics. These include sterol-4-alpha-carboxylate 3-dehydrogenase (NSDHL), prosaposin (PSAP) and protein kinase C delta (PKC-d). Functional experiments demonstrate that PKC-d translocation to lysosomes is required for LML, as silencing its expression with RNA interference or suppressing its activity with the inhibitor rottlerin prevents CPT-induced LLM. PKC-d translocation to lysosomes is associated with lysosomal acidic sphingomyelinase (ASM) phosphorylation and activation, which in turn leads to an increase of ceramide (CER) content at lysosomes. The accumulation of endogenous CER at lysosomes is a critical event for CPT-induced LLM as suppressing PKC-d or ASM activity reduces both CPT-mediated CER generation at lysosomes and CPT-induced LLM.These findings reveal a novel mechanism by which PKC-d mediates ASM phosphorylation/activation and CER accumulation at lysosomes in CPT-induced LLM, rapidly activating the lysosomal pathway of apoptosis after CPT treatment. Taken together, these results confirm the importance of sphingolipid metabolism in the activation of the lysosomal pathway of apoptosis.

1474	Conception de miARN artificiels basée sur la caractérisation de la boucle de régulation miR-20/E2F	miRNAs are powerful regulators of gene expression in mammals. These small RNAs of around 20 nucleotides are involved in several cellular processes and diseases. MiRNAs recognize their targets mainly by a region comprising nucleotides 2-8, known as the seed. This characteristic gives them the potential to inhibit hundreds of messenger RNAs. Our first goal was to better characterize the complex network involving miRNAs in the regulation of gene expression.  To achieve this, we studied the relation between a family of transcription factors, the E2Fs, and a family of miRNAs, the miR-17-92 cluster. Our results suggest a negative feedback loop involving miR-17, miR-20a, E2F1, E2F2 and E2F3. In this loop E2F1, 2 and 3 activate the transcription of the two miRNAs that inhibit their translation in return. The inhibition of the antiapoptotic function of E2F1 by miR-17 and miR-20 in a prostate cancer context, could explain the oncogenic potential of the miR-17-92 cluster that was previously reported. Studying the miR-20/E2F feedback loop made us realize how powerful was the ability of miRNAs to inhibit several targets. To overcome the lack of efficient tools able to inhibit simultaneously the expression of multiple genes, our second goal was to develop MultiTar, an algorithm able to design artificial miRNAs that target a set of predetermined genes. MultiTar was validated in silico, using known targets of endogenous miRNAs and in vivo, taking advantage of our experience with the E2F context. We designed artificial miRNAs against E2F1-3 and expressed them both in normal human fibroblasts and prostate cancer cells where they inhibited cell proliferation and induced cellular senescence. The observed phenotypes were precisely those known for inhibiting E2F activities. Hence, MultiTar can efficiently design artificial micro RNAs able to target multiple genes and is thus a flexible tool that can address the issue of multigenic diseases and complex cellular processes. The use of multitargets could be an alternative to overcome the limits of drugs or siRNAs that are designed generally to regulate only one target.	miR-20 , miR-17-92 , E2F , MultiTar , miRNA , negative feedback loop	en	4141.0
1475	Les unions d'artistes, qu'ossa m'fait faire? : la subjectivation des artistes à travers les pratiques de leurs associations	This thesis explores the subjectification of artists as entrepreneurs of self through their professional unions’ practices. From a governmentality perspective, the first chapter of this thesis describes the cultural field in Quebec, the role played by the unions under study in this ‘dispositif’ and the formation of subjects. The second chapter addresses methodological questions : the construction of the archive and details about the interviews conducted. The foucaldian archive was adapted to incoporate interviews in order to analyse once at a time the subjectification implied through unions’ practices and the self-exercise of power by artists. The next three chapters present the analysis. The first chapter of analysis addresses the inclusion in unions (who has access to unions’ services). Even before artists can invest in themselves through unions’ services, the membership process already implies some enterprise of self. This chapter also introduces the notion of security on the labour market. The next chapter concentrates on the subject entrepreneur of self who invests in his security through unions’ services : professional training and savings banks. It presents membership as an investment in itself, which gives access to other investments, and explores, through the idea of experience, unions’ inflexibility as curbing the enterprise of self. Since artists’ careers are not isolated, the last chapter of analysis locates them in a broader context through the notions of market, passion and responsibilization. The conclusion summarizes the thesis and offers an epistemological questioning as well as a brief discussion on the schizophrenic subject in the neoliberal context.

1476	L’un contre l’autre : la dialectique de l’auteur et de la lectrice chez Serge Doubrovsky	Since Serge Doubrovsky coined the term « autofiction » to describe his own novel on the back cover blurb of Fils (1977), doubrovskian studies have tended to focus on the literary genres issues implied by his neologism. Consequently, another aspect of the writer’s work, and a quite crucial one, was somewhat neglected: the relationship with the reader, which is not only represented and acted out by the characters in doubrovskian autofictions but also linked to a another complex, tempestuous and inextricable relationship, that of man and woman. “I write male, read myself female”, says the doubrovskian narrator, who happens to take part, under our very eyes, in a series of passionate relationships with mates that are also readers of his works. Repeated from novel to novel, the mise en scène of the rapport between the doubrovskian hero and his lady companion of the moment reminds us of Doubrovsky’s hypotheses in Corneille ou la dialectique du héros (1963), which were inspired by the Hegelian master-slave Dialectics. This study thus concentrates on the representation of the dialectical relation between male author and female reader in Doubrovsky’s autofictions. After a brief survey and description of the tools used by the author in order to construct his own Model Reader (First section), our three other principal sections will focus on the analysis of Fils and Un amour de soi (1977 and 1982; Section Two); Le livre brisé and l’Après-vivre (1989 and 1994; Section Three); and finally Laissé pour conte (1999; Section Four). We will ultimately attempt to demonstrate the doubrovskian dialectal theme’s literary richness as well as its social and historical implications – the author’s reflexion widens with each episode, touching on questions of reader-response and reception of the literary work, while the master-slave motif resonates in the History of twentieth century Europe, mainly the Second World War and the Holocaust.

1477	De Sade, fantôme de la modernité	This essay examines the relation of de Sade's works with modernity. De Sade is a visionary: he wasn't blinded by the Enlightment, in which he saw an inherent darkness. What some perceived as his madness — the natural reason, the bourgeois reason which he celebrates and exacerbates — is a mirror of our own, a mirror in which our societies refuse to see themselves and their own utilitarian reason, guided by opportunism and self-conservation. This refusal shows de Sade's works as a part of our modernity which we seek to suppress — de Sade as le refoulé de notre modernité.  First, this essay looks at the esthetic filiation from de Sade to Baudelaire and, by comparing de Sade's libertine and Baudelaire's dandy, shows how the negative esthetic of Baudelaire presupposes de Sade's conception of Evil as a product of nature and reason, and how it transfigures this conception in such a way that Good can only proceed of this awareness in Evil, through which lies the only possibility to become at once human and lucid. One must always go back to de Sade to understand Evil, writes Baudelaire, who thus highlights de Sade's — or rather a ghost of de Sade, as his name is seldom mentioned in Baudelaire's — key role in this concept of conscience dans le Mal, making him the sine qua non condition of his modernity. The second part of this essay analyzes the notion of petite souveraineté. This borrowed sovereignty, which forbids the real sovereignty, is the product of the libertine's subjection to nature and to Reason, i.e. to the bourgeois and natural Reason. The natural education by which the libertine — he who can only possess by submitting the other to the system to which he consciously submitted himself, the possessed yearning to possess, the man reduced to a ghost who create ghosts himself — wants to dominate the Other(s) is a reproduction for himself of his own subjection. This notion of petite souveraineté confronts a tradition of idealistic critics who see in the libertine the subject of a total liberty, a sovereign subject – and thus who don't notice that the historical meaning of his Reason is laden with consequences.

1478	Les origines évolutionnistes du rire et de l'humour	Laughter is a universal and ubiquitous human behavior. Widely investigated by psychology and neuroscience, it is still largely ignored by anthropology. While humor and laughter are well caracterised at proximate levels of explanation, the question of their evolutionary origins remains relatively unexplored. A number of recent hypotheses have yet attempted to shed light on the potential adaptive significance and phylogeny of these behaviors. This project consists of an analysis of five of these ultimate explanations, by confronting their predictions to empirical data from a large array of disciplines. In the end, I propose an evolutionary framework that synthesizes and reconciles these hypotheses.	Laughter , Humor , Evolution , Anthropology	en	4085.0
1479	"Facteurs associés à l’alliance thérapeutique en toxicomanie : 
effets modérateurs de la judiciarisation et des troubles sévères de santé mentale"	Drug misuse has a major negative impact on individuals and on society as a whole (MSSS, 2007). The efficiency of drug treatments is however weakened by the difficulty retaining and engaging this clientele in treatment (Meier et al., 2006). In this context, and because the quality of the therapeutic alliance is associated with treatment outcome and treatment retention (Martin et al., 2000; Meier et al., 2005a), the alliance which develops between the client and therapist in the course of therapy appeared to be a promising solution to improve the efficiency of the treatments of drug addiction.  The present study focus on the factors associated to the therapeutic alliance developed by drug addicts recruited in a drug rehabilitation programme (n = 269). The study is also interested in the influence of problems associated with addiction (justice and mental health) on the existing relations between the alliance and independents variables (moderating effects). The links between the therapeutic alliance and a range of factors (mental health, drug use, satisfaction with services, motivation, social support, legal pressures) are examined.   The findings demonstrate that pretreatment drug use covarie with the therapeutic alliance. Cognitive disorders and satisfaction with services are two main variables assess during the group therapy which are associated with the alliance. The moderating effect of problems associated with addiction (justice, mental health) on therapeutic alliance is finally supported.	therapeutic alliance , drug misuse , addiction , justice , justice , mental health	en	4078.0
1480	Un portrait du trafic de drogues fait par les membres de gangs de rue à Montréal	"In a context where the gang phenomenon has become omnipresent in our neighbourhoods and represents a growing problem in several large cities in Quebec and Canada, paying particular attention to drug trafficking by members of street gangs is undoubtedly of great interest.  The media strongly influences the image of gang phenomenon.  As information conveyed by newspapers and news channels focus on the stereotypes associated with gangs and their behaviour, it enhances the fear that society has regarding street gangs.  That being said, to shed light on gangs and their activities is an interest.  We chose to focus on drug trafficking which is common in street gangs.  The main objective of this research is to obtain the most accurate description and knowledge of drug trafficking from present and former street gang members related to their knowledge of drug trafficking as a result of their membership and their involvement in street gang activities.  Drug trafficking is addressed through interviews with gang members.  In total, fifteen semi-directive interviews were conducted among present and former gang members.  All respondents but one were from the Centre jeunesse de Montréal-Institut universitaire.  Overall, this study allows us to understand that in addition to drug trafficking, gangs or gang members indulge in polymorphic criminal activities; drug trafficking is rarely the sole source of income. Moreover, drug trafficking is not an activity exclusive to street gangs.  Thus, even if a number of members are involved in drug sales as a structured gang activity, it is possible for a member to sell drugs on a freelance basis while being affiliated with a street gang.  It appears that most respondents are part of a clique, identify a color or a district and buy drugs from older and higher ranked members that respondents identify as veterans. Regarding the veterans, respondents indicated the importance of being trusted by the highest ranked if they wish to evolve in the drug sales market.  When trust is present and the new seller begins his activities, either he takes over a turf, usually within his area, or the veteran provides a place where the new seller can ""work"".  The presence of a family member already affiliated to a gang seems to facilitate the process of access to new trafficking activities.  There are several dimensions associated with the territory aspect according to the interviewees such as: competition, conflict, interactions with rival gangs and violence, to name a few.   Members indicate selling a variety of drugs, cannabis and crack representing the two most commonly cited drugs. The profit margin varies among the type of drugs sold, the district and of customers’ characteristics. The customers, although diverse in nature, have something in common: addicted customers, as several interviewees have mentioned, are desperate to ensure their consumption. These are typically homeless, prostitutes, bars’ employees, partygoers and foreigners/ travellers.  Respondents also indicate the presence of undercover police officers, which may arise as customers.  Thus, it is essential to develop skills allowing them to distinguish the undercover police officers from regular customers.  Regarding drug use, respondents assert themselves using mostly alcohol and cannabis.  However, several admitted to having used a large variety of intoxicants during their lives."

1481	La entrevista sociolingüística y su valor como método de investigación	In this study we carried out the analysis of the main problems found at the time of using sociolinguistic interviews as a field method in search of authentic samples of linguistic performance. Such problematic arises from the very nature of the methodology used based on the observer's paradox (Labov 1972), and imposes the necessity to reflect on the advantages and inherent disadvantages on the used instrument of investigation.  With this intention, the primary goal pursued is to give answer to a question that underlies when speaking of the sociolinguistic interview: How to obtain samples of spontaneous style’s speech in the systematic observation of the interview? In order to try to give an answer to this problematic, a sample of twenty semi-structured interviews that integrates the Corpus of Spoken Rural Spanish (or Corpus Oral y Sonoro del Español Rural, COSER) was reviewed and analyzed (25 hours of recording).   The study of the sociolinguistic interviews as scientific method reveals as main result that among the strategies to reduce the effects of the observer's paradox the tactic to ask the informer to speak about an object of special affective value should be included, in order to generate a dismantling of the formal scheme of the interview and an emotional situation, in such a way that emotion neutralizes his linguistic consciousness and his speech. Thus, the attention of the speaker will concentrate in the same object and not in its formal speech, which leads to obtaining samples of more spontaneous and colloquial style.

1482	La souffrance et les vieux	The experience of suffering of elderly people lacking physical autonomy and who live in a CHSLD includes two dimensions: that of suffering and of being elderly. The two are closely linked. My hypothesis about the meaning of suffering takes into account the sense that the elderly give and have given to their lives. The meaning of suffering depends on the meaning of their life. Depending on whether one is an individualist, an agnostic humanist or a religious humanist, the meaning of suffering will take a particular form. This thesis addresses these two parts of the research problem and provides a portrait of the elderly in 2008, proposes a theoretical basis for the research project, and establishes a link between the meaning of suffering of the elderly and the meaning they give to their lives. The life of elderly people living in a CHSLD is discontinuous with their prior existence: their values and lifestyle are brought into question. Their presence in a substitute residence calls for reflection on the place of the elderly in contemporary individualistic society and the nature and provision of humane services. How should one reconcile individualism and humanism? How can one live with a loss of autonomy, general suffering, and a certain isolation? There are as many questions that challenge society with regards to the role of the family, and the care that the elderly justly deserve. The elderly need enlightened care givers and health policies that make residences places of real living and care; this must be a collective responsibility in the face of growing social exclusion.

1483	The Impact of Recycling on the Long-Run Stock of Trees	Interest in recycling of forest products has grown in recent years, one of the goals being to conserve the stock of trees or possibly increase it to compensate for positive externalities generated by the forest and neglected by the market. This paper explores the issue as to whether recycling is an appropriate measure to attain such a goal. We do this by considering the problem of the private owner of an area of land, who, acting as a price taker, decides how to allocate his land over time between forestry and some other use, and at what age to harvest the forest area chosen. Once the forest is cut, he makes a new land allocation decision and replants. He does so indefinitely, in a Faustmann-like framework. The wood from the harvest is transformed into a final product which is partly recycled into a substitute for the virgin wood, so that past output affects the current price. We show that in such a context, increasing the rate of recycling will result in less area being devoted to forestry. It will also have the effect of increasing the harvest age of the forest, as long as the planting cost is positive. The net effect on the flow of virgin wood being harvested to supply the market will as a result be ambiguous. The main point however is that recycling will result in a smaller, not a larger, stock of trees in the long run. It would therefore be best to resort to other means if the goal is to increase the stock of trees.	Recycling , Forestry , Faustmann Rule , Land Use , Q15, Q23, Q53	en	3995.0
1484	Influence du vieillissement sur la réorganisation cérébrale dans la compréhension du discours : apport de l’imagerie optique	During aging, changes in discourse comprehension have been reported, attributed in part by cognitive changes that occur during aging. Moreover, various studies suggest a cerebral reorganization with aging. This study aims to evaluate the influence of aging on cerebral reorganization during discourse comprehension using near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). The first hypothesis is that younger adults will have better accuracy on micropropositions and macropropositions, but will have equivalent performance for the situation model. The second hypothesis is that the neural networks used for discourse comprehension will be reorganized during aging. Thirty-two participants took part in this study: 16 young adults and 16 older adults. While undergoing NIRS recording on the prefrontal cortex (PFC), the participants read short stories each followed by a sentence deciding if it was in agreement or not with the previous story. Results didn’t show any differences for accuracy between the group, in opposition with the literature. The PFC was more activated by the older adults compared to the younger adults showing a cerebral reorganization.	discours , neuroimagerie , aging , cerebral reorganization , comprehension , discourse , near-infrared spectroscopy , neuroimaging	en	3976.0
1485	L'universalité des droits humains dans le contexte du pluralisme axiologique inhérent aux relations internationales : le cas du confucianisme	Abstract The demonstration elaborated here is similar, to a certain extent, to the one developed by Amartya Kumar Sen in The 'Argumentative Indian'. In his work, Sen discusses India’s intellectual and political inheritance, and the way this tradition is essential for the success of the democracy and secular politics of the Indian State. For our part, our interest lies not with India, but with China, quite particularly with the intellectual, political and moral legacy of the early Confucian scholars, and the relevancy to revisit, nowadays, Classical Confucian teachings in order to conceive and establish human rights in China. More precisely, our reflection lies within the contemporary debate, which takes place on an international scale, surrounding the so-called Asian values and human rights. For the advocates of the Asian values thesis, Asian values would be associated with the so-called Asian development model, which would distinguish itself from the « Western » model by resisting for instance human rights. These rights, having a western origin and being, in many respects, in breach with Asian values, would be neither desirable in Asia (particularly in China) nor compatible with Asian values (specifically with Confucian values). In our thesis, we refute this point of view. By the intervention of an analysis of the 'Universal Declaration of Human Rights' of 1948 and an examination of four texts founders of the Classical Confucianism who are: the 'Analects' (Lunyu), the 'Mencius' (Mengzi), the 'Great Learning' (Daxue), and the 'Practice of the Mean' (Zhongyong), we demonstrate that this understanding of things is unjustified. Human rights are not incompatible with Confucian values and their adoption is desirable in Asia (including China), quite as it is in Western countries. Actually, the philosophy of human rights and the Classic Confucian thought have numerous conceptual, axiological and normative affinities. Far from being in opposition, these theoretical views converge, because they both care about the human being, his vital needs, and his self-fulfillment within the community. Our demonstration leans, for the most part, on the analysis of a key concept of the Confucian ethical and political thought that is the notion of humanity, or humaneness (ren) and the closely related notion of gentleman, or morally noble person (junzi).

1486	Étude structurale de la fructoselysine 6-kinase d’Escherichia coli : reconnaissance de substrats et mécanisme enzymatique	Some enzymes have been found to deglycate the products of the Maillard reaction between sugars and primary amines: ketoamines. An operon is found in Escherichia coli that allows the growth on fructoselysine media. The deglycation process is done by a kinase and a “deglycase”. The fructoselysine 6-kinase, a member of the PfkB family, phosphorylates its substrate on the sixth carbon to initiate the metabolism of fructoselysine. Here are presented x-ray crystallography structures obtained for the fructoselysine 6-kinase in its native form and bound with ATP, ADP and AMP-PNP. The active site of the kinase has been determined, and modelisation of fructoselysine allowed identification of some residues that might be important for the specific binding of the substrate and the enzymatic mechanism. Kinetic results tend to suggest a SN2 mechanism for the phosphorylation catalyzed by the enzyme. Structural modifications of the FL6K could help to increase the size of the substrates recognized by the enzyme until it binds glycated proteins.

1487	Analyse de la fertilité des vaches laitières Holstein «Repeat Breeder»	Two factors underlie the Repeat Breeder (RB) concerns in Quebec: its incidence and economic impact. Currently RB incidence in Quebec is of ± 25% (yearly Report, June 2008, www.dsahr.ca). Monetary losses related to the RB are the result of veterinary expenses and insemination, loss of productivity and the involuntary culling.  In order to have a better knowledge of this syndrome, one must understand the general risk factors involved and then explore the individual condition of these problem cows. The goal of the first part of the project was to assess the impact of the postpartum reproductive problems and the effect of the lactation number as risk factors of the Repeat Breeder cow. A computerized data bank listing 418 383 lactations was analyzed. The analysis established dystocia as being the condition with the most consequences on future fertility. Other risk factors namely the number of lactations influence the reproductive prognosis as well. The second part of the research was to explore the individual condition of the RB using clinical tools. A cohort study was conducted on Holstein cows at the end of the voluntary waiting period on day 7 of the oestrous cycle. The clinical tests studied were vaginoscopy, trans-rectal examination, ultrasonography of the reproductive system, presence of leukocyte esterase, bacteriology and biochemistry of uterine fluid, endometrial cytology and serum progesterone profile. The results of these clinical tests reveal that the bacteriological analysis of uterine fluid is indicative of future reproductive status.

1488	Traduire et interpréter : survol des constructions subjectives d'Ezra Pound et de Xi Chuan	This dissertation strives to be a reflection on the importance of interpretation in a translation of poetic language.  This reflection takes is point of departure from the example of Ezra Pound, translator of classic Chinese poems. It continues with an exploration of the interpretative possibilities included in language itself, concluding with a subjective experience of translation.  I chose to translate three poems by Xi Chuan, a Chinese poet belonging to the obscure poetry movement. Obscure poetry is a contemporary literary movement which still continues today under the name of post-obscure poetry. Xi Chuan’s writings are an example of the search for a new expressive form for contemporary Chinese poets or, in other words, for the emergence of a subjective voice that is directly related to taking a stand with regard to the traditional past while striving for the emancipation and autonomy of literary expression. The place occupied by the obscure poet between the new and the old allows the individual to interpret the present in a manner that is more personal. In the same way, the translator has to break away from the past (in other words, the original text) to allow for interpretation and the projection of the new text into the future (that is, the receiving language).

1489	Sélection de modèle d'imputation à partir de modèles bayésiens hiérarchiques linéaires multivariés	Abstract  The technique known as multiple imputation seems to be the most suitable technique for solving the problem of non-response. The literature mentions methods that models the nature and structure of missing values. One of the most popular methods is the PAN algorithm of Schafer and Yucel (2002). The imputations yielded by this method are based on a multivariate linear mixed-effects model for the response variable. A Bayesian hierarchical clustered and more flexible extension of PAN is given by the BHLC model of Murua et al. (2005). The main goal of this work is to study the problem of model selection for multiple imputation in terms of efficiency and accuracy of missing-value predictions. We propose a measure of performance linked to the prediction of missing values. The measure is a mean squared error, and hence in addition to the variance associated to the multiple imputations, it includes a measure of bias in the prediction. We show that this measure is more objective than the most common variance measure of Rubin. Our measure is computed by incrementing by a small proportion the number of missing values in the data and supposing that those values are also missing. The performance of the imputation model is then assessed through the prediction error associated to these pseudo missing values. In order to study the problem objectively, we have devised several simulations. Data were generated according to different explicit models that assumed particular error structures. Several missing-value prior distributions as well as error-term distributions are then hypothesized. Our study investigates if the true error structure of the data has an effect on the performance of the different hypothesized choices for the imputation model. We concluded that the answer is yes. Moreover, the choice of missing-value prior distribution seems to be the most important factor for accuracy of predictions. In general, the most effective choices for good imputations are a t-Student distribution with different cluster variances for the error-term, and a missing-value Normal prior with data-driven mean and variance, or a missing-value regularizing Normal prior with large variance (a ridge-regression-like prior). Finally, we have applied our ideas to a real problem dealing with health outcome observations associated to a large number of countries around the world.

1490	"La pratique médicale des omnipraticiens : 
influence des contextes organisationnel et géographique"	Health services utilization is central to healthcare organization. Understanding the processes that determine utilization is essential to influence the health system and to ensure that it better meets the needs of the population.  The objective of this thesis is to understand the complex phenomenon of health services utilization by looking at general practitioners' practices.  Using Donabedian's theoretical framework, we decomposed determinants of utilization at three levels: individual, organizational and environmental. We chose a configurational approach to account for the complex nature of the phenomenon under study. Our question is the following: To what extent does the type of practice influence delivery of health services, and how do geographical environment and patient populations mediate this relationship?  We used combined data sources from the Collège des médecins du Québec, the Régie de l'assurance maladie du Québec and the iCLSC databases. Almost 70% of family physicians practicing in 2002 met the selection criteria. Multiple correspondence analyses and ascending hierarchical classifications were used to create a taxonomy of practices and a taxonomy of geographical contexts. We constructed services utilization indicators to assess continuity, comprehensiveness, accessibility and productivity. These indicators were validated using a population survey. The results first present physicians' profiles of practice. Two single-site profiles emerged. Private clinic practice is characterized by high levels of continuity and productivity. CLSC practice is typified by low productivity level and slightly above average levels of comprehensiveness and accessibility. Five other practice profiles include physicians who practice in different combinations of sites (multi-sites profiles). Two multi-institutional profiles of practice include physicians who divide their time in two different patterns, among emergency departments, hospital centres and private clinics or CLSCs. The levels of accessibility and productivity for physicians in these two groups are very high. The profile combining private clinics and long-term care facilities (the less active profile) includes physicians with below average productivity, and very high level of continuity. An ambulatory practice profile includes physicians who work in CLSCs, private clinics and long-term care facilities. Physicians in this profile, show low levels for all indicators. Finally, the hospital-based practice includes physicians who practice mainly in hospitals but also occasionally in private clinics.  Our analyses highlighted four groups of CSSS territories: rural, semi-urban, urban, and metropolitan. The prevalence of practice profiles vary based on context. In rural settings, about a third of physicians opt for multi-institutional practices. In semi-urban settings, physicians predominantly work in practices that include a CLSC component. In urban settings, more physicians choose a profile of practice with a private clinic component.  Finally, in metropolitan areas, the less active and more hospital-based type of practice attracts close to 40% of physicians. General practitioners are almost equally split among the other profiles of practices. Indicator levels vary according to geographical environment. As a result, accessibility increases with level of rurality. Conversely, productivity increases with level of urbanity. Continuity of care is higher in metropolitan and rural areas. Comprehensiveness changes little among contexts. We will refer back to the initial research question to look at the results and compare them with the literature. To offset the shortcomings of the limited analysis of physicians' practice organization found in the literature, we defined type of practice concept as the configuration of each physician's professional practice site To our knowledge, no other study reported in the literature has analyzed four service utilization indicators simultaneously to assess delivery of medical services.  Results of our analyses show that there is a difference in service delivery based on type of practice. Some results are documented in the literature, especially as regards single-site type of practice.  We will then present the relationships among indicators. Care continuity and comprehensiveness seem to be evolving in the same direction. Productivity and accessibility are also positively correlated. However, there is a certain tension between the former and the latter indicators. Only single-site types do not fit the indicators, as articulated in the state of current knowledge. No type of practice showed high levels for the four indicators. It is therefore necessary to work on combinations of practice types in the territories to offer the population the services required to reach all four care delivery objectives.  Emerging types of practice (which attract young doctors) and those that are dying out (where the prevalence of older physicians is highest) are discussed in the next section. It should be noted that the types of practice that are vanishing address the population's health needs better than emerging types, in terms of indicators. In conclusion, this thesis presents three theoretical and three methodological contributions. The implications for future research and decision making point out that if no measures are implemented to reverse the trend, Quebec risks to see deficiencies in delivery of services in terms of continuity, comprehensiveness and accessibility.

Using an original typology, we study changes in job quality for women and men, and changes in the gender gap. The novel aspect of this research is that it uses a multidimensional perspective on job quality by considering simultaneously four dimensions: wage level, employment stability, qualification and length of the work week. We first present our research topic, professional inequalities between genders in the labour market, and we review the literature concerning the main theories on gender inequality and job quality. We then present the conceptual framework of our research and our research questions; the relevance of our typology of job quality is then examined, and our approach to data analysis is justified. The analysis parameters chapter is dedicated to the creation of new typology of job quality and to data analysis framework. Finally, we present our results concerning the evolution of the job quality differences between male and female workers, taking into account the family situation, the education level of these individuals and some labor market characteristics. Our study reveals an appreciable decrease of the gender gap in job quality (an overall drop of more than 30 %). Our research shows that changes occur especially for those who have a relatively high level of education, those who live in a couple, and those whose family responsibilities are not too heavy. Most of the changes depend on a notable improvement of job quality for women, and not so much on the deterioration among male workers. Those results show that family situation and level of education, considering together, are significant determinants of the observed changes.	job quality , gender inequalities , wage , stability , qualifications , qualifications , hours of work	en	3922.0
1492	Developmental trajectories of body mass index in early childhood : an 8-year longitudinal study	Developmental Trajectories of Body Mass Index in Early Childhood: An 8-Year Longitudinal Study. Introduction: Childhood obesity has become one of the greatest Public Health challenges this century, affecting not only developed nations, but increasingly low- and middle-income countries as well. Estimating developmental trajectories of Body Mass Index (BMI) during early childhood represents an innovative approach towards a better understanding of the development of this health problem. Objective: To identify groups of children with distinct developmental trajectories of Body Mass Index (BMI) between the ages of five months and eight years, and to identify early-life risk factors that distinguish children in an atypically elevated BMI trajectory group. Methods: Group-based developmental trajectories of BMI were estimated from annual maternal assessments (5 months to 8 years) in a large population sample (n=1957). Measures of height and weight, as well as family and child characteristics were obtained yearly from mothers. Multivariate logistic regression was used to distinguish children with elevated BMI from other children, using pre and early post-natal risk factors. Results: Three trajectories of BMI were identified: low-stable BMI (54.5%), moderate BMI (41.0%) and high-rising BMI (4.5%). The high-rising group included children whose BMI, at eight years of age, exceeded the cut-off value for obesity. Multinomial logit regression analyses revealed that two maternal risk factors were significantly associated with the high-rising BMI trajectory group as compared to both the low and moderate groups: smoking during pregnancy and maternal overweight. Conclusions: Antecedents of childhood obesity can be identified during pregnancy. Intervention studies are needed in order to test the possibility that targeting maternal smoking and maternal obesity during pregnancy would reduce the risk of childhood obesity in the offspring. Keywords: Body Mass Index (BMI), child obesity, Group-based developmental trajectories, early life predictors, population-based study, maternal smoking, maternal obesity.

For this reason their luminosity declines until complete extinction. Their flux, particularly in the band between 0,8 and 2,35 μm, is absorbed by the water vapor in the terrestrial atmosphere. The goal of this research is to find a way to correct this part of their spectra affected by this effect. First, general notions needed to understand the project are exposed. The second chapter concerns the data reduction. The calibration, the problem of the position repeatability of the slit of the spectrometer SIMON and his cause are exposed. It discusses techniques to even up the pixels’ response and the substraction of the sky from the spectra. The method used to study the atmosphere effect on brown dwarf spectra is presented. The third chapter analyses the results that use the A0 reference star to correct the brown dwarf spectrum. We cannot conclude that the A0 spectrum is affected in the same way as the brown dwarf spectrum by the terrestrial atmosphere. The data from a single night do not allow a good analysis of this effect as a function of air mass and humidity level. Others missions are needed.	Near infrared spectroscopy , Low mass star	en	3901.0
1494	Influence des structures commerciales de types lifestyle centers sur la centralité de leurs régions périphériques : le cas du Quartier DIX30 à Brossard	Over the time, trade has knew numerous changes in term of location and form, passing from prestigious department stores in the heart of cities in the early twentieth century to large shopping centers at the junction of highways in the years 2000. The lifestyle center is the most accomplished commercial form, the American concept exists since the years 1980 and it appeared for the first time in Quebec in 2006 in Brossard on the South Shore of Montreal. Its unusual features: a sales area of almost 2 000 000 square feet (making it a center of supra-regional scale), a mix of shops clustered around a pedestrian street and numerous other activities, breaks with the traditional agencement of the existing shopping malls. Thus, by becoming established in Brossard, the Quartier DIX30 modifies profoundly the commercial structure of the South Shore of Montréal. The Quartier DIX30 imposes itself as a major commercial pole against the domination of the Promenades Saint Bruno. The Quartier DIX30 will not only change the commercial structure of the South Shore, but more generally the urban centrality of the South Shore established itself as a major center pole. Due to the variety of activities and its concept of mix of shops clustered around a pedestrian street permitting social interaction, the Quartier DIX30 creates a commercial and office concentration. Thus, today develops around the Quartier DIX30 many building with offices. However, this new centrality created by the Quartier DIX30 raises interrogations in particular with respect to the privatization of a space imposing itself more and more like one of the principal poles of growth of the South Shore. Thus, a question legitimate is posed, does we aren't attending a privatization of a downtown area in becoming?

This absence of photo-protection is associated with higher plasma triacylglycerol concentration (TG) in premature infants and, in animals, with oxidative stress and a H2O2 independent hepatic steatosis. We hypothesized that ascorbylperoxide is the active agent leading to high TG. The aim was to investigate the role of ascorbylperoxide on glucose and lipid metabolism in an animal model of neonatal parenteral nutrition.

1496	Parcours d'entrée en vie féconde des femmes au Burkina Faso : une analyse séquentielle	In West African societies, marriage has traditionally represented the first step of the sequence of demographic events regarding the formation of the family. Currently, this sequence has become more complex. Following the erosion of traditional patterns of entrance into adulthood, urban youth tend to delay marriage, to increasingly engage in premarital sex while premarital births among youth seem to rise. Our study considers demographic life courses of entry into reproductive life as individual sequences of states. The main purpose of this study is to explore, describe and explain changes in young women’s sequences of entry in reproductive life using individual sequences as the unit of analysis. Using data from the 2003 Demographic and Health Survey of Burkina Faso, we synthesize the timing of first sexual intercourse, first union and first birth into sequences. Using Sequence Analysis methods, we identify four main categories of entrance in reproductive life: marital, premarital sex, premarital childbearing and singles. These methods allow a finer classification and a visualization of complete sequences and their transition patterns. We then analyze the association between individual characteristics and the sequence that women follow. Our results confirm that non-traditional sequences rise among younger generations. We also show that while women’s years of instruction increase, the probability of starting a sequence by premarital sex rises and the probability of starting a sequence by a marriage falls dramatically. Finally the childhood place of residence seems to moderate these effects by increasing the probability to follow a non-traditional sequence for urban women.

1497	"Les multiples trajectoires d’activité physique supervisée et non supervisée
chez les enfants du primaire au Québec : un modèle écologique"	Context : Physical activity is a central component of a child physical, psychological and social development, most importantly in a society where sedentary behaviors and obesity become a more significant problematic. Few studies have investigated the developmental trajectories and predictors of physical activity over time. Furthermore, even fewer studies have investigated supervised and non-supervised physical activity separately. Objectives : The present study has for main goals (a) to identify developmental trajectories of supervised and non-supervised physical activity in elementary school children (b) to assess the link between these two types of physical activity (c) to identify neighborhood, family and individual predictors of these two types of physical activity. Participants: 1 814 children (51% boys) born in 1998 who participated in the Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child Development (QLSCD). Data were mainly collected through mothers’ report. Measures : The frequency of physical activity was measured at four time points when children were aged between 5 and 8 years old. Predictors and control variables were assessed when children were 4 or 5 years old. Results : Three trajectories of supervised and non-supervised activities have been identified. Trajectories of supervised physical activity (10%, 55.3% et 34.7%) are relatively stable although they are slightly increasing over time. Trajectories of nonsupervised physical activity (14.1%, 28.1% et 57.8%) are relatively stable although one group (28.1%) is increasing considerably. Supervised and non-supervised physical activity trajectories are not related to each other. Mother’s education, neighborhood safety and child’s prosociality are related to high frequency of both physical activities. Sufficient revenue and mother’s involvement in sport is related to frequent supervised vi physical activity trajectories as intact family predict less frequent non-supervised physical activity trajectories. Conclusion : First, involvement in supervised and non-supervised physical activity is relatively stable between 5 and 8 years old. Second, supervised and non-supervised physical activity appear to be two different processes that have their own set of predictors. Third, an ecological and multidimensional approach is required to capture the complexity of these two processes.

1498	Ring-opening of cycloalkane epoxides and aziridines with aromatic amines : toward the total synthesis of pactamycin	Abstract Ring-opening reactions of epoxides and aziridines have been extensively studied. The influence of different protecting groups on the hydroxyl group in the ring-opening reactions of cis- and trans- 3-hydroxy-1,2-cycloalkane epoxides with aromatic amines was studied. It was shown that Yb(OTf)3 in toluene was a mild catalyst for regioselective ring-opening, to give -anilino cycloalkanols in good yields. Heating the reaction mixture accelerated the rate of the reaction, albeit at the expense of yield. The aniline moiety was regioselectively added at the carbon furthest from the hydroxyl or ether group to yield a single regioisomer. The same trend was also observed with 3-azidocyclohex-1-ene epoxides and the corresponding 3-carbamates. The reaction time became shorter when acetonitrile was used as solvent, possibly due to the homogeneous medium. Ytterbium(III) triflate has also been used as the catalyst for the regioselective ring-opening of unactivated aziridines in cyclohexanes having an azide or benzyl ether substituent. Azide ion or aniline forms the corresponding trans-products giving access to vicinal diamines in good yields. A racemic ω-alkoxy p-methoxy benzyl ether HDAC inhibitor has been prepared in 8 synthetic steps (26% overall yield) from 1-((tert-butyldiphenylsilyl)oxy)hept-6-en-2-ol. This is an improvement over the published method (9 steps, 16% overall yield). The cross-metathesis method proved to be efficient and practical in this strategy, and alkylation using p-methoxybenzyl trichloroacetimidate in the presence of Sc(OTf)3 improved the overall yield of the synthesis.  An amino alcohol that contains all the core carbons, functional groups and the required stereochemistry present in pactamycin was obtained starting from L-threonine over 27 steps. The methodology described in this thesis allows for a synthesis of this key intermediate on a multigram scale.

1499	La responsabilité pénale des sociétés canadiennes pour les crimes contre l’environnement survenus à l’étranger	Due to trade liberalization, multinational enterprises (MNEs) are overwhelmingly engaged in developing countries’ industries. Unfortunately, many of those MNEs pay scant attention to environmental preservation. Yet, almost all developing countries lack effective rules designed to protect the environment from polluting activities operated by MNEs. In the absence of any incentive, it is impossible for MNEs to avoid environmentally harmful operations. As economic agents, MNEs are not willing to adopt environmental protection costs without any legislation compelling them to do so. The profit maximization rationale underlying corporate policy leaves little room for incurring environmental preservation costs and only voluntary measures are applied in the management of polluting operations. As a general principle, the regulation of MNEs’ conduct falls upon the State whose territory is directly harmed by polluting operations. However, the lack of resources of developing countries as well as the financial influence of MNEs has weakened environmental protection regulation in many states. The preservation of the environment from polluting activities of MNEs has also undermined by the lack of political will of developing countries which is increased by the corruption phenomenon. Despite the large number of international treaties and conventions designed to protect the environment from pollutant threats, those international instruments cannot directly apply to MNEs as they are non-state actors. Hence, developed countries, under whose law many MNEs are incorporated, are required to fill this gap in regulating their MNEs’ activities abroad. This dissertation suggests the examination of juridical mechanisms by which environmental crimes which take place in developing countries may trigger criminal prosecution in Canada. Given the absence of Canadian regulation dealing explicitly with extraterritorial criminal conduct of MNEs, this research seeks to provide a new approach to existing law in order to deal with transnational environmental crimes, bearing in mind that environmental protection has emerged as a fundamental value in Canadian society. Nowadays, the values represented by environmental protection entail the shift of the traditional territoriality principle since worldwide economic activities have brought transnational threats of global concern. Therefore, we hold that Canada would be entitled to extend its competence so as to assert jurisdiction over environmental crimes occurred abroad during operations conducted by Canadian citizens. The need to assert extraterritorial jurisdiction to environmental crimes committed within foreign sovereignty becomes more pressing if those crimes reach the same level of gravity as international crimes.

1500	Evaluation des effets analgésiques du meloxicam après des chirurgies orthopédiques chez le pigeon (Columba livia)	Pain assessment is especially difficult in avian species, since many birds behave as prey and do not show any external signs of distress. Choice of drugs and dosages used in clinical practice are most of the time based on extrapolation from other species and clinical experience. Few pharmacokinetic, efficacy or toxicity research studies are available in the literature. Most of these studies used noxious stimuli, such as electric or thermal stimuli, and results are therefore difficult to extrapolate to clinical pain. The objective of our project was to study the analgesic efficacy of two dosages of meloxicam in pigeons, using a femoral fracture pain model. Postoperative pain was assessed during the first four postoperative days by three different methods: weight bearing load on the fractured limb versus the controlateral limb, four different descriptive pain scales and ethogram realization based on video recordings. Administration of 0.5 mg/kg PO q12h of meloxicam did not show any reduction in the measured level of pain compared to the control group that received saline. However, pigeons that received 2 mg/kg PO q12h showed a significant decrease in their pain levels, with the three different pain assessment methods. Our results suggest that 2 mg/kg can provide a superior level of analgesia compared to the dosages recommended in the current literature, for pigeons that have undergone an orthopedic surgery.	fracture , meloxicam , pigeon , analgesia , avian , birds , fracture , meloxicam , pain , pigeon , surgery	en	3789.0
1501	Étude des voies de signalisation en amont et en aval de la petite GTPase Rac1	The molecular events upstream and downstream of Rac leading to cell migration and still to date not fully understood allthough more than 20 effectors have been identified for this GTPase. The first part of our project is to use a non-biased proteomic approach to try to identify novel binding partners of Rac1. In order to do so, we developped a novel purification strategy that enabled us to purify Rac and its binding partners in a timely manner. The second part of our project is to understand the role of Dock5 phosphorylation downstream of the integrins. We identified phosphorylated residues in the PXXP region of the atypical RacGEF upon fibronectin stimulation and found 14 kinases able to phosphorylate this region. According to our results, Dock5 phosphorylation does not affect its GEF activity but diminishes its interaction with various SH3 domain-containing proteins. Thus, our data suggest that Dock5 phosphorylation would regulate complex formation and recruitment of this protein by adaptor proteins.	Rac1 , Dock5 , Cell migration , Rac1 , Dock5	en	3782.0
1502	Évaluation gastro-intestinale chez des chiens présentant un comportement de léchage excessif de surface	The objective of this study was to characterize excessive licking of surfaces (ELS) in dogs and demonstrate that it can be a sign of underlying gastrointestinal (GI) pathology rather than an obsessive-compulsive disorder. Twenty dogs presented with ELS (L group) were divided in 2 subgroups of 10 dogs each: L0 without and LD with concomitant digestive signs. Ten healthy dogs were assigned to a control group (C group). Behavioral, physical and neurological examinations were performed prior to a complete work-up of the GI system (CBC, serum chemistry panel, urinalysis, assessment of total serum bile acids and canine specific pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity, fecal flotation by zinc sulfate, fecal culture, abdominal ultrasonography and upper GI endoscopy with biopsies). Based on results, appropriate treatment was recommended. Dogs were monitored subsequently for 90 days during which the licking behavior was recorded. Gastrointestinal disorders were identified in14/20 L dogs. Underlying GI disorders included eosinophilic infiltration of the GI tract, lymphoplasmacytic infiltration of the GI tract, delayed gastric emptying, irritable bowel syndrome, chronic pancreatitis, gastric foreign body and giardiasis. Significant improvement (>50%) in frequency or duration of the basal ELS behavior was observed in the majority of dogs (56%). Resolution of ELS occurred in half of the L dogs. Except for ELS, there was no significant difference in the behavior (e.g. anxiety) of L dogs and C dogs. GI disorders should be considered in the differential diagnosis of ELS in dogs	excessive licking of surface , dog , gastrointestinal , obsessive-compulsive disorder , behavior	en	3776.0
1503	"Les sûretés sur les valeurs mobilières : 
le mouvement d'uniformisation d'origine américaine est-il transposable universellement ? : vers une approche québécoise à la question"	New technologies changed financial markets.  Where securities were represented by certificates, now often, they are dematerialised and held indirectly in order to facilitate and expedite trades.  However, this situation caused new problems since the legislation was inadequate to regulate the indirect holding system.   The american Uniform Commercial Code enacted a new and unique legislation in order to respond to the legal uncertainty.  Following the Americans, an international effort rised in order to harmonise legislation pertaining to the transfers and security interests on securities and other investment properties, namely, the Hague Conference, UNIDROIT and the Uniform Law Conference of Canada, just to name a few.  Accordingly, Quebec adopted the Act respecting the transfer of securities and the establishment of security entitlements, in order to respond to the actual discrepancies.  However, does the Act integrate itself harmoniously within the civil law tradition?  May the private citizen grant a hypothec on securities? Where are situated uncertificated or indirectly held securities?   We will attempt to answer these questions in two parts; firstly, we will study the evolution and particulars of the transfers and security interests on securities and other investment properties.  Secondly, we will study the Quebec Act in respect with other legislations and with the civil law rules.

1504	Un formalisme pour la traçabilité des transformations	When developing software system in industry, system specifications are heavily used in communication among analysts and developers. However, system evolution, employee turn-over and shorter deadlines lead those documents either not to be up-to-date or not to be consistent with the actual system source code. Yet, having up-to-date documents would greatly help analysts and developers and reduce development and maintenance costs. Therefore, we need to keep those documents up-to-date and consistent.  We propose a novel mathematical formalism to describe and manipulate the evolution of these documents. The mathematical formalism is based on Hoare triple to represent the transformations and group theory and groups homomorphisms to manipulate these transformations and apply them on different representations.  We illustrate our formalism using two representation of a same system: PADL, that is an abstract design specification (similar to UML), and JCT, that is an Abstract Syntax Tree for Java. We also define transformations describing their evolutions, and transformations transposition from one representation to another. Finally, we provide an implementation of our illustration, a plugin for the Eclipse IDE detecting source code transformations made by a developer and a source code generator for integrating new representations in the implementation.	traceability , model , source code , group theory , transpositions , transpositions	en	3747.0
1505	Caractérisation phénotypique et génotypique d’isolats de Salmonella Typhimurium provenant de porcs sains ou septicémiques	Salmonella Typhimurium infections represent an important threat both to the swine industry and public health since pig is also a reservoir for human infections. Multiresistance to antimicrobial agents is often associated with S. Typhimurium belonging to phage type (PT) 104, and these isolates can cause septicemia in fattening pigs. It is thus necessary to control the infection at the herd level to avoid meat contamination by these isolates. However, in order to develop more efficacious control measures, it is important to characterize isolates, better understand the pathogenesis of infection and identify virulence factors.  The main objective of this study was to characterize isolates of S. Typhimurium associated with septicemia in swine and to compare them to isolates recovered from healthy pigs.  Isolates of S. Typhimurium associated with septicemia in swine (CS) were compared to isolates recovered from healthy animals at slaughterhouses (WCS). The phage type of each isolate was identified and these isolates were characterized by antimicrobial resistance, SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting, and PFGE. Among the CS isolates, PT 104 represented 36.4% of isolates while it represented 51.5% of WCS isolates. Resistance to as many as twelve antimicrobial agents was found in isolates from CS and WCS. However, it was not possible to associate any particular protein to septicemic isolates. Multiple genetic profiles were identified among the isolates of PT 104.  Different steps of the pathogenesis of Salmonella infection were evaluated, in particularly the ability to adhere to and invade intestinal epithelial cell lines by CS and WCS isolates. The isolates recovered from diseased animals invaded intestinal epithelial cell lines at a higher rate than isolates from healthy pigs (P=0.003). Some isolates were selected according to their invasion rate and some analysis, using flow cytometry were done to evaluate phagocytosis, induction of apoptosis, and adhesion to intestinal mucus. The survival in monocytes was evaluated and the MATS method was used to evaluate the bacterial surface properties, measuring interactions with solvents. Isolates from WCS were more phagocytized than isolates fom CS at 15 minutes (P=0.02). We found no significant difference for the other methods used.  Using SSH, we also compared the genome of a CS isolate (#36) to that of a WCS isolate (#1), for the identification of putative virulence factors. Clones with chromosome and plasmids homology were obtained. It was therefore decided to analyze the plasmid profiles of all isolates. Two profiles (PL14 and PL20) were more frequently observed in the PT 104 isolates than in the isolates belonging to other phage types (P=0.01 and P=0.01, respectively). Various profiles were found in both isolates from septicemic pigs and those from healthy pigs. An interesting plasmid of the CS isolate was sequenced. This plasmid possesses genetic information for replication as well as a beta-galactosidase-α. It would be needed to characterize the role of these putative virulence factors in the future.  Our work suggests that isolates from septicemic pigs may be distinguished from isolates from healthy pigs by their better ability to invade intestinal cells as well as by a lower rate of phagocytosis in the early steps of infection. This study increased our knowledge on the pathogeny of S. Typhimurium infection in pigs.

1506	Les valeurs professionnelles de nouvelles enseignantes du primaire au regard de la modernité et de la postmodernité	The integration of new teachers in their working environment is more and more the focus of interest in the education research community. With the upcoming of reflexive practice methods, there is a large space for autonomy in nowadays teaching environments, which can be heavy to handle especially at the beginning of professional practice. Facing this freedom implies a reference  to certain values in order to handle well educational tasks. This master focuses on those values which are inspiring young teachers and help them deal with the beginning of their profession.  Furthermore this work provides an analysis, based on deep reflections of new teachers, which gives an intuitive sense of their values and relations concerning their workplace.  The interpretation of our data is done through the perspectives of modernity and postmodernity, which presently seem to have an important impact on young educators professional values.    The analysis of the survey underlying this work shows, in spite of the presence of common modern and postmodern values, a significant interesting tendency. The interrogated teachers seem to be foremost true to themselves, even if it leads to the abandonment of their profession, a fact which seems to be a reflection of the balance between their professional priorities and their personal values. It is obvious that these young teaching professionals aspire to work in the most possible authentic way. Even if some of them deal with difficulties in facing work flexibility and adaptation, the analysis confirms that these values are well integrated in their professional habitus.

1507	Favoriser le transfert de connaissances grammaticales en situation d'écriture : mise à l'essai d'une séquence didactique auprès d'élèves de troisième secondaire	This action research aims to determine by which means French teachers can contribute to help their secondary students in transferring their grammatical knowledge in writing situations.   We first noticed that, for secondary students in general, agreements are more likely to be successful in exercise context than in writing context.  Based on didactical propositions of researchers interested in grammatical spelling and/or transfer of knowledge, notably propositions consisting in an inductive approach, centered on student questioning and sentence analysis, we conceived and developed a didactical sequence about the agreement of past participle used with être or with an attributive verb.  Then, we implemented it in a third grade secondary student group, and we observed its effects by pretesting and posttesting, using questionnaires, exercises and written productions.     Results revealed by data analysis show the efficiency of the lessons built.  Students succeeded a lot more often in making agreement of past participle used with être or with an attributive verb after the implement of the didactical sequence than before.  The mean rate of successful agreement in exercises came from 53% to 75%, while agreement in written production is 48% successful before, against 82% after.  The questionnaires collected incline us to believe that this augmentation of successful agreement rate in written productions is related to the right progress of the transfer process due to work done during lessons on conditional knowledge.

1508	Influence d’un supplément alimentaire sur le développement des colonies d’abeilles domestiques (Apis mellifera, Linnaeus 1758) au Québec	The use of pollen supplement is a countermeasure to honey bee malnutrition which is identified as one of the factors causing high colonies losses over the past few years in Quebec. There is little documentation on the results of using pollen supplement during different periods. The effects of pollen availability and supplementation on the development of honey bee colonies were examined during 3 different periods: in spring, during cranberry pollination and in late summer. Each period was a distinct study using 40 different colonies. In each study, pollen supplemented and pollen restricted conditions were created for one month in 10 colonies per treatment group in a 2x2 factorial design experiment. Brood rearing and honey yield were monitored until the end of summer for the spring and the cranberry pollination studies and until the end of the following spring for the late summer study. In the spring study, pollen restricted colonies reared 18% less brood (p<0.05) during the restriction period and 11% less brood (p<0.05) by the end of summer while pollen supplement had no effect (p>0.05). Colonies supplemented during cranberry pollination study reared less brood (p<0.05) by the end of summer. In the late summer study, supplemented colonies had a greater (p<0.05) spring build-up (60% more brood) and pollen restriction negatively influence (p<0.05) brood rearing. Honey yield was decreased (p<0.05) by 15 kg in colonies exposed to a pollen restriction in spring. It was increased by 1.3 kg (p<0.05) in pollen supplemented colonies during the cranberry pollination study and was reduced by 4.2 kg (p<0.05) in pollen restricted colonies in the late summer study. In conclusion, pollen supplement improved colonies population when fed in late summer and not during spring or in cranberry pollination and was without impact on honey yield.

1509	Portrait du journalisme à la pige à l’heure de la convergence	This research explores the independent journalism in the contemporary context of socio-technological and media convergences. Here I question the existence of a connection between freelance and convergence practices in journalism, and its contribution to the development of the journalistic world. This is an exploratory and empirical study, focused on freelancers’ experiences and developed around the concepts of tactics, resistance, freedom and governance. I have thus formulated a theoretical framework, supported by Michel Foucault’s accounts related to power. I argue that freelancing and convergence are free movements, co-existing and forming a driving force for the institution of power represented by journalism in advanced democracies. In this current context of convergences, this freedom allows freelancers to challenge the limits of journalism, hence increasing the scope of applications within this greater realm of mass communication.

1510	Observations de pulsateurs compacts à l'aide de la caméra Mont4K CCD	Compact pulsators are stars with surface gravities larger than 100,000 cm/s² showing intrisinc luminosity variations. Six different classes of such objects are known, including two pulsating hot subdwarf (sdB), and four pulsating white dwarf classes. In order to observe their pulsations and further analyze their properties through asteroseismology, the Universit\'e de Montr\'eal, in collaboration with the University of Arizona Imaging Instrument Laboratory, developed the Mont4K (Montreal4K) CCD camera which is the primary science detector of the Kuiper 1.55 m telescope at Mt Bigelow since Spring 2007. With this setup, several compact pulsators were targeted. The first target was the hybrid pulsator HS 0702+6043, observed from November 1st 2007 to March 14th 2008, for which 28 pulsation modes were isolated. Moreover, it was possible to highlight important amplitude variations in some of these modes. Two Hot DQ white dwarf pulsators, SDSS J220029.08-074121.5 and SDSS J234843.30-094245.3, were also targeted. In the case of J220029.08-074121.5, it was possible to highlight the presence of a strong magnetic field at its surface through the presence of the first harmonic of the main pulsation mode of this object. Furthermore, the follow-up campaigns on J220029.08-074121.5 and J234843.30-094245.3 allowed to classify these two white dwarf as Hot DQ pulsators.	stars , oscillations , oscillations , hot subdwarf , white dwarf , asteroseismology , photometry , HS 0702+6043 , HS 0702+6043 , J2200-0741 , J2200-0741 , J2348-0942 , J2348-0942	en	3672.0
1511	Nanoparticules Chitosane-PEG-FA-ADN pour la thérapie génique non virale et application du gène de l’IL-1Ra dans un modèle expérimental d’arthrite rhumatoïde	Considered to be one of the medical challenges of the coming decade, the success of gene therapy depends on the ability to deliver therapeutic DNA to target cells. Non-viral polymers, such as chitosan (Ch), a cationic polymer, can be easily combined with DNA. Once a complex is formed, DNA is protected from degradation by nucleases.  The first objective of this study was to define the characteristics of the best-suited Ch nanoparticle for maximum selective transfection in human epidermoid carcinoma (KB) cells in vitro. Nanoparticles varied by the presence or absence of folic acid (FA) and Ch’s molecular weight (MW 5, 25 and 50 kDa). They were then selected and combined with interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) gene, a natural blocker of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1beta (IL-1β). The second objective was to inject these carriers by the hydrodynamic method in a rat model of adjuvant-induced arthritis and to evaluate the inhibitory effects of IL-1Ra against inflammation in vivo.   Ch-DNA nanoparticles with FA and Ch25 demonstrated selective transfection and significantly increased it in KB cells in vitro. The inhibitory effects of IL-1Ra gene therapy in vivo were evident from lower expression levels of inflammatory factors (IL-1 and prostaglandin E2) and decreased macroscopic limb inflammation. The results also revealed the presence of human recombinant IL-1Ra protein in rat sera. Non-viral gene therapy with Ch-PEG-FA-DNA nanoparticles containing the IL-1Ra gene appears to significantly decrease inflammation in this experimental model of arthritis.

1512	Les récepteurs intracellulaires de l'angiotensine II : nouvelles cibles thérapeutiques pour le remodelage cardiaque	Angiotensin-II (Ang-II) from extracardiac sources and intracardiac synthesis regulates cardiac homeostasis, with mitogenic and growth-promoting effects largely due to altered gene-expression. In this study, the possibility that angiotensin-1 (AT1R) or angiotensin-2 (AT2R) receptors are located on the nuclear envelope and mediate effects on cardiomyocyte gene expression was assessed. Western blot tests of nucleus-enriched rat heart fractions indicated the presence of AT1R and AT2R proteins that preferentially copurified with a nuclear membrane marker (Nup 62) but not markers of plasma (Calpactin I), Golgi apparatus (GRP 78) or endoplasmic reticulum (GM130) membranes. Confocal microscopy revealed the existence of AT1R and AT2R proteins on nuclear membranes. Microinjected Ang-II preferentially bound to nuclear sites of isolated cardiomyocytes. Ca2+i-recordings on nuclear preparations demonstrated an AT1R-mediated Ca2+ release. AT1R and AT2R ligands enhanced de novo RNA synthesis in isolated cardiomyocyte nuclei incubated with [α32P]UTP (e.g. 16.9 ± 0.5 cpm/ng for DNA control vs. 162.4 ± 29.7 cpm/ng for DNA Ang-II, 219.4 ± 8.2 cpm/ng for DNA L-162313 (AT1) and 126.5 ± 8.7 cpm/ng for DNA CGP42112A (AT2), P<0.001). Ang-II application to isolated cardiomyocyte nuclei enhanced NFκB mRNA-expression, a response that was suppressed by co-administration of valsartan or PD123177. Dose-response experiments with Ang-II applied to purified nuclei vs. to whole cardiomyocytes showed a greater increase in NFκB mRNA levels at saturating concentrations with ~3 fold greater affinity (EC50 values 9 vs. 28 pmol/L, respectively), suggesting preferential nuclear signaling. These results lead us to conclude that cardiac nuclear membranes possess angiotensin receptors that couple to nuclear signaling pathways and regulate transcription. Signaling within the nuclear envelope (e.g. from intracellularly synthesized Ang-II) may play a role in Ang-II-mediated changes in cardiac gene-expression, with potentially important mechanistic and therapeutic implications.

1513	L’allocation d’antiviraux dans un contexte de pandémie : vérification de critères auprès des professionnels de la santé pour le développement d’un cadre éthique	The goal of this study is to assess the use of criteria as a means of deciding who might be priority recipients of an antiviral stockpile, aimed specifically at prevention, during an influenza pandemic. It is understood that a public antiviral stockpile for prevention is not available at this time. Thus one of the objectives of this research is to provide guidance to decision-makers in terms of feedback from healthcare workers on the issue of whether it is necessary to acquire such a stockpile and, if so, for whom. The specific perspectives of two groups of front-line healthcare workers are considered. One group consists of healthcare workers from Toronto hospitals who have experienced the 2003 SARS outbreak. The other group consists of healthcare workers from hospitals in Montreal who did not experience the SARS outbreak. The two groups analyses are based on verbal comments and their responses to a questionnaire designed to evaluate how participants with different background experiences will view and rank the proposed criteria.	analyse qualitative , Bioethics , focus group , influenza pandemic , qualitative analysis	en	3627.0
1514	Étude des facteurs influençant la susceptibilité à l'infection au VIH chez des femmes africaines	Initial exposure to HIV during heterosexual transmission occurs in the female genital tract. However, little is known about the local immunity, the factors influencing the susceptibility to HIV infection and the immune response in the female genital tract against HIV infection.  The aim of this study is to analyse some factors that could be implicated in the susceptibility to HIV infection and to analyse, in part, the immunity present in the female genital tract. We investigated the role of HLA-G and HLA-E in the susceptibility to HIV infection in a cohort of Zimbabwean women. We found that the presence of HLA-G*0105N allele in combination with the genotype HLA-EG/HLA-EG was associated with a decrease in the risk of HIV infection. We also measured the expression of soluble HLA-G in a study of commercial sex workers (CSW) in Benin. Levels of soluble HLA-G were lower in the HIV-1-infected CSWs compared to those observed in both the HIV-1-uninfected CSWs and the HIV-1-uninfected women from the general population at low risk of infection. We also analysed the chemokine and cytokine expression patterns in the serum and female genital tract of the three groups of women. HIV-1-infected CSWs had significantly higher blood and genital levels of the chemokines IP-10, MCP-3 and MIG compared with those in both the HIV-1-uninfected CSW and non-CSW groups. HIV-1-infected CSWs had significantly higher genital mucosal levels of the cytokines TNF-α and IFN-γ compared with those in both the HIV-uninfected CSW and non-CSW groups. In contrast, the serum levels of the cytokines IL-2, IL-10 and TNF-α were lower in HIV-1-infected CSWs compared with those in the other groups. This suggests the presence of a constant immune cells recruitment and immune activation in the female genital tract in order to favour perpetuation and dissemination of the virus. Our results also demonstrate the important difference between the systemic and the mucosal immunity. We also observed a significant increase in the levels of IL-4, MIP-1α, MIP-1β and MCP-1 in the serum of the HIV-1-uninfected CSWs. It seems that these highly-exposed and yet uninfected women can have a better capacity to mount an early immune response against HIV. This study gives us new insights of the mucosal immunology of HIV infection.	HIV , HLA-G , HLA-G , Immunologie , Mucosal immunology , Africa , Cytokines , Cytokines , Chemokines	en	3623.0
1515	"Quotients d'une variété algébrique par un groupe algébrique linéairement
réductif et ses
sous-groupes maximaux unipotents"	The topological notion of a quotient is fairly simple. Given a topological group $G$ acting on a topological space $X$, one gets the natural application from $X$ to the quotient space $X/G$. In algebraic geometry, unfortunately, it is generally not possible  to give the orbit space the structure of an algebraic variety. In the special case of a linearly reductive group acting on a projective variety $X$, the geometric invariant theory allows us to get a morphism of variety from an open $U$ of $X$ to a projective variety $X//G$, which is as close as possible to a quotient map, from a topological point of view.  As an example, let $ X\subseteq P^{n}$ be a $k$-projective variety on which acts a linearly reductive group $G$. Suppose further that this action is induced by a linear action of $G$ on $A^{n+1}$ and let $\widehat{X}\subseteq A^{n +1}$ be the affine cone over $X$. By an important theorem of the classical invariants theory, there exist homogeneous invariants $f_{1},..., f_{r}\in C[\widehat{X}]^{G}$ such as $$\C[\widehat{X}]^{G}=\C[f_{1},...,f_{r}].$$ The locus in $X$ of $f_{1},...,f_{r}$ is called the nullcone, noted $N$. Let $Proj(C[\widehat{X}]^{G})$ be the projective spectrum of the invariants ring. The rational map $$\pi:X\dashrightarrow Proj(C[f_{1},...,f_{r}])$$ induced by the inclusion of $C[\widehat{X}]^{G}$ in $C[\widehat{X}] $ is then surjective, constant on the orbits and separates orbits as much as possible, that is, the fibres contains exactly one closed orbit. A regular map is obtained by removing the nullcone; we then get a regular map $$\pi:X \backslash N\rightarrow Proj(C[f_{1},...,f_{r}])$$ which still satisfy the preceding properties. The Hilbert-Mumford criterion, due to Hilbert and revisited by Mumford nearly half-century later, can be used to describe $N$ without knowing the generators of the invariants ring. Since those are rarely known, this criterion had proved to be quite useful. Despite the important applications of this criterion in classical algebraic geometry, the demonstrations found in the literature are usually given trough the difficult theory of schemes. The aim of this master thesis is therefore, among others, to provide a demonstration of this criterion using classical algebraic geometry and of commutative algebra. The version that we demonstrate is somewhat wider than the original version of Hilbert \cite{hilbert}; a schematic proof of this general version is given in \cite{kempf}. Finally, the proof given here is valid for $C$ but could be generalised to a field $k$ of characteristic zero, not necessarily algebraically closed.  In the second part of this thesis, we study the relationship between the preceding constructions and those obtained by including covariants in addition to the invariants. We give a Hilbert-Mumford criterion for covariants (Theorem 6.3.2) which is a theorem from Brion for which we prove a slightly more general version. This theorem, together with a simplified proof of a theorem of Grosshans (Theorem 6.1.7), are the elements of this thesis that can't be found in the literature.

1516	Renverser la vapeur : la construction de la résilience : une approche autobiographique	The research object of this paper is resilience as seen through the prism of an autobiographical approach within a context of research training. The concept of resilience being possibly either over-or under-estimated by various researchers, the author through analysis of her life story, relates the experience of an “ordinary” though very real resilience, this in opposition to an “out of ordinary” one.   The author approaches the notion of resilience from various perspectives. However, she privileges the neurosciences approach that shows through brain imaging, the realignment of the brain during interactions. Yet, for many authors including Boris Cyrulnik and Allan N. Schore, resilience takes root following an attachment experience, as resilience cannot be built alone. The author’s therapeutic process of bioenergetic analysis is reflected in her autobiographical journey.

1517	Negative affect mediates the relationship between the Cortisol Awakening Response and Conduct Problems in boys	This thesis begins with two chapters which discuss conduct problems and stress regulation, with a focus on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Subsequently, the literature is reviewed and we see that with regards to the relationship between conduct problems and HPA axis activity, the findings are inconsistent. It is possible that methodological considerations underlie the inconsistency found in the literature and the following chapter is concerned with methodology. This is followed by the featured study presented in this thesis which examines the link between the cortisol awakening response (CAR), which is considered a good indicator of HPA axis functioning, and conduct problems in children. Further, negative affect has been linked to both conduct problems and the Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR). Thus it was hypothesized that negative affect acts as a mediator in the cortisol-conduct problems relationship. The featured study found that a reduced CAR was associated with both negative affect and conduct problems, however only in boys and not in girls. Further, the mediation hypothesis was supported in boys. The last chapter in this thesis discusses the implications of this mediation finding for theories of conduct problems as well as proposing some psychobiological mechanisms to explain the sex differences found.

1518	Dimensions des représentations du concept de Temps dans treize classes du préscolaire et du premier cycle du primaire au Québec	"Since September 2002, elementary schools in Quebec have to use a new series of programs with a new content. In the first cycle, in social universe, the competence that is targeted is ""Building its representation of space, time and society"" (MEQ, 2001). But we know that to build a teaching with the aim to guide an individual in the construction of his/her representation, it is necessary to be aware of the initial representations of the object. But what are the representations of time for students in kindergarten and in the first cycle in elementary school in Quebec? That is the question we are asking in this thesis. To answer this question, we sought to express the time by proposing a theoretical reflection on its essence and analyzing the sense that it takes in the program. Our methodology identified the dimensions of these representations in the verbalization of 164 subjects in kindergarten and in first and second year of elementary school, spread over 13 classes in Montreal. Through this research, we would be able to provide researchers and educators with a new list of dimensions of time representations adapted to the current educational system in Quebec as well as to express the representations of time from the classes that we have visited. Finally, thanks to these results, we will be able to suggest a few remarks and principals on how to teach time in classrooms."	time , concept , representation , social universe	en	3587.0
1519	Visions d’État : deux systèmes d'informations géographiques dans la « gouvernance »	During the 1990s, Canada’s federal government and the European Commission established two networks of geographic information systems (GIS):  the National Forest Information System in Canada and the Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Union. These two systems permit social and environment facts to be studied geographically and to be mapped.   In this thesis, we emphasize the heuristic value of these two networks of geographic information systems: an analysis of them allows us to better understand the institutional configurations that existed during their development, that is to say, in our cases, what is called “governance”. As instruments that measure and represent phenomena, GIS belong to knowledge tools. As knowledge tools, they allow us to discuss two issues of “governance” theories: relationships between central and local administrations, and relationships between state and non-state organizations. This discussion leads us to show, on the one hand, that the reorganization of different levels of government does not signify, as is described elsewhere in the literature, the retreat of central administrations in favor of local administrations, but is rather a means for more forcefully controlling them. On the other hand, we show that the renegotiation of relationships between central and local administrations is not accompanied, in reality, by a negotiation of relationships with non-state organizations. In light of the fact that non-state organizations are not integrated in states’ GIS networks, we must revisit theories of “governance” that foresee governments as more open to civil society. This helps us to understand how knowledge tools can be used in order to exclude certain facts from State's sight.  In conclusion, this political analysis of two specific software – GIS – leads us to propose that some software can be considered as political institutions.

1520	Sequential Machine learning Approaches for Portfolio Management	This thesis considers a number of approaches to make machine learning algorithms better suited to the sequential nature of financial portfolio management tasks.  We start by considering the problem of the general composition of learning algorithms that must handle temporal learning tasks, in particular that of creating and efficiently updating the training sets in a sequential simulation framework.  We enumerate the desiderata that composition primitives should satisfy, and underscore the difficulty of rigorously and efficiently reaching them.  We follow by introducing a set of algorithms that accomplish the desired objectives, presenting a case-study of a real-world complex learning system for financial decision-making that uses those techniques.  We then describe a general method to transform a non-Markovian sequential decision problem into a supervised learning problem using a K-best paths search algorithm.  We consider an application in financial portfolio management where we train a learning algorithm to directly optimize a Sharpe Ratio (or other risk-averse non-additive) utility function.  We illustrate the approach by demonstrating extensive experimental results using a neural network architecture specialized for portfolio management and compare against well-known alternatives.  Finally, we introduce a functional representation of time series which allows forecasts to be performed over an unspecified horizon with progressively-revealed information sets.  By virtue of using Gaussian processes, a complete covariance matrix between forecasts at several time-steps is available.  This information is put to use in an application to actively trade price spreads between commodity futures contracts.  The approach delivers impressive out-of-sample risk-adjusted returns after transaction costs on a portfolio of 30 spreads.

1522	Les dynamiques de la résistance écologique : le cas d’une compagnie minière canadienne dans la vallée de Siria au Honduras	This research deals with a phenomenon growing in interest in Latin American studies: natural resources exploitation from foreign companies and the growth of local resistance movements against the implementation of these companies. Going away from the general emphasis put on the birth of these movements, transformations due to the impact of time are instead measured and analyzed. The specific case of Goldcorp Inc. a Canadian mining company exploiting gold in the Siria Valley, Honduras, illustrates perfectly many tactics used by a rural population in an extensive battle and who wishes to resist to a multinational company that have more social, economic and politic power. Therefore, the resistance movement’s dynamics illustrate the changes in its primary form after the arrival of new local and international actors. Identities, build with the beginning of the mining exploitation, are also in play within the groups that are clashing in the region. Moreover, the study of a movement close to the end of its life demonstrate the need to redefine the notion of resistance in order to move away from the purely active form of it and include as well the discursive and moral aspects in its definition.

1523	Pour une Église-communauté-de-paix dans un contexte multiethnique conflictuel : le cas du Cameroun	The religious and political effervescence in Cameroon is progressively causing the ethnic fragmentation of the Christian people of Cameroon. In the face of political manipulation, the other name for ethnic injustice, the majority of Cameroonians, and Christians in particular, now react by tribalism, the other name for resignation, or better yet, for social fraying. Cameroonians give the impression they have lost the spirit of resistance/dissidence that made their freedom, better yet, their independence possible. How can one ignore that to become accustomed to the drama of ethnic drifting by settling, for reasons of survival, into the most abject fragmentation, is to opt for the voluntary enslavement of a people that inexorably leads to collective genocide? Our research puts forward the hypothesis that ethnic conflicts have penetrated the sphere of Christianity and are now a part of the dysfunctions of the Church in Cameroon. These internal dysfunctions hinder the credibility of the Church. There is a link between the shortcomings observed in the Church and those in Cameroonian society. Furthermore, the relationship of convergence between ethnic rivalries and religion provoke an unavoidable theological questioning: how are the different ethnic groups that make up most African countries to be lead to a harmonious living together inspired by the way of life and the way of functioning of the Christian Churches, in Cameroon to be specific. Must one be limited to adopting a new image of the church, for example the Church- family-of- God, or must one take the bull by the horns and educate the peoples of Africa in regards to living a culture of peace? The approach of this thesis is inspired by the method adopted by practical theology, in other words praxeology3, in relation to contextual theology4, in regards to the relationship with the human and social sciences’ methods of analysis, and in regards to its creative prophetic dimension. It is constructed around four axes: observation (social mediation), 3 Cf. G. ROUTHIER et VIAU (dir.), Précis de théologie pratique, Montréal/Bruxelles, Novalis/Lumen Vitae, 2004, 819p. 4 C. BOFF, Théorie et pratique. La méthode des théologies de la libération, Paris, Cerf, 1900, 400p. iv interpretation (hermeneutic mediation), pastoral intervention (practical mediation) and prospective. The thesis is composed of four parts. The first part (chapters 1, 2, and 3), dedicated to observation, seeks to encompass the issue of multiethnic cohabitation thus enabling a better perception of the manifestation of the phenomenon of tribalism in the Church (the Churches) and in Cameroonian society. It shows that dramatic situations of misfortune, poverty, famine, conflicts and wars are caused in part by excessive tribalism. The second part (chapters 4 and 5) deals with comprehension of the meaning. It analyses and tests the comprehension of the phenomenon of tribalism and ethnic conflict in Cameroonian society and its Churches. What is thus successively examined are the principal manifestations of tribalism, the strategy employed during the era of colonialism in order to transform the social structure in Cameroon (divide to reign more easily), and subsequently kept up by politicians as political ideology since independence. We have come to realize that this ideology has lead to a profound structural breakdown of Cameroonian society that extends to the Church (the Churches). The third part (chapters 6 and 7) is dedicated to the ecclesial practise of dialogue for peace within the African ethnic diversity. We illustrate how ethnic solidarities purified by the fire of the Gospel can have an influence on Christian practise. We then seek to demonstrate that a well articulated ethnic dialogue is the way to reconciliation. The fourth part (chapter 8) is an effort to move from utopia put unto practise to a practise in a utopian form the fertile pastoral dialogue within the ethnic and religious diversity shall bring forth the transformation of the local Church in its interaction with the different ethnic groups of Cameroon and Africa.

1524	Les déterminants de l’acceptation d’une affectation à l’international	This study’s main focus is the reasons that are involved in the acceptance of an international assignment. While the number of multinational corporations is increasing, so is the pressure to attract and select candidates that will accept an international assignment. Based on a sample of employees working in engineering and construction, our study had two main goals. First, we sought to identify which are the key individual, organisational and assignment variables in the decision to accept or refuse an international assignment. The second goal was to verify the relative importance of those key variables in the acceptation of an international assignment. Our analyses revealed that two individual variables and seven organisational variables have a significant and positive influence in the acceptance of an international assignment.

1525	L’égalité souveraine : entre fiction et outil juridiques	The idea of sovereign equality emerged along with the multilateral international system. Although sovereign equality is explicitly entrenched in the United Nations Charter, a definition remains lacking. This study proposes a three dimensional definition of sovereign equality: formal equality, legislative equality and existential equality.  Following an in-depth examination of its three dimensions, a strong conception of sovereign equality cannot be sustained because of legalised hegemony, bifurcation of the international legal order, unequal representation within multilateral institutions and anti-pluralism. Hence, the study of each dimension of sovereign equality shows that sovereign equality is a mere legal fiction. It can hardly be justified in light of the reality of international society. Nevertheless, the principle is still relevant for the purpose of restraining the prerogatives of the Great Powers and remains an ideal to achieve.	fragmentation , Colonialism , Fragmentation , Inequality , International law , Legalised hegemony , Pluralism , Sovereign equality , Sovereignty , Voluntarism	en	3487.0
1526	Dynamique de l'aveu et de la dénonciation dans les récits du sida d'Hervé Guibert	                                    The impact of Aids on the intellectual community anticipates an important change in contemporary literature’s aesthetics. Testimony of the writer’s experience, in an epoch of collective disarray and social repression towards homosexuals, strived to create a new context for self-confession by prospecting the personal subject into public sphere. This mode of self-exposure was already manifest in feminine texts from the 70’s, but it underwent an important transformation in the 80’s and 90’s. In the age of Aids, it is the masculine subject that, by means of the body, unveils itself in narratives about the disease. Discourses about personal intimacy attempted to bring social and literary spaces closer by elaborating forms of heterogeneous ethics and aesthetics.                                    The closing period of Guibert’s work, which focuses on illness is anchored in the social context of the Aids epidemic. Consequently, the three texts, À l’ami qui ne m’a pas sauvé la vie (1990), Le protocole compassionnel (1991) and Cytomégalovirus (1992) constitute the central subject of my reflection, along with the personal diary that Guibert kept from his teenage years until his death, Le mausolée des amants (2001). To a certain extent, this journal bears witness to the encroaching disease, which evolved between the years 1987 and 1991, the period during which the writer felt a growing vulnerability regarding his health.  This study will focus on Guibert’s thinking about confession and denunciation. It will be a matter of reflecting on the strategies and functions of literature bearing intensity to the subjective experience of Aids. Moreover, the quest for achieving intensity by self-confession which concerns telling the story of illness, sexuality and death, seeks to go beyond an apocalyptic dimension by inscribing the work in a social and ethical context. In this way, self-exposure holds forth the collective aspect by confronting society and community.

1527	D’une Semaison à l’autre : contribution à une lecture des carnets de Philippe Jaccottet	This M.A. thesis concerns the notebooks of the poet Philippe Jaccottet ; it attempts to find the main lines of a practice of writing which evolves as time goes by and to determine the status of the notebooks with regard to the rest of the work.  The first four chapters of this thesis establish the characteristics of the writing of notebooks, by studying closely texts as well as their evolution over the years, and by comparing these texts with the works published at the same time.  We notice that as time advances, the works tend to look like the texts found in notebooks.  The last two chapters interpret, more globally, the work that we see in notebooks.  Not only the notebooks are the most suited to lead a reflection on the poetry, they also insure cohesion and validity to the work.

1528	Le sensemaking collectif dans une équipe virtuelle	Virtual teams have been subject of much attention in the last two decades. Organizations have included them as regular units to adjust with globalization of markets. They are increasingly more common in schools as well. Universities developed virtual learning environments to cope with the market and prepare their students to be competitive. Those environments were also made popular because of the trends instigated by the constructivist approach to learning and educational methods. Researchers have been studying virtual teams most generally with teleological and utilitarian goals giving teachers’ and mangers’ point of view of the phenomenon. In addition, the will to draw general laws of virtual teams lead up researchers to sacrifice a part of its complexity. Our study aims to observe how students made sense of their collaboration experience in a virtual team. We adopt an interpretive perspective with a narrative approach that allows us to access the richness of the phenomenon while studying the sensemaking process. Our research questions are: how do students make sense of the collaboration? And how does individual sensemaking plays a role in constructing collective sensemaking? Our findings show that the sensegiving process is crucial for virtual teams to create collective sensemaking.

The author presents three generations of work which approach the question of the consistency between attitude and behavior from different perspectives: those which conclude with a very weak relation, those which conclude with a moderated relation, those which highlight conditions necessary to the predictivity of the attitudes.	attitude , prédiction , relation , attitude , behavior , prediction , act , relation	en	3417.0
1531	Aide au développement et santé comme droit humain	As health is more and more recognized as a « human right », we can wonder if this tendency leads to an important increase in foreign aid for health. We try to show that aid has been considered for a few years as a big stake for international security. This approach focused on security issues is a very narrow use of the concept of global public goods. As a consequence, infectious disease is the priority of health assistance and other sub-sectors generally considered pro-poor are loosing chare in health funding.

1532	Travail des enfants, enfants des rues et approche par les capabilités : Liens méthodologiques et implications pour les politiques	The debate on child labour has taken a fullness these last twenty years. Policies are actually largely based on the promotion of education. Meanwhile, the debate has not taken into account the very question of street children. Integrating this category of children set new issues. Particularly, education must be non violent and spaces of work must be openned for street children.

1533	Substance P, récepteurs NK1 et neurones à sérotonine : relations anatomiques et fonctionnelles dans le noyau raphe dorsalis	We have studied in detail the relationships between substance P (SP) and serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) neurotransmission systems in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) of rodents, in order to further our understanding of their interaction during mood regulation.  The DRN receives a SP innervation arising from the habenula and, in human, it is known that blockade of the neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1r) of SP by antagonists may have antidepressant effects. In rodents, treatment with NK1r antagonists is known to increase the firing of DRN 5-HT neurons and to induce a desensitization of their 5-HT1A autoreceptors, suggesting local interactions between the SP and 5-HT systems. In a first step, we were able to demonstrate by means of light, confocal, and electron microscopic immunocytochemistry, including double immunolabelings of NK1r and of the biosynthetic enzyme of 5-HT, tryptophane hydroxylase, the presence of NK1r in a subpopulation of 5-HT neurons in the caudal DRN of rat and mouse. After the dual immunolabelings for electron microscopy, we also found that NK1r was mostly cytoplasmic in 5-HT neurons while predominating on the plasma membrane of TPH negative (non 5-HT) neurons. Subsequently, in additionnal double labeling experiments, we were able to identify most if not all non 5-HT dendrites bearing membranous NK1r as GABAergic.  In a second step, we combined the immunolabeling of SP with that of NK1r, in order to examine the relationships between SP axon terminals (varicosities *) and the two categories of DRN neurons (5-HT: cytoplasmic NK1r; non 5-HT: membranous NK1r). After single SP labeling, we could estimate the frequency with which SP terminals made synapse at 41%, at least. In the material doubly labeled for SP and NK1r, the SP terminals were often found in close contact or in the immediate proximity of dendrites endowed with cytoplasmic receptor, but never near non 5-HT dendrites bearing membrane bound receptors. To test the hypothesis of a sustained internalization of NK1r in 5-HT neurons, we then tested the effects of RP67580, a selective NK1r antagonist, on the subcellular localization of the receptor. One hour after administration of a single dose, the NK1r distribution was unchanged in both types of dendrites (5-HT and non 5-HT). However, after administration for 7 (subchronic) or 21 (chronic) days, the cytoplasmic and the membrane densities of NK1r were significantly increased in 5-HT dendrites, without any change in non 5-HT dendrites. These treatments also increased NK1r gene expression in the caudal DRN. Lastly, a significant increase in the membrane density of NK1r was measured in the 5-HT neurons, without any increase of the cytoplamic density, following bilateral electrolytic lesioning of the habenula. These results strenghtened the hypothesis of a sustained activation and internalization of NK1r by SP in 5-HT neurons of the caudal DRN. They also suggested that trafficking of NK1r in these cells might represent a cellular mechanism in control of the activation of the 5-HT system by SP afferents from the habebula.	substance P , NK1 receptor , serotonin , functional neuroanatomy , immunocytochimie , immunocytochemistry , hybridation in situ , in situ hybridization , habenula , mood	en	3354.0
1534	Expression des SOCS-1 et SOCS-3 par les lymphocytes T humains en réponse à des cytokines immuno-modulatrices	Cytokines regulate fundamental biological processes via the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Suppressors of Cytokine Signaling proteins (SOCS), intracellular proteins, inhibit the JAK-STAT pathway. Emerging evidence supports the involvement of SOCS in diseases of the immune system but no data is available regarding their expression in human T cells. We postulate that the cytokines Interferon-β (IFN-β) and Interleukin-27 (IL-27), both potential immuno-regulators, have beneficial roles through the induction of SOCS proteins. The impact of IFN-β and IL-27 on the SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 expression by human CD4 and CD8 T cells was assessed using peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors. We evaluated the expression of SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 at the mRNA level by qRTPCR and at the protein level by immunocytochemistry. A rapid increase of SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 mRNA levels was observed upon cytokine addition, and such upregulation was confirmed at the protein level. To mimic patients under IFN-β treatment, both T cell subsets were chronically exposed to IFN-β. We observed an increase of SOCS-1 after each stimulation but not for SOCS-3. IL-27 stimulation increased SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 mRNA levels in CD8 T cells but only slightly in CD4 T cells; these observations correlate with previous observations in our laboratory showing less IL-27 receptors on CD4 T cells than CD8 counterparts. Our project determined the distinct expression of SOCS proteins in different human T cells subsets. This study could highlight the mechanism of action of cytokines such as IFN-β and IL-27.

1535	Effet de chaperones pharmacologiques sur les formes mutantes du récepteur mélanocortine de type 4 responsables de l'obésité morbide précoce	The MC4R is a G-protein coupled receptor involved in the central regulation of food intake and energy homeostasis. Eighty percent of childhood obesity-related MC4R mutants are retained intracellularly, probably via the quality control system acting on misfolded receptors. Thus, rescuing cell surface targeting and functionality of these mutant receptors could be of therapeutic value. Cell permeable MC4R selective ligands have been tested and were able to restore cell surface expression and signalling activity of S58C and R165W MC4R mutants. Those compounds, according to their mode of action, are described as pharmacological chaperones (PC). The MC4R-PCs also helps to rescue the glycosylation pattern (maturation) of the MC4R mutants. The site of action of MC4R-PCs of the MC4R mutants monitored by BRET suggests an action downstream of the calnexin-MC4R interaction, most likely at the level of the Golgi apparatus. Generally, a CP can have different effects according to the mutant by stabilizing distinct conformations of the receptor that are more or less able to exit the quality control system and to activate the signaling pathway, and a mutant can respond differently according to the CP used by its distinct affinity to the ligand, the CP itself and the effectors. A better understanding of PCs’ mode of action could help in the design of novel therapeutic approaches not only for early-onset morbid obesity (EOMO) but also for other conformational diseases resulting from protein misfolding.

An Egalitarian Case for (Truly) Universal Public Services"	Some egalitarians argue against public services that are free for all, on the grounds that free access appears to primarily benefit the middle classes. I advocate, instead, the inclusion of the middle classes in public services, arguing that only truly universal intake of public services prevents the inegalitarian effects of economic segregation. Such universal participation in public services is achieved, partly, through subsidies for, and regulation of, privately produced services.	Philosophy , Ethics , Economics	en	3302.0
1537	Le pouvoir communal et l'émancipation urbaine au XVe siècle : le cas de la ville de Liège (1400-1455)	The city of Liege, in the late Middle Ages, witnessed the assertions of its bourgeois through their guilds and municipal institutions. The fourteenth century was indeed marked by significant gains for the municipal power at the expense of the urban patriciate on one hand and of the prince-bishop of Liege on the other hand. From 1384, the Council of Liege, entirely in the hands of the craftsmen, possessed extensive powers in the administration and management of the city. However, the growth of the power of these bourgeois was suddenly stopped for a decade after their defeat in Othee in 1408. This thesis discusses the evolution of communal power in Liege during the first half of the fifteenth century, less well known by historians. The study of the chronicle of Jean de Stavelot can highlight this troubled period. The defeat of Othee, as well as reforms imposed by prince-bishops, caused notably dramatic changes. Political parties also entered the scene and the neighboring presence of the powerful Duke of Burgundy influenced the lives of the bourgeois of Liege. These features of the political and social context are factors which influenced the willingness of the bourgeois’ assertion and the exercise of communal power in Liege.

1538	Modes de représentation pour l'éclairage en synthèse d'images	In image synthesis, the main computation involved to generate an image is characterized by an equation named rendering equation [Kajiya1986]. This equation represents the law of energy conservation. It stipulates that the light emanating from the scene objects is the sum of the emitted energy and the reflected energy. Moreover, the reflected energy at a surface point is defined as the convolution of the incoming lighting with a reflectance function. The reflectance function models the object material and represents, in the rendering equation, a directional and energetic filter that describes the surface behavior regarding the reflection. In this thesis, we introduce new representations for the reflectance function and the incoming lighting.   In the first part of this thesis, we propose two new models for the reflectance function. The first model is targeted for artists   to help them create and edit highlights. Our main idea is to let the user paint and sketch highlight characteristics (shape, color, gradient and texture) in a plane parametrized by the incident lighting direction.  The second model is designed to represent efficiently isotropic material data. To achieve this result, we introduce a new representation of the reflectance function that uses rational polynomials. Their coefficients are computed using a fitting process that guarantees an optimal solution regarding convergence.   In the second part of this thesis, we introduce a new volumetric structure for indirect illumination that is  directionally represented with irradiance vector. We show that our representation is compact and robust to geometric variations, that it can be used as caching system for interactive and offline rendering and that it can also be transmitted with streaming techniques. Finally, we introduce two modifications of the incoming lighting to improve the shape depiction of a surface. The first modification consists in warping the incoming light directions whereas the second one consists in scaling the intensity of each light source.

1539	La IIIe République et Bismarck : le rôle des opportunistes dans le compromis franco-allemand	The European concert is often perceived, at least from the 1871s to 1890, as the unmistakable work of the German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck and the major politicians of his time. The said Bismarckian policy  effectively influenced most of the interactions between opposing parties, particularly between France and Germany. Its bearing on the French policy  is such that it affects home and foreign policies. The opportunist republicans will personify this ambiguous reaction to new German giant. A pragmatic attitude allows them, between 1878 and 1885, to recover their former role as well as to guide a strong nationalist feeling. If the opportunists are often blamed for having preferred the short term, the governments of Ferry, Gambetta, Waddington and Freycinet governments managed to handle Bismarckian policy skilfully. Familiar with its ephemeral character, opportunist governments knew how to find advantages, insure that France recover its diplomatic position and acquire new colonial territories while protecting a certain independence vis-à-vis the Iron Chancellor.

1540	Étude des interactions entre Haemophilus parasuis et des cellules endothéliales et épithéliales porcines: implications d’une composante bactérienne, le lipooligosaccharide (LOS)	Haemophilus parasuis is a swine pathogen that causes Glässer’s disease characterized by fibrinous polyserositis, polyarthritis, meningitis and septicemia. The pathogenesis of the infection and virulence factors are not well known. Whether the upper respiratory tract is the site of colonization of H. parasuis is still a controversial issue. H. parasuis must invade the mucosa to gain access to the bloodstream. H. parasuis is able to adhere to newborn pig trachea cells (NPTr). H. parasuis must then cross the blood-brain barrier to gain access to the central nervous system in cases of meningitis. H. parasuis is able to adhere to and invade porcine brain microvascular endothelial cells (PBMEC). The aim of this work was to study the interactions between H. parasuis, its lipooligosccharide (LOS), and porcine endothelial and epithelial cells. Results showed that adhesion of H. parasuis Nagasaki to NPTr and PBMEC was partially mediated by its LOS. H. parasuis induced NPTr and PBMEC apoptosis, although purified LOS does not seem to be involved. H. parasuis, and to a lesser extent its LOS, stimulated the release of interleukin- (IL) 6 and IL-8. Field strains of H. parasuis serotypes 4 and 5 (the most prevalent serotypes in North America) also induced the production of IL-6 and IL-8. Results suggest that H. parasuis LOS plays a role in the pathogenesis of the infection, but other bacterial components are also involved.

1541	Le Régime Juridique de la mer Caspienne	From the creation of the Soviet Union to its dissolution, the Caspian Sea belonged to Iran and the USSR, which were its only two littoral States. The Caspian was, during this period, governed by two bilateral agreements signed in 1921 and 1940, in which the two States had agreed to “jointly” manage the Sea. However, after the dissolution of the USSR in 1991 gave birth to three newly independent States (Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan) with coast lines along the Caspian Sea, these three new actors demanded with insistence that the existing treaty-based regime be revised. During the course of the ensuing negotiations, several legal questions have been raised: Is the treaty-based legal regime established by the 1921 and 1940 treaties still valid in the new regional configuration? Are the newly independent States, successors to the USSR, obliged to respect the former Union's legal obligations towards Iran? If not, what is the appropriate legal regime applicable to the Caspian? Is it the law of the Sea (as defined mostly in the UNCLOS) or the law of treaties? Considering the new regional configuration, does the concept of rebus sic stantibus - or the fundamental change of circumstances - invalidate the 1921 and 1940 treaties? Will the internal administrative divisions established in 1970 by the former Soviet Union with regards to the Caspian become - de jure - the new international maritime frontiers? In this thesis, we argue in favour of the validity of the legal regime established by the 1921 and 1940 treaties and we support the position of those States which assert the transmissibility of the obligations of the former Union to the newly independent littoral States. In doing so, we will provide a complete analysis of the legal dilemma at hand and suggest appropriate analytical answers to the aforementioned questions. The law of treaties, the law of the succession of States, the 1982 United Nations' Convention of the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), doctrinal commentaries, case law of the I.C.J, and official U.N documents revealing the positions of each littoral States will be thoroughly conversed in this regard.

1542	Les facteurs à homéodomaine Pitx et Irx au cours du développement des membres postérieurs	The Pitx transcription factors have been implicated in growth and specification of hindlimb identity. First, Pitx1 gene inactivation in mice results in partial transformation of hindlimbs into forelimbs. Further, Pitx1 and Pitx2 have redundant activity for hindlimb growth as demonstrated in double mutant mice for Pitx1 and Pitx2. Indeed, Pitx1-/-;Pitx2neo/neo mice show loss of proximal (femur) and anterior (ilium, tibia and first digit) skeletal structures. A collaborator, Dr C. C. Hui of Toronto University, has demonstrated the importance of the Iroquois (Irx) family transcription factors in hindlimb development. Irx3-/-;Irx5-/- mice show loss of proximal and anterior skeletal structures, exclusively in hindlimbs, even if Irx are expressed in the two limb pairs. This phenocopy between Pitx and Irx mutants led us to investigate the interaction between these transcription factors with three hypotheses : (1) Pitx control Irx expression in hindlimb buds ; (2) the Irx direct Pitx gene expression in hindlimb bud ; (3) Pitx and Irx participate together in a growth regulation cascade in hindlimb buds. Our analyses led us to conclude that Pitx and Irx are in independant genetic cascade in hindlimb buds. However, we observed that Pitx and Irx transcription factors are capable of transcriptionnal interactions assessed using either a generic promoter or conserved regions of the Tbx4 locus. Finally, inactivation of either Pitx or Irx led to a delay of Pax9 expression exclusively in hindlimb buds. In sum, Pitx and Irx gene appear to act on parallel genetic programs involved in control of hindlimbs growth and patterning.

1543	Les productions palatiales dans les sociétés complexes: le cas de la céramique bleue amarnienne	The present work consists in a study of the ceramic typical of the city of Amarna (Akhet-Aten) viewed in relation to palatial productions in complex societies. In the first part of the work, we put this blue-painted pottery style in context and present the geographic, historical and religious situation of the city. We then consider the usual themes relating to the study of a ceramic: workshops, materials, transformation, firing, forms and motifs. Since the function of these vases remains an open question, we analyse various theories on the subject. We raise the question whether a link between these vases and the religious ideology introduced by pharaoh Akhenaten might exist; comparison of the motifs with the iconography of the city's palaces allows us to confirm this hypothesis. These last two points bring out the importance of this pottery in the Amarnian framework. The second part of this work pertains to the concept of palatial objects. This type of production is defined and various criteria are presented. We then apply these criteria to palatial objects from complex societies, in hope of confirming their adequacy. Having verified these characteristics, we apply them to blue-painted pottery in order to determine whether this latter corresponds to a palatial industry. Since this pottery style satisfies all these criteria, it is possible to assert that it is a palatial object. It is even possible to affirm that it consists in a prestige object, consummed by an elite and whose purpose is to further the established ideology.

1544	Development of a Chinese version WHO Self-Assessment Tool for Evaluating Health Promotion in Hospital	The first purpose of this research is to develop a Chinese version (WHO self-assessment tool for Health Promotion in Hospital(WHOSATHPH), and test its reliability and validity through a pilot test in Canada (Montréal) and spot field investigation in China, this research was the first time to adopt completely cross-culture approach which includes:translated the source English edition tool into Chinese, then back translated it into English. 8 Chinese health professionals who have worked both in China and Montreal were investigated to complete the pilot test. Then 3 health professionals whose work language is English (1 Native American, 1 evaluation professor, the author of WHOSATHPH) commented the back-translation quality. The spot field investigation was performed in three Chinese capital cities, Shanghai, Hefei and Kunming from 5 June to 30 August 2008. Non-probability sample was used to survey 40 hospital leaders who are from 22 China hospitals, and 3 health management researchers (include 1 government officer). The second purpose of this research is to provide a primary description of China current HPH development by using this Chinese version WHOSATHPH, and to discuss China current hospital service evaluating principle and management model, and analysis the value and culture of TCM and its role and influence to China HPH development. Three capital cities(Shanghai, Kunming, and Hefei) which stand for different economic development level and different culture context feature but all deep influenced by TCM were investigated. 22 hospitals and 35 hospital leaders were given interview while they answered the questionnaire. All the respondents were vonluntary to take part in the first survey and the repeat survey after 3-7 days if they would like to. Reliability analysis include internal consistency(Cronbach Alpha),inter-rater relibility(Correlation analysis),Test-retest reliability( Paire-Sample T-test), Validity Test through factor analysis and Pearson Bivariate Correlations analysis. NPAR test was used to analyize the different cities and different grade hospitals comparison. Result: Only 1 word <satisfy>) was marked different meaning comparing with the back translation English version with original version by all of them. Reliability measures utilized Cronbach's Alpha, the general coefficient of the Chinese version WHOSATHPH was 0.938, Cronbach's alpha for the domains was 0.896. The Cronbach`s alpha for v five standards from one to five were: 0.793, 0.819, 0.807, 0.785, 0.755. 8 groups data were used for Inner-raters analysis, result shows that Shanghai respondents had comment consistency but Hefei and Kunming respondents didn't show inner raters assessed consistency. Pair T-Test for 40 items between pre and post test, the signification p was from 0.1-1 which indicates not statistic significant difference. Factor analysis shows this tool has the general theory construct validity, but the domain construct validity has not show the contruct validity. The results showed that Chinese version WHOSATHPH has high internal consistency but the high Cronbach`s Alpha might concern to the number of items. All the respondents thought WHOSATHPH was valuable in theory research, 15 respondents refused to use this instrument in their work, only 17 respondents accepted it, 3 respondents were not sure to use. The rejective reasons were: no government finance budget support, no demand from the government, difficult to follow. The acceptive reasons were: help to improve the work quality, help to guide HPH development. This research result shows that the Chinese version has reliability and general construct validity, but its validity needs the further conceptual and empirical research to prove. ① For five standards from the highest to lowest: standard5 (continuity and cooperation) 28.95(72.4% of full score), standard4 (healthy workplace) 35.71(71.4%), standard3 (patient information and prevention) 21.34 (71.1%), standard2 (patients assessment) 23.85 (68.1%), standard1 (management and policy) 28.17(only 62.6% of full score). These results show China hospitals has better HPH development level, their means are all over 60% of full score,②The mean of the total score for different grade hospital were: Grade III (n=21)154.19 + 7.34, Grade II(n=9) 158.67 + 10.7, Grade I (n=11) 144.82 + 14.54. Variance analysis result shows that there was no statistic significant difference between different grade hospitals. However, the last conclusion need further research with large ramdom sample size investigation. This thesis discussed the quality and weakness of China health care system and its successive strategies to develop HPH in very poor finance support, huge population, and difficult social condition and polluted environment. Disease prevention first, patient-center, combined the TCM with west medicine are regarded as the successive strategies for China HPH development. This research created a foundation for future HPH research.

1546	Expérience sonore des usagers dans l'espace public urbain: l'exemple du boulevard Saint-Laurent à Montréal	"Since Pierre Schaeffer has first explored the concept of ""sound object,"" research on the sound phenomenon has considerably evolved, allowing us to grasp all of its complexity. This research further explores the world of sound by examining the everyday experience of the city main commercial streets using as fieldwork, Saint-Laurent Street in Montreal. Through a comprehensive approach, we examine people’s own interpretation of their sound experience of this historical commercial street. Every day, citizens wander and make their way in public spaces by apprehending their environment through their senses. Besides the visual aspect, senses are quite often ignored by designers of urban space. This often results in a relatively poor urban design in terms of sensorial experience. The theories and methods resulting from the environmental sounds field see the scope of their investigation expanded by anthropology of the senses. The richness of this approach allows us to better understand the multiple dimensions that shape the sound. The field of references privileged here also draws on artistic practices. Those offer us a form of field of experimentation that abounds with qualitative material. The analysis of these last ones brings to the foreground dimensions useful for the understanding of the sonic experience. This experiment was conducted using various methods to collect a maximum of qualitative material. Then, observation, qualified listening walks and commented walks1, in-depth interviews were led. This research allowed to a better understanding of the existing dialogue between the sound, the space and the user disclosing the various dimensions of the sonic experience of the commercial main street and in particular those was surrounding the culture of the senses."	design urbain , son , perception , culture , urban design , experience , sound , perception , public space , culture , polysensorialiy , memory	en	3156.0
1547	Prediction of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy by combined uterine artery Doppler, serum biomarkers and maternal characteristics	Objective: To evaluate the screening efficacy of maternal demographic characteristics, serum biomarkers and uterine artery Doppler (uaD) during the first and the second trimester for the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. To elaborate prediction models of these diseases based on the combination of selected maternal demographic characteristics, maternal serum biomarkers and uaD indexes.  Methods: This is a prospective pregnant cohort study of 598 singleton nulliparous consecutive women. UaD investigation was performed by transabdominal sonography between 11+0 and 13+6 weeks, and between 17+0 and 21+6 weeks. All the serum samples for measurement of several placental biomarkers were collected at the first trimester. Maternal demographic characteristics were recorded at the same time. Receiver operating characteristic curves and predictive values were used to analyze the predictive powers of the above parameters. Different combinations and their logistic regression predictive models were analyzed.  Results: Among 598 women, 20 developed preeclampsia (3.3%), 7 developed early-onset preeclampsia (1.2%), 52 developed gestational hypertension (8.7%), 10 developed gestational hypertension with delivery before 37 weeks (1.7%). Second trimester uterine artery pulsatility index was the best predictor with statistical significance for all the outcomes. In the multivariable logistic regression analysis, the best predictive value in the first and second trimester was obtained for the prediction of early onset preeclampsia. The combined screening showed significantly better results compared to either maternal parameters or Doppler alone. Conclusion: As a single marker, second trimester Doppler has the highest predictive value for hypertensive disorders, preterm birth and SGA. Combination of the maternal demographic characteristics, maternal serum biomarker and uaD improves the screening efficacy, especially when this necessitates early delivery.

1548	L’universalité des normes éthiques en recherche biomédicale sur sujets humains et leur application aux pays en développement	With a growing number of new human diseases being discovered, along with existing or novel treatments being explored for their cure, researchers are more than ever seeking to extend their biomedical trials on human subjects.  Research with human models is a crucial step for the proper understanding of diseases and therefore advancing the science and technology required to eventually eradicate global diseases such as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) causing acquired immune deficient syndrome (AIDS).  At present, these important studies are conducted across the world, but more specifically, in developing countries with more vulnerable populations.  This very practice has caused many stakeholders to reconsider certain ethical aspects of human studies. In this thesis, an examination of the various ethical norms for tests on human subjects will be presented in order to understand how they account for the characteristics of populations in developing countries.  This will provide the framework for a case study analyzing three philosophical approaches to biomedical research on human subjects.  Finally, a critical review of the field’s literature leads to the imperative conclusion of strengthening universal norms surrounding ethical biomedical research involving humans, specifically as vulnerable populations in developing countries are becoming more frequenctly the subjects.

1549	MODELING HETEROTACHY IN PHYLOGENETICS	Heterotachy, substitution rate variation across sites and time, has shown to be a frequent phenomenon in the real data. Failure to model heterotachy could potentially cause phylogenetic artefacts. Currently, there are several models to handle heterotachy, the mixture branch length model (MBL) and several variant forms of the covarion model. In this project, our objective is to find a model that efficiently handles heterotachous signals in the data, and thereby improves phylogenetic inference.    In order to achieve our goal, two individual studies were conducted. In the first study, we make comparisons among the MBL, covarion and homotachous models using AIC, BIC and cross validation. Based on our results, we conclude that the MBL model, in which sites have different branch lengths along the entire tree, is an over-parameterized model. Real data indicate that the heterotachous signals which interfere with phylogenetic inference are generally limited to a small area of the tree. In the second study, we relax the assumption of the homogeneity of the covarion parameters over sites, and develop a mixture covarion model using a Dirichlet process. In order to evaluate different heterogeneous models, we design several posterior predictive discrepancy tests to study different aspects of molecular evolution using stochastic mappings. The posterior predictive discrepancy tests demonstrate that the covarion mixture +Γ model is able to adequately model the substitution variation within and among sites.   Our research permits a detailed view of heterotachy in real datasets and gives directions for future heterotachous models. The posterior predictive discrepancy tests provide diagnostic tools to assess models in detail. Furthermore, both of our studies reveal the non-specificity of heterogeneous models. Our studies strongly suggest that different heterogeneous features in the data should be handled simultaneously.

1552	"Le care entre dépendance et domination: l'intérêt de la théorie néorépublicaine pour penser une ""caring society"""	The ethics of care is facing a paradox: although politicization seems necessary, the ethics of care does not seem able to find in itself sufficient resources to formulate a comprehensive political theory. There is no political theory of care per se. This article examines the possible and fruitful rapprochement of ethics of care with neorepublican theories of non-domination. The important result would be to guarantee the protection of important forms of care activities, but this would not necessarily block negative portrayals of these activities, which can be assumed of having provoked, at least partly, the marginalization and the uneven distribution that affects these activities. In order to stop these degrading representations, care must be discussed and defined in the public space not only as a possible locus of domination, but as a fundamental and positive aspect of individual and collective lives.	care	en	3103.0
1556	L’acceptation des rôles de l’infirmière praticienne en première ligne selon les caractéristiques socio-démographiques des usagers de CLSC	The purpose of this study was to measure the level of acceptance of the Primary Care Nurse Practitioner (PCNP) roles, by CLSC users, according to their socio-demographic characteristics. The data acquisition for this comparative synthetic research was carried out in five CLSCs in the Montreal region through a self-administered questionnaire. The accidental sample consisted of 316 people, 18 years and older, presenting to the CLSC with a medical problem. The sample group was propositioned by posters or through the suggestions of the receptionist in the waiting room. The results reveal that nearly 40% of the sample accepts every role of the PCNP. A logistic regression analysis shows that those earning a higher annual income (greater than $40,000) are more likely to accept all PCNP roles. These results will make it possible for the decision makers to take the necessary actions to establish this new occupational class; it may also help PCNPs to create strategies for efficient promotion to the general public, in regards to their advanced practice role.

1557	The Economics Of Civil Law Contract And Of Good Faith	In his 1993 book on the Limits of Freedom of Contract, Michael Trebilcock acknowledged the difficulties of trying to set criteria for correcting informational asymmetries. Informational asymmetries are one opening for opportunism and it has been generally acknowledged that one of the fundamental objectives of legal systems is to curtail opportunism. A civil-code based legal system has the ambition of being closed, i.e. covering all difficulties in private relationships within its purview. To accomplish this, it has to rely on open-ended concepts that can be used in unforeseen circumstances; yet legal certainty requires that such concepts be used sparingly and that recurrent circumstances calling for their application be particularised into more specific concepts having their own more detailed legal regime. The paper seeks to make the case that good faith in civil law systems is the exact opposite of opportunism; that it is one of the residual open-ended concepts 'closing' the system; and that it is particularised in a number of civil code concepts. These developments allow us to illustrate the difficulties Michael foretold in his book.	economic analysis of law , civil law , Civil Code , contract , opportunism , good faith	en	3016.0
1558	Changements dans le circuit de la récompense suite à la bulbectomie olfactive : une nouvelle approche pour étudier des antidépresseurs	Depression is a chronic, recurrent and potentially deadly disorder that affects over 20 % of the population worldwide. The mechanisms underlying depression are still not understood and current pharmacotherapy, based largely on monoaminergic hypotheses, is plagued by suboptimal efficacy and delayed therapeutic latency.  This has lead to a search for novel pharmacological treatments. To achieve this, it is first necessary to develop adequate experimental tools.  With this in mind, we aimed to measure anhedonia, a cardinal symptom of depression, in laboratory rats.  We defined anhedonia as a reduction in reward, and measured it with the sucrose intake test and in the intracranial self-stimulation paradigm. In order to induce anhedonia, we surgically removed the olfactory bulbs, a procedure that results in a host of behavioral, cellular and biochemical changes that are qualitatively similar to those observed in clinical depression.  These changes are long-lasting and reversed by chronic antidepressant treatment, validating olfactory bulbectomy as an animal model of depression. Our results show that olfactory bulbectomy also produces anhedonia, reflected by a stable and long-lasting reduction in sucrose intake as well as a reduction in the rewarding effectiveness of amphetamine in the self-stimulation paradigm.  These effects were present even after three to four weeks post-surgery. Olfactory bulbectomy was also associated with increased striatal cAMP response element binding, a molecular index associated with depressive-like behaviour.  These findings suggest that anhedonia can be reliably produced and studied within the olfactory bulbectomy model and that reward circuitry may comprise a logical target for novel drugs to treat depression.	depression , anhedonia , olfactory bulbectomy , antidepressants , reward , animal model	en	2975.0
1559	Pour une allocation équitable des ressources en GMF	Objective: To evaluate the “burden” involved in the clinical management of people living with HIV/AIDS, in order to adjust the allocation of resources in terms of family medicine groups (FMG).  Methodology: A comparative analysis of FMG Clinique médicale l’Actuel, FMGs in Montréal and throughout Québec, identifying differences in care consumption profiles for the years 2006 to 2008 and the costs of use of services for 2005.  Results: In 2008, seventy eight percent (78%) of the clientele registered with the FMG at Clinique médicale l’Actuel was considered vulnerable, in comparison to twenty eight percent (28%) at other Montréal FMGs, a trend observed throughout Québec. The average number of visits per registered individuals was 7.57 at the Actuel FMG, while the average in Montréal was 3.37 and in Québec overall, 3.47. In 2005, the average cost of a visit at the Actuel FMG was $203.93 compared to costs that varied from $132.14 to $149.53 for comparative units.  Conclusion: The intensity of use of FMG resources at the Clinique médicale l’Actuel (number of vulnerable individuals, number of visits and costs) suggests that the clinical management of people living with HIV/AIDS is a much heavier burden than that of an average citizen, or even from the majority of other categories of vulnerability. In order to ensure that all FMGs are treated fairly and equitably, registration should be adjusted to take into account the “burden” of this clientele and to place more value on the case management of people with complex clinical presentations.

1560	Implications fonctionnelles du collicule inférieur chez l'humain	The role of the inferior colliculus in human auditory processing is still poorly understood. We report the results obtained from a 12-year-old boy who suffered a very circumscribed lesion at the level of the right inferior colliculus without additional neurological damage. The child underwent an extensive battery of psychophysical and electrophysiological tests. Results revealed that tonal detection thresholds, speech recognition in the absence of competing auditory input and performance on binaural interaction tasks were unimpaired. However, the pattern of results suggests that auditory functions such as the recognition of low-redundancy speech presented monaurally, frequency discrimination, the recognition of tone-duration patterns, binaural separation, binaural integration, sound-source localization in space as well as mutlisensory integration depend on the integrity of the bilateral auditory pathways at the level of the inferior colliculus.

In this presentation, the results of an exercise in which a score and a music sound recording have been catalogued according to AACR2 and RDA will be presented. For each resource, two MARC records have been prepared, one according to AACR2 and the other according to RDA. Comparing the two records will highlight some of the differences between the two cataloguing codes.	Partitions musicales , RDA , Resource Description and Access , Format MARC 21	en	2863.0
1562	La fibrose en deux parties : de la paillasse à la souris	Apoptosis of endothelial cells (EC) is an early event in various fibrotic diseases including chronic allograft vasculopathy and systemic sclerosis.  We showed previously that mediators released by apoptotic EC activate myofibroblast differentiation and resistance to apoptosis, two mechanisms pivotal to fibrogenesis.  PI3K (phospatidylinositol-3 kinase) activation was found to be central to these two mechanisms.  A C-terminal fragment of perlecan (LG3) produced by apoptotic EC was found to inhibit apoptosis of fibroblasts.  The aims of the present project were : 1. to define the receptors and pathways implicated in this anti-apoptotic response and 2. to characterize the fibrogenic mediators implicated in myofibroblast differentiation.    Concerning the anti-apoptotic response, the inhibition of 21 integrin activity in fibroblasts exposed to either medium conditioned by apoptotic EC (SSC) or LG3 prevented resistance to apoptosis and was associated with decreased levels of Akt phosphorylation.  Neutralizing Src family kinases (SFK) activity in fibroblasts produced the same effects.  These results suggest that LG3 produced by apoptotic EC initiate a state of resistance to apoptosis in fibroblasts via an α2β1integrin/SFK/PI3K dependent pathway.  LG3 did not induce myofibroblast differentiation. We went on to identify which mediators present in SSC are implicated in myofibroblast differentiation.   Media conditioned by apoptotic and non-apoptotic EC (respectively SSC and SSC-ZVAD) were analyzed comparatively by 2-dimension liquid chromatography, western blotting and mass spectrometry.  Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) was the only known fibrogenic factor increased in SSC.  Caspase-3 silencing of EC demonstrated that CTGF is released by apoptotic EC downstream of caspase-3 activation. In fibroblasts, blocking the activation of SFK or silencing the proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk2) blocked myofibroblast differentiation triggered by either SSC or recombinant CTGF in vitro.  Exposure to a pan-transforming growth factor (TGF-β) neutralizing antibody failed to attenuate myofibroblast differentiation in fibroblasts exposed to either SSC or CTGF.  Subcutaneous injection of mouse SSC to C3H mice daily for three weeks led to increased skin thickness, increased protein levels of αSMA, vimentin and collagen I. This fibrogenic response was blunted in mice injected with either SSC-ZVAD or SSC immunodepleted of CTGF.    These results bring new mechanistic insights into the fibrogenic pathways activated by EC death.  Caspase activation in apoptotic EC triggers the production of LG3 and CTGF which in turn activate SFK/PI3K dependant pathways in fibroblasts thus activating a TGF-β-independent fibrogenic response.

1563	The Origin and Stimuli Implicated in the Expression of Nestin(+) Cardiac Myocyte-like Cells in the Ischemic Heart	Studies from our lab demonstrated that scar formation and healing was associated with the appearance of nestin(+) cardiac myocyte-like cells predominantly at the peri-infarct region. The focus of the present study was to identify the underlying mechanism(s) (e.g. hypoxia, neurohormones) implicated in their recruitment and their cellular origin. The presence of these cells was detected as early as 1-week post-myocardial infarction (MI) and persisted 9 months after complete coronary artery ligation. Furthermore, nestin(+) cardiac myocyte-like cells were also detected in the infarcted human heart. Hypoxia represents a predominant stimulus following MI, however the exposure of normal rats to a hypoxic environment failed to promote the re-appearance of nestin(+) cardiac myocyte-like cells. By contrast, the infusion of the non-selective  -adrenergic agonist isoproterenol (ISO) in the normal adult Sprague-Dawley rat increased nestin expression in the left ventricle and was associated with the reappearance of nestin(+) cardiac myocyte-like cells. However, the reappearance of nestin(+) cardiac myocyte-like cells may not represent a direct effect but was apparently secondary to cardiac myocyte necrosis mediated by isoproterenol. Lastly, we identified a subpopulation of nestin-immunoreactive cells in the normal rat heart that coexpressed cardiac progenitor cell markers Nkx-2.5 and GATA-4. This subpopulation of nestin/Nkx-2.5/GATA-4 cells may represent the progenitor pool that differentiates to a nestin(+) cardiac myocyte-like cell following an ischemic insult.

1564	Mode de vie, habitudes alimentaires et cancer du sein: Étude cas-témoins chez les Canadiennes-françaises non porteuses de mutations des gènes BRCA	Breast cancer (BC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women in most industrialised countries. Individuals who have breast cancer may not inherit cancer-causing mutations from their parents. Instead, certain cells undergo mutations that lead to cancer. In the case of hereditary cancer, tumor cells usually contain mutations not found elsewhere in the body, but also harbor a critical mutation shared by all cells. Autosomal dominant alterations in 2 genes, ‘Breast cancer 1’ (BRCA1) and ‘Breast cancer 2’ (BRCA2), are likely to account for familial cases of early-onset BC. It is estimated that 5-10% of breast cancers are due to a genetic predisposition. Most of these cancers are linked to an abnormality in the gene BRCA1 or BRCA2. Several studies have been conducted in women with sporadic BC but few studies have focused on those who carry BRCA mutations. Our research was undertaken to test the hypothesis of an association between the BC, lifestyle and eating habits among French-Canadian women who were non carriers of 6 frequently-occurring BRCA mutations.  We conducted a case-control study in a French-Canadian population. Some 280 women with breast cancer and who were non-gene carriers of mutated BRCA gene were recruited as cases. Control subjects were women from families with breast cancer (n=265), except for 15 (5.4%) who came from the same families as cases. Participants of all ages were recruited from an on-going cohort studied by researchers at Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Montreal (CHUM) Hôtel-Dieu in Montreal. A validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire was administered by a nutritionist on telephone to ascertain dietary intake covering the period prior to 2 years before the initial diagnosis of BC among cases and the period prior to 2 years before the telephone interview for the controls. A core questionnaire was administered by the research team’s nurse to gather information on socio-demographic and lifestyle risk factors. BC risk was increased among subjects who reached their maximum body mass index (BMI) at an older age (more than 50 years) (OR=2.83; 95% CI: 2.34-2.91). In addition, a direct and significant association was noted between weight gain of >34 lbs compared to weight gain of ≤15 lbs, since age 20 (OR=1.68; 95% CI: 1.10-2.58). Moreover, a weight gain of >24 lbs compared to ≤9 lbs, showed an increased risk of BC since age 30 (OR=1.96; 95% CI: 1.46-3.06) and an increased BC risk was also observed with a weight gain of >12 lbs compared to ≤1 lb, since age 40 (OR=1.91; 95% CI: 1.53-2.66). Women who smoked more than 9 pack-years of cigarettes had a higher risk (59%) of BC (OR=1.59; 95% CI: 1.57-2.87). Subjects who engaged in >24.8 metabolic equivalent (MET)-hours per week compared to ≤10.7 MET-hours per week, of moderate physical activity had a 52% decreased risk of BC (OR=0.48; 95% CI: 0.31-0.74). Moreover, total physical activity between 16.2 and 33.2 MET-hours per week showed a 43% lower risk of BC (OR=0.57 95% CI: 0.37-0.87). However, there was no association between vigorous physical activity and BC risk.  Energy intakes greater than 2,057 Kcal per day were significantly and positively related to BC risk (OR=2.54; 95%CI: 1.67-3.84). Women who consumed more than 8 cups of coffee per day had a 40% increased risk of BC: OR=1.40 (95%CI: 1.09-2.24). Subjects who consumed more than 9 g of alcohol (ethanol) per day had a heightened risk (55%) of BC: OR=1.55 (95%CI: 1.02-2.37). In addition, a positive and significant association was noted between the consumption of beer, wine and spirits and BC risk. The ORs were 1.34 (95%CI: 1.28-2.11) for >2 bottles of beer per week, OR=1.16 (95%CI: 1.08-2.58) for >10 oz of wine per week and OR=1.09 (95%CI: 1.02-2.08) for >6 oz of spirits per week, respectively.  In summary, we found that weight history did affect breast cancer risk. Moreover, smoking appeared to raise the risk, whereas moderate physical activity had a protective effect. Our findings also indicate that relatively high total energy intake and high coffee and alcohol consumption may increase the risk of breast cancer. This work has highlighted an as-yet-untested research focus addressing relationships between lifestyle and dietary habits and BC among non-carriers of BRCA mutations. The report provides advice and guidance on what can be done to influence and change the lifestyle choices as well as dietary habits to help people to reduce their risk of breast cancer.	breast cancer , case-control study , BMI , weight gain , smoking , physical activity , energy intakes , coffee	en	2857.0
1565	Évolution des profils d'état de santé et utilisation des services sociosanitaires chez les personnes âgées	Abstract This thesis aims to study the relationship between the typically heterogeneous needs of community-living elderly and their consequent utilization of health and social services. Inspired by the concept of frailty, the approach consisted in modeling the heterogeneity – by latent class analysis (LCA) – to group individuals into homogenous categories of health status, each representing a constellation of health problems. Applied to the data collected for the demonstration project of the system of integrated services for frail elderly (SIPA), LCA revealed four health state profiles that distinguish the physical and cognitive dimensions of health and capture severity along the disability dimension (Article 1). Transition analyses over 1 year and 22 months showed differentiated and gender-specific patterns of transition probabilities, confirming the sensitivity of the profiles to change in health status. The profiles are stable over time and robust to mortality and lost to follow-up attrition. Relationships between the profiles, sociodemographic characteristics and distal outcomes, such as mortality and institutionalization, confirm the classification’s validity.   These profiles were then used in two-part econometric models to study access and costs of several measures of publicly funded services (Article 2). Our results show the profiles are able to identify distinct configurations of service utilization and costs in substantially meaningful subgroups of the frail elderly population. What is important here is that the health state profiles are sensitive to differences, and changes, in available patterns of care in a specific milieu. These differences reveal choices of target groups by local authorities in delivering institutional and community-based services.   Finally, a fine analysis of these differences was performed for the costly period preceding death to establish whether the high end-of-life costs affect all elderly homogenously irrespective of the severity of their health state (Article 3). A comparative analysis revealed that survivors’ and decedents’ costs of care trends according to health status go in opposite directions. Severely disabled survivors cost significantly more compared to their relatively healthy counterparts. In contrast, the highest end-of-life costs – driven by acute hospitalizations – belong to the relatively healthy, independent of age. Among survivors and among decedents, the oldest old (85+) cost significantly less compared to younger age groups. Combined, these results support the notion of a compression of costs due to morbidity in the oldest old decedents.   The originality of this thesis rests on the fact that few very few studies attempted to model heterogeneity in health status with the goal of estimating its effect on patterns of service utilization. Moreover, in light of the shift towards community-based care as a response to economic pressures and population aging, our work is the first to describe the relationship between health status and end-of-life care in frail community-living elderly.

1566	Brain tumor and brain endothelial cells' response to ionizing radiation and phytochemical treatments	Glioblastoma multiform (GBM) represents the most aggressive and vascularised primary cerebral neoplasm in adults. Median length of survival without further therapy is usually less than one year from the time of diagnosis. Unfortunately, 90% of patients receiving radiotherapy following GBM resection develop a tumor recurrence. More recently, treatment of GBM with combined radiotherapy and temozolomide, an agent recognized for its antiangiogenic activity, increased the median survival to 14,6 months.  Efforts have been oriented towards identifying naturally occurring substances capable of inhibiting, delaying or reversing the multi-stage carcinogenesis process.  Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a green tea polyphenol, has been recognized for its anticancerous and antiangiogenic property.  EGCG may represent a potential agent capable of sensitizing brain tumor cells and their derived endothelial cells (ECs) to conventional treatments.  In chapter II, the first part of this doctorate project aimed at determining if EGCG, in synergy with radiotherapy, can sensitize GBM’s response to radiation and whether specific molecular markers are involved.  We documented that U-87 cells were relatively radioresistant and that Survivin, an inhibitor of apoptosis protein, may be involved in GBM’s radioresistance.  We also found that pre-treatment of U-87 cells with EGCG could overcome the cytoprotective effect of Survivin overexpression and potentiate the cytoreductive effect of irradiation (IR).  In chapter III, we characterized the impact of IR on human brain microvascular endothelial cell (HBMEC) survival and determined whether EGCG, could optimize this effect.  We found that although EGCG treatment and IR individually decreased HBMEC survival, the combined treatment synergistically reduced survival.  We documented that the combined treatment increased cell death, more specifically necrosis. In chapter IV, we investigated the impact of IR exposure on the angiogenic functions i.e. cell proliferation, cell migration in response to brain tumor-derived growth factors, and capacity for tubulogenesis of surviving human brain tumor-derived ECs.  The Rho signalling pathway was also investigated in relation to the functional properties of radioresistant HBMEC.  Our data suggests that IR significantly alters radioresistant HBMEC migration response to tumor-secreted growth factors and tubulogenesis.  Response to growth factors important for tumor expansion and angiogenesis is significantly attenuated in these cells. In conclusion, this doctorate project confirmed IR’s cytoreductive properties on malignant gliomas.  We proposed a novel mechanism to explain GBMs’ radioresistance.  This project documented for the first time IR’s cytotoxic effect in HBMEC.  It also described the existence of radioresistant HBMEC and characterized their altered angiogenic functions.  The combination of natural anticancerous and antiangiogenic molecules such as EGCG with radiotherapy could improve IR’s effect on human malignant glioma cells and microvascular ECs, especially through increased necrosis of HBMEC.  The thesis supports integrating nutrients bearing anticancerous and antiangiogenic properties, such as EGCG, in the management of gliomas to sensitize tumor and tumor-associated ECs to conventional therapies.

1567	Plasticité présynaptique et gliale à long-terme en réponse à un changement chronique de l’activité synaptique,à la jonction neuromusculaire d’amphibien	Synaptic plasticity is a major property of the nervous system, believed to be at the basis of neuronal information processing.  This plasticity has been generally described with pre and postsynaptic adaptations.  Notably, presynaptic efficacy, referring to the probability of transmitter release associated with the quantal content of a synapse, can be increased or decreased according to the previous history of synapses.  Despite this characterization, the mechanisms implicated in the activity-dependent determination of synaptic efficacy remain unknown.  Moreover, synaptic plasticity has never been described in terms of glial adaptations, thus limiting our comprehension of neuronal information processing.  Nevertheless, the past decade has lead to a redefinition of glial cells functions. Relegated to a passive role of neuronal support in the past, glial cells are now known to be involved in the regulation of neurotransmission.  For instance, at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), perisynaptic Schwann cells (PSCs) are believed to modulate synaptic efficacy and plasticity.  Such an active role requires, however, that PSCs adapt to the changing needs of NMJs.  Thus, synaptic plasticity must underlie glial plasticity.  At the NMJ, changes in synaptic activity result in several morphological and physiological adaptations.   Among others, chronic nerve stimulation was shown to decrease synaptic efficacy and short-term depression.  Conversely, chronic blockade of postsynaptic nicotinic receptors increases synaptic efficacy.  Given that PSCs can detect and respond to neurotransmission with a calcium elevation and that they react to environmental stimuli with morphological, physiological and gene expression adaptations, we propose that prolonged changes in synaptic efficacy, induced by chronic nerve stimulation or chronic blockade of nicotinic receptors, would lead to PSCs adaptations.  Thus, in this thesis, we studied, in parallel, long-term presynaptic and glial plasticity, in response to chronic changes in synaptic activity, at the amphibian NMJ.   Our results show presynaptic adaptations of synaptic efficacy, short-term plasticity, mitochondrial content and calcium signalling.  They also reveal several adaptations of PSCs, related to their sensitivity to neurotransmitters and their calcium responses properties.  These presynaptic and glial adaptations are discussed, in parallel, in terms of possible mechanisms and functions in the regulation of neurotransmission.  Our work also confirms the coincidence of presynaptic and glial plasticity and, therefore, raises the importance of glial adaptations for the maintenance of synaptic function.

1568	Caractérisation électro-clinique des convulsions fébriles et risque d’épilepsie	The incidence of epilepsy in children with febrile seizures (FS) varies from 2 to 3%, but available clinical tools do not allow the identification of those children who will later develop epilepsy. Evidences have shown quantitative EEG abnormalities, more particularly revealed by intermittent photic stimulation (IPS), in patients with epilepsy. No studies have yet examined quantitative EEG parameters in children with FS. It is not known either whether they can be relevant to the evaluation of FSs prognosis. The objectives of this research program were to identify, first, clinical risk factors for developing epilepsy after FS and, second, to determine quantitative EEG markers that differentiate FS patients from normal controls and may aid to evaluate their prognosis. In order to meet our first objective, we reviewed the charts of 482 children with FS, aged 3 months to 6 years. Using survival statistics, we described risk factors for developing partial (prenatal antecedents, developmental delay, prolonged and focal FS) and generalized (family history of epilepsy, recurrent FS and FS after the age of 4 years) epilepsy after FS. In addition, we identified several distinct clinical phenotypes related to the prognosis of FS: (i) simple FS with a family history of FS, not related to a subsequent epilepsy, (ii) recurrent FS with a family history of epilepsy and an increased risk of generalised epilepsy and (iii) focal FS with a family history of epilepsy and an increased risk of partial epilepsy.  In order to meet our second objective, we analyzed the steady-state visual potentials (SSVEP) evoked by IPS (5, 7.5, 10 and 12.5 Hz) as a function of age. The high density EEG (128 channels) was recorded in 61 normal children between 6 months and 16 years of age and 8 adults. We showed different topographical development of low (5-15 Hz) and high (30-50 Hz) frequency SSVEP components phase alignment. Thus, low frequency phase alignment increased with age only over the frontal and occipital regions, whereas high frequency phase alignment increased over all cerebral regions.  Then, using the same methodology, we investigated whether children with FS show abnormalities of gamma frequency SSVEP components. We show an increase of both magnitude and phase alignment of the gamma frequency SSVEP components in 12 FS patients compared to 5 siblings of FS patients and 15 control children between 6 and 36 months of age. This study has identified distinct electro-clinical phenotypes that differentiate FS patients from the group of siblings and controls. Future studies should investigate whether detected abnormalities are associated with the clinical presentation of FS and their prognosis. This could help identify children with FSs who will later develop epilepsy and would eventually allow the institution of an early neuroprotective treatment.

1570	Étude de la fonction ovarienne chez les souris déficientes des enzymes hyaluronidases	Female mammals are born with a large number of ovarian primordial follicles, though the vast majority of these never reach the preovulatory stage and undergo atresia, mainly through granulosa cell apoptosis. Our laboratory has established that mammalian hyaluronidases induce apoptosis of ovarian granulosa cells and that they are involved in follicular atresia but that their apoptotic effect is not due to their enzymatic activity. Our model suggests that mammalian hyaluronidases might have a role in follicles not destined to ovulate. The aim of this study was to evaluate the folliculogenesis and fertility of mice devoid of these enzymes. Our results showed that Hyal-3 KO mice have normal folliculogenesis, which could be explained by a compensatory effect of Hyal-1 since its expression is upregulated in these mice. In contrast, Hyal-1 KO mice had increased numbers of primordial, primary and secondary follicles, particularly in young mice, and lower levels of granulosa cell apoptosis. In order to investigate the effect of the three hyaluronidases, Hyal-1, -2 and -3, without a compensatory effect by one another, we decided to create a transgenic mouse deficient in all these three hyaluronidases but only in the gonads by using the Cre/loxP system. We successfully created a plasmid containing the Cre sequence under the control of Inhibin-α promoter, which conducts gene expression in somatic cells of the gonads. In conclusion, the present work demonstrates that Hyal-3 does not have any effect on ovarian function, but that deletion of Hyal-1 in mice promotes increased folliculogenesis and lowers granulosa cell apoptosis.

1571	La transplantation d’hépatocytes chez le rat Long Evans Cinnamon, modèle animal de la maladie de Wilson	Wilson’s disease (WD) is a hereditary metabolic disease caused by a deficiency of copper-transporting ATP7B, resulting in copper accumulating to toxic levels in the liver.  Its manifestations range from acute or chronic hepatic insufficiency to fulminant liver failure. The mainstay of therapy is the use of chelating agents.  However selected patients may also require orthotopic liver transplantation (OTL), an invasive and complex procedure with life-long implications.  Hepatocyte transplantation  is an appealing alternative to OLT.  Its safety and efficacy  were evaluated in the animal model of WD, the Long Evans Cinnamon (LEC) rat.  Twelve LEC rats received an intrasplenic injection of 2,6 x 105 – 3,6 x 107 hepatocytes obtained from LE donor rats.  They were followed for 6 months before sacrifice.  They were then compared to a control group of twelve rats.  No difference was found when comparing their weights, biochemical parameters such as liver function tests and bilirubin, as well as their biliary and hepatic copper concentrations.  However, the ceruloplasmin oxydase activity was improved in the transplanted rats (49,6 ± 31,5 versus 8,9 ± 11,7).  After sacrifice, histologic evaluation and demonstration of atp7b mRNA in the recipient liver were performed.  There was evidence of histological improvement and atp7b mRNA was found in 58% of transplanted rats with an expression of 11,9% ± 13,6 when compared to a normal LE rat.  Evidence of successful engraftment of the transplanted cells was found in every transplanted rat using the technique of immunohistochemistry.  These encouraging results are in accordance with previous studies on hepatocyte transplantation in the LEC rat.  Its application to the human clinical setting is the next step, as it has already been tried in other metabolic liver diseases.

1572	Estimation des longueurs de branche et artefact sur la datation moléculaire	Molecular phylogeny provides an additional tool complementary to paleontological and geological studies, allowing the reconstruction of phylogenetic relationships between species and the estimate of their divergence time. Researchers are mainly focusing on the topology of a phylogenetic tree; i.e. the relative connection between different nodes. Whereas, the branch lengths of this phylogeny are often considered as secondary, i.e. as additional parameters containing little information. However, the branch lengths are the primary information for molecular dating. Importantly, saturation, the presence of multiple substitutions at the same position, is an artifact that leads to an underestimation of the branch length. We are therefore interested in estimating the magnitude of this phenomenon and its impact on divergence time.  We chose to study the mammalian mitochondrial genome, which is available for many species and displays a high level of saturation. Furthermore, the phylogenetic relationships of mammalians are known, thus allowing us to fix the topology, thus eliminating one of the parameters influencing the branch lengths. We used two main approaches to improve the detection of multiple substitutions: (i) an increase in the number of species breaks the longest branches of the tree, (ii) more realistic models of sequence evolution. The results demonstrate that there is a very pronounced underestimation of branch lengths (up to a factor of 3). Furthermore, the use of a large number of species is the factor that influences most the detection of multiple substitutions, not the improvement of the model of sequence evolution. This suggests that even the most complex evolutionary models currently available, like the CAT+ Covarion model, which takes into account the heterogeneity of the substitution process between sites and the rates of evolution over time, are still far from taking the entire complexity of biological processes into account. Despite the important underestimation of branch lengths, the impact on dating appeared to be relatively limited, because the underestimation is more or less homothetic. This is obviously true for the complex evolutionary models. Since multiple substitutions are most effectively detected when breaking the long internal branches via the addition of species. This raises the problem of bias in the taxonomic sampling, due to the impact of extinction on the history of life on earth. Because this kind of bias leads to a non-homothetic underestimation, we consider it essential to improve models of sequence evolution and suggest that the protocol developed in this work will allow to evaluate their effectiveness towards saturation.

1573	L'activation des mères seules prestataires d'aide sociale : quels effets sur leur santé et leur bien-être?	This research is about the impact of the active policy designed for social assistance recipients on lone mother’s health and well being. In Quebec, a social assistance recipient who has a child aged less than 5 receives a temporarily limited capacity allowance. When the child begins school, the lone mother is no longer considered to have limitations to work. Indeed, Emploi-Québec considers this time as the most suitable time to return to work. As part of this research, I analyzed what this moment of transition represented for lone mothers in terms of new employment relationships and possible employment strain. I have met 13 lone mothers who received social assistance within the past year. The data obtained via the interviews helped me meeting my research objectives, which were: 1) reconstruct the insertion trajectories of the lone mothers in the labour market, with emphasis on the moment of transition, and 2) understand the process by which these insertion trajectories have an impact on the health and well being of this population. I first found that the “social assistance relationship” had negative impact on the respondents’ health and well being. The causes for this are fundamentally the social assistance program’s standards that underlie the low level of allowances. Regarding the impact of the activation process itself on the health and well being of the lone mothers I met, I noted that the participation to active measures in community-based organizations specialized in employability programs had positive impact on them, especially on their well being. However, the activation process has also been recognized as having a negative impact on their health and well being because of the strain linked to Emploi-Québec’s demands related to the participation in active measures and to the lack of resources available to lone mothers participating to these measures.	activation , emploi , activation , social policies , employment , lone mothers , social assistance , poverty , health , well being	en	2652.0
1574	La sécurité des xénogreffons : une normativité à bâtir	Xenotransplantation that is, the transplantation of non-human animal cells, tissues and organs into humans, is considered a solution to the organ shortage problem. However, this technology could be the source of new diseases; therefore, it is necessary to have measures aimed at assuring the health of animal donors as well as the quality and safety of the xenografts in order to minimize the risks of disease transmission from animal to human, called xenozoonosis. The subject of this master's thesis is to verify if the standards that exist in Canada and in Quebec are appropriate to assure the safety of the recipients and the population. In the first place, we have examined the standards that could apply to the surveillance and control of the health of animal donors. These standards that apply to known diseases do not meet the specificities of xenotransplantation. As for the xenografts, their qualification is problematic: drugs or medical devices? This possibility of a double status could affect the uniformity of the decisions relative to their quality and safety. We have also studied the Proposed Canadian Standard for Xenotransplantation. The latter may resolve the unsuitability of normative standards that exists in Canada. A comparison of such a Canadian standard with the WHO recommendations and the measures in place in the United States allows us to recommend on how to improve it. Our study reveals that a Canadian normative standard that focuses on the security of the xenografts is still to be implemented. An essential element to be considered in its development, is the need to establish a worldwide compatible and suitable control system.

1575	The carriers responsibilities and immunities under the Hague and Hamburg rules	"Over the last few centuries the carriage of goods by sea has gone through a constant evolution. Only in the last century were the changes so noticeable. Since the early days of shipping, maritime law has tried to adapt to the realities of its time. Change was slow and not always easy to achieve. Prior to statutory regulation the practical reality was such that carriers managed to escape most if not all of their responsibilities. In the last century everything changed, the adoption of The Hague, Hague-Visby and Hamburg Rules transformed the whole system of carriage of goods by sea and their system of responsibilities. The maritime industry was marked by gradual evolution and maritime law has never been the same since. In the last few decades, maritime law went through various reforms and many changes. Today, the shipping industry faces two carriages of goods by sea regimes, The Hague or Hague / Nisby Rules and the new Hamburg Rules. Since the early nineteen hundreds, the maritime industry, with the help of a number of international and national organisations, have been working toward ""one goal"", the adoption of a universal convention regulating maritime trade. The objective was to reach acceptability, predictability, certainty, clarity and unanimity among all the parties involved i.e. carriers as well as shippers, insurers and governments. The 1924 Hague convention was a great innovator. For the first time in maritime history, an international convention limited the carriers practice of using exoneration clauses to limit their responsibilities. Article 3(8) of the Hague Rules regulated the issue in clear and simple terms. Any exemption clause found to be contrary to the Hague Rules would be null and void. The aim was to change the pattern of abuse that existed and promote fairness and balance between shippers and carriers. The carrier's rights and immunities are expressed in art. IV of the Rules. Here again, the convention outlines the importance of the carriers responsibilities found in art. Ill by IV restating them in art. IV(l). Only after discharging such duties, are carriers allowed to follow with the use of available defences (art. IV (2)). For the first time, a mandatory convention regulated affairs of carriage by sea, in particular the use of exemption clauses by carriers. This was a novelty in such an old industry, whose working was based on customs and the freedom of contract basis. Thus, it seemed natural to praise such an accomplishment and indeed no one can contest that in those days, it was an accomplishment. In the late sixties, the Hague rules were amended. The amendments were adopted in Brussels on February 23, 1968 and were known as the Visby Protocol. They represented the response to modernisation and changes that have marked the shipping industry and that were not covered by the original Hague Rules. Nonetheless, even with the changes brought forth by the Visby Rules, international criticism over The Hague and Hague Visby Rules persisted. Thus, in 1978, the Hamburg Rules were adopted to answer the growing dissatisfaction of shipper interests, particularly amongst developing nations. The adoption of the Hamburg Rules meant the implementation of a new regime to govern the relationship between cargo owners and carriers. The adoption of the Hamburg Rules modernised the transit of cargo by ships. They replaced the Hague Rules as well as clarified and simplified maritime shipping matters. They abolished the list of available defences found in article 4(2) of The Hague, and changed the carrier's basis of liability. No longer will exoneration, in cases of fault or neglect, be accepted. The new system is based on the presumption of fault or neglect. This issue is made clear in article 5 (l) of the Hamburg Rules, which states that the carrier will be held responsible for the loss or damage to the goods under his charge, until he proves he was not at fault and that he used the v reasonable required measures to avoid such loss or damage. In practice the Hamburg Rules are not universally accepted, none of the major trading states (US, Britain, Canada, France etc...) have adopted this new system. However, they are more suitable for modem maritime shipping needs, they expanded into areas that Hague did not cover or did not exist (electronic technology), and further, eliminated the perception of bias and injustice that was perceived with the Hague Rules. Formulated by all parties concerned they are more illustrative of all interests involved. Today the question on everyone's mind is, which system should be the one to govern? Until everyone agrees on the acceptable solution, if ever, we will have to face an industry being regulated by two systems or three if we consider the Hague / Nisby System as distinct from the original Hague Rules."	carriage of goods by sea	en	2637.0

1577	Priorities in the Location of Multiple Public Facilities	A collective decision problem is described by a set of agents, a profile of single-peaked preferences over the real line and a number k of public facilities to be located. We consider public facilities that do not su¤er from congestion and are non-excludable. We provide a characterization of the class of rules satisfying Pareto-efficiency, object-population monotonicity and sovereignty. Each rule in the class is a priority rule that selects locations according to a predetermined priority ordering among interest groups. We characterize each of the subclasses of priority rules that respectively satisfy anonymity, hiding-proofness and strategy-proofness. In particular, we prove that a priority rule is strategy-proof if and only if it partitions the set of agents into a fixed hierarchy. Alternatively, any such rule can be viewed as a collection of fixed-populations generalized peak-selection median rules (Moulin, 1980), that are linked across populations, in a way that we describe.

1581	Convergence of corporate governance : comparative study in Canada and in China	This thesis aims to consider the debates in the field of corporate governance in the fact that there have been and will be dramatic changes in the structure of corporate activities, such as the nature of work and the organization of corporations, as well as the influences of reforms in the financial reforms. Moreover, the emergence of institutional investment in the financial markets, the process of globalization and the development of electronic commerce have the influences on the corporate governance both in Canada and in China. There is an immense magnitude of discussion on various aspects of corporate governance in the academic field. This thesis will focus on comparing two rather distinctive systems of corporate governance, with respect to three specific aspects of the corporate governance. Those are: the board of directors, the role of shareholders, the roles of banks and investors in the two countries, also the reforms in China. Moreover, the convergence of the two corporate governance systems is introduced.	Convergence , Canada , Corporate governance , Board of directors , Shareholder , Reform , China	en	2440.0
1582	La liberté d'expression et l'administration de la justice : le choc de deux paradigmes	The present thesis examines the relations between the freedom of expression and the administration of justice. Historically, these relations have been set down as being those of the journalists and the public to be admitted to court hearings, those of the media to report and criticize the judicial decisions and the judiciary itself, and those, correlative and opposing, of the judges to order the proceeding to be held in camera, to issue non-publication orders and, if need be, to sentence for contempt of court. More recently, the protection of the journalistic sources has become a new stake about which the constellation of law and that of information collide. Our thesis is inspired by a materialistic approach to the relations between the law and the society. The materialistic vision, of which the marxian thought may have represented an element - not to mention the varied metamorphoses of that thought constitued by diverse marxist schools - sets down the necessity of a synchronic and diachronic confrontation between the world of law that of information in ail the dimensions and surfaces of their interaction - hence the use of the term paradigm to designate those two constellations. Essentially, this fundamental requirement imposes the form and the dimensions taken by this thesis. This work is divided in two Parts. The First Part expounds the analysis framework and the empirical data, whereas the Second Part in dedicated to the examination of the legal norms themselves. The First Part is dedicated to the relations between law and society. The Second Part analyses the international legal norms regarding the relations between the media and the judiciary, while our analysis of the canadian legal nonns in this matter will be found in the Second Part. Each Section of each Chapter explores, from a diachronic standpoint, a specific subject of study, generally respecting the four fundamental modes of production of the social wealth in which law and information are inscribed as a specific mode of normalization. Rigorous observance of those architectronic rules has seemed to us the best way to lay out such a wide ranging and complex subject. However considering the extent of our work, it seemed to us that our abstract should be used to expound this structure in order to guide the reader somewhat. The First Part sets out our theoretical analysis of the relations between law and society, more specifically, the relations between the freedom of expression and the administration of justice. Its Chapters successively tackle the over all issue, our standpoint and our procedure (Chapter I), expound the materialistic theory of the relations between law and society (Chapter II), explore the moments and surfaces of their confrontation and emphasize the common epistemological characteristics that unite them and that make the appeal to the public the essential mode of their action and their legitimation. The Second Part is considering, as we have already pointed out, the legal norms concerning the relations between the media, the judiciary and the world of law. We have chosen models laying a very wide perspective on these questions or presenting historical links with the Canadian law in this matter. In this way we examine the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the jurisprudence of the Human Rights Committee of the United Nations, the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and the jurisprudence of the Strasbourg Court and the American and French nonns (Chapter IV). The Second Part is dedicated to the canadian legal norms. We examine the rights to be admitted to court hearings and that of media to report and criticize the judicial decisions, the judges and the judiciary, on the one hand (Chapter V), and, on the other hand, the right of the journalists to protect their joumalist sources (Chapter VI). A last chapter completes our work, summing up our conclusions, however provisional they may be. Finally, we would like to point out that this thesis is but the first phase of a more comprehensive approach that will be completed by sociological and economical studies on the same subject.

1583	Une analyse de la sanction économique en droit international	The fundamental criticism addressed to internationallaw denounces the weaknesses of its sanctions mechanisms. For this reason, severallegal thinkers conc1uded to the inexistence of international law. The present text studies the rhetoric behind this statement and examines its validity. To do so, we analyze in the first place the relationship between sanction and law through the positivist framework of the XIXth Century. We examine in turn the so-called fundamental elements of sanction. We compare these elements with different non-Iegal orders so that we can ultimately reject the positivist theory according to which coercion and centralization ofpower are the fundamental elements of sanction. Chapter II examines the United Nations Security Council framework for adopting economic sanctions. This step allows us to underline the main sources ofweaknesses and limitations of internationallaw. In this respect we observe that the lack of international cooperation is the major weakness of internationallaw. Furthermore, an analysis of the relevant dispositions of the United Nations Charter shows that the veto right and the principle of international sovereignty are two elements that hamper international cooperation. We then study the objectives behind the adoption of sanctions as well as their effectiveness. Finally, we study general embargoes as well as arms embargos. This inquiry allows us to focus on the effects of economic sanctions on both civilians and third States. It also helps us understand the problems with regard to the administration of a sanction, as well as the ways to bypass the prohibitions.

1584	L'utilisation des cellules souches embryonnaires à des fins thérapeutiques	The embryonic stem cells discovery and the immense therapeutic potential glven to them has created big hopes in the world of today. The appearance of new revolutionary therapies to treat sorne of the most serious known diseases are now conceivable. However, the treatment of life to its earliest stage is questionned. The legal status recognized to the foetus and the embryo has, in fact, a direct effect to the research area and industry as weil as to its therapeutic use. Therefore, we have examined and studied the CUITent canadian law with respect to the legal status of the foetus and embryo. Following this study, we have noticed the uncertainty that prevails in Canada concerning the said legal status. Afierwards, we have examined ail the different canadian norms and regulations already established regarding the use of embryonic stem cells for therapeutic ends. We also did the comparaison between those norms and regulations so as to see their differences and similarities. It appears from our analysis that ail the canadian litterature generally treat the subject in the same way and that there have been few changes from 1993 up until now with respect to the forbidden researchs activities in Canada. We also have analysed the foreign law standards and regulations in United States and Great Britain concerning those forbidden researchs activities. We did the exercise of comparing the state of the law in these three countries with different parameters. It emerges from that that Great Britain is the most liberal country, United States being the most conservative and Canada being in between them.

1585	Defining the crime of aggression : cutting the Gordian knot ?	"The crime of aggression is one of the four international crimes under the jurisdiction of the ICC. When delegates at the Rome Conference were unable to agree on the content of a definition, the crime was left undefined. As a result, the ICC can only begin prosecuting individuals for the crime of aggression once a definition is adopted by the Assembly of States Parties in 2009, at the earliest. This thesis examines three issues associated with the crime of aggression: the question of individual criminal responsibility, the role of the UN Security Council and the general scope of the definition of the crime of aggression itself Individual criminal liability is reviewed, inter alia, from the perspective of international sources doctrine. Regarding the role of the Security Council in relation to the crime of aggression, the author concludes: if the Security Council is vested with more powers than it already has under Articles 13(b) and 16 of the Rome Statute, each permanent member will have a veto over any situation of aggression that might otherwise be brought before the Court. This would result in a complete politicization of the ICC and render moot any future definition of the crime of aggression. If a definition for the crime of aggression is properly conceived and constructed, it is argued, there is no need to further limit the Court's exercise of jurisdiction. The author proposes general parameters for the scope ofthe definition based on conclusions reached in the analysis of the conceptual components of aggression. At its essence, the act of aggression is the unnecessary, unlawful use of force which constitutes a breach ofthe peace. Unless employed in ""self-defence"" or under a Chapter VII mandate, the use offorce constitutes prima facie an act of aggression, and if it is sufficiently grave, a crime ofaggression. This thesis concludes with a working definition ofthe crime of aggression to promote dialogue and ultimately a consensus on these core issues. Not only is a definition is within reach, the author believes, we are closer to it than we ever have been before."

1586	Umbilical Cord Blood Banking	The umbilical cord, previously considered as waste and discarded at birth, is a source of haematopoietic stem cells. Current therapeutic uses of umbilical cord blood stem cells and the promise of these cells for the treatment of degenerative diseases in the future have led to the establishment of cord blood banks in many parts of the world. Although umbilical cord blood banking raises many ethical and legal issues, this article focuses on the controversy created by the coexistence of public and private cord blood banks in many countries. Policy statements adopted by professional associations and advisory groups indicate that, based on the current state of medical evidence, childbearing women with no current or potential familial need of stem cell transplantation should be encouraged to donate cord blood to public banks.

However, this area of research raises challenging ethical, legal and social issues that must be addressed. One way of addressing these issues is through public involvement in the policy-making process. This GenEdit reviews how international guidelines and policy statements related to public health genomics address the issue of public involvement. Key areas of discussion are the values and goals justifying public involvement, the proposed activities to increase public involvement, who is / who represents ""the public"", and the projected outcomes of public involvement."

1590	A Generalized Index of Fractionalization	The goal of this paper is to contribute to the economic literature on ethnic and cultural diversity by proposing a new index that is informationally richer and more flexible than the commonly used ‘ethno-linguistic fractionalization’ (ELF) index. We characterize a measure of diversity among individuals that takes as a primitive the individuals, as opposed to ethnic groups, and uses information on the extent of similarity among them. Compared to existing indices, our measure does not require that individuals are pre-assigned to exogenously determined categories or groups. We show that our generalized index is a natural extension of ELF and is also simple to compute. We also provide an empirical illustration of how our index can be operationalized and what difference it makes as compared to the standard ELF index. This application pertains to the pattern of fractionalization in the United States.	Diversity , Similarity , Ethno-Linguistic Fractionalization , C43 , D63	en	2214.0
1591	Land Ownership, Working Capital, and the Agricultural Output: Egypt, 1913-1958	A simple model is constructed in which short-term credit is needed to finance the purchase of inputs, in which there is bankruptcy risk, and in which we argue were important characteristics of Egyptian agriculture during the first half of this century, result in aggregate agricultural output being dependant on the distribution of land ownership. The main theorical insight is that aggregate agricultural output will be increased by a decrease in the inequality of the distribution of land ownership when returns to scale are decreasing. Testable short- and long-run empirical propositions are formulated and carefully tested on Egyptian data for the 1913-1958 period. We find that, controlling for factor inputs, there is no tradeoff between equity and efficiency for Egyptian agriculture - they go hand in hand in the short run.

1597	Le développement d'une pensée séculière par la diffusion de la religion : une sociologie des humanistes	By way of a historical perspective, this masters thesis aims to reconsider the weberian “ethical rationalization” theory as an explanatory factor for the modern transformation of the relationship between individuals and religion. Reviewing the changes in Renaissance religious thought—and contrasting it with the Medieval religious context—enables us to uncover a shift from a syncretic and ritualized religion that is filled with magical elements, towards an uncluttered, internalized and rational Christianity. The focus on Erasmus of Rotterdam’s religious humanist thought—considered here as a “historical figure” and carrier of these transformations—brings light on how Christianity was stripped of its mystical aspects and came to be understood as a comprehensive philosophical system. The dissemination of such a Christian “spirit”, as well as the importance granted to a methodical way of life specifically oriented towards salvation, play a key role in the appearance of a “quotidian ritualization” of religious charisma, which is in itself, according to Weber, an essential preliminary to an “ethical rationalization” and thus to the “autonomization” of the religious sphere in the social life.

1605	Bayesian Analysis for a Theory of Random Consumer Demand: The Case of Indivisible Goods	"McCausland (2004a) describes a new theory of random consumer demand. Theoretically consistent random demand can be represented by a \""regular\"" \""L-utility\"" function on the consumption set X. The present paper is about Bayesian inference for regular L-utility functions. We express prior and posterior uncertainty in terms of distributions over the indefinite-dimensional parameter set of a flexible functional form. We propose a class of proper priors on the parameter set. The priors are flexible, in the sense that they put positive probability in the neighborhood of any L-utility function that is regular on a large subset bar(X) of X; and regular, in the sense that they assign zero probability to the set of L-utility functions that are irregular on bar(X). We propose methods of Bayesian inference for an environment with indivisible goods, leaving the more difficult case of indefinitely divisible goods for another paper. We analyse individual choice data from a consumer experiment described in Harbaugh et al. (2001)."	Consumer demand , Bayesian methods , Flexible functional Forms , Shape restrictions	en	522.0

We demonstrate some useful properties of the decomposition, and propose an index for a certain type of time irreversibility. Two empirical examples illustrate the use of the proposed parameter, decomposition and index. One involves observed states; the other, latent states.

1607	Anonymous Single-Profile Welfarism	This note reexamines the single-profile approach to social-choice theory. If an alternative is interpreted as a social state of affairs or a history of the world, it can be argued that a multi-profile approach is inappropriate because the information profile is determined by the set of alternatives. However, single-profile approaches are criticized because of the limitations they impose on the possibility of formulating properties such as anonymity. We suggest an alternative definition of anonymity that applies in a single-profile setting and characterize anonymous single-profile welfarism under a richness assumption.

1609	Jumps in the Volatility of Financial Markets	Recent work suggests that the conditional variance of financial returns may exhibit sudden jumps. This paper extends a non-parametric procedure to detect discontinuities in otherwise continuous functions of a random variable developed by Delgado and Hidalgo (1996) to higher conditional moments, in particular the conditional variance. Simulation results show that the procedure provides reasonable estimates of the number and location of jumps. This procedure detects several jumps in the conditional variance of daily returns on the S&P 500 index.	jumps , conditional variance , one-sided windows	en	476.0
1610	Aggregations and Marginalization of GARCH and Stochastic Volatility Models	The GARCH and Stochastic Volatility paradigms are often brought into conflict as two competitive views of the appropriate conditional variance concept : conditional variance given past values of the same series or conditional variance given a larger past information (including possibly unobservable state variables). The main thesis of this paper is that, since in general the econometrician has no idea about something like a structural level of disaggregation, a well-written volatility model should be specified in such a way that one is always allowed to reduce the information set without invalidating the model. To this respect, the debate between observable past information (in the GARCH spirit) versus unobservable conditioning information (in the state-space spirit) is irrelevant. In this paper, we stress a square-root autoregressive stochastic volatility (SR-SARV) model which remains true to the GARCH paradigm of ARMA dynamics for squared innovations but weakens the GARCH structure in order to obtain required robustness properties with respect to various kinds of aggregation. It is shown that the lack of robustness of the usual GARCH setting is due to two very restrictive assumptions : perfect linear correlation between squared innovations and conditional variance on the one hand and linear relationship between the conditional variance of the future conditional variance and the squared conditional variance on the other hand. By relaxing these assumptions, thanks to a state-space setting, we obtain aggregation results without renouncing to the conditional variance concept (and related leverage effects), as it is the case for the recently suggested weak GARCH model which gets aggregation results by replacing conditional expectations by linear projections on symmetric past innovations. Moreover, unlike the weak GARCH literature, we are able to define multivariate models, including higher order dynamics and risk premiums (in the spirit of GARCH (p,p) and GARCH in mean) and to derive conditional moment restrictions well suited for statistical inference. Finally, we are able to characterize the exact relationships between our SR-SARV models (including higher order dynamics, leverage effect and in-mean effect), usual GARCH models and continuous time stochastic volatility models, so that previous results about aggregation of weak GARCH and continuous time GARCH modeling can be recovered in our framework.

1611	The Measurement of Diversity	The notion of diversity is an issue that is of relevance in several contexts. For example, the biodiversity of a given ecological environment and the diversity of the options available to a decision maker have attracted some attention in recent research. This paper provides an axiomatic approach to the measurement of diversity. We characterize two nested classes of ordinal measures of diversity and an important member of these classes. We prove that the latter special case is equivalent to a diversity ordering proposed by Weitzman.	diversity , distance measures	en	357.0
1612	Logique et tests d'hypotheses: reflexions sur les problemes mal poses en econometrie	In this text, we review recent developments in econometrics from the viewpoint of statistical test theory. We first review some basic principles of philosophy of science and statistical theory, emphasizing parsimony and falsifiability as criteria for evaluating models, test theory as a formalization of the falsification principle for probabilistic models, and the logical foundation of basic notions in test theory (such as the level of a test). We then show that some of the most frequently used statistical and econometric methods are fundamentally inappropriate for the problems and models considered, while several hypotheses, for which test procedures are commonly proposed, are not testable at all. Such situations lead to ill-defined statistical problems. We analyze several cases of such problems : (1) building confidence intervals in structural models where identification problems may be present; (2) the construction of tests for nonparametric hypotheses, including procedures robust to heteroskadasticity, non-normality or dynamic specification. We point out that these difficulties often originate from the ambition to weaken regularity conditions typically required by statistical analysis, and from an inappropriate use of asymptotic distributional theory. Finally, we underscore the importance of formulating testable hypotheses and models, and of developing econometric methods with provable finite-sample properties.

1613	Efficiency in Uncertain Cooperative Games	A contingent contract in a transferable utility game under uncertainty specifies an outcome for each possible state. It is assumed that coalitions evaluate these contracts by considering the minimal possible excesses. A main question of the paper concerns the existence and characterization of efficient contracts. It is shown that they exist if and only if the set of possible coalitions contains a balanced subset. Moreover, a characterization of values that result in efficient contracts in the case of minimally balanced collections is provided.	transferable utility games , uncertainty , balanced collections	en	354.0
1614	Non-Deteriorating Choice	We analyze an alternative to the standard rationalizability requirement for observed choices by considering non-deteriorating selections. A selection function is a generalization of a choice function where selected alternatives may depend on a reference (or status quo) alternative in addition to the set of feasible options. A selection function is non-deteriorating if there exists an ordering over the universal set of alternatives such that the selected alternatives are at least as good as the reference option. We characterize non-deteriorating selection functions in an abstract framework and in an economic environment.	choice functions , individual rationality , status quo	en	342.0
1615	Vertical R&D Sprillovers, Cooperation, Market Structure, and Innovation	This paper studies vertical R&D spillovers between upstream and downstream firms. The model incorporates two vertically related industries, with horizontal spillovers within each industry and vertical spillovers between the two industries. Four types of R&D cooperation are studied : no cooperation, horizontal cooperation, vertical cooperation, and simultaneous horizontal and vertical cooperation. Vertical spillovers always increase R&D and welfare, while horizontal spillovers may increase or decrease them. The comparison of cooperative settings in terms of R&D shows that no setting uniformly dominates the others. Which type of cooperation yields more R&D depends on horizontal and vertical spillovers, and market structure. The ranking of cooperative structures hinges on the signs and magnitudes of three competitive externalities (vertical, horizontal, and diagonal) which capture the effect of the R&D of a firm on the profits of other firms. One of the basic results of the strategic investment literature is that cooperation between competitors increases (decreases) R&D when horizontal spillovers are high (low); the model shows that this result does not necessarily hold when vertical spillovers and vertical cooperation are taken into account. The paper proposes a theory of innovation and market structure, showing that the relation between innovation and competition depends on horizontal spillovers, vertical spillovers, and cooperative settings. The private incentives for R&D cooperation are addressed. It is found that buyers and sellers have divergent interests regarding the choice of cooperative settings and that spillovers increase the likelihood of the emergence of cooperation in a decentralized equilibrium.	innovation , vertical R&D spillovers , market structure , innovation , vertical R&D cooperation , R&D policy	en	340.0
