0	Mindful parenting programs in non-clinical contexts : a qualitative review of child outcomes and programs, and recommendations for future research	Mindful parenting programs, providing mindfulness training for parents and caregivers, have been gaining increasing attention in recent years. Parents participating in these programs have reported benefits in emotional awareness, listening, and parent-child relationships at post-intervention. Considering that many mindful parenting programs aim to train parents generally, rather than specifically targeting parents of clinic-referred or diagnosed children, it is necessary to ascertain the impact of these programs in non-clinical, community samples. In the present qualitative review, databases were searched for studies that reported on children’s outcomes following mindful parenting programs for parents of typically developing children without clinical diagnoses. A synthesis of selected papers (n = 6) demonstrated promising but limited impact of mindful parenting programs on children’s psychosocial functioning. Differences emerged across programs in themes and mindfulness elements covered. Results demonstrate a need for more rigorous and multi-informant research on the preventative implications of mindful parenting programs in non-clinical contexts for child functioning.		en	24994.0
1	La trame sonore du film Baby Driver : une esthétique de musicalisation intensifiée	For a long time, filmmakers have used pre-existing musical pieces to soundtrack their movies. Yet given how digital technologies reshape the availability of music and its consumption, a new relationship between popular music and contemporary cinema may be emerging. Consequently, my article focuses on a case study: the analysis of Edgar Wright’s film Baby Driver (2017). To frame my research, I first examine the work of several academics who have theorized contemporary cinema through the lens of music. I then analyze the particular audiovisual configuration of Edgar Wright’s film thanks to notions used in film studies, especially in Michel Chion’s study of sounds. Finally, I consider the film’s depiction of contemporary musical devices as a kind of documentation of current media practices in music.

2	More ‘Europe’, less Democracy? : European integration does not erode satisfaction with democracy	The process of European integration, through institutions such as the European Union, the Eurozone, or Schengen, implies a shift in political decision-making away from the national governments and towards international institutions. This gradual shift in the balance of power, furthermore, is increasingly debated by citizens. As a result, European integration might lead to an erosion of satisfaction with democracy in European countries. By means of a longitudinal analysis of the determinants of satisfaction with democracy in European countries, we test this expectation. We find no indication that the shift in the balance of power, and the trend towards more European integration indeed have eroded satisfaction with the functioning of (national) democracy.

3	Perinatal adversity profiles and suicide attempt in adolescence and young adulthood : longitudinal analyses from two 20-year birth cohort studies	Background We aimed to identify groups of children presenting distinct perinatal adversity profiles and test the association between profiles and later risk of suicide attempt.  Methods Data were from the Québec Longitudinal Study of Child Development (QLSCD, N = 1623), and the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC, N = 5734). Exposures to 32 perinatal adversities (e.g. fetal, obstetric, psychosocial, and parental psychopathology) were modeled using latent class analysis, and associations with a self-reported suicide attempt by age 20 were investigated with logistic regression. We investigated to what extent childhood emotional and behavioral problems, victimization, and cognition explained the associations.  Results In both cohorts, we identified five profiles: No perinatal risk, Poor fetal growth, Socioeconomic adversity, Delivery complications, Parental mental health problems (ALSPAC only). Compared to children with No perinatal risk, children in the Poor fetal growth (pooled estimate QLSCD-ALSPAC, OR 1.89, 95% CI 1.04–3.44), Socioeconomic adversity (pooled-OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.08–1.85), and Parental mental health problems (OR 1.74, 95% CI 1.27–2.40), but not Delivery complications, profiles were more likely to attempt suicide. The proportion of this effect mediated by the putative mediators was larger for the Socioeconomic adversity profile compared to the others.  Conclusions Perinatal adversities associated with suicide attempt cluster in distinct profiles. Suicide prevention may begin early in life and requires a multidisciplinary approach targeting a constellation of factors from different domains (psychiatric, obstetric, socioeconomic), rather than a single factor, to effectively reduce suicide vulnerability. The way these factors cluster together also determined the pathways leading to a suicide attempt, which can guide decision-making on personalized suicide prevention strategies.

4	Health science communication strategies used by researchers with the public in the digital and social media ecosystem : a systematic scoping review protocol	Introduction The optimisation of health science communication (HSC) between researchers and the public is crucial. In the last decade, the rise of the digital and social media ecosystem allowed for the disintermediation of HSC. Disintermediation refers to the public’s direct access to information from researchers about health science-related topics through the digital and social media ecosystem, a process that would otherwise require a human mediator, such as a journalist. Therefore, the primary aim of this scoping review is to describe the nature and the extent of the literature regarding HSC strategies involving disintermediation used by researchers with the public in the digital and social media ecosystem. The secondary aim is to describe the HSC strategies used by researchers, and the communication channels associated with these strategies. Methods and analysis We will conduct a scoping review based on the Joanna Briggs Institute’s methodology and perform a systematic search of six bibliographical databases (CINAHL, EMBASE, IBSS, PubMed, Sociological Abstracts and Web of Science), four trial registries and relevant sources of grey literature. Relevant journals and reference lists of included records will be hand-searched. Data will be managed using the EndNote software and the Rayyan web application. Two review team members will perform independently the screening process as well as the full-text assessment of included records. Descriptive data will be synthesised in a tabular format. Data regarding the nature and the extent of the literature, the HSC strategies and the associated communication channels will be presented narratively. Ethics and dissemination This review does not require institutional review board approval as we will use only collected and published data. Results will allow the mapping of the literature about HSC between researchers and the public in the digital and social media ecosystem, and will be published in a peer-reviewed journal.		en	24935.0
5	Effects of experimental thermocline and oxycline deepening on methylmercury bioaccumulation in a Canadian Shield lake	Environmental disturbances like deforestation or climate change may influence lake thermal and oxic stratification, thereby modifying cycles of contaminants such as mercury (Hg). In a lake naturally separated into three basins, the thermocline and oxycline of an experimental basin were deepened by 4 and 3 m, respectively, to study the effect on the methylmercury (MeHg) accumulation. This treatment decreased hypolimnetic MeHg concentration by approximately 90%, zooplankton concentrations by 30 to 50%, and in some fish by 45%. A multiple linear regression indicated that oxycline depth significantly influenced hypolimnetic MeHg concentrations, with no significant effect of thermocline depth, anoxic water volume, interface area of oxic-anoxic water, and sediment area in contact with anoxic water. Fish MeHg decline varied, with a greater response by low oxygen-tolerant bullhead. Increased pelagic primary and secondary production likely caused zooplankton and fish MeHg decreases via algal and growth dilution. Environmental changes leading to oxycline deepening are therefore predicted to cause a decrease in MeHg bioaccumulation in similar Canadian Shield lakes. If associated ecosystem impacts related to the deepening treatment are deemed acceptable, then this experiment provides a potential remediation method for small lakes confronted with MeHg accumulation.		en	24914.0
6	Mapping metal (Hg, As, Se), lipid and protein levels within fish muscular system in two fish species (Striped Bass and Northern Pike)	Current guidelines tend to limitfish consumption based on mercury (Hg) or monomethylmercury(MeHg) content infishflesh, without considering the presence of antagonist chemical elements thatcould modulate Hg toxicity. However, it is difficult to assess the potential for antagonistic interactions ofthese elements since their covariation within muscle tissues is poorly known. Here we present thefirststudy simultaneously mapping multiple metal(oid)s (Hg, As and Se), lipids and proteins infishfillets inorder to assess the magnitude of intra-organ variability of metals and the potential for antagonisticinteractions. We mapped twofish species (Striped Bass and Northern Pike) with contrasting muscularstructure with respect to the presence of white, intermediate and red muscles. In individual Striped Bassmuscle tissues, metals varied on average by 2.2-fold. Methylmercury and selenium covaried strongly andwere related to protein content as assessed by % N; arsenic was inversely related to these elements andwas associated with the lipid fraction of the muscle. In Pike, no such relationship was found because thecontents in proteins and lipids were less variable. Arsenic speciation revealed that arsenobetaine andarsenolipids were the only As species in thosefish species, whereas the toxic inorganic As species (As3þ)was under the detection limit. Arsenobetaine was related to % N, whereas arsenolipids covaried with %lipids. Elemental associations found with muscle lipids and proteins could help explain changes inbioaccumulation patterns within and between individuals with potential implications onfish toxicology,biomonitoring and human consumption guidelines.
