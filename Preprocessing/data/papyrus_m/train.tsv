0	Law enforcement and disruption of offline and online activities : a review of comptemporary challenges	The digital world represents a new frontier for law enforcement operations. The virtual nature of online communications creates challenges regarding legal frameworks and sovereignty that are exacerbated by the inherent context of the digital world, the current state of policing expertise and resources and the detection and reporting rates of cybercrimes. This book chapter presents an informed review of the current state of ‘what works’ in policing both offline and online, providing at each step the context needed to understand how new technologies impact police operations. Our conclusion suggests that new models of policing are indeed needed to effectively police the digital world and that cooperation through nodal governance could improve the ability of police agencies to regulate cyberoffenders.

1	Differential language network functional connectivity alterations in Alzheimer's disease and the semantic variant of primary progressive aphasia	Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA) can present with similar language impairments, mainly in naming. It has been hypothesized that these deficits are associated with different brain mechanisms in each disease, but no previous study has used a network approach to explore this hypothesis. The aim of this study was to compare resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) language network in AD, svPPA patients, and cognitively unimpaired elderly adults (CTRL). Therefore, 10 AD patients, 12 svPPA patients and 11 CTRL underwent rs-fMRI. Seed-based functional connectivity analyses were conducted using regions of interest in the left anterior temporal lobe (ATL), left posterior middle temporal gyrus (pMTG) and left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), applying a voxelwise correction for gray matter volume. In AD patients, the left pMTG was the only key language region showing functional connectivity changes, mainly a reduced interhemispheric functional connectivity with its right-hemisphere counterpart, in comparison to CTRL. In svPPA patients, we observed a functional isolation of the left ATL, both decreases and increases in functional connectivity from the left pMTG and increased functional connectivity form the left IFG. Post-hoc analyses showed that naming impairments were overall associated with the functional disconnections observed across the language network. In conclusion, AD and svPPA patients present distinct language network functional connectivity profiles. In AD patients, functional connectivity changes were restricted to the left pMTG and were overall less severe in comparison to svPPA patients. Results in svPPA patients suggest decreased functional connectivity along the ventral language pathway and increased functional connectivity along the dorsal language pathway. Finally, the observed connectivity patterns are overall consistent with previously reported structural connectivity and language profiles in these patients.

2	Augustine’s ‘Si comprehendis, non est Deus’ : to what extent is God incomprehensible?	Can God be positively understood? The very respectable tradition of negative theology would claim that this is impossible and that God could only be understood by saying what God is not. There is a saying of Augustine that is often quoted in this context, “If you understand it is not God.” What did Augustine mean by this? Does this dictum not entail a contradiction in that we all understand the meaning of the word God? Did God not also reveal himself in Scripture and creation, thus opening himself to understanding? This study sorts out the meaning and context of this saying in Augustine’s Sermon 117 and argues that an understanding of God and indeed a “touching” of God are possible for Augustine. It also argues against the obsessive, if widespread attempt of some to debase humankind’s capability of understanding.

3	Altered gray matter structural covariance networks in early stages of Alzheimer's disease	Clinical symptoms observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients may reflect variations within specific large-scale brain networks, modeling AD as a disconnection syndrome. The present magnetic resonance imaging study aims to compare the organization of gray matter structural covariance networks between 109 cognitively unimpaired controls (CTRL) and 109 AD patients positive to beta-amyloid at the early stages of the disease, using voxel-based morphometry. The default-mode network (DMN; medial temporal lobe subsystem) was less extended in AD patients in comparison with CTRL, with a significant decrease in the structural association between the entorhinal cortex and the medial prefrontal and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortices. The DMN (midline core subsystem) was also less extended in AD patients. Trends toward increased structural association were observed in the salience and executive control networks. The observed changes suggest that early disruptions in structural association between heteromodal association cortices and the entorhinal cortex could contribute to an isolation of the hippocampal formation, potentially giving rise to the clinical hallmark of AD, progressive memory impairment. It also provides critical support to the hypothesis that the reduced connectivity within the DMN in early AD is accompanied by an enhancement of connectivity in the salience and executive control networks.

4	Diagnosis and surgical management of cholecystolithiasis in two adult inland beardeddragons (pogona vitticeps)	Two male inland bearded dragons (Pogona vitticeps) of 5 and 6 yr of age were presented for anorexia with and without lethargy, respectively. In both cases, a firm, spherical, and mobile mass, measuring 2 cm in diameter, was palpated in the cranio-medial coelom. Radiographs were unremarkable. Ultrasonographic evaluation was highly suggestive of cholecystolithiasis. Coeliotomy confirmed the presence of a markedly enlarged gallbladder containing a cholecystolith in both cases, and cholecystectomies were performed. Both dragons resumed eating after 1–7 days and were doing well 3–6 months postoperatively. The gallbladder wall was unremarkable on histology, and the choleliths were composed of protein and calcium carbonate crystals. Cholecystolithiasis in bearded dragons has been the subject of very few case reports, probably due to its low occurrence. The lack of available data on the diagnosis and management may have led to this condition being underdiagnosed in this species. Ultrasonography was essential to the clinical diagnosis of cholecystolithiasis in our two cases and should be recommended as part of the diagnostic approach of bearded dragons with cranio-medial coelomic masses.

5	The role of the hippocampus in the semantic variant of primary progressive aphasia : a resting‐state fcMRI study	The goal of the study was to determine whether the semantic variant of primary progressive aphasia (svPPA) affects the intrinsic connectivity network anchored to left and right anterior hippocampus, but spares the posterior hippocampus. A resting‐state functional connectivity MRI (rs‐fcMRI) study was conducted in a group of patients with svPPA and in controls, using a seed‐to‐voxel approach. In comparison to controls, massively reduced connectivity was found in the anterior hippocampus, mainly the left one, for svPPA patients but not in the left or right posterior hippocampus. In svPPA, the anterior hippocampus showed reduced functional connectivity with regions implicated in the semantic memory network. Significant correlation was also found between the functional connectivity strength of the left anterior hippocampus and the ventromedial cortex, and performance in semantic tasks. These findings indicate that the functional disconnection of the anterior hippocampus may be a promising in vivo biomarker of svPPA and illustrate the role of this hippocampal subregion in the semantic memory system.

6	Word-finding in confrontation naming and picture descriptions produced by individuals with early post-stroke aphasia	Objective The present study aims to assess the relationship between quantitative measures of connected speech production and performance in confrontation naming in early post-stroke aphasia (8-14 days post-stroke). Method: We collected connected speech samples elicited by a picture description task and administered a confrontation naming task to 20 individuals with early post-stroke aphasia and 20 healthy controls. Transcriptions were made in compliance with the CHAT format guidelines. Several micro- (i.e. duration, total number of words, words per minute, mean length of utterances, ratio of open- to closed-class words and noun-to-verb ratio, VOC-D, repetitions, self-corrections, and phonological and semantic errors) and macrolinguistic (i.e. informativeness and efficiency) measures were extracted. Results: We provide evidence for the presence of impairments in an array of micro- and macrolinguistic measures of speech in individuals with early post-stroke aphasia. We show that in the patient group, confrontation naming abilities most strongly relate to informativeness in a picture description task. Conclusion: Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the relationship between performance in confrontation naming and in connected speech production in the first days after stroke onset and also suggest that discourse analysis may provide unique, possibly more complex information.

7	"Rereading the decline of the illustrated song : three
crisis discourses in moving picture world, 1908"	Historians have well documented the decline of illustrated songs in nickelodeons in the United States from 1909 to 1913. In this article, a close examination of the 1907 and 1908 issues of Moving Picture World shows that several crises occurred before 1909 that help us understand this decline. Here I examine three main crises: the structural crisis of free music, the economic and aesthetic crisis of piracy, and the legal dispute over exclusive illustration rights.

8	Posterior cortical atrophy : impact on daily living activities and exploration of a cognitive rehabilitation approach	Posterior cortical atrophy (PCA) is a neurodegenerative disease affecting the posterior region of the brain. Little is known about both the impact of PCA on functioning and how to support patients on a daily basis. The purpose of this study was to describe the functional profile of DD, a woman diagnosed with PCA, as well as to explore a pilot cognitive rehabilitation program designed to optimize functioning in daily living. The ADL Profile was used to assess the daily tasks that DD chose to undertake. Four operations, i.e. formulate a goal, plan, carry out and verify goal attainment, were scored for each task. Difficulties were observed during the execution of all tasks, as she struggled to find items or showed unsafe behaviors. Impairments were also seen in formulating a goal and planning, especially for less routine tasks. DD identified two tasks to be addressed in rehabilitation: setting the table and dealing cards. Learning was optimized using errorless learning and compensatory aids when setting the table, while dealing cards received no intervention. Only setting the table improved significantly with time. Further studies should be conducted to portray a wider functional profile of people living with PCA and develop effective rehabilitation programs.

9	"Evidence of a relation between hippocampal volume,
white matter hyperintensities, and cognition in subjective
cognitive decline and mild cognitive impairment"	Objective: The concepts of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and subjective cognitive decline (SCD) have been proposed to identify individuals in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), or other neurodegenerative diseases. One approach to validate these concepts is to investigate the relationship between pathological brain markers and cognition in those individuals. Method: We included 126 participants from the Consortium for the Early Identification of Alzheimer’s disease-Quebec (CIMA-Q) cohort (67 SCD, 29 MCI, and 30 cognitively healthy controls [CH]). All participants underwent a complete cognitive assessment and structural magnetic resonance imaging. Group comparisons were done using cognitive data, and then correlated with hippocampal volumes and white matter hyperintensities (WMHs). Results: Significant differences were found between participants with MCI and CH on episodic and executive tasks, but no differences were found when comparing SCD and CH. Scores on episodic memory tests correlated with hippocampal volumes in both MCI and SCD, whereas performance on executive tests correlated with WMH in all of our groups. Discussion: As expected, the SCD group was shown to be cognitively healthy on tasks where MCI participants showed impairment. However, SCD’s hippocampal volume related to episodic memory performances, and WMH to executive functions. Thus, SCD represents a valid research concept and should be used, alongside MCI, to better understand the preclinical/prodromal phase of AD.

10	Deformation-based shape analysis of the hippocampus in the semantic variant of primary progressive aphasia and Alzheimer’s disease	Background Increasing evidence shows that the semantic variant of primary progressive aphasia (svPPA) is characterized by hippocampal atrophy. However, less is known about disease-related morphological hippocampal changes. The goal of the present study is to conduct a detailed characterization of the impact of svPPA on global hippocampus volume and morphology compared with control subjects and patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD).  Methods We measured hippocampal volume and deformation-based shape differences in 22 patients with svPPA compared with 99 patients with AD and 92 controls. Multiple Automatically Generated Templates Brain Segmentation Algorithm (MAGeT-Brain) was used on MRI images obtained at the diagnostic visit.  Results Comparable left and right hippocampal atrophy were observed in svPPA and AD. Deformation-based shape analysis showed a common pattern of morphological deformation in svPPA and AD compared with controls. More specifically, both svPPA and AD showed inward deformations in the dorsal surface of the hippocampus, from head to tail on the left side, and more limited to the anterior portion of the body in the right hemisphere. These results also pointed out that both diseases are characterized by a lateral displacement of the central part (body) of the hippocampus.  Discussion Our study provides critical new evidence of hippocampal morphological changes in svPPA, similar to those found in AD. These findings highlight the importance of considering morphological hippocampal changes as part of the anatomical profile of patients with svPPA.

11	"Pathogenic and transmission potential of wildtype and
chicken embryo origin (CEO) vaccine revertant infectious laryngotracheitis virus"	Infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT) is an infectious upper respiratory tract disease that impacts the poultry industry worldwide. ILT is caused by an alphaherpesvirus commonly referred to as infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV). Vaccination with live attenuated vaccines is practiced regularly for the control of ILT. However, extensive and improper use of live attenuated vaccines is related to vaccine viruses reverting to virulence. An increase in mortality and pathogenicity has been attributed to these vaccine revertant viruses. Recent studies characterized Canadian ILTV strains originating from ILT outbreaks as related to live attenuated vaccine virus revertants. However, information is scarce on the pathogenicity and transmission potential of these Canadian isolates. Hence, in this study, the pathogenicity and transmission potential of two wildtype ILTVs and a chicken embryo origin (CEO) vaccine revertant ILTV of Canadian origin were evaluated. To this end, 3-week-old specific pathogen-free chickens were experimentally infected with each of the ILTV isolates and compared to uninfected controls. Additionally, naïve chickens were exposed to the experimentally infected chickens to mimic naturally occurring infection. Pathogenicity of each of these ILTV isolates was evaluated by the severity of clinical signs, weight loss, mortality, and lesions observed at the necropsy. The transmission potential was evaluated by quantification of ILTV genome loads in oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs and tissue samples of the experimentally infected and contact-exposed chickens, as well as in the capacity to produce ILT in contact-exposed chickens. We observed that the CEO vaccine revertant ILTV isolate induced severe disease in comparison to the two wildtype ILTV isolates used in this study. According to ILTV genome load data, CEO vaccine revertant ILTV isolate was successfully transmitted to naïve contact-exposed chickens in comparison to the tested wildtype ILTV isolates. Overall, the Canadian origin CEO vaccine revertant ILTV isolate possesses higher virulence, and dissemination potential, when compared to the wildtype ILTV isolates used in this study. These findings have serious implications in ILT control in chickens.

12	Task-induced functional connectivity of picture naming in healthy aging : the impacts of age and task complexity	The topological organization of the brain, governed by the capacity of brain regions to synchronize their activity, allows for cost-effective performance during everyday cognitive activity. Functional connectivity is an fMRI method deemed task-specific and demand-dependent. Although the brain undergoes significant changes during healthy aging, conceptual knowledge and word-production accuracy are generally preserved. The exploration of task-induced functional connectivity patterns during active picture naming may thus provide additional information about healthy functional cerebral mechanisms that are specifically adapted to the cognitive activity at hand. The goal of this study is to assess and describe age-related differences in functional connectivity during an overt picture-naming task, as well as to compare age-related differences under complex task demand, defined by lexical frequency. Results suggest both age-specific and task-specific mechanisms. In the context of preserved behavioral performance in a picture-naming task, older adults show a complex array of differences in functional connectivity architecture, including both increases and decreases. In brief, there is increased segregation and specialization of regions that are classically assigned to naming processes. Results also expand on previous word-production studies and suggest that motor regions are particularly subject to age-related differences. This study also provides the first indication that intrinsic task demand, as manipulated by lexical frequency, interacts little with the relationship between age and functional connectivity. Together, these findings confirm the value of task-induced functional connectivity analysis in revealing the brain organization that subserves task performance during healthy aging.	fMRI , Functional connectivity , Healthy aging , Picture naming , Language , Task-induced functional connectivity	en	24981.0
13	"Prevalence of Coxiella burnetii seropositivity
and shedding in farm, pet and feral cats and
associated risk factors in farm cats in Quebec,
Canada"	Cats represent a potential source of Coxiella burnetii, the aetiological agent of Q fever in humans. The prevalence and risk factors of C. burnetii infection in farm, pet and feral cats were studied in Quebec, Canada, using a cross-sectional study. Serum samples were tested using a specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the presence of antibodies against C. burnetii, whereas rectal swabs were assayed using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) for the molecular detection of the bacteria. Potential risk factors for farm cats were investigated using clinical examinations, questionnaires and results from a concurrent study on C. burnetii farm status. A total of 184 cats were tested: 59 from ruminant farms, 73 pets and 52 feral cats. Among farm cats, 2/59 (3.4%) were ELISA-positive, 3/59 (5.1%) were ELISA-doubtful and 1/59 (1.7%) was qPCR-positive. All pets and feral cats were negative to C. burnetii ELISA and qPCR. Farm cat positivity was associated with a positive C. burnetii status on the ruminant farm (prevalence ratio = 7.6, P = 0.03). Our results suggest that although pet and feral cats do not seem to pose a great C. burnetii risk to public health, more active care should be taken when in contact with cats from ruminant farms.

14	Gadamer, aesthetics and modernity	J’aborde ici la dimension exemplaire que revêt l’art pour l’herméneutique philosophique de Gadamer. Ce dernier souscrit sans doute à la thèse classiciste de Hegel selon laquelle l’art élève une prétention à la vérité qui a connu sa plus haute expression dans l’antiquité grecque, mais il refuse de concéder à Hegel qu’à l’époque moderne c’est désormais la philosophie qui assume cette prétention de manière privilégiée. Gadamer entend ainsi surmonter la perte de sens que connaît l’art à l’époque moderne, et il s’oppose à l’herméneutique romantique de Schleiermacher précisément pour cette raison. À l’encontre du diagnostic de Gadamer portant sur la subjectivisation de l’expérience artistique aux Temps Modernes, je fais intervenir W. Benjamin et sa compréhension du rôle constitutif de la « critique » dans l’art romantique pour faire contraste avec le modèle gadamérien d’accès à l’œuvre comme participation à un avènement de sens.

15	Gadamer, aesthetics and modernity	In this article I examine the exemplary role played by art in Gadamer’s philosophical hermeneutics. To be sure Gadamer agrees with Hegel and his classicist view according to which art contains a claim to truth that has reached its highest expression in Greek antiquity, but he refuses to admit that in the modern era it is henceforth philosophy that presents this truth in a privileged manner. Gadamer wishes thereby to counter the loss of meaning afflicting art in the modern era, and he stigmatizes Schleiermacher’s romantic hermeneutics precisely for that reason. Against Gadamer’s diagnosis of the subjectivisation of artistic experience in the modern times, I introduce W. Benjamin and his understanding of the intrinsic function of “critique” in romantic art in order to show the contrast with Gadamer’s model of access to the artwork as a participation in an event of meaning.

16	Cybervictimization in adolescence and its association with subsequent suicidal ideation/attempt beyond face‐to‐face victimization : a longitudinal population‐based study	Background Cross‐sectional associations have been documented between cybervictimization and suicidal risk; however, prospective associations remain unclear.  Methods Participants were members of the Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child Development (QLSCD), a prospective birth cohort of 2,120 individuals followed from birth (1997/98) to age 17 years (2014/15). Cybervictimization and face‐to‐face victimization experienced since the beginning of the school year, as well as serious suicidal ideation and/or suicide attempt were self‐reported at ages 13, 15 and 17 years.  Results In cross‐sectional analyses at 13, 15 and 17 years, adolescents cybervictimized at least once had, respectively, 2.3 (95% CI = 1.64–3.19), 4.2 (95% CI = 3.27–5.41) and 3.5 (95% CI = 2.57–4.66) higher odds of suicidal ideation/attempt after adjusting for confounders including face‐to‐face victimization, prior mental health symptoms and family hardship. Sensitivity analyses suggested that cybervictimization only and both cyber‐ and face‐to‐face victimization were associated with a higher risk of suicidal ideation/attempt compared to face‐to‐face victimization only and no victimization; however, analyses were based on small n. In prospective analyses, cybervictimization was not associated with suicidal ideation/attempt 2 years later after accounting for baseline suicidal ideation/attempt and other confounders. In contrast, face‐to‐face victimization was associated with suicidal ideation/attempt 2 years later in the fully adjusted model, including cybervictimization.  Conclusions The cross‐sectional association between cybervictimization and suicidal ideation/attempt is independent from face‐to‐face victimization. The absence of a prospective association suggested short‐term effects of cybervictimization on suicidal ideation/attempt.

17	Associations between developmental trajectories of peer victimization, hair cortisol, and depressive symptoms : a longitudinal study	Background Peer victimization has been associated with long‐lasting risks for mental health. Prior research suggests that stress‐related systems underlying adaptation to changing environments may be at play. To date, inconsistent findings have been reported for the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis, and its end product cortisol. This study tested whether peer victimization was associated with hair cortisol concentrations (HCC), and whether this association varied according to sex, timing, and changes in exposure. We also examined whether peer victimization differentially predicted depressive symptoms according to HCC.  Methods The sample comprised 556 adolescents (42.0%; 231 males) who provided hair for cortisol measurement at 17 years of age. Peer victimization was reported at seven occasions between the ages of 6 and 15 years.  Results Peer victimization was nonlinearly associated with HCC for boys only, whereas changes in peer victimization were related to HCC for boys and girls. Peer victimization predicted more depressive symptoms for all participants, except those with lower HCC.  Conclusions Our findings provide further support for persistent dysregulation of the HPA axis following exposure to chronic adversity, of which the expression may change according to sex and the severity of victimization.

18	A comparative tale of two methods : how thematic and narrative analyses author the data story differently	An interpretive qualitative approach insists on the plural and negotiated nature of the meanings that humans attach to their social realities. Thus, the qualitative researcher must navigate multiple and sometimes conflicting commitments to method, data, oneself, participants, and one’s reader. This can lead us to obscure the messiness of data analysis in final research reports and to downplay how methodological choices can make our participants ‘say things.’ In this article, we compare two interpretive methods, thematic and narrative analysis, including their shared epistemological and ontological premises, and offer a pedagogical demonstration of their application to the same data excerpt. However, our broader goal is to use the divergent results to critically examine how our choice of analytic method in interpretive research influences how we (researcher + method) ‘author’ data stories. Ultimately, researcher reflexivity must go beyond acknowledging how one’s position may influence the data analysis or the participant.

19	Cannabis use, depression and suicidal ideation in adolescence : direction of associations in a population based cohort	Background To clarify the direction of the association between frequency of cannabis use, depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation from 15 to 20 years using cross-lagged analyses.  Method We included 1606 adolescents from the province of Québec followed since 1997 with information on frequency of cannabis use (none/monthly/weekly), depression (defined as being in the top 10% symptoms) and serious suicidal ideation at ages 15, 17 and 20 years.  Results The prevalence of weekly cannabis use increased from 7.0% at age 15 years to 15.6% by age 20 years. Adolescents who reported using cannabis weekly at one age were 11 to 15 times more likely to continue using cannabis over time. In longitudinal cross-lagged analyses, weekly cannabis use at age 15 was associated with greater odds (OR=2.19, 95% CI=1.04-4.58) of suicidal ideation two years later. However, other substance use (alcohol, tobacco, other drugs) fully explained this association. Further, depression predicted subsequent weekly cannabis use, even after adjusting for comorbid other substance use (eg, for depression at 15 years predicting cannabis use at 17 years: OR=2.30, 95% CI=1.19-4.43).  Limitations Quantity of cannabis consumed was not measured.  Conclusion Findings suggest that depressive symptoms in adolescence may represent a risk factor for weekly cannabis consumption, which once initiated is likely to remain chronic. Weekly cannabis use increased risk for suicidal ideation, but not independently from other substance use including alcohol, tobacco and other drugs.

20	Contribution of genes and environment to the longitudinal association between childhood impulsive‐aggression and suicidality in adolescence	Background Population‐based and family studies showed that impulsive‐aggression predicts suicidality; however, the underlying etiological nature of this association is poorly understood. The objective was to determine the contribution of genes and environment to the association between childhood impulsive‐aggression and serious suicidal ideation/attempt in young adulthood.  Methods N = 862 twins (435 families) from the Quebec Newborn Twin Study were followed up from birth to 20 years. Repeated measures of teacher‐assessed impulsive‐aggression were modeled using a genetically informed latent growth model including intercept and slope parameters reflecting individual differences in the baseline level (age 6 years) and in the change (increase/decrease) of impulsive‐aggression during childhood (6 to 12 years), respectively. Lifetime suicidality (serious suicidal ideation/attempt) was self‐reported at 20 years. Associations of impulsive‐aggression intercept and slope with suicidality were decomposed into additive genetic (A) and unique environmental (E) components.  Results Additive genetic factors accounted for an important part of individual differences in impulsive‐aggression intercept (A = 90%, E = 10%) and slope (A = 65%, E = 35%). Genetic (50%) and unique environmental (50%) factors equally contributed to suicidality. We found that 38% of the genetic factors accounting for suicidality were shared with those underlying impulsive‐aggression slope, whereas 40% of the environmental factors accounting for suicidality were shared with those associated with impulsive‐aggression intercept. The genetic correlation between impulsive‐aggression slope and suicidality was 0.60, p = .027.  Conclusions Genetic and unique environmental factors underlying suicidality significantly overlap with those underlying childhood impulsive‐aggression. Future studies should identify putative genetic and environmental factors to inform prevention.

21	Associations between peer victimization and suicidal ideation and suicide attempt during adolescence : results from a prospective population-based birth cohort	Objective:To test whether adolescents who are victim-ized by peers are at heightened risk for suicidal ideationand  suicide  attempt,  using  both  cross-sectional  andprospective investigations.Method:Participants are from the Quebec LongitudinalStudy of Child Development, a general population sampleof children born in Quebec in 1997 through 1998 andfollowed up until 15 years of age. Information aboutvictimization and serious suicidal ideation and suicideattempt in the past year was obtained at ages 13 and15 years from self-reports (N¼1,168).Results:Victims reported concurrently higher rates ofsuicidal ideation at age 13 years (11.6–14.7%) and suicideattempt at age 15 years (5.4–6.8%) compared to those whohad not been victimized (2.7–4.1% for suicidal ideationand 1.6–1.9% for suicide attempt). Being victimized bypeers at 13 years predicted suicidal ideation (odds ratio[OR]¼2.27;  95%  CI¼1.25–4.12)  and  suicideattempt (OR¼3.05, 95% CI¼1.36–6.82) 2 years later,even  after  adjusting  for  baseline  suicidality  andmental health problems and a series of confounders(socioeconomic status, intelligence, family’s functioningand structure, hostile-reactive parenting, maternal lifetimesuicidal  ideation/suicide  attempt).  Those  who  werevictimized at both 13 and 15 years had the highest risk ofsuicidal ideation (OR¼5.41, 95% CI¼2.53–11.53) andsuicide attempt (OR¼5.85, 95% CI¼2.12–16.18) at15 years.Conclusion:Victimization is associated with an increasedrisk of suicidal ideation and suicide attempt over andabove concurrent suicidality and prior mental healthproblems. The longer the history of victimization, thegreater the risk.	Suicidal ideation , Suicide attempt , Adolescence , Peer victimization , Bullying	en	24961.0
22	Newborn screening for congenital hypothyroidism and congenital adrenal hyperplasia : the balance of benefits and costs of a public health success	Newborn screening is an important public health program and a triumph of preventive medicine. Economic analyses show that the benefits of newborn screening clearly outweigh the  costs for certain diseases but not necessarily for other ones. This is due to the great diversity of the  natural history of the diseases detected, to the fact that each of these diseases considered  individually is rare, and to differences in the effectiveness of interventions. In addition, the benefit cost ratio of screening for a particular disorder may differ between countries, specifically between high-income and low- and middle-income countries. The burden of a disorder may also be alleviated by increased clinical awareness and effective clinical services, even in the absence of newborn screening. In this article, the authors focus on economic analyses of newborn screening  for primary congenital hypothyroidism, which has been in place in high-income countries for  roughly 40 years, and for classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency. Screening for the latter is not yet universal, even in high-income countries, although the lack of universal implementation may reflect factors other than economic considerations.		en	24960.0

Nous rapportons une nouvelle façon d’augmenter la diversité polymorphique basée sur la cristallisation induite par l’ensemencement à l’aide de cristaux mixtes. Nous rapportons également une nouvelle stratégie de cristallisation de composés fondus suspendus qui permet d’induire la formation de cristaux uniques qui sont trop instables pour être produits par des méthodes traditionnelles. Cette stratégie permet la résolution par diffraction des rayons X d’une plus large variété de structures cristallines. L’efficacité des méthodes présentées ci-dessus a été démontrée en les utilisant pour produire des cristaux uniques caractérisés par diffraction des rayons X de nouveaux polymorphes du composé ROY, une référence en matière de polymorphisme. Cela permet à ROY de regagner sa part de la position de composé le plus polymorphique dans la Cambridge Structural Database (CSD).

25	La nucléation à partir de cristaux mixtes : une nouvelle approche pour augmenter la diversité polymorphique	Chemical compounds that exist in multiple crystalline forms are said to exhibit polymorphism. Polymorphs have the same composition, but their structures and properties can vary markedly. In many fields, conditions for crystallizing compounds of interest are screened exhaustively to generate as many polymorphs as possible, from which the most advantageous form for the desired application can be selected. Here we report a new way to increase polymorphic diversity, based on crystallization induced by suitably designed mixed-crystal seeds. Also reported herein is a new strategy of suspended-melt crystallization, which can be used to induce the formation of single crystals that are too unstable to be produced by traditional methods. This strategy allows for a broader scope of crystalline structures to be resolved by X-ray diffraction. The efficacy of the above methods has been demonstrated by using them to produce new polymorphs of the benchmark compound ROY as single crystals structurally characterized by X-ray diffraction. This allows ROY to reclaim a share of the crown as the most polymorphic compound in the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD).

26	Prospective randomized clinical trial evaluating the effects of two different implant collar designs on peri‐implant healing and functional osseointegration after 25 years	Objectives Evaluate the effects of two different machined‐collar lengths and designs on peri‐implant healing.  Material and Methods An implant with a microtextured surface and 3.6mm‐long internal‐connection machined collar was compared to two implants that had an identical 1.2mm‐long external‐connection machined collar, but one had the microtextured surface while the other's was machined. Participants received the three implants, with microgap at the crest, alternately at five sites between mental foramen, and a full‐arch prosthesis. Peri‐implant bone levels were measured after 23 to 26 years of function. Keratinized tissue height, plaque, probing depth, bleeding, and purulence were also evaluated. Descriptive and mixed models for repeated\measures analyses were used, with Bonferroni correction for pairwise comparisons.  Results Twenty‐two participants (110 implants) were evaluated at the 25‐year examination. Microtextured implants with the longer machined collar had significantly greater mean marginal bone loss (−1.77mm ± 0.18, mean ± SE) than machined (−0.85mm ± 0.18, p < .001) and microtextured (−1.00 ± 0.18mm, p < .001) implants with the shorter machined collar. Keratinized tissue height was greater for internal‐connection (0.74mm ± 0.10) versus external‐connection (0.51 ± 0.08, p =  0.01) microtextured implants. No differences were observed for plaque (p = 0.78), probing depth (p = 0.42), bleeding (p  = 0.07), and purulence (p = 1.00). Implant survival rate was 99%.  Conclusions Implants with the 1.2mm machined collar limited bone loss to 1mm, while those with the longer machined collar showed > 1.5mm loss after 25 years of function with microgap at the crest. Internal‐connection design and fixture surface microtexturing did not result in greater bone preservation.

28	Inclusion of relatives in stroke rehabilitation : Perception of quality of services they received in the context of early supported discharged (ESD), in- and out-patient services	Background Relatives of stroke patients should be an integral part of the continuum of rehabilitation services.  Objective The objective was to describe their perception of the quality of the services they received in the context of early supported discharged (ESD), in- and out-patient rehabilitation services.  Methods Descriptive study using the Quality of Services Questionnaire for Relatives post-stroke (QSQR) completed online by relatives after the patient’s discharge. It consists of 22 statements with respect to three subscales: 1) the training/instructions, 2) the information provision and 3) the organizational process of the service offer. Space is allowed for free comments and two open-ended questions. Quantitative data were analyzed descriptively, and we used a content analysis for qualitative data.  Results One-third (30/90; 33.3%) of the sample are composed of relatives aged 55 and under, with a majority (81%) of women and 51.3% of spouses. The training/instructions and information provision were perceived positively with a mean % agreement at 85.0 ± 29.6 and 84.8 ± 22.4, respectively. The mean % agreement was 91.4 ± 17.8 for the organizational process subscale. A significantly higher score (p = 0,03; Kruskal Wallis test) was found for out-patient services (n = 20) as compared to ESD (n = 29) or in-patient rehabilitation (n = 41). Qualitatively, a lack of involvement of relatives was mentioned as well as a lack of personalized information about stroke and its consequences and provision of resources available. However, communication between professionals, their availability, and their professionalism were appreciated.  Conclusion Despite quantitative high scores, qualitative data allowed the identification of concrete avenues for improvement to truly and systematically include relatives in stroke rehabilitation.

29	"Effects of dopamine receptor antagonism and
amphetamine-induced psychomotor sensitization on
sign- and goal-tracking after extended training"	The dopamine system is important for incentive salience attribution, where motivational value is assigned to conditioned cues that predict appetitive reinforcers. However, the role of dopamine in this process may change with extended training. We tested the effects of dopamine D1-like and D2-like receptor antagonism on the expression of sign-tracking and goal-tracking conditioned responses following extended Pavlovian conditioned approach (PCA) training. We also tested if amphetamine-induced psychomotor sensitization accelerates the enhanced acquisition of sign-tracking that is observed with extended training. In experiment 1, 24 male Long-Evans rats received 20 PCA sessions in which one lever (CS+, 10 s) predicted 0.2 ml sucrose (10 %, w/v) delivery and the other lever (CS–) did not. SCH-23390 (D1-like antagonist) or eticlopride (D2-like antagonist) were administered before non-reinforced behavioural tests at doses of 0, 0.01, and 0.1 mg/kg (s.c.). In experiment 2, rats received vehicle or 2 mg/kg amphetamine (i.p.) for 7 days (n = 12/group). Ten days later, they received 16 PCA training sessions. Both doses of SCH-23390 reduced sign- and goal-tracking, but also reduced locomotor behaviour. A low dose of eticlopride (0.01 mg/kg) selectively reduced goal-tracking, without affecting sign-tracking or locomotor behaviour. Amphetamine produced psychomotor sensitization, and this did not affect the acquisition of sign- or goal-tracking. Following extended PCA training, dopamine D2-like receptor activity is required for the expression of goal-tracking but not sign-tracking. Psychomotor sensitization to amphetamine did not impact incentive salience attribution; however, more selective manipulations of the dopamine system may be needed.

30	Enhancing relationships between criminology and cybersecurity	‘Cybercrime’ is an umbrella concept used by criminologists to refer to traditional crimes that are enhanced via the use of networked technologies (i.e. cyber-enabled crimes) and newer forms of crime that would not exist without networked technologies (i.e. cyber-dependent crimes). Cybersecurity is similarly a very broad concept and diverse field of practice. For computer scientists, the term ‘cybersecurity’ typically refers to policies, processes and practices undertaken to protect data, networks and systems from unauthorised access. Cybersecurity is used in subnational, national and transnational contexts to capture an increasingly diverse array of threats. Increasingly, cybercrimes are presented as threats to cybersecurity, which explains why national security institutions are gradually becoming involved in cybercrime control and prevention activities. This paper argues that the fields of cyber-criminology and cybersecurity, which are segregated at the moment, are in much need of greater engagement and cross-fertilisation. We draw on concepts of ‘high’ and ‘low’ policing (Brodeur, 2010) to suggest it would be useful to consider ‘crime’ and ‘security’ on the same continuum. This continuum has cybercrime at one end and cybersecurity at the other, with crime being more the domain of ‘low’ policing while security, as conceptualised in the context of specific cybersecurity projects, falls under the responsibility of ‘high’ policing institutions. This unifying approach helps us to explore the fuzzy relationship between cyber-crime and cyber-security and to call for more fruitful alliances between cybercrime and cybersecurity researchers.

31	Child migration in the US and Spain : towards a global border regime ?	In The New Politics of Immigration, Professor Catherine Dauvergne proposes that as migration policies converge at the global level the traditional difference between settler societies and former European colonies is becoming irrelevant. To test this argument, this paper addresses the impact of externalization, militarization, detention and deportation on unaccompanied migrant children along the southern Spanish and US borders. I conclude that the combined used of these strategies is designed to keep all unwanted migrants away from the physical border of the state regardless of their background and prevents children from accessing specific protections. Current border policy in these two countries shows the primacy of national security concerns over human rights and supports Dauvergne’s argument that distinctions between former colonies and settler societies are disappearing. The evidence considered here points towards an increasingly restrictive and punitive global border regime, but one with regional variations.		en	24950.0
32	A longitudinal study of narrative discourse in post-stroke aphasia	Background: Previous findings have demonstrated the importance of discourse analysis in post-stroke aphasia, as it allows for in-depth examination of language impairment and represents key components of functional communication. However, little is known about the recovery of discourse over time. Aims: The main aim of this study is to measure the longitudinal changes in descriptive discourse production from the acute to chronic stages of post-stroke aphasia recovery. The secondary aim is to explore the association between discourse measures and overall language impairment severity measures at different testing points. Methods & Procedure: Seventeen French Canadian speakers with various types and severities of aphasia following a first left middle cerebral artery stroke participated in this study. They underwent three language assessments (acute: 0 to 72 hours; subacute: 7 to 14 days; chronic: 6 to 12 months post-onset). The picture description from the Western Aphasia Battery was analyzed at three time points. Changes in terms of thematic informativeness and microstructural variables were analyzed. Outcomes & Results: Regarding the micro-structural variables, the mean length of utterances (MLU) and the number of words per minute showed significant positive changes between the acute and chronic phases. For the thematic informativeness measures, the number of thematic units (TUs), the number of thematic units per minute (TUs/min) and the number of thematic units per utterance (TUs/utt) 4 increased significantly between the acute and chronic phases. Positive correlations between TUs and MLU in the acute phase and a general language impairment severity measure in the acute and chronic phases suggest a relationship between these measures and global language performance suggesting the potential predictive value of these variables in the acute phase. Conclusions & Implications: These findings support the use of thematic units in descriptive discourse analysis during an acute clinical examination of language as they require minimal additional time to score and track changes in post-stroke aphasia recovery. They capture long-term changes in discourse abilities and appear related to overall language measures in both the acute and chronic stages of recovery. The interpretation of the changes in MLU and the number of words per minute is less straightforward, as improvements in these measures carry different interpretations depending on the type of aphasia. Nonetheless, further studies are required to investigate test-retest reliability and the effect of therapy on the changes observed over time when using thematic units to document change in discourse.

34	Atlas and Hercules in the garden : scientific culture and literary imagination at the Villa Aldobrandini at Frascati	This essay explores the interplay in early modern Roman gardens between the iconography of instruments and fountains and scientific culture, especially astronomy. Examining the sundials that adorned the garden at the Villa Aldobrandini at Frascati, it suggests a new reading of the garden and its iconographic programme, centred on the iconography of Atlas and Hercules holding the celestial sphere. It stresses the importance of scientific culture for both the conception and the subsequent reception of the programme. Several themes are developed: the relevance of wonder and curiosity in the process of understanding nature, the multiple links between nature and artefacts in the space of the garden, and the scientific interests of the patron, Cardinal Pietro Aldobrandini, and his main adviser, the letterato Giovanni Battista Agucchi.

35	Effects of a parent training programme for the treatment of young children with separation anxiety disorder	Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has been shown to be an effective treatment for anxiety disorders in children. However, the majority of studies conducted to date have included heterogeneous samples of children combining social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and separation anxiety disorder (SAD) together. Few studies have examined the efficacy of CBT to specifically treat SAD. Moreover, research on the impact of CBT for SAD in children younger than 7 years old has been very limited. To address these issues, we examined the effects of a CBT parent training programme with six children with SAD aged between 4 and 7 years using a non-concurrent multiple baseline design. Parents completed semi-structured interviews, questionnaires and daily diaries to assess their child’s anxiety symptoms, parental practices and parental stress. Results indicated that five of six children no longer met the criteria for SAD diagnosis after treatment and at 3-month follow-up. Moreover, the daily diaries showed that four of six children presented a systematic favourable change of the total weekly frequency of SAD symptoms. Finally, four mothers reported a decrease in overprotection, but we observed no changes in parental stress.

36	Comprehension of concrete and abstract words in patients with selective anterior temporal lobe resection and in patients with selective amygdalo-hippocampectomy	The role of the anterior temporal lobe (ATL) in semantic memory is now firmly established. There is still controversy, however, regarding the specific role of this region in processing various types of concepts. There have been reports of patients suffering from semantic dementia (SD), a neurodegenerative condition in which the ATL are damaged bilaterally, who present with greater semantic impairment for concrete concepts than for abstract concepts, an effect known as reversal of the concreteness effect. This effect has previously been interpreted as reflecting degraded visual-perceptual features of objects due to damage to the inferior temporal lobes such as is observed in SD. Temporal lobe atrophy in SD, however, is bilateral even if it usually predominates to the left ATL, and it has been found to extend beyond the ATL, throughout the temporal lobes including medial and posterior temporal lobe regions. The question therefore remains whether greater impairment for concrete concepts results from damage to the ATL or from damage to the visual association cortex, and if unilateral damage can produce such a deficit. The aim of the present study was to investigate the processing of concrete and abstract words in rare patients who underwent a selective ATL surgical resection, and to compare their performance with that of patients with selective medial temporal lobe damage sparing the ATL region. Seven patients with a selective unilateral anterior temporal resection (ATL), 15 patients with a selective unilateral amygdalo-hippocampectomy (SeAH), and 15 healthy ageand education-matched controls underwent detailed neuropsychological assessment and carried out a semantic similarity judgement task evaluating their comprehension of concrete and abstract words. Results showed that both ATL and SeAH groups were significantly impaired on the semantic task relative to the control group. Within the patient groups, however, comprehension of concrete words was significantly more impaired than that of abstract words in the ATL group, while comprehension of abstract and concrete words was equally affected in the SeAH group. Results of this study suggest that the ATL region may play a critical role in processing concrete concepts, and that the reversal of the concreteness effect observed in ATL patients may result from damage to a categorical organization underlying the representation of concrete concepts.

37	Enhancing the effectiveness of cybercrime prevention through policy monitoring	This article examines the feasibility of designing and implementing a cybercrime prevention monitoring approach to enhance the quality of knowledge about policies that aim to reduce the prevalence and impact of online harms. Despite very significant investments made by governments over the past decade to improve the cybersecurity of publicly and privately-operated computer systems, there is very limited systematic knowledge about what cybercrime prevention policies have been adopted in various parts of the world and even less knowledge about their effectiveness in reducing the exposure of individuals and organizations to cybercrime. Borrowing from the policy monitoring (or policy surveillance) methodology that was developed in a broad range of fields such as public health and education, this article argues that such an approach would be critical in advancing our understanding of what is being done to control cybercrime, what works, what doesn’t, and what is promising. This article provides an overview of the principles and benefits of the policy monitoring approach, reviews the main features of a sample of 18 policy monitoring platforms, assesses a dozen cybersecurity policy rating initiatives—concluding that very few of them include cybercrime in their framework, then provides a template for the creation of a dedicated cybercrime prevention monitoring tool that would benefit academics, policy-makers and practitioners.

38	Assessment of library liaison programs	Session Format: Lighting talks by three librarians interspersed with facilitated small group breakout activities and discussion. Objective: This session aims to further the conversation about the evolving nature of liaison roles and duties. Through activities, attendees will explore differences in liaison roles and examine the evolution of the liaison librarian in health sciences libraries. Facilitated activities provide an opportunity to brainstorm and discuss what’s next for the role of the liaison librarian. Attendees will share information about ways to assess liaison duties and gain insights that further develop their familiarity with functional support models and other methods to support library users.Instructional  Methods: Lightning talks will present background information on three topics relevant to liaison models. The attendees will further explore these topics through inquiry-based learning activities. Using a participant-centered teaching approach, attendees will work collaboratively with information related to the lightning talk topic, summarize and categorize this information, arrive at questions based on their own experience that further elucidate the content, and then synthesize group findings by sharing back finding with all participants. Facilitators will float among the tables to provide guidance on all activities. Participant Engagement: Participants will be asked to respond to lightning talks through a combination of facilitated small group activities and discussion based on Liberating Structures activity plans. During the activities and discussion, participants will record notes and takeaways into a shared online document that will combine across all groups and will be shared with participants and broader MLA membership after the conference as a follow-up.

39	Highly active, entirely biobased antimicrobial Pickering emulsions	We present the development of surfactant‐free, silica‐free and fully biobased oil‐in‐water antimicrobial Pickering emulsions, based on the self‐assembly of b ‐cyclodextrin and phytoantimicrobial oils (terpinen‐4‐ol or carvacrol). Undecylenic acid (UA), derived from castor oil, can be used as bio‐based drug to treat fungal infection, but is less effective than petroleum‐based drugs as azole derivatives. To maximize its antifungal potential, we have incorporated UA in fully biobased Pickering emulsions. These emulsions are effective against fungi, Gram‐positive and Gram‐negative bacteria. The carvacrol emulsion charged with UA is +390 % and +165 % more potent against methicillin‐resistant S. aureus (MRSA), compared to UA and azole‐based commercial formulations. Moreover, this emulsion is up to +480 % more efficient that UA ointment against C. albicans . Finally, remarkable eradication of E. coli and MRSA biofilms was obtained with this environmental‐friendly emulsion.	Biobased formulation , Pickering emulsion , Antimicrobial , Antibiofilm	en	24938.0
40	"Communicating science in the digital and social media ecosystem : scoping review and typology of strategies used by
health scientists"	Background: The public's understanding of science can be influential in a wide range of areas related to public health, including policy making and self-care. Through the digital and social media ecosystem, health scientists play a growing role in public science communication (SC).  Objective: This review aimed to (1) synthesize the literature on SC initiated by health scientists targeting the public in the digital and social media ecosystem and (2) describe the SC strategies and communication channels used.  Methods: This scoping review was based on the Joanna Briggs Institute Methodological Framework. A systematic search was performed in 6 databases (January 2000 to April 2018). Title and abstract screening, full-text review, data charting, and critical appraisal were performed independently by two review authors. Data regarding included studies and communication channels were synthesized descriptively. A typology of SC strategies was developed using a qualitative and inductive method of data synthesis.  Results: Among 960 unique publications identified, 18 met inclusion criteria. A third of publications scored good quality (6/18, 33%), half scored moderate quality (9/18, 50%), and less than a fifth scored low quality (3/18, 16%). Overall, 75 SC strategies used by health scientists were identified. These were grouped into 9 types: content, credibility, engagement, intention, linguistics, planification, presentation, social exchange, and statistics. A total of 5 types of communication channels were identified: social networking platforms (eg, Twitter), content-sharing platforms (eg, YouTube), digital research communities (eg, ResearchGate), personal blogs and websites (eg, WordPress), and social news aggregation and discussion platforms (eg, Reddit).  Conclusions: Evidence suggests that multiple types of SC strategies and communication channels are used by health scientists concurrently. Few empirical studies have been conducted on SC by health scientists in the digital and social media ecosystem. Future studies should examine the appropriateness and effectiveness of SC strategies for improving public health-related outcomes and identify the barriers, facilitators, and ethical considerations inherent to the involvement of health scientists in the digital and social media ecosystem.

41	Children with persistent versus transient early language delay : language, academic, and psychosocial outcomes in elementary school	Purpose: The objective of this study was to compare children with persistent versus transient preschool language delay on language, academic, and psychosocial outcomes in elementary school. Method: Children with persistent language delay (n = 30), transient language delay (n = 29), and no language delay (controls; n = 163) were identified from a population-based sample of twins. They were compared on language skills, academic achievement, and psychosocial adjustment in kindergarten and Grades 1, 3, 4, and 6. Results: Children with persistent language delay continued to show language difficulties throughout elementary school. Furthermore, they had academic difficulties, in numeracy, and psychosocial difficulties (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder behaviors, externalizing behaviors, peer difficulties) from Grade 1 to Grade 6. Children with transient language delay did not differ from controls on language and academic performance. However, they showed more externalizing behaviors in kindergarten and peer difficulties in Grade 1 than controls. Conclusion: Difficulties at school age are widespread and enduring in those with persistent early language delay but appear specific to psychosocial adjustment in those with transient language delay.		en	24934.0
42	Au-delà de l’utilitarisme, vers une refondation des modèles de compétences informationnelles	Depuis une quarantaine d’années, l’extraordinaire bond technologique, médiatique et informationnel a bouleversé le rapport des individus aux objets de communication. Pour y faire face, plusieurs institutions du monde anglo-saxon ont appréhendé le sujet comme une nouvelle littératie à enseigner à l’usager·ère, particulièrement en termes d’habiletés. Depuis les années 1990, la recherche francophone a toutefois vu se développer le concept de culture informationnelle qui amène à interroger davantage le rapport individuel et collectif vis-à-vis de l’information. Quoique ces deux traditions conceptuelles mettent l’accent sur des enjeux différents, l’interdépendance des questions soulevées semble prise en compte dans de nouvelles modélisations. Au premier chef, la translittératie et, surtout, la métalittératie peuvent se présenter comme la pierre angulaire d’une refondation des compétences sur des bases qui fédéreraient les littératie et culture informationnelles.		fr	24933.0
43	Évaluation de la condition physique et mentale de l’aîné : développement et mise à l’essai d’une intervention de pratique réflexive	Les personnes âgées en centre d'hébergement et de soins de longue durée (CHSLD), en raison de leur état de santé souvent précaire, nécessitent un suivi clinique qui passe, entre autres, par l’évaluation de leur condition physique et mentale. Pourtant, plusieurs études démontrent que les infirmières n’évaluent pas suffisamment l'état de santé des personnes à leur charge. Parmi les stratégies identifiées dans les écrits pour renforcer l’évaluation de la condition physique et mentale effectuée par l’infirmière, la pratique réflexive (PR) a été retenue, car elle favorise le développement et l’amélioration des compétences professionnelles de l’infirmière qui œuvre auprès des aînés (Dubé et Ducharme, 2014a). Basée sur une combinaison du Modèle de réflexion structurée de Johns (2006) et sur la Méthode de réflexion de Goudreau, Pepin et Lavoie (2013), une intervention de PR a été développée et mise à l’essai, auprès d’un groupe d’infirmières en CHSLD. Cinq infirmières ont ainsi partagé une situation clinique vécue, en lien avec l’évaluation physique et mentale d’un résident, qu’elles ont trouvée difficile ou problématique. Par la suite, des interventions reconnues en lien avec le sujet présenté ont été discutées. De plus, chaque participante a bénéficié d’un accompagnement clinique dans l’unité de soins, sur un sujet d’évaluation physique ou mentale de son choix. Les infirmières ont apprécié avoir pu discuter de cas réels et se disent plus outillées pour faire face aux situations complexes de soins. D’ailleurs, elles recommanderaient les rencontres de PR à leurs collègues, suggérant ainsi le maintien de ces rencontres dans leur établissement.

44	Évaluation de la condition physique et mentale de l’aîné : développement et mise à l’essai d’une intervention de pratique réflexive	Seniors in residential and long-term care, due to their often precarious state of health, require clinical follow-up, which includes assessing their physical and mental condition. Yet, several studies show that nurses do not adequately assess the health-status of their dependents. Among the strategies identified in the literature to strengthen the assessment of physical and mental condition, reflective practice (RP) stood out. It promotes the development and enhancement of the professional competency of nurses who work with elders (Dubé et Ducharme, 2014a). Based on a combination of Johns' Structured Reflection Model (Johns, 2006) and Goudreau et al. (2013) Reflection Method, a RP intervention was developed and tested with a group of nurses in long term care. Five nurses each shared a difficult or problematic clinical situation experienced in connection with physical and mental assessment. Subsequently, best practices’ interventions in relation to the topic presented were discussed. In addition, each participant benefited from clinical support on her care unit, with her choice of subject of physical or mental evaluation. The nurses appreciated being able to discuss real cases and felt they were better equipped to deal with complex care situations. Moreover, they would recommend meetings of RPs to their colleagues, thus suggesting the maintenance of these meetings in their institution.

45	Identité et bien-être des adultes latino-américains en couple immigrants au Canada	Lors de l’immigration, les individus sont appelés à entrer en contact avec la nouvelle société et le rapport entre l’identité de la culture d’origine et celle de la culture d’accueil serait déterminant pour le bien-être de l’individu. Développer une cohérence entre les deux cultures, c’est-à-dire leur accorder une importance égale, est associé à un bien-être élevé. Cependant, malgré l’importance du phénomène de l’intégration identitaire, les recherches portant sur ce sujet l’ont considéré exclusivement comme étant une conséquence de la relation entre l’individu et la culture, sans jamais prendre en compte que les individus immigrent souvent en couple. La présente recherche visait à évaluer la relation entre l'intégration des identités culturelles, l'intégration de l'identité du partenaire dans le soi et le bien-être chez 239 individus latino-américains dans une relation de couple et ayant immigré au Canada. Plus particulièrement, cette recherche visait à déterminer si l’intégration de l’identité du partenaire dans le soi peut avoir un impact sur le bien-être des individus en couple lorsque ceux-ci intègrent leurs identités culturelles. Les données obtenues avec deux échelles différentes d’intégration identitaire (MULTIIS et IOS) ont révélé que plus un individu intègre ses identités culturelles, plus il intégrera l’identité de son partenaire dans le soi, ce qui l’amènera à ressentir plus de bien-être.

46	Identité et bien-être des adultes latino-américains en couple immigrants au Canada	During immigration, individuals are asked to come into contact with the new society and the relationship between the identity of the culture of origin and that of the host culture would be decisive for the well-being of the individual. Developing coherence between the two cultures, i.e. giving them equal importance, is associated with high well-being. However, despite the importance of the phenomenon of identity integration, research on this subject has considered it exclusively as a consequence of the relationship between the individual and the culture, without ever taking into account that individuals often immigrate as a couple. The present research aimed to assess the relationship between the integration of cultural identities, the integration of the identity of the partner in the self and well-being among 239 Latin American individuals in a couple relationship and who have immigrated to Canada. More specifically, this research aimed to determine whether the integration of the identity of the partner into the self can have an impact on the well-being of individuals in a couple when they integrate their cultural identities. The data obtained with two different scales of identity integration (MULTIIS and IOS) revealed that the more an individual integrates their cultural identities, the more they will integrate the identity of their partner in the self, which will lead them to feel more well-being. More specifically, this study demonstrated that the integration of cultural identities promotes the integration of the partner's identity into the self which, in turn, will have a positive impact on well-being.

48	Debriefing approaches for high-fidelity simulations and outcomes related to clinical judgment in baccalaureate nursing students	Simulation followed by debriefing is increasingly common in clinical nursing education. Yet, limited studies have compared approaches to debriefing—the portion of simulations where participants re-examine and make sense of their experience. In this study, 120 baccalaureate nursing students in Quebec were randomized to receive one of two types of debriefing (selfassessment with Plus-Delta vs. guided reflection using a structured tool with REsPoND) after each of four simulations (a hemorrhage scenario, two sepsis scenarios, and a trauma simulation) during which their situation awareness was measured as a proxy for their clinical judgment. Unexpectedly, situation awareness scores showed little to no consistency across students or simulations and no clear improvements over time were noted, which rendered the comparison of the debriefing approaches across scenarios problematic. However, when comparing the two iterations of the sepsis scenario, students who participated in a reflective debriefing showed greater improvement in their recognition of abnormalities in patient vital signs and level of consciousness than students whose debriefing involved self-assessment.

49	Perceptions of emergency medicine residents of multisource feedback : different, relevant, and useful information	Objective Multisource feedback is a process through which different members of the care team assess and provide feedback on residents’ competencies, usually those that are less often addressed by traditional assessment methods (i.e., communication, collaboration, professionalism). Feasibility and reliability of multisource feedback have been addressed in prior research. The present study explored emergency residents’ perceptions of multisource feedback provided by teaching physicians, nurses, and patients they have worked with during a rotation in an emergency department.  Methods A multisource feedback intervention was proposed to residents during nine months in the emergency department of a tertiary-care university hospital. Residents distributed feedback questionnaires to physicians, nurses, and patients that focused on competencies (collaboration, communication, and professionalism) from the CanMEDS framework. Responses were compiled and reported to participating residents. To assess residents’ perceptions of multisource feedback, semi-structured group and individual interviews were held three months after the intervention. Transcripts were analyzed qualitatively following Miles and Huberman’s method for intra-site case analysis.  Results According to residents (n=10), each source (physicians, nurses, patients) provided relevant comments that differed significantly in their content. Physicians focused primarily on medical expertise, nurses addressed competencies related to leadership, collaboration, and communication, and patients commented on the competencies of professionalism and communication. Residents concluded that obtaining feedback from nurses and patients was acceptable and useful. They reported modifying certain behaviours after receiving the multisource feedback.   Conclusion Residents perceived the multisource feedback to be acceptable and useful for the assessment of medical competencies such as communication, collaboration, professionalism, and leadership.		en	24923.0
50	"Countering distrust in illicit online networks : the dispute resolution strategies of
cybercriminals"	The core of this paper is a detailed investigation of the dispute resolution system contained within Darkode, an elite cybercriminal forum. Extracting the dedicated disputes section from within the marketplace, where users can report bad behaviour and register complaints, we carry out content analysis on these threads. This involves both descriptive statistics across the dataset and qualitative analysis of particular posts of interest, leading to a number of new insights. First, the overall level of disputes is quite high, even though members are vetted for entry in the first instance. Second, the lower ranked members of the marketplace are the most highly represented category for both the plaintiffs and defendants. Third, vendors are accused of malfeasance far more often than buyers, and that their “crimes” are most commonly either not providing the product/service or providing a poor one. Fourth, the monetary size of the disputes is surprisingly small. Finally, only 23.1% of disputes reach a clear outcome.

51	"Acceptability and feasibility of recruitment
and data collection in a field study of
hospital nurses’ handoffs using mobile
devices"	Background The portability and multiple functionalities of mobile devices make them well suited for collecting field data for naturalistic research, which is often beset with complexities in recruitment and logistics. This paper describes the implementation of a research protocol using mobile devices to study nurses’ exchanges of patient information at change of shift.  Methods Nurses from three medical and surgical units of an acute care teaching hospital in Montreal, Canada, were invited to participate. On 10 selected days, participants were asked to record their handoffs using mobile devices and to complete paper questionnaires regarding these exchanges. Nurse acceptance of mobile devices was assessed using a 30-item technology acceptance questionnaire and focus group interviews. The principal feasibility indicator was whether or not 80 complete handoffs could be collected on each unit.  Results From October to December 2017, 63 of 108 eligible nurses completed the study. Results suggest that the use of mobile devices was acceptable to nurses, who felt that the devices were easy to use but did not improve their job performance. The principal feasibility criterion was met, with complete data collected for 176, 84, and 170 of the eligible handoffs on each unit (81% of eligible handoffs). The research protocol was acceptable to nurses, who felt the study’s demands did not interfere with their clinical work.  Conclusions The research protocol involving mobile devices was feasible and acceptable to nurses. Nurses felt the research protocol, including the use of mobile devices, required minimal investment of time and effort. This suggests that their decision to participate in research involving mobile devices was based on their perception that the study protocol and the use of the device would not be demanding. Further work is needed to determine if studies involving more sophisticated and possibly more demanding technology would be equally feasible and acceptable to nurses.

52	Assessing and addressing sexual concerns in individuals diagnosed with coronary artery disease	Background/Aims Sexual concerns are frequently reported in people diagnosed with coronary artery disease. These concerns may be related to disorders in one or more phases of the sexual response cycle (i.e. desire, arousal and orgasm). Sexual concerns have been linked to anxiety, depressive symptoms and feelings of despair. As such, nurses should have an understanding of the aetiology of sexual concerns in this population and use appropriate assessment and support strategies.  Methods This clinical article discusses several key aspects of evidence-based practice to assess and address sexual concerns in people diagnosed with coronary artery disease.  Findings Early assessment of biological, psychological and pharmacological causes of sexual concerns should be carried out. Sexual counselling may be offered to meet specific information needs. Adding pharmacological agents and referring to a sex therapist can be considered to effectively address the sexual concerns of people within this population.  Conclusions Approaches to sexual assessment, main information needs of patients with coronary artery disease regarding their sexual health, and support strategies are presented.

54	Effectiveness of serious games and impact of design elements on engagement and educational outcomes in healthcare professionals and students : a systematic review and meta-analysis protocol	Introduction Serious games (SGs) are interactive and entertaining digital software with an educational purpose. They engage the learner by proposing challenges and through various design elements (DEs; eg, points, difficulty adaptation, story). Recent reviews suggest the effectiveness of SGs in healthcare professionals’ and students’ education is mixed. This could be explained by the variability in their DEs, which has been shown to be highly variable across studies. The aim of this systematic review is to identify, appraise and synthesise the best available evidence regarding the effectiveness of SGs and the impact of DEs on engagement and educational outcomes of healthcare professionals and students. Methods and analysis A systematic search of the literature will be conducted using a combination of medical subject headings terms and keywords in Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health, Embase, Education Resources Information Center, PsycInFO, PubMed and Web of Science. Studies assessing SGs on engagement and educational outcomes will be included. Two independent reviewers will conduct the screening as well as the data extraction process. The risk of bias of included studies will also be assessed by two reviewers using the Effective Practice and Organisation of Care criteria. Data regarding DEs in SGs will first be synthesised qualitatively. A meta-analysis will then be performed, if the data allow it. Finally, the quality of the evidence regarding the effectiveness of SGs on each outcome will be assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. Ethics and dissemination As this systematic review only uses already collected data, no Institutional Review Board approval is required. Its results will be submitted in a peerreviewed journal by the end of 2018.		en	24918.0
55	Acute carotid stenting in patients undergoing thrombectomy : a systematic review and meta-analysis	Background The benefit of acute carotid stenting compared with no acute stenting on clinical outcomes among patients with tandem lesions (TL) undergoing endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) remains unknown.  Methods We conducted a a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies comparing acute carotid stenting versus no stenting among TL patients undergoing EVT with regards to 90 day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score, symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH), and mortality. Four reviewers screened citations for eligibility and two assessed retained studies for risk of bias and data extraction. A random effects model was used for the synthesis of aggregated data.  Results 21 studies (n=1635 patients) were identified for the systematic review; 19 were cohort studies, 1 was a post-hoc analysis of an EVT trial, and 1 was a pilot randomized controlled trial. 16 studies were included in the meta-analysis. Acute stenting was associated with a favorable 90 day mRS score: OR 1.43 (95% CI 1.07, 1.91). No significant heterogeneity between studies was found for this outcome (I2=17.0%; χ2=18.07, p=0.26). There were no statistically significant differences for 3 month mortality (OR 0.80 (95% CI 0.50, 1.28)) or sICH (OR 1.41 (95% CI 0.91, 2.19)).  Conclusions This meta-analysis suggests that among TL patients undergoing EVT, acute carotid stenting is associated with a greater likelihood of favorable outcome at 90 days compared with no stenting.		en	24917.0
56	La place du bonheur dans la doctrine de la vertu	Le lecteur de la Critique de la raison pratique risque d’être intrigué par le fait que Kant affirme dans l’Analytique que le bonheur ne doit jouer aucun rôle dans la motivation à agir selon la loi morale, alors que la Dialectique réintroduit de manière inopinée le thème du bonheur comme faisant l’objet d’une attente raisonnable de la part du sujet moral vertueux. Or, tant Fichte que Schopenhauer exprimeront des réserves face à ce geste de Kant. Dans cet article, je cherche à montrer que les trois explications habituellement fournies pour rendre plausible cette espérance en un bonheur proportionnel à la vertu sont sujettes à caution : 1) le dualisme ontologique (suprasensible/sensible), 2) le préjugé religieux de Kant (F. Schroeter) et 3) une concession faite par Kant à la faiblesse de la nature humaine (L. W. Beck). J’avance alors une autre explication, fondée sur la conception kantienne de la raison pratique.

57	La place du bonheur dans la doctrine de la vertu	The reader of the Critique of Practical Reason is often puzzled by Kant’s claim in the Analytic that happiness must not play any role in the motivation to act according to the moral law, whereas the Dialectic unexpectedly reintroduces the topic of happiness as a reasonable expectation from the part of the virtuous moral subject. In fact, both Fichte and Schopenhauer had reservations about this move. In this paper I argue that the three explanations usually provided in order to make sense of the hope for happiness are questionable: 1) the ontological dualism (intelligible/sensible), 2) Kant’s religious prejudice (F. Schroeter), and 3) a concession made by Kant to the weakness of human nature (L. W. Beck). I give another explanation, based on Kant’s conception of practical reason.

58	Entre la philosophie et la science : le reconstructionnisme hermeneutique de J. Habermas	Cet article traite du déplacement théorique opéré par Habermas entre Connaissance et intérêt (1968) et la Théorie de l’agir communicationnel (1981). Connaissance et intérêt présentait un double volet théorique correspondant au couple « théorie traditionnelle et théorie critique » : 1- une description des intérêts de connaissance conçus comme invariants anthropologiques (les intérêts technique et pratique), et 2- une reprise du concept de « critique » propre à l’École de Francfort selon lequel la théorie est autoréférentielle au sens où elle doit être strictement contextualisée et viser la mise au jour de déterminations inaperçues. Ici, l’intérêt est émancipatoire et la psychanalyse en est une illustration. Connaissance et intérêt procédait donc à une répartition asymétrique des intérêts de connaissance en vertu de ces deux approches théoriques distinctes. Or, le passage à la théorie de l’agir communicationnel maintiendra ces deux approches, de façon renouvelée toutefois, conformément aux deux fonctions contenues dans la nouvelle définition du rôle de la philosophie : 1- « Platzhalter » et 2- « Interpret ».

59	Entre la philosophie et la science : le reconstructionnisme hermeneutique de J. Habermas	This paper deals with the theoretical reframing that takes place between Knowledge and Human Interest (1968) and the Theory of Communicative Action (1981). In Knowledge and Human Interest two theoretical approaches corresponding to the pair “traditional theory and critical theory” overlapped: 1- a description of the knowledge interests conceived as anthropological invariants (the technical and the practical interests), and 2- the taking up of the concept of “critique” proper to the Frankfurt School according to which theory is self-referential since it is strictly contextualized and aims at the discovery of unnoticed determinations. The interest in this case is emancipatory and psychoanalysis can serve as an example for it. As we can see, the distribution of the knowledge interests in 1968 was asymmetrical because of these two distinct theoretical approaches. Yet the transition to the theory of communicative action will maintain the two approaches, in a renewed manner however, in accordance with the two functions delineated in the new definition of the role of philosophy: 1- “Platzhalter” and 2- “Interpret.”	Habermas , Philosophie , Théorie traditionnelle , Théorie critique , Intérêts de connaissance , Agir communicationnel	en	24912.0
60	Effet de la musique sur le stress chez des athlètes avec et sans commotions cérébrales	Les commotions cérébrales d’origine sportive préoccupent de plus en plus les experts; entre 20 à 40 % des athlètes subissent une commotion cérébrale chaque année au Québec. Parmi les nombreux impacts néfastes, les symptômes affectifs (p. ex., le stress et l’anxiété) font partie des complications les plus fréquentes. Ainsi, il est important de développer des techniques de gestion du stress adaptées au mode de vie des athlètes. En ce sens, la musique a été démontrée efficace pour réduire le stress, dû à ses propriétés relaxante et agréable. L’objectif de cette étude est d’explorer les effets de l’écoute musicale sur le stress induit expérimentalement chez les athlètes commotionnés et non commotionnés. Pour ce faire, quatre groupes d’athlètes (non commotionné musique, non commotionné silence, commotionné musique, commotionné silence) ont effectué le Test de stress social de Trier alors que des mesures autorapportées de stress ont été prises. Les résultats ne montrent pas de différence significative dans le patron de récupération du stress entre les groupes ayant écouté ou non de la musique. Cependant, il est intéressant de constater que les groupes d’athlètes ayant écouté de la musique durant la phase de récupération montrent un niveau de stress final inférieur à leur niveau de base. Par ailleurs, aucune différence n’a été observée entre les groupes d’athlètes avec et sans commotion cérébrale lors de l’induction et de la récupération du stress. Des recherches futures sont nécessaires afin d’approfondir ces résultats et de mieux comprendre comment la musique peut être utilisée comme outils aidant à réduire le stress dans le domaine sportif.

61	Effet de la musique sur le stress chez des athlètes avec et sans commotions cérébrales	Sports-related concussions are a growing concern to experts; concussions affect approximately 20 to 40 percent of athletes every year in Quebec. Of the many negative side effects, emotional symptoms such as stress and anxiety are among the most common. It is therefore important to develop adequate stress management techniques adapted to an athlete’s lifestyle. In this regard, music has been shown to be effective in reducing stress, due to its relaxing and therapeutic properties. The purpose of this study is to explore the effects of music on experimentally induced stress in concussed and non-concussed athletes. To achieve this, four groups of athletes (non-concussed music, non-concussed silence, concussed music, concussed silence) performed the Trier Social Stress Test, for which self-reported stress measurements were taken. The results do not show a significant difference in the pattern of stress recovery between the groups who listened to music and those who did not. However, it is interesting to note that groups of athletes who listened to music during the recovery phase show a lower final stress level than their baseline level. Furthermore, no difference was observed between the groups of athletes with and without concussions during stress induction or recovery. Future research is needed to refine these findings and to better understand how music can be used as a tool to help reduce stress in sports.

62	La catégorisation visuelle des lettres et les habiletés de lecture chez l’enfant	L’identification des lettres est un processus de catégorisation ; une large variété de stimuli visuels est regroupée en 26 catégories distinctes. La lecture de mots dépendrait du traitement de l’identité des lettres, indépendamment de leurs formes visuelles. Certaines évidences suggèrent une perception catégorielle des lettres chez l’adulte lettré. Toutefois, le lien entre la catégorisation visuelle des lettres et la lecture demeure peu étudié. La présente étude a employé un paradigme de perception catégorielle (étude de cas des lettres b-d) afin d’explorer si la perception des lettres est catégorielle chez l’enfant, et si une telle perception serait liée aux habiletés de lecture. Les résultats indiquent que les enfants perçoivent les lettres b et d de façon catégorielle, suggérant que leurs représentations abstraites des lettres influencent leur perception, et que celles-ci sont liées aux habiletés de lecture de mots irréguliers, mais non de pseudo-mots. Cette étude soutient l’importance de représentations abstraites des lettres en lecture, permettant de mieux comprendre les processus impliqués en lecture.

63	La catégorisation visuelle des lettres et les habiletés de lecture chez l’enfant	Letter identification is a process of categorization; a wide variety of visual stimuli are sorted into 26 distinct categories. Word reading is assumed to be dependant on the process of letter identities, abstracting over their visual forms. Some evidence suggest categorical perception of letters in literate adults. However, these studies focussed mostly on pre-lexical process of letters without the implication of the central reading processes. This current study employed a categorical perception paradigm with the letters b-d as a test case to examine the mode of perception of letters in children; and its role in reading. The results show that children perceived the letters b and d in a categorical manner, suggesting that their abstract letter representations influenced their perception. The results also show that categorial perception of letters seemed to be linked to irregular words, but not to pseudo-word reading ability. This study supports the importance of abstract representations in reading and allows a better understanding of the processes involved in reading.

64	Understanding food web mercury accumulation through trophic transfer and carbon processing along a river affected by recent run-of-river dams	Unlike large dams which favor methylation of Hg in flooded soils over long periods, run-of-river dams are designed to flood a limited area of soils and are therefore not expected to significantly affect mercury (Hg) cycling or carbon processing. We studied the Hg and carbon cycles within food webs from several sectors along the Saint-Maurice River, Quebec, Canada, that differ in how they are influenced by two run-of-river dams and other watershed disturbances. We observed peak Hg concentrations in fish five-year postimpoundment, but these levels were reduced three years after this peak. Methylmercury concentrations in low trophic level fish and invertebrates were related to their carbon source (δ13C) rather than their trophic positions (δ15N). Biomagnification, measured by trophic magnification slopes, was driven mainly by methylmercury concentrations in low-trophic level organisms and environmental factors related to organic matter degradation and Hg-methylation. River sectors, δ13C and δ15N, predicted up to 80% of the variability in food web methylmercury concentrations. The installation of run-of-river dams and the related pondages, in association with other watershed disturbances, altered carbon processing, promoted Hg-methylation and its accumulation at the base of the food web, and led to a temporary increase in Hg levels in fish.

65	Start small : how nanomedicine could alleviate the burden of rare CNS Diseases	The complexity and organization of the central nervous system (CNS) is widely modulated by the presence of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and the blood–cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB), which both act as biochemical, dynamic obstacles impeding any type of undesirable exogenous exchanges. The disruption of these barriers is usually associated with the development of neuropathologies which can be the consequence of genetic disorders, local antigenic invasions, or autoimmune diseases. These disorders can take the shape of rare CNS-related diseases (other than Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s) which a exhibit relatively low or moderate prevalence and could be part of a potential line of treatments from current nanotargeted therapies. Indeed, one of the most promising therapeutical alternatives in that field comes from the development of nanotechnologies which can be divided between drug delivery systems and diagnostic tools. Unfortunately, the number of studies dedicated to treating these rare diseases using nanotherapeutics is limited, which is mostly due to a lack of interest from industrial pharmaceutical companies. In the present review, we will provide an overview of some of these rare CNS diseases, discuss the physiopathology of these disorders, shed light on how nanotherapies could be of interest as a credible line of treatment, and finally address the major issues which can hinder the development of efficient therapies in that area.

66	De Max Weber à Heidegger : l'historiographie comme liquidation méthodique de l'histoire	Il peut paraître audacieux d’effectuer un rapprochement entre deux intellectuels aussi différents que Max Weber et Martin Heidegger, et ce même à propos de cette préoccupation commune qu’ils ont pour l’histoire. Weber aborde en vérité la question du point de vue de la méthodologie des sciences humaines, refusant de s’aventurer sur le terrain de la philosophie, alors que Heidegger traite de l’historialité dans le cadre d’une ontologie phénoménologique gravitant autour de la question de l’être. Mais c’est l’accent qu’ils mettent tous deux sur le concept de « possibilité » en histoire qui autorise le rapprochement, comme nous allons le voir.

67	De Max Weber à Heidegger : l'historiographie comme liquidation méthodique de l'histoire	It may seem odd at first glance to bring together Max Weber and Martin Heidegger, two intellectuals so different from one another even they share a common concern for history. In fact Weber deals with history merely from the standpoint of the methodology of the human sciences, renouncing to venture in the field of philosophy, whereas Heidegger develops his concept of historicality within a phenomenological ontology centered around the question of being. However the fact that they both insist on the importance for history of the concept of “possibility” clearly justifies, as we will see, the comparison.
