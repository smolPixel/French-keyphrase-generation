It has been hypothesized that these deficits are associated with different brain mechanisms in each disease, but no previous study has used a network approach to explore this hypothesis. The aim of this study was to compare resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) language network in AD, svPPA patients, and cognitively unimpaired elderly adults (CTRL). Therefore, 10 AD patients, 12 svPPA patients and 11 CTRL underwent rs-fMRI. Seed-based functional connectivity analyses were conducted using regions of interest in the left anterior temporal lobe (ATL), left posterior middle temporal gyrus (pMTG) and left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), applying a voxelwise correction for gray matter volume. In AD patients, the left pMTG was the only key language region showing functional connectivity changes, mainly a reduced interhemispheric functional connectivity with its right-hemisphere counterpart, in comparison to CTRL. In svPPA patients, we observed a functional isolation of the left ATL, both decreases and increases in functional connectivity from the left pMTG and increased functional connectivity form the left IFG. Post-hoc analyses showed that naming impairments were overall associated with the functional disconnections observed across the language network. In conclusion, AD and svPPA patients present distinct language network functional connectivity profiles. In AD patients, functional connectivity changes were restricted to the left pMTG and were overall less severe in comparison to svPPA patients. Results in svPPA patients suggest decreased functional connectivity along the ventral language pathway and increased functional connectivity along the dorsal language pathway.

However, AD patients also present with semantic deficits, which are more severe for semantically unique entities (e.g. a famous person) than for common concepts (e.g. a beaver). Previous studies in these patient populations have largely focused on famous-person naming. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate if these impairments also extend to other semantically unique entities such as famous places and famous logos. In this study, 13 AD patients, 9 svPPA patients, and 12 cognitively unimpaired elderly subjects (CTRL) were tested with a picture-naming test of non-unique entities (Boston Naming Test) and three experimental tests of semantically unique entities assessing naming of famous persons, places, and logos. Both clinical groups were overall more impaired at naming semantically unique entities than non-unique entities. Naming impairments in AD and svPPA extended to the other types of semantically unique entities, since a CTRL>AD>svPPA pattern was found on the performance of all naming tests. Naming famous places and famous persons appeared to be most impaired in svPPA, and both specific and general semantic knowledge for these entities were affected in these patients. Although AD patients were most significantly impaired on famous-person naming, only their specific semantic knowledge was impaired, while general knowledge was preserved. Post-hoc neuroimaging analyses also showed that famous-person naming impairments in AD correlated with atrophy in the temporo-parietal junction, a region functionally associated with lexical access. In line with previous studies, svPPA patients’ impairment in both naming and semantic knowledge suggest a more profound semantic impairment, while naming impairments in AD may arise to a greater extent from impaired lexical access, even though semantic impairment for specific knowledge is also present. These results highlight the critical importance of developing and using a variety of semantically-unique-entity naming tests in neuropsychological assessments of patients with neurodegenerative diseases, which may unveil different patterns of lexical-semantic deficits."], "keyphrases": ["Naming", "Semantically unique entities", "Semantic variant primary progressive aphasia", "Alzheimer's disease", "Semantics", "Lexical access"]}

Exposures to 32 perinatal adversities (e.g. fetal, obstetric, psychosocial, and parental psychopathology) were modeled using latent class analysis, and associations with a self-reported suicide attempt by age 20 were investigated with logistic regression. We investigated to what extent childhood emotional and behavioral problems, victimization, and cognition explained the associations.\n\nResults\nIn both cohorts, we identified five profiles: No perinatal risk, Poor fetal growth, Socioeconomic adversity, Delivery complications, Parental mental health problems (ALSPAC only). Compared to children with No perinatal risk, children in the Poor fetal growth (pooled estimate QLSCD-ALSPAC, OR 1.89, 95% CI 1.04–3.44), Socioeconomic adversity (pooled-OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.08–1.85), and Parental mental health problems (OR 1.74, 95% CI 1.27–2.40), but not Delivery complications, profiles were more likely to attempt suicide. The proportion of this effect mediated by the putative mediators was larger for the Socioeconomic adversity profile compared to the others.\n\nConclusions\nPerinatal adversities associated with suicide attempt cluster in distinct profiles. Suicide prevention may begin early in life and requires a multidisciplinary approach targeting a constellation of factors from different domains (psychiatric, obstetric, socioeconomic), rather than a single factor, to effectively reduce suicide vulnerability. The way these factors cluster together also determined the pathways leading to a suicide attempt, which can guide decision-making on personalized suicide prevention strategies."], "keyphrases": ["ALSPAC", "Latent class analysis", "Perinatal adversity", "QLSCD", "Suicide attempt"]}

The objective was to determine the contribution of genes and environment to the association between childhood impulsive‐aggression and serious suicidal ideation/attempt in young adulthood.\n\nMethods\nN = 862 twins (435 families) from the Quebec Newborn Twin Study were followed up from birth to 20 years. Repeated measures of teacher‐assessed impulsive‐aggression were modeled using a genetically informed latent growth model including intercept and slope parameters reflecting individual differences in the baseline level (age 6 years) and in the change (increase/decrease) of impulsive‐aggression during childhood (6 to 12 years), respectively. Lifetime suicidality (serious suicidal ideation/attempt) was self‐reported at 20 years. Associations of impulsive‐aggression intercept and slope with suicidality were decomposed into additive genetic (A) and unique environmental (E) components.\n\nResults\nAdditive genetic factors accounted for an important part of individual differences in impulsive‐aggression intercept (A = 90%, E = 10%) and slope (A = 65%, E = 35%). Genetic (50%) and unique environmental (50%) factors equally contributed to suicidality. We found that 38% of the genetic factors accounting for suicidality were shared with those underlying impulsive‐aggression slope, whereas 40% of the environmental factors accounting for suicidality were shared with those associated with impulsive‐aggression intercept. The genetic correlation between impulsive‐aggression slope and suicidality was 0.60, p = .027.\n\nConclusions\nGenetic and unique environmental factors underlying suicidality significantly overlap with those underlying childhood impulsive‐aggression.

They underwent three language assessments (acute: 0 to\n72 hours; subacute: 7 to 14 days; chronic: 6 to 12 months post-onset). The picture\ndescription from the Western Aphasia Battery was analyzed at three time points.\nChanges in terms of thematic informativeness and microstructural variables were\nanalyzed.\nOutcomes & Results: Regarding the micro-structural variables, the mean length of\nutterances (MLU) and the number of words per minute showed significant positive\nchanges between the acute and chronic phases. For the thematic informativeness\nmeasures, the number of thematic units (TUs), the number of thematic units per\nminute (TUs/min) and the number of thematic units per utterance (TUs/utt)\n4\nincreased significantly between the acute and chronic phases. Positive correlations\nbetween TUs and MLU in the acute phase and a general language impairment\nseverity measure in the acute and chronic phases suggest a relationship between\nthese measures and global language performance suggesting the potential predictive\nvalue of these variables in the acute phase.\nConclusions & Implications: These findings support the use of thematic units in\ndescriptive discourse analysis during an acute clinical examination of language as\nthey require minimal additional time to score and track changes in post-stroke\naphasia recovery. They capture long-term changes in discourse abilities and appear\nrelated to overall language measures in both the acute and chronic stages of\nrecovery. The interpretation of the changes in MLU and the number of words per\nminute is less straightforward, as improvements in these measures carry different\ninterpretations depending on the type of aphasia.

Some studies have demonstrated a marked impairment of semantic VF compared to phonemic VF in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Since amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (aMCI) is associated with increased risk of conversion to incident AD, it is relevant to examine whether a similar impairment is observed in this population. The objective of the present empirical study is to compare VF performance of aMCI patients to those of AD and elderly controls matched one-to-one for age and education.\n\nMethod\nNinety-six participants divided into three equal groups (N = 32: AD, aMCI and Controls) were included in this study. Participants in each group were, on average, 76 years of age and had 13 years of education. A repeated measures ANOVA with the Group (AD, aMCI, NC) as between-subject factor and the Fluency condition (“P” and “animals”) as within-subject factor was performed. T-tests and simple ANOVAs were also conducted to examine the interaction.\n\nResults\nThere was a significant interaction between the groups and the verbal fluency condition. In AD, significantly fewer words were produced in both conditions. In contrast, participants with aMCI demonstrated a pattern similar to controls in the phonemic condition, but generated significantly fewer words in the semantic condition.\n\nConclusion\nThese results indicate a semantic memory impairment in aMCI revealed by a simple, commonly-used neuropsychological test.

There have been reports of patients suffering from semantic\ndementia (SD), a neurodegenerative condition in which the ATL are damaged bilaterally, who\npresent with greater semantic impairment for concrete concepts than for abstract concepts, an\neffect known as reversal of the concreteness effect. This effect has previously been interpreted\nas reflecting degraded visual-perceptual features of objects due to damage to the inferior\ntemporal lobes such as is observed in SD. Temporal lobe atrophy in SD, however, is bilateral\neven if it usually predominates to the left ATL, and it has been found to extend beyond the\nATL, throughout the temporal lobes including medial and posterior temporal lobe regions.\nThe question therefore remains whether greater impairment for concrete concepts results from\ndamage to the ATL or from damage to the visual association cortex, and if unilateral damage\ncan produce such a deficit.\nThe aim of the present study was to investigate the processing of concrete and abstract\nwords in rare patients who underwent a selective ATL surgical resection, and to compare their\nperformance with that of patients with selective medial temporal lobe damage sparing the\nATL region. Seven patients with a selective unilateral anterior temporal resection (ATL), 15\npatients with a selective unilateral amygdalo-hippocampectomy (SeAH), and 15 healthy ageand education-matched controls underwent detailed neuropsychological assessment and\ncarried out a semantic similarity judgement task evaluating their comprehension of concrete\nand abstract words.

A systematic search was performed in 6 databases (January 2000 to April 2018). Title and abstract screening, full-text review, data charting, and critical appraisal were performed independently by two review authors. Data regarding included studies and communication channels were synthesized descriptively. A typology of SC strategies was developed using a qualitative and inductive method of data synthesis.\n\nResults: Among 960 unique publications identified, 18 met inclusion criteria. A third of publications scored good quality (6/18, 33%), half scored moderate quality (9/18, 50%), and less than a fifth scored low quality (3/18, 16%).

Feasibility and reliability of multisource feedback have been addressed in prior research. The present study explored emergency residents’ perceptions of multisource feedback provided by teaching physicians, nurses, and patients they have worked with during a rotation in an emergency department.\n\nMethods\nA multisource feedback intervention was proposed to residents during nine months in the emergency department of a tertiary-care university hospital. Residents distributed feedback questionnaires to physicians, nurses, and patients that focused on competencies (collaboration, communication, and professionalism) from the CanMEDS framework. Responses were compiled and reported to participating residents. To assess residents’ perceptions of multisource feedback, semi-structured group and individual interviews were held three months after the intervention. Transcripts were analyzed qualitatively following Miles and Huberman’s method for intra-site case analysis.\n\nResults\nAccording to residents (n=10), each source (physicians, nurses, patients) provided relevant comments that differed significantly in their content. Physicians focused primarily on medical expertise, nurses addressed competencies related to leadership, collaboration, and communication, and patients commented on the competencies of professionalism and communication.

This paper describes the implementation of a research protocol using mobile devices to study nurses’ exchanges of patient information at change of shift.\n\nMethods\nNurses from three medical and surgical units of an acute care teaching hospital in Montreal, Canada, were invited to participate. On 10 selected days, participants were asked to record their handoffs using mobile devices and to complete paper questionnaires regarding these exchanges. Nurse acceptance of mobile devices was assessed using a 30-item technology acceptance questionnaire and focus group interviews. The principal feasibility indicator was whether or not 80 complete handoffs could be collected on each unit.\n\nResults\nFrom October to December 2017, 63 of 108 eligible nurses completed the study. Results suggest that the use of mobile devices was acceptable to nurses, who felt that the devices were easy to use but did not improve their job performance. The principal feasibility criterion was met, with complete data collected for 176, 84, and 170 of the eligible handoffs on each unit (81% of eligible handoffs). The research protocol was acceptable to nurses, who felt the study’s demands did not interfere with their clinical work.\n\nConclusions\nThe research protocol involving mobile devices was feasible and acceptable to nurses. Nurses felt the research protocol, including the use of mobile devices, required minimal investment of time and effort. This suggests that their decision to participate in research involving mobile devices was based on their perception that the study protocol and the use of the device would not be demanding.

In a lake naturally separated into three basins, the thermocline and oxycline of an experimental basin were deepened by 4 and 3 m, respectively, to study the effect on the methylmercury (MeHg) accumulation. This treatment decreased hypolimnetic MeHg concentration by approximately 90%, zooplankton concentrations by 30 to 50%, and in some fish by 45%. A multiple linear regression indicated that oxycline depth significantly influenced hypolimnetic MeHg concentrations, with no significant effect of thermocline depth, anoxic water volume, interface area of oxic-anoxic water, and sediment area in contact with anoxic water. Fish MeHg decline varied, with a greater response by low oxygen-tolerant bullhead. Increased pelagic primary and secondary production likely caused zooplankton and fish MeHg decreases via algal and growth dilution. Environmental changes leading to oxycline deepening are therefore predicted to cause a decrease in MeHg bioaccumulation in similar Canadian Shield lakes. If associated ecosystem impacts related to the deepening treatment are deemed acceptable, then this experiment provides a potential remediation method for small lakes confronted with MeHg accumulation."], "keyphrases": []}

The interest in this case is emancipatory and psychoanalysis can serve as an example for it.

Mais c’est l’accent qu’ils mettent tous deux sur le concept de « possibilité » en histoire qui autorise le rapprochement, comme nous allons le voir.", "It may seem odd at first glance to bring together Max Weber and Martin Heidegger, two intellectuals so different from one another even they share a common concern for history. In fact Weber deals with history merely from the standpoint of the methodology of the human sciences, renouncing to venture in the field of philosophy, whereas Heidegger develops his concept of historicality within a phenomenological ontology centered around the question of being. However the fact that they both insist on the importance for history of the concept of “possibility” clearly justifies, as we will see, the comparison."], "keyphrases": ["Weber, Max", "Heidegger, Martin", "Histoire", "Possibilité", "Avenir", "Futur passé", "History", "Possibility", "Future past"]}

En effet, ce sont ces deux\nprincipaux paramètres qui permettent de définir cette pratique, par ailleurs fort diverse,\npuisque les pratiques d’apprentissage en famille peuvent varier selon un large spectre, allant de\nla reprise, à la maison, de la forme scolaire et d’une pédagogie traditionnelle, à l’apprentissage\nlibre, autodirigé par l’enfant (unschooling), en passant par une forme d’éducation souple, active,\ninspirée des pédagogies dites nouvelles, faisant parfois grand usage des ressources éducatives\ncommunautaires, de l’internet, des groupes locaux d’enfants éduqués dans la famille et même,\nde fréquentation scolaire à temps partiel (Brabant, 2008).\nCe mouvement émergent, bien que marginal, constitue un changement important dans\nle paysage des options éducatives disponibles. Il importe de réfléchir à la façon de gérer ce\nchangement, du point de vue de l’évolution des systèmes éducatifs. C’est pourquoi cette\nrecherche s’attarde aux défis de gouvernance que soulève cette nouveauté et au rôle des divers\nacteurs pour assurer une réflexivité au sein du système éducatif, de façon à réaliser des\napprentissages utiles pour l’évolution de l’éducation.\nCette recherche-formation étudie la création d’un «comité d’experts de terrain»,\nréunissant des parents-éducateurs et des superviseurs scolaires, pour éclairer la prise en\ncompte du mouvement d’apprentissage en famille. Elle fait suite aux deux premières étapes\nd’un programme de recherche à cet effet, des démarches de recherche-formation mises en\nplace d’abord avec des groupes de parents-éducateurs (Brabant, 2010, 2013; Brabant et\nBourdon, 2012), puis avec des superviseurs scolaires (Brabant, à paraître, 2014, 2015)."], "keyphrases": []}
