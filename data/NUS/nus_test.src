{"title": "2-Source Dispersers for Sub-Polynomial Entropy and Ramsey Graphs Beating the Frankl-Wilson Construction", "abstract": "The main result of this paper is an explicit disperser for two independent sources on n bits, each of entropy k = n o(1). Put differently, setting N = 2n and K = 2k , we construct explicit N  N Boolean matrices for which no K  K sub-matrix is monochromatic. Viewed as adjacency matrices of bipartite graphs, this gives an explicit construction of K-Ramsey bipartite graphs of size N . This greatly improves the previous bound of k = o(n) of Barak, Kindler, Shaltiel, Sudakov and Wigderson [4]. It also significantly improves the 25-year record of k = ~ O(n) on the special case of Ramsey graphs, due to Frankl and Wilson [9]. The construction uses (besides \"classical\" extractor ideas) almost all of the machinery developed in the last couple of years for extraction from independent sources, including: Bourgain's extractor for 2 independent sources of some entropy rate &lt; 1/2 [5] Raz's extractor for 2 independent sources, one of which has any entropy rate &gt; 1/2 [18] Rao's extractor for 2 independent block-sources of entropy n (1) [17] The \"Challenge-Response\" mechanism for detecting \"entropy concentration\" of [4]. The main novelty comes in a bootstrap procedure which allows the Challenge-Response mechanism of [4] to be used with sources of less and less entropy, using recursive calls to itself. Subtleties arise since the success of this mechanism depends on restricting the given sources, and so recursion constantly changes the original sources. These are resolved via a new construct, in between a disperser and an extractor, which behaves like an extractor on sufficiently large subsources of the given ones.

{"title": "Indexing Multi-Dimensional Time-Series with Support for Multiple Distance Measures", "abstract": "Although most time-series data mining research has concentrated on providing solutions for a single distance function, in this work we motivate the need for a single index structure that can support multiple distance measures.

Trajectory datasets are very common in environmental applications, mobility experiments, video surveillance and are especially important for the discovery of certain biological patterns. Our primary similarity measure is based on the Longest Common Subsequence (LCSS) model, that offers enhanced robustness, particularly for noisy data, which are encountered very often in real world applications . However, our index is able to accommodate other distance measures as well, including the ubiquitous Euclidean distance, and the increasingly popular Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). While other researchers have advocated one or other of these similarity measures, a major contribution of our work is the ability to support all these measures without the need to restructure the index.

{"title": "Categorizing Web Queries According to Geographical Locality", "abstract": "Web pages (and resources, in general) can be characterized according to their geographical locality. For example, a web page with general information about wildflowers could be considered a global page, likely to be of interest to a ge-ographically broad audience. In contrast, a web page with listings on houses for sale in a specific city could be regarded as a local page, likely to be of interest only to an audience in a relatively narrow region. Similarly, some search engine queries (implicitly) target global pages, while other queries are after local pages. For example, the best results for query [wildflowers] are probably global pages about wildflowers such as the one discussed above. However, local pages that are relevant to, say, San Francisco are likely to be good matches for a query [houses for sale] that was issued by a San Francisco resident or by somebody moving to that city. Unfortunately, search engines do not analyze the geographical locality of queries and users, and hence often produce sub-optimal results. Thus query [wildflowers ] might return pages that discuss wildflowers in specific U.S. states (and not general information about wildflowers), while query [houses for sale] might return pages with real estate listings for locations other than that of interest to the person who issued the query. Deciding whether an unseen query should produce mostly local or global pages--without placing this burden on the search engine users--is an important and challenging problem, because queries are often ambiguous or underspecify the information they are after. In this paper, we address this problem by first defining how to categorize queries according to their (often implicit) geographical locality. We then introduce several alternatives for automatically and efficiently categorizing queries in our scheme, using a variety of state-of-the-art machine learning tools. We report a thorough evaluation of our classifiers using a large sample of queries from a real web search engine, and conclude by discussing how our query categorization approach can help improve query result quality.", "id": "15", "src": "categorizing web queries according to geographical locality . web pages ( and resources , in general ) can be characterized according to their geographical locality . for example , a web page with general information about wildflowers could be considered a global page , likely to be of interest to a ge ographically broad audience . in contrast , a web page with listings on houses for sale in a specific city could be regarded as a local page , likely to be of interest only to an audience in a relatively narrow region . similarly , some search engine queries ( implicitly ) target global pages , while other queries are after local pages . for example , the best results for query wildflowers are probably global pages about wildflowers such as the one discussed above . however , local pages that are relevant to , say , san francisco are likely to be good matches for a query houses for sale that was issued by a san francisco resident or by somebody moving to that city . unfortunately , search engines do not analyze the geographical locality of queries and users , and hence often produce sub optimal results . thus query wildflowers might return pages that discuss wildflowers in specific u . s . states ( and not general information about wildflowers ) , while query houses for sale might return pages with real estate listings for locations other than that of interest to the person who issued the query . deciding whether an unseen query should produce mostly local or global pages without placing this burden on the search engine users is an important and challenging problem , because queries are often ambiguous or underspecify the information they are after . in this paper , we address this problem by first defining how to categorize queries according to their ( often implicit ) geographical locality . we then introduce several alternatives for automatically and efficiently categorizing queries in our scheme , using a variety of state of the art machine learning tools . we report a thorough evaluation of our classifiers using a large sample of queries from a real web search engine , and conclude by discussing how our query categorization approach can help improve query result quality ."}

{"title": "Integrating the Document Object Model with Hyperlinks for Enhanced Topic Distillation and Information Extraction", "abstract": "Topic distillation is the process of finding authoritative Web pages and comprehensive \"hubs\" which reciprocally endorse each other and are relevant to a given query. Hyperlink-based topic distillation has been traditionally applied to a macroscopic Web model where documents are nodes in a directed graph and hyperlinks are edges. Macroscopic models miss valuable clues such as banners, navigation panels , and template-based inclusions, which are embedded in HTML pages using markup tags. Consequently, results of macroscopic distillation algorithms have been deteriorating in quality as Web pages are becoming more complex. We propose a uniform fine-grained model for the Web in which pages are represented by their tag trees (also called their Document Object Models or DOMs) and these DOM trees are interconnected by ordinary hyperlinks. Surprisingly, macroscopic distillation algorithms do not work in the fine-grained scenario. We present a new algorithm suitable for the fine-grained model.

{"title": "Lower Bounds & Competitive Algorithms for Online Scheduling of Unit-Size Tasks to Related Machines", "abstract": "In this paper we study the problem of assigning unit-size tasks to related machines when only limited online information is provided to each task. This is a general framework whose special cases are the classical multiple-choice games for the assignment of unit-size tasks to identical machines. The latter case was the subject of intensive research for the last decade. The problem is intriguing in the sense that the natural extensions of the greedy oblivious schedulers, which are known to achieve near-optimal performance in the case of identical machines, are proved to perform quite poorly in the case of the related machines. In this work we present a rather surprising lower bound stating that any oblivious scheduler that assigns an arbitrary number of tasks to n related machines would need log n polls of machine loads per task, in order to achieve a constant competitive ratio versus the optimum offline assignment of the same input sequence to these machines . On the other hand, we prove that the missing information for an oblivious scheduler to perform almost optimally , is the amount of tasks to be inserted into the system. In particular, we provide an oblivious scheduler that only uses O(loglog n) polls, along with the additional information of the size of the input sequence, in order to achieve a constant competitive ratio vs. the optimum offline assignment .

{"title": "A New Approach to Intranet Search Based on Information Extraction", "abstract": "This paper is concerned with `intranet search'. By intranet search, we mean searching for information on an intranet within an organization. We have found that search needs on an intranet can be categorized into types, through an analysis of survey results and an analysis of search log data. The types include searching for definitions, persons, experts, and homepages. Traditional information retrieval only focuses on search of relevant documents, but not on search of special types of information. We propose a new approach to intranet search in which we search for information in each of the special types, in addition to the traditional relevance search. Information extraction technologies can play key roles in such kind of `search by type' approach, because we must first extract from the documents the necessary information in each type. We have developed an intranet search system called `Information Desk'. In the system, we try to address the most important types of search first - finding term definitions, homepages of groups or topics, employees' personal information and experts on topics. For each type of search, we use information extraction technologies to extract, fuse, and summarize information in advance.

In contrast to conventional privacy mechanisms that aim to prevent any access to individual records, we aim to restrict the set of queries that can be feasibly evaluated on the encrypted database.

The only feasible operation on an obfuscated record is to look up some attribute Y by supplying the value of another attribute X that appears in the same record (i.e., someone who does not know X cannot feasibly retrieve Y ). We then (i) generalize our construction to conjunctions of equality tests on any attributes of the database, and (ii) achieve a new property we call group privacy. This property ensures that it is easy to retrieve individual records or small subsets of records from the encrypted database by identifying them precisely, but \"mass harvesting\" queries matching a large number of records are computationally infeasible.

While integrating data for answering user queries, it often happens that inconsistencies arise, because some integrity constraints specified on peers' global schemas may be violated. In these cases, we may give semantics to the inconsistent system by suitably \"repairing\" the retrieved data, as typically done in the context of traditional data integration systems. However , some specific features of P2P systems, such as peer autonomy and peer preferences (e.g., different source trusting ), should be properly addressed to make the whole approach effective. In this paper, we face these issues that were only marginally considered in the literature. We first present a formal framework for reasoning about autonomous peers that exploit individual preference criteria in repairing the data. The idea is that queries should be answered over the best possible database repairs with respect to the preferences of all peers, i.e., the states on which they are able to find an agreement.

{"title": "Physiological Measures of Presence in Stressful Virtual Environments", "abstract": "A common measure of the quality or effectiveness of a virtual environment (VE) is the amount of presence it evokes in users. Presence is often defined as the sense of being there in a VE. There has been much debate about the best way to measure presence, and presence researchers need, and have sought, a measure that is reliable, valid, sensitive, and objective. We hypothesized that to the degree that a VE seems real, it would evoke physiological responses similar to those evoked by the corresponding real environment, and that greater presence would evoke a greater response.  To examine this, we conducted three experiments, the results of which support the use of physiological reaction as a reliable, valid, sensitive, and objective presence measure.  The experiments compared participants' physiological reactions to a non-threatening virtual room and their reactions to a stressful virtual height situation.  We found that change in heart rate satisfied our requirements for a measure of presence, change in skin conductance did to a lesser extent, and that change in skin temperature did not.   Moreover, the results showed that inclusion of a passive haptic element in the VE significantly increased presence and that for presence evoked: 30FPS &gt; 20FPS &gt; 15FPS.", "id": "55", "src": "physiological measures of presence in stressful virtual environments . a common measure of the quality or effectiveness of a virtual environment ( ve ) is the amount of presence it evokes in users . presence is often defined as the sense of being there in a ve . there has been much debate about the best way to measure presence , and presence researchers need , and have sought , a measure that is reliable , valid , sensitive , and objective . we hypothesized that to the degree that a ve seems real , it would evoke physiological responses similar to those evoked by the corresponding real environment , and that greater presence would evoke a greater response . to examine this , we conducted three experiments , the results of which support the use of physiological reaction as a reliable , valid , sensitive , and objective presence measure . the experiments compared participants ' physiological reactions to a non threatening virtual room and their reactions to a stressful virtual height situation . we found that change in heart rate satisfied our requirements for a measure of presence , change in skin conductance did to a lesser extent , and that change in skin temperature did not . moreover , the results showed that inclusion of a passive haptic element in the ve significantly increased presence and that for presence evoked 30fps &gt 20fps &gt 15fps ."}

{"title": "Preventing Attribute Information Leakage in Automated Trust Negotiation", "abstract": "Automated trust negotiation is an approach which establishes trust between strangers through the bilateral, iterative disclosure of digital credentials. Sensitive credentials are protected by access control policies which may also be communicated to the other party. Ideally, sensitive information should not be known by others unless its access control policy has been satisfied. However, due to bilateral information exchange, information may flow to others in a variety of forms, many of which cannot be protected by access control policies alone. In particular, sensitive information may be inferred by observing negotiation participants' behavior even when access control policies are strictly enforced. In this paper, we propose a general framework for the safety of trust negotiation systems. Compared to the existing safety model, our framework focuses on the actual information gain during trust negotiation instead of the exchanged messages. Thus, it directly reflects the essence of safety in sensitive information protection. Based on the proposed framework, we develop policy databases as a mechanism to help prevent unauthorized information inferences during trust negotiation. We show that policy databases achieve the same protection of sensitive information as existing solutions without imposing additional complications to the interaction between negotiation participants or restricting users' autonomy in defining their own policies.", "id": "57", "src": "preventing attribute information leakage in automated trust negotiation . automated trust negotiation is an approach which establishes trust between strangers through the bilateral , iterative disclosure of digital credentials . sensitive credentials are protected by access control policies which may also be communicated to the other party . ideally , sensitive information should not be known by others unless its access control policy has been satisfied . however , due to bilateral information exchange , information may flow to others in a variety of forms , many of which cannot be protected by access control policies alone . in particular , sensitive information may be inferred by observing negotiation participants ' behavior even when access control policies are strictly enforced . in this paper , we propose a general framework for the safety of trust negotiation systems . compared to the existing safety model , our framework focuses on the actual information gain during trust negotiation instead of the exchanged messages . thus , it directly reflects the essence of safety in sensitive information protection . based on the proposed framework , we develop policy databases as a mechanism to help prevent unauthorized information inferences during trust negotiation . we show that policy databases achieve the same protection of sensitive information as existing solutions without imposing additional complications to the interaction between negotiation participants or restricting users ' autonomy in defining their own policies ."}

{"title": "Publicly Verifiable Ownership Protection for Relational Databases", "abstract": "Today, watermarking techniques have been extended from the multimedia context to relational databases so as to protect the ownership of data even after the data are published or distributed. However , all existing watermarking schemes for relational databases are secret key based , thus require a secret key to be presented in proof of ownership. This means that the ownership can only be proven once to the public (e.g., to the court). After that, the secret key is known to the public and the embedded watermark can be easily destroyed by malicious users. Moreover, most of the existing techniques introduce distortions to the underlying data in the watermarking process, either by modifying least significant bits or exchanging categorical values. The distortions inevitably reduce the value of the data. In this paper, we propose a watermarking scheme by which the ownership of data can be publicly proven by anyone, as many times as necessary.

This superimposed model can be distinct from the model(s) employed by the sources in the base layer. An application that superimposes a new conceptual model over diverse sources, with varying capabilities, needs to accommodate the various types of information and differing access protocols for the base information sources.

Then, we propose a new method, protocol-aware ranking, where we make use of the packet sequence number (when available in transport header) to infer the number of non-sampled packets from a flow, and hence to improve the ranking. Surprisingly, our analytical and experimental results indicate that a high sampling rate (10% and even more depending on the number of top flows to be ranked) is required for a correct blind ranking of the largest flows.

{"title": "Ranking Target Objects of Navigational Queries", "abstract": "Web navigation plays an important role in exploring public interconnected data sources such as life science data. A navigational query in the life science graph produces a result graph which is a layered directed acyclic graph (DAG). Traversing the result paths in this graph reaches a target object set (TOS). The challenge for ranking the target objects is to provide recommendations that reflect the relative importance of the retrieved object, as well as its relevance to the specific query posed by the scientist. We present a metric layered graph PageRank (lgPR) to rank target objects based on the link structure of the result graph. LgPR is a modification of PageRank; it avoids random jumps to respect the path structure of the result graph.

{"title": "A Pseudo Random Coordinated Scheduling Algorithm for Bluetooth Scatternets", "abstract": "The emergence of Bluetooth as a default radio interface allows handheld devices to be rapidly interconnected into ad hoc networks. Bluetooth allows large numbers of piconets to form a scatternet using designated nodes that participate in multiple piconets. A unit that participates in multiple piconets can serve as a bridge and forwards traffic between neighbouring piconets. Since a Bluetooth unit can transmit or receive in only one piconet at a time, a bridging unit has to share its time among the different piconets. To schedule communication with bridging nodes one must take into account their availability in the different piconets, which represents a difficult , scatternet wide coordination problem and can be an important performance bottleneck in building scatternets. In this paper we propose the Pseudo-Random Coordinated Scatternet Scheduling (PCSS) algorithm to perform the scheduling of both intra and inter-piconet communication. In this algorithm Bluetooth nodes assign meeting points with their peers such that the sequence of meeting points follows a pseudo random process that is different for each pair of nodes. The uniqueness of the pseudo random sequence guarantees that the meeting points with different peers of the node will collide only occasionally. This removes the need for explicit information exchange between peer devices, which is a major advantage of the algorithm. The lack of explicit signaling between Bluetooth nodes makes it easy to deploy the PCSS algorithm in Bluetooth devices, while conformance to the current Bluetooth specification is also maintained. To assess the performance of the algorithm we define two reference case schedulers and perform simulations in a number of scenarios where we compare the performance of PCSS to the performance of the reference schedulers.", "id": "78", "src": "a pseudo random coordinated scheduling algorithm for bluetooth scatternets . the emergence of bluetooth as a default radio interface allows handheld devices to be rapidly interconnected into ad hoc networks . bluetooth allows large numbers of piconets to form a scatternet using designated nodes that participate in multiple piconets . a unit that participates in multiple piconets can serve as a bridge and forwards traffic between neighbouring piconets . since a bluetooth unit can transmit or receive in only one piconet at a time , a bridging unit has to share its time among the different piconets . to schedule communication with bridging nodes one must take into account their availability in the different piconets , which represents a difficult , scatternet wide coordination problem and can be an important performance bottleneck in building scatternets . in this paper we propose the pseudo random coordinated scatternet scheduling ( pcss ) algorithm to perform the scheduling of both intra and inter piconet communication . in this algorithm bluetooth nodes assign meeting points with their peers such that the sequence of meeting points follows a pseudo random process that is different for each pair of nodes . the uniqueness of the pseudo random sequence guarantees that the meeting points with different peers of the node will collide only occasionally . this removes the need for explicit information exchange between peer devices , which is a major advantage of the algorithm . the lack of explicit signaling between bluetooth nodes makes it easy to deploy the pcss algorithm in bluetooth devices , while conformance to the current bluetooth specification is also maintained . to assess the performance of the algorithm we define two reference case schedulers and perform simulations in a number of scenarios where we compare the performance of pcss to the performance of the reference schedulers ."}

{"title": "Scalable Data Aggregation for Dynamic Events in Sensor Networks", "abstract": "Computing and maintaining network structures for efficient data aggregation incurs high overhead for dynamic events where the set of nodes sensing an event changes with time. Moreover, structured approaches are sensitive to the waiting-time which is used by nodes to wait for packets from their children before forwarding the packet to the sink. Although structure-less approaches can address these issues, the performance does not scale well with the network size. We propose a semi-structured approach that uses a structure-less technique locally followed by Dynamic Forwarding on an implicitly constructed packet forwarding structure to support network scalability. The structure, ToD, is composed of multiple shortest path trees. After performing local aggregation , nodes dynamically decide the forwarding tree based on the location of the sources. The key principle behind ToD is that adjacent nodes in a graph will have low stretch in one of these trees in ToD, thus resulting in early aggregation of packets.

A key aspect of StyleCam is that it allows the author to significantly tailor what the user sees and when they see it. The resulting viewing experience can approach the visual richness and pacing of highly authored visual content such as television commercials or feature films. At the same time, StyleCam allows for a satisfying level of interactivity while avoiding the problems inherent in using unconstrained camera models. The main components of StyleCam are camera surfaces which spatially constrain the viewing camera; animation clips that allow for visually appealing transitions between different camera surfaces; and a simple, unified, interaction technique that permits the user to seamlessly and continuously move between spatial-control of the camera and temporal-control of the animated transitions. Further, the user's focus of attention is always kept on the content, and not on extraneous interface widgets.

First, we introduce a performance model for Cell and apply it to several key scientific computing kernels: dense matrix multiply, sparse matrix vector multiply, stencil computations , and 1D/2D FFTs. The difficulty of programming Cell, which requires assembly level intrinsics for the best performance, makes this model useful as an initial step in algorithm design and evaluation. Next, we validate the accuracy of our model by comparing results against published hardware results, as well as our own implementations on the Cell full system simulator. Additionally, we compare Cell performance to benchmarks run on leading superscalar (AMD Opteron), VLIW (Intel Itanium2), and vector (Cray X1E) architectures.

Our probabilistic detection framework is a combination of a shot classification step and a detection phase using hierarchical probabilistic models.

Additionally, the S-HSMM allows the duration information to be incorporated, consequently the modeling of long-term dependencies in videos is enriched through both hierarchical and duration modeling . Furthermore, the use of the Coxian distribution in the S-HSMM makes it tractable to deal with long sequences in video.

When developing service robot software, it is a challenging problem to design the robot architecture by carefully considering user needs and requirements, implement robot application components based on the architecture, and integrate these components in a systematic and comprehensive way for maintainability and reusability. Furthermore, it becomes more difficult to communicate among development teams and with others when many engineers from different teams participate in developing the service robot.  To solve these problems, we applied the COMET design method, which uses the industry-standard UML notation, to developing the software of an intelligent service robot for the elderly, called T-Rot, under development at Center for Intelligent Robotics (CIR).

{"title": "Unwanted Traffic in 3G Networks", "abstract": "The presence of \"unwanted\" (or background) traffic in the Internet is a well-known fact. In principle any network that has been engineered without taking its presence into account might experience troubles during periods of massive exposure to unwanted traffic, e.g. during large-scale infections.

Similar events might take place in 3G networks as well, with further potential complications arising from their high functional complexity and the scarcity of radio resources. For example, under certain hypothetical network configuration settings unwanted traffic, and specifically scanning traffic from infected Mobile Stations, can cause large-scale wastage of logical resources, and in extreme cases even starvation.

{"title": "Using Roles and Business Objects to Model and Understand Business Processes", "abstract": "Business process modeling focus on describing how activities interact with other business objects while sustaining the organization's strategy. Business objects are object-oriented representations of organizational concepts, such as resources and actors, which collaborate with one another in order to achieve business goals.

{"title": "Using Web Helper Agent Profiles in Query Generation", "abstract": "ABSTRACT Personalized information agents can help overcome some of the limitations of communal Web information sources such as portals and search engines. Two important components of these agents are: user profiles and information filtering or gathering services. Ideally, these components can be sep-arated so that a single user profile can be leveraged for a variety of information services. Toward that end, we are building an information agent called SurfAgent;in previous studies, we have developed and tested methods for automatically learning a user profile [20]. In this paper, we evaluate alternative methods for recommending new documents to a user by generating queries from the user profile and submitting them to a popular search engine. Our study focuses on three questions: How do different algorithms for query generation perform relative to each other? Is positive relevance feedback adequate to support the task? Can a user profile be learned independent of the service? We found that three algorithms appear to excel and that using only positive feedback does degrade the results somewhat.

Since coding mode decisions take up the most resources in video transcoding, a fast macro block (MB) mode estimation would lead to reduced complexity. The proposed approach is based on the hypothesis that MB coding mode decisions in H.264 video have a correlation with the distribution of the motion compensated residual in MPEG-2 video. We use machine learning tools to exploit the correlation and derive decision trees to classify the incoming MPEG-2 MBs into one of the 11 coding modes in H.264. The proposed approach reduces the H.264 MB mode computation process into a decision tree lookup with very low complexity. The proposed transcoder is compared with a reference transcoder comprised of a MPEG-2 decoder and an H.264 encoder.

{"title": "Accelerated Focused Crawling through Online Relevance Feedback", "abstract": "The organization of HTML into a tag tree structure, which is rendered by browsers as roughly rectangular regions with embedded text and HREF links, greatly helps surfers locate and click on links that best satisfy their information need. Can an automatic program emulate this human behavior and thereby learn to predict the relevance of an unseen HREF target page w.r.t. an information need, based on information limited to the HREF source page? Such a capability would be of great interest in focused crawling and resource discovery, because it can fine-tune the priority of unvisited URLs in the crawl frontier, and reduce the number of irrelevant pages which are fetched and discarded.

Additionally, there is a growing need for the seamless mobile and multi-modal system usage throughout the whole day to meet the requirements of the modern society (\"anytime, anywhere, anyhow\"). A personal information agent that is delivering the right information at the right time by accessing, filtering and presenting information in a situation-aware matter is needed. Applying Agent-technology is promising, because the inherent capabilities of agents like autonomy, pro- and reactiveness offer an adequate approach.

During the last ten years, substantial work has been done to understand the nature of wired IP traffic and it has been proven that IP traffic exhibits self-similar properties and burstiness over a large range of time scales. Recently, because of the large deployment of new wireless architectures, researchers have focused their attention towards understanding the nature of traffic carried by different wireless architecture and early studies have shown that wireless data traffic also exhibits strong long-range dependency. Thus, the classical tele-traffic theory based on a simple Markovian process cannot be used to evaluate the performance of wireless networks. Unfortunately, the area of understanding and modeling of different kinds of wireless traffic is still immature which constitutes a problem since it is crucial to guarantee tight bound QoS parameters to heterogeneous end users of the mobile Internet. In this paper, we make several contributions to the accurate modeling of wireless IP traffic by presenting a novel analytical model that takes into account four different classes of self-similar traffic.

{"title": "An expressive aspect language for system applications with Arachne", "abstract": "C applications, in particular those using operating system level services, frequently comprise multiple crosscutting concerns : network protocols and security are typical examples of such concerns. While these concerns can partially be addressed during design and implementation of an application, they frequently become an issue at runtime, e.g., to avoid server downtime. A deployed network protocol might not be efficient enough and may thus need to be replaced. Buffer overflows might be discovered that imply critical breaches in the security model of an application. A prefetching strategy may be required to enhance performance. While aspect-oriented programming seems attractive in this context, none of the current aspect systems is expressive and efficient enough to address such concerns. This paper presents a new aspect system to provide a solution to this problem. While efficiency considerations have played an important part in the design of the aspect language, the language allows aspects to be expressed more concisely than previous approaches. In particular, it allows aspect programmers to quantify over sequences of execution points as well as over accesses through variable aliases. We show how the former can be used to modularize the replacement of network protocols and the latter to prevent buffer overflows. We also present an implementation of the language as an extension of Arachne, a dynamic weaver for C applications.

A 3D device allows the specification of complex 3D motion, while virtual tools are visible mediators that live in the same 3D space as application objects and supply the interaction metaphors to control them.  In our environment, there is no intrinsic difference between user interface and application objects. Multi-way constraints provide the necessary tight coupling among components that makes it possible to seamlessly compose animated and interactive behaviors. By recording the effects of manipulations, all the expressive power of the 3D user interface is exploited to define animations. Effective editing of recorded manipulations is made possible by compacting all continuous parameter evolutions with an incremental data-reduction algorithm, designed to preserve both geometry and timing. The automatic generation of editable representations of interactive performances overcomes one of the major limitations of current performance animation systems. Novel interactive solutions to animation problems are made possible by the tight integration of all system components.

{"title": "Attack-Resilient Hierarchical Data Aggregation in Sensor Networks", "abstract": "In a large sensor network, in-network data aggregation, i.e., combining partial results at intermediate nodes during message routing, significantly reduces the amount of communication and hence the energy consumed. Recently several researchers have proposed robust aggregation frameworks, which combine multi-path routing schemes with duplicate-insensitive algorithms, to accurately compute aggregates (e.g., Sum, Count, Average) in spite of message losses resulting from node and transmission failures. However, these aggregation frameworks have been designed without security in mind. Given the lack of hardware support for tamper-resistance and the unattended nature of sensor nodes, sensor networks are highly vulnerable to node compromises. We show that even if a few compromised nodes contribute false sub-aggregate values, this results in large errors in the aggregate computed at the root of the hierarchy.

{"title": "Automatic Extraction of Titles from General Documents using Machine Learning", "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a machine learning approach to title extraction from general documents. By general documents, we mean documents that can belong to any one of a number of specific genres, including presentations, book chapters, technical papers, brochures, reports, and letters. Previously, methods have been proposed mainly for title extraction from research papers. It has not been clear whether it could be possible to conduct automatic title extraction from general documents. As a case study, we consider extraction from Office including Word and PowerPoint. In our approach, we annotate titles in sample documents (for Word and PowerPoint respectively) and take them as training data, train machine learning models, and perform title extraction using the trained models. Our method is unique in that we mainly utilize formatting information such as font size as features in the models. It turns out that the use of formatting information can lead to quite accurate extraction from general documents.

{"title": "Autonomous and Distributed Node Recovery in Wireless Sensor Networks", "abstract": "Intrusion or misbehaviour detection systems are an important and widely accepted security tool in computer and wireless sensor networks. Their aim is to detect misbehaving or faulty nodes in order to take appropriate countermeasures, thus limiting the damage caused by adversaries as well as by hard or software faults. So far, however, once detected, misbehaving nodes have just been isolated from the rest of the sensor network and hence are no longer usable by running applications. In the presence of an adversary or software faults, this proceeding will inevitably lead to an early and complete loss of the whole network. For this reason, we propose to no longer expel misbehaving nodes, but to recover them into normal operation. In this paper, we address this problem and present a formal specification of what is considered a secure and correct node recovery algorithm together with a distributed algorithm that meets these properties. We discuss its requirements on the soft- and hardware of a node and show how they can be fulfilled with current and upcoming technologies. The algorithm is evaluated analytically as well as by means of extensive simulations, and the findings are compared to the outcome of a real implementation for the BTnode sensor platform. The results show that recovering sensor nodes is an expensive, though feasible and worthwhile task.

{"title": "Black-Box Constructions for Secure Computation", "abstract": "It is well known that the secure computation of non-trivial functionalities in the setting of no honest majority requires computational assumptions. We study the way such computational assumptions are used. Specifically, we ask whether the secure protocol can use the underlying primitive (e.g., one-way trapdoor permutation) in a black-box way, or must it be nonblack-box (by referring to the code that computes this primitive)? Despite the fact that many general constructions of cryptographic schemes (e.g., CPA-secure encryption ) refer to the underlying primitive in a black-box way only, there are some constructions that are inherently nonblack-box. Indeed, all known constructions of protocols for general secure computation that are secure in the presence of a malicious adversary and without an honest majority use the underlying primitive in a nonblack-box way (requiring to prove in zero-knowledge statements that relate to the primitive). In this paper, we study whether such nonblack-box use is essential. We present protocols that use only black-box access to a family of (enhanced) trapdoor permutations or to a homomorphic public-key encryption scheme. The result is a protocol whose communication complexity is independent of the computational complexity of the underlying primitive (e.g., a trapdoor permutation) and whose computational complexity grows only linearly with that of the underlying primitive.

In this paper, we revisit the compression of inverted lists of document postings that store the position and frequency of indexed terms, considering two approaches to improving retrieval efficiency:better implementation and better choice of integer compression schemes. First, we propose several simple optimisations to well-known integer compression schemes, and show experimentally that these lead to significant reductions in time. Second, we explore the impact of choice of compression scheme on retrieval efficiency. In experiments on large collections of data, we show two surprising results:use of simple byte-aligned codes halves the query evaluation time compared to the most compact Golomb-Rice bitwise compression schemes; and, even when an index fits entirely in memory, byte-aligned codes result in faster query evaluation than does an uncompressed index, emphasising that the cost of transferring data from memory to the CPU cache is less for an appropriately compressed index than for an uncompressed index. Moreover, byte-aligned schemes have only a modest space overhead:the most compact schemes result in indexes that are around 10% of the size of the collection, while a byte-aligned scheme is around 13%.

Computing consistent answers to conjunctive queries is generally coNP-hard in data complexity, even in the presence of very restricted forms of ICs (single, unary keys). Recent studies on consistent query answering for database schemas containing only key dependencies have an-alyzed the possibility of identifying classes of queries whose consistent answers can be obtained by a first-order rewriting of the query, which in turn can be easily formulated in SQL and directly evaluated through any relational DBMS. In this paper we study consistent query answering in the presence of key dependencies and exclusion dependencies.

All data sharing of both graphical and non-graphical data is done via general-purpose remote and replicated objects, presenting the illusion of a single distributed shared memory. Graphical objects are directly distributed, circumventing the \"duplicate database\" problem and allowing programmers to focus on the application details. Repo-3D is embedded in Repo, an interpreted, lexically-scoped, distributed programming language, allowing entire applications to be rapidly prototyped. We discuss Repo-3D's design, and introduce the notion of local variations to the graphical objects, which allow local changes to be applied to shared graphical structures.

{"title": "Coupling Feature Selection and Machine Learning Methods for Navigational Query Identification", "abstract": "It is important yet hard to identify navigational queries in Web search due to a lack of sufficient information in Web queries, which are typically very short. In this paper we study several machine learning methods, including naive Bayes model, maximum entropy model, support vector machine (SVM), and stochastic gradient boosting tree (SGBT), for navigational query identification in Web search. To boost the performance of these machine techniques, we exploit several feature selection methods and propose coupling feature selection with classification approaches to achieve the best performance. Different from most prior work that uses a small number of features, in this paper, we study the problem of identifying navigational queries with thousands of available features, extracted from major commercial search engine results, Web search user click data, query log, and the whole Web's relational content. A multi-level feature extraction system is constructed. Our results on real search data show that 1) Among all the features we tested, user click distribution features are the most important set of features for identifying navigational queries. 2) In order to achieve good performance, machine learning approaches have to be coupled with good feature selection methods. We find that gradient boosting tree, coupled with linear SVM feature selection is most effective. 3) With carefully coupled feature selection and classification approaches, navigational queries can be accurately identified with 88.1% F1 score, which is 33% error rate reduction compared to the best uncoupled system, and 40% error rate reduction compared to a well tuned system without feature selection.", "id": "169", "src": "coupling feature selection and machine learning methods for navigational query identification . it is important yet hard to identify navigational queries in web search due to a lack of sufficient information in web queries , which are typically very short . in this paper we study several machine learning methods , including naive bayes model , maximum entropy model , support vector machine ( svm ) , and stochastic gradient boosting tree ( sgbt ) , for navigational query identification in web search . to boost the performance of these machine techniques , we exploit several feature selection methods and propose coupling feature selection with classification approaches to achieve the best performance . different from most prior work that uses a small number of features , in this paper , we study the problem of identifying navigational queries with thousands of available features , extracted from major commercial search engine results , web search user click data , query log , and the whole web ' s relational content . a multi level feature extraction system is constructed . our results on real search data show that 1 ) among all the features we tested , user click distribution features are the most important set of features for identifying navigational queries . 2 ) in order to achieve good performance , machine learning approaches have to be coupled with good feature selection methods . we find that gradient boosting tree , coupled with linear svm feature selection is most effective . 3 ) with carefully coupled feature selection and classification approaches , navigational queries can be accurately identified with <digit> . 1 f1 score , which is <digit> error rate reduction compared to the best uncoupled system , and <digit> error rate reduction compared to a well tuned system without feature selection ."}

{"title": "Data Mining in Metric Space: An Empirical Analysis of Supervised Learning Performance Criteria", "abstract": "Many criteria can be used to evaluate the performance of supervised learning. Different criteria are appropriate in different settings, and it is not always clear which criteria to use. A further complication is that learning methods that perform well on one criterion may not perform well on other criteria. For example, SVMs and boosting are designed to optimize accuracy, whereas neural nets typically optimize squared error or cross entropy. We conducted an empirical study using a variety of learning methods (SVMs, neural nets, k-nearest neighbor, bagged and boosted trees, and boosted stumps) to compare nine boolean classification performance metrics: Accuracy, Lift, F-Score, Area under the ROC Curve, Average Precision, Precision/Recall Break-Even Point, Squared Error, Cross Entropy, and Probability Calibration. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) shows that these metrics span a low dimensional manifold. The three metrics that are appropriate when predictions are interpreted as probabilities: squared error, cross entropy, and calibration, lay in one part of metric space far away from metrics that depend on the relative order of the predicted values: ROC area, average precision, break-even point, and lift. In between them fall two metrics that depend on comparing predictions to a threshold: accuracy and F-score. As expected, maximum margin methods such as SVMs and boosted trees have excellent performance on metrics like accuracy , but perform poorly on probability metrics such as squared error. What was not expected was that the margin methods have excellent performance on ordering metrics such as ROC area and average precision. We introduce a new metric, SAR, that combines squared error, accuracy, and ROC area into one metric.

{"title": "dBBlue: Low Diameter and Self-routing Bluetooth Scatternet", "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of scatternet formation for single-hop Bluetooth based ad hoc networks, with minimal communication overhead. We adopt the well-known structure de Bruijn graph to form the backbone of Bluetooth scatternet, hereafter called dBBlue, such that every master node has at most seven slaves, every slave node is in at most two piconets, and no node assumes both master and slave roles. Our structure dBBlue also enjoys a nice routing property: the diameter of the graph is O(log n) and we can find a path with at most O(log n) hops for every pair of nodes without any routing table . Moreover, the congestion of every node is at most O(log n/n), assuming that a unit of total traffic demand is equally distributed among all pair of nodes. We discuss in detail a vigorous method to locally update the structure dBBlue using at most O(log n) communications when a node joins or leaves the network. In most cases, the cost of updating the scatternet is actually O(1) since a node can join or leave without affecting the remaining scatternet. The number of nodes affected when a node joins or leaves the network is always bounded from above by a constant. To facilitate self-routing and easy updating, we design a scalable MAC assigning mechanism for piconet, which guarantees the packet delivery during scatternet updating. The dBBlue scatternet can be constructed incrementally when the nodes join the network one by one.

{"title": "Diagnosis of TCP Overlay Connection Failures using Bayesian Networks", "abstract": "When failures occur in Internet overlay connections today, it is difficult for users to determine the root cause of failure. An overlay connection may require TCP connections between a series of overlay nodes to succeed, but accurately determining which of these connections has failed is difficult for users without access to the internal workings of the overlay. Diagnosis using active probing is costly and may be inaccurate if probe packets are filtered or blocked. To address this problem, we develop a passive diagnosis approach that infers the most likely cause of failure using a Bayesian network modeling the conditional probability of TCP failures given the IP addresses of the hosts along the overlay path. We collect TCP failure data for 28.3 million TCP connections using data from the new Planetseer overlay monitoring system and train a Bayesian network for the diagnosis of overlay connection failures .

We examine query traffic on an hourly basis by matching it against lists of queries that have been topically pre-categorized by human editors. This represents 13% of the query traffic.

{"title": "Efficient Multi-way Text Categorization via Generalized Discriminant Analysis", "abstract": "Text categorization is an important research area and has been receiving much attention due to the growth of the on-line information and of Internet. Automated text categorization is generally cast as a multi-class classification problem. Much of previous work focused on binary document classification problems. Support vector machines (SVMs) excel in binary classification, but the elegant theory behind large-margin hyperplane cannot be easily extended to multi-class text classification. In addition, the training time and scaling are also important concerns. On the other hand, other techniques naturally extensible to handle multi-class classification are generally not as accurate as SVM. This paper presents a simple and efficient solution to multi-class text categorization. Classification problems are first formulated as optimization via discriminant analysis . Text categorization is then cast as the problem of finding coordinate transformations that reflects the inherent similarity from the data. While most of the previous approaches decompose a multiclass classification problem into multiple independent binary classification tasks, the proposed approach enables direct multi-class classification. By using Generalized Singular Value Decomposition (GSVD), a coordinate transformation that reflects the inherent class structure indicated by the generalized singular values is identified.

These relationships capture both a connectivity of entities as well as similarity of entities based on a specific notion of similarity called -isomorphism.

In the context of a graph model such as that for RDF, Semantic Associations amount to specific certain graph signatures. Specifically, they refer to sequences (i.e. directed paths) here called Property Sequences, between entities, networks of Property Sequences (i.e. undirected paths), or subgraphs of \u03c1-isomorphic Property Sequences. The ability to query about the existence of such relationships is fundamental to tasks in analytical domains such as national security and business intelligence, where tasks often focus on finding complex yet meaningful and obscured relationships between entities.  However, support for such queries is lacking in contemporary query systems, including those for RDF.

{"title": "Energy Management Schemes for Memory-Resident Database Systems", "abstract": "With the tremendous growth of system memories, memory-resident databases are increasingly becoming important in various domains. Newer memories provide a structured way of storing data in multiple chips, with each chip having a bank of memory modules. Current memory-resident databases are yet to take full advantage of the banked storage system, which offers a lot of room for performance and energy optimizations. In this paper, we identify the implications of a banked memory environment in supporting memory-resident databases, and propose hardware (memory-directed) and software (query-directed) schemes to reduce the energy consumption of queries executed on these databases. Our results show that high-level query-directed schemes (hosted in the query optimizer) better utilize the low-power modes in reducing the energy consumption than the respective hardware schemes (hosted in the memory controller), due to their complete knowledge of query access patterns. We extend this further and propose a query restructuring scheme and a multi-query optimization . Queries are restructured and regrouped based on their table access patterns to maximize the likelihood that data accesses are clustered. This helps increase the inter-access idle times of memory modules, which in turn enables a more effective control of their energy behavior. This heuristic is eventually integrated with our hardware optimizations to achieve maximum savings.

First, we outline the connection between large margin optimization and statistical learning and see why this paradigm is successful for many pattern recognition problems.

We rather use both evolution strategies and particle swarm optimization in order to directly solve the posed constrained optimization problem. Transforming the problem into the Wolfe dual reduces the total runtime and allows the usage of kernel functions. Exploiting the knowledge about this optimization problem leads to a hybrid mutation which further decreases convergence time while classification accuracy is preserved. We will show that evolutionary SVMs are at least as accurate as their quadratic programming counterparts on six real-world benchmark data sets.

While, in general, any algorithm might benefit from compressed data because of reduced paging requirements, we identified two natural candidates that would further benefit from order-preserving compression, namely string-oriented sorting algorithms and word-RAM algorithms for keys of bounded length. The word-RAM model has some of the fastest known sorting algorithms in practice. These algorithms are designed for keys of bounded length, usually 32 or 64 bits, which limits their direct applicability for strings. One possibility is to use an order-preserving compression scheme, so that a bounded-key-length algorithm can be applied.

{"title": "Focused Named Entity Recognition Using Machine Learning", "abstract": "In this paper we study the problem of finding most topical named entities among all entities in a document, which we refer to as focused named entity recognition. We show that these focused named entities are useful for many natural language processing applications, such as document summarization , search result ranking, and entity detection and tracking. We propose a statistical model for focused named entity recognition by converting it into a classification problem . We then study the impact of various linguistic features and compare a number of classification algorithms. From experiments on an annotated Chinese news corpus, we demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve near human-level accuracy.", "id": "205", "src": "focused named entity recognition using machine learning . in this paper we study the problem of finding most topical named entities among all entities in a document , which we refer to as focused named entity recognition . we show that these focused named entities are useful for many natural language processing applications , such as document summarization , search result ranking , and entity detection and tracking . we propose a statistical model for focused named entity recognition by converting it into a classification problem . we then study the impact of various linguistic features and compare a number of classification algorithms . from experiments on an annotated chinese news corpus , we demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve near human level accuracy ."}
{"title": "Formally Deriving an STG Machine", "abstract": "Starting from P. Sestoft semantics for lazy evaluation, we define a new semantics in which normal forms consist of variables pointing to lambdas or constructions. This is in accordance with the more recent changes in the Spineless Tagless G-machine (STG) machine, where constructions only appear in closures (lambdas only appeared in closures already in previous versions). We prove the equivalence between the new semantics and Sestoft's. Then, a sequence of STG machines are derived, formally proving the correctness of each derivation. The last machine consists of a few imperative instructions and its distance to a conventional language is minimal. The paper also discusses the differences between the final machine and the actual STG machine implemented in the Glasgow Haskell Compiler.", "id": "206", "src": "formally deriving an stg machine . starting from p . sestoft semantics for lazy evaluation , we define a new semantics in which normal forms consist of variables pointing to lambdas or constructions . this is in accordance with the more recent changes in the spineless tagless g machine ( stg ) machine , where constructions only appear in closures ( lambdas only appeared in closures already in previous versions ) . we prove the equivalence between the new semantics and sestoft ' s . then , a sequence of stg machines are derived , formally proving the correctness of each derivation . the last machine consists of a few imperative instructions and its distance to a conventional language is minimal . the paper also discusses the differences between the final machine and the actual stg machine implemented in the glasgow haskell compiler ."}
{"title": "Building Bridges for Web Query Classification", "abstract": "Web query classification (QC) aims to classify Web users' queries, which are often short and ambiguous, into a set of target categories. QC has many applications including page ranking in Web search, targeted advertisement in response to queries, and personalization. In this paper, we present a novel approach for QC that outperforms the winning solution of the ACM KDDCUP 2005 competition, whose objective is to classify 800,000 real user queries. In our approach, we first build a bridging classifier on an intermediate taxonomy in an offline mode. This classifier is then used in an online mode to map user queries to the target categories via the above intermediate taxonomy. A major innovation is that by leveraging the similarity distribution over the intermediate taxonomy, we do not need to retrain a new classifier for each new set of target categories, and therefore the bridging classifier needs to be trained only once. In addition, we introduce category selection as a new method for narrowing down the scope of the intermediate taxonomy based on which we classify the queries. Category selection can improve both efficiency and effectiveness of the online classification. By combining our algorithm with the winning solution of KDDCUP 2005, we made an improvement by 9.7% and 3.8% in terms of precision and F1 respectively compared with the best results of KDDCUP 2005.", "id": "207", "src": "building bridges for web query classification . web query classification ( qc ) aims to classify web users ' queries , which are often short and ambiguous , into a set of target categories . qc has many applications including page ranking in web search , targeted advertisement in response to queries , and personalization . in this paper , we present a novel approach for qc that outperforms the winning solution of the acm kddcup <digit> competition , whose objective is to classify <digit> , <digit> real user queries . in our approach , we first build a bridging classifier on an intermediate taxonomy in an offline mode . this classifier is then used in an online mode to map user queries to the target categories via the above intermediate taxonomy . a major innovation is that by leveraging the similarity distribution over the intermediate taxonomy , we do not need to retrain a new classifier for each new set of target categories , and therefore the bridging classifier needs to be trained only once . in addition , we introduce category selection as a new method for narrowing down the scope of the intermediate taxonomy based on which we classify the queries . category selection can improve both efficiency and effectiveness of the online classification . by combining our algorithm with the winning solution of kddcup <digit> , we made an improvement by 9 . 7 and 3 . 8 in terms of precision and f1 respectively compared with the best results of kddcup <digit> ."}
{"title": "Geographically Focused Collaborative Crawling", "abstract": "A collaborative crawler is a group of crawling nodes, in which each crawling node is responsible for a specific portion of the web. We study the problem of collecting geographically -aware pages using collaborative crawling strategies. We first propose several collaborative crawling strategies for the geographically focused crawling, whose goal is to collect web pages about specified geographic locations, by considering features like URL address of page, content of page, extended anchor text of link, and others. Later, we propose various evaluation criteria to qualify the performance of such crawling strategies. Finally, we experimentally study our crawling strategies by crawling the real web data showing that some of our crawling strategies greatly outperform the simple URL-hash based partition collaborative crawling, in which the crawling assignments are determined according to the hash-value computation over URLs. More precisely, features like URL address of page and extended anchor text of link are shown to yield the best overall performance for the geographically focused crawling.", "id": "208", "src": "geographically focused collaborative crawling . a collaborative crawler is a group of crawling nodes , in which each crawling node is responsible for a specific portion of the web . we study the problem of collecting geographically aware pages using collaborative crawling strategies . we first propose several collaborative crawling strategies for the geographically focused crawling , whose goal is to collect web pages about specified geographic locations , by considering features like url address of page , content of page , extended anchor text of link , and others . later , we propose various evaluation criteria to qualify the performance of such crawling strategies . finally , we experimentally study our crawling strategies by crawling the real web data showing that some of our crawling strategies greatly outperform the simple url hash based partition collaborative crawling , in which the crawling assignments are determined according to the hash value computation over urls . more precisely , features like url address of page and extended anchor text of link are shown to yield the best overall performance for the geographically focused crawling ."}
{"title": "GraalBench: A 3D Graphics Benchmark Suite for Mobile Phones", "abstract": "In this paper we consider implementations of embedded 3D graphics and provide evidence indicating that 3D benchmarks employed for desktop computers are not suitable for mobile environments. Consequently, we present GraalBench, a set of 3D graphics workloads representative for contemporary and emerging mobile devices . In addition, we present detailed simulation results for a typical rasterization pipeline. The results show that the proposed benchmarks use only a part of the resources offered by current 3D graphics libraries. For instance, while each benchmark uses the texturing unit for more than 70% of the generated fragments, the alpha unit is employed for less than 13% of the fragments. The Fog unit was used for 84% of the fragments by one benchmark, but the other benchmarks did not use it at all. Our experiments on the proposed suite suggest that the texturing, depth and blending units should be implemented in hardware, while, for instance, the dithering unit may be omitted from a hardware implementation. Finally, we discuss the architectural implications of the obtained results for hardware implementations.", "id": "209", "src": "graalbench a 3d graphics benchmark suite for mobile phones . in this paper we consider implementations of embedded 3d graphics and provide evidence indicating that 3d benchmarks employed for desktop computers are not suitable for mobile environments . consequently , we present graalbench , a set of 3d graphics workloads representative for contemporary and emerging mobile devices . in addition , we present detailed simulation results for a typical rasterization pipeline . the results show that the proposed benchmarks use only a part of the resources offered by current 3d graphics libraries . for instance , while each benchmark uses the texturing unit for more than <digit> of the generated fragments , the alpha unit is employed for less than <digit> of the fragments . the fog unit was used for <digit> of the fragments by one benchmark , but the other benchmarks did not use it at all . our experiments on the proposed suite suggest that the texturing , depth and blending units should be implemented in hardware , while , for instance , the dithering unit may be omitted from a hardware implementation . finally , we discuss the architectural implications of the obtained results for hardware implementations ."}
