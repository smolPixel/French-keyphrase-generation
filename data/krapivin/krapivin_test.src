{"title": "Enhancing Product Recommender Systems on Sparse Binary Data.", "abstract": "Commercial recommender systems use various data mining techniques to make appropriate recommendations to users during online, real-time sessions. Published algorithms focus more on the discrete user ratings instead of binary results, which hampers their predictive capabilities when usage data is sparse. The system proposed in this paper, e-VZpro, is an association mining-based recommender tool designed to overcome these problems through a two-phase approach. In the first phase, batches of customer historical data are analyzed through association mining in order to determine the association rules for the second phase. During the second phase, a scoring algorithm is used to rank the recommendations online for the customer. The second phase differs from the traditional approach and an empirical comparison between the methods used in e-VZpro and other collaborative filtering methods including dependency networks, item-based, and association mining is provided in this paper. This comparison evaluates the algorithms used in each of the above methods using two internal customer datasets and a benchmark dataset. The results of this comparison clearly show that e-VZpro performs well compared to dependency networks and association mining.

It provides a semantics for individuals that explicitly models their identity through time and across alternative possible histories; and enables one to distinguish between necessary and extensional identity of individuals. In virtue of its treatment of individuals and count nouns, the formalism offers a solution to certain puzzles of identity, which arise when individuals are described in different ways.

{"title": "A model of BGP routing for network engineering.", "abstract": "The performance of IP networks depends on a wide variety of dynamic conditions. Traffic shifts, equipment failures, planned maintenance, and topology changes in other parts of the Internet can all degrade performance. To maintain good performance, network operators must continually reconfigure the routing protocols. Operators configure BGP to control how traffic flows to neighboring Autonomous Systems (ASes), as well as how traffic traverses their networks. However, because BGP route selection is distributed, indirectly controlled by configurable policies, and influenced by complex interactions with intradomain routing protocols, operators cannot predict how a particular BGP configuration would behave in practice. To avoid inadvertently degrading network performance, operators need to evaluate the effects of configuration changes before deploying them on a live network. We propose an algorithm that computes the outcome of the BGP route selection process for each router in a single AS, given only a static snapshot of the network state, without simulating the complex details of BGP message passing. We describe a BGP emulator based on this algorithm; the emulator exploits the unique characteristics of routing data to reduce computational overhead.

{"title": "Establishing wireless conference calls under delay constraints.", "abstract": "A prevailing feature of mobile telephony systems is that the cell where a mobile user is located may be unknown. Therefore, when the system is to establish a call between users, it may need to search, or page, all the cells that it suspects the users are located in, to find the cells where the users currently reside. The search consumes expensive wireless links and so it is desirable to develop search techniques that page as few cells as possible.We consider cellular systems with c cells and m mobile users roaming among the cells. The location of the users is uncertain as given by m probability distribution vectors. Whenever the system needs to find specific users, it conducts a search operation lasting some number of rounds (the delay constraint). In each round, the system may check an arbitrary subset of cells to see which users are located there. In this setting the problem of finding one user with minimum expected number of cells searched is known to be solved optimally in polynomial time.In this paper we address the problem of finding several users with the same optimization goal.

This research aims to mitigate such problems by creating a new mode selector that examines the current situation, then chooses a mode that has been successful in the past, in situations like the current one. The technique, called program steering, creates a new mode selector via machine learning from good behavior in testing or in successful operation.

{"title": "Optimal Time Bounds for Approximate Clustering.", "abstract": "Clustering is a fundamental problem in unsupervised learning, and has been studied widely both as a problem of learning mixture models and as an optimization problem. In this paper, we study clustering with respect to the k-median objective function, a natural formulation of clustering in which we attempt to minimize the average distance to cluster centers. One of the main contributions of this paper is a simple but powerful sampling technique that we call successive sampling that could be of independent interest. We show that our sampling procedure can rapidly identify a small set of points (of size just O(k log \\frac{n}{k})) that summarize the input points for the purpose of clustering. Using successive sampling, we develop an algorithm for the k-median problem that runs in O(nk) time for a wide range of values of k and is guaranteed, with high probability, to return a solution with cost at most a constant factor times optimal. We also establish a lower bound of (nk) on any randomized constant-factor approximation algorithm for the k-median problem that succeeds with even a negligible (say \\frac{1}{100}) probability. The best previous upper bound for the problem was (nk), where the -notation hides polylogarithmic factors in n and k. The best previous lower bound of (nk) applied only to deterministic k-median algorithms.

The goal is to produce a partition of the vertices (a clustering) that agrees as much as possible with the edge labels. That is, we want a clustering that maximizes the number of + edges within clusters, plus the number of  edges between clusters (equivalently, minimizes the number of disagreements: the number of  edges inside clusters plus the number of + edges between clusters). This formulation is motivated from a document clustering problem in which one has a pairwise similarity function f learned from past data, and the goal is to partition the current set of documents in a way that correlates with f as much as possible&semi; it can also be viewed as a kind of agnostic learning problem.An interesting feature of this clustering formulation is that one does not need to specify the number of clusters k as a separate parameter, as in measures such as k-median or min-sum or min-max clustering. Instead, in our formulation, the optimal number of clusters could be any value between 1 and n, depending on the edge labels.

{"title": "Untangling of 2D meshes in ALE simulations.", "abstract": "A procedure is presented to untangle unstructured 2D meshes containing inverted elements by node repositioning. The inverted elements may result from node movement in Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) simulations of continuum mechanics problems with large shear deformation such as fluid flow and metal forming. Meshes with inverted elements may also be created due to the limitations of mesh generation algorithms particularly for nonsimplicial mesh generation.

This family of shifted systems arises, for example, in Tikhonov regularization and computations in lattice quantum chromodynamics. For each single shift  this system can be solved using the conjugate gradient method for least squares problems (CGLS). In literature various implementations of the, so-called, multishift CGLS methods have been proposed. These methods are mathematically equivalent to applying the CGLS method to each shifted system separately but they solve all systems simultaneously and require only two matrix-vector products (one by A and one by AT) and two inner products per iteration step. Unfortunately, numerical experiments show that, due to roundoff errors, in some cases these implementations of the multishift CGLS method can only attain an accuracy that depends on the square of condition number of the matrix A. In this paper we will argue that, in the multishift CGLS method, the impact on the attainable accuracy of rounding errors in the Lanczos part of the method is independent of the effect of roundoff errors made in the construction of the iterates.

{"title": "Unifying proof methodologies of duration calculus and timed linear temporal logic.", "abstract": "Linear temporal logic (LTL) has been widely used for specification and verification of reactive systems. Its standard model is sequences of states (or state transitions), and formulas describe sequencing of state transitions. When LTL is used to model real-time systems, a state is extended with a time stamp to record when a state transition takes place. Duration calculus (DC) is another well studied approach for real-time systems development. DC models behaviours of a system by functions from the domain of reals representing time to the system states. This paper extends this time domain to the Cartesian product of the real and the natural numbers. With the extended time domain, we provide the chop modality with a non-overlapping interpretation. This allows some linear temporal operators explicitly dealing with the discrete dimension of time to be derivable from the chop modality in essentially the same way that their continuous-time counterparts are in the classical DC. This provides a nice embedding of some timed LTL (TLTL) modalities into DC to unify the methods from DC and LTL for real-time systems development: Requirements and high level design decisions are interval properties and are therefore specified and reasoned about in DC, while properties of an implementation, as well as the refinement relation between two implementations, are specified and verified compositionally and inductively in LTL.

{"title": "Admission control with immediate notification.", "abstract": "When admission control is used, an on-line scheduler chooses whether or not to complete each individual job successfully by its deadline. An important consideration is at what point in time the scheduler determines if a job request will be satisfied, and thus at what point the scheduler is able to provide notification to the job owner as to the fate of the request. In the loosest model, often seen in real-time systems, such a decision can be deferred up until the job's deadline passes. In the strictest model, more suitable for customer-based applications, a scheduler would be required to give notification at the instant that a job request arrives.Unfortunately there seems to be little existing research which explicitly studies the effect of the notification model on the performance guarantees of a scheduler. We undertake such a study by reexamining a problem from the literature. Specifically, we study the effect of the notification model on the non-preemptive scheduling of a single resource in order to maximize utilization. At first glance, it appears severely more restrictive to compare a scheduler required to give immediate notification to one which need not give any notification.

We show that this category--in contradistinction to Top0--is a cartesian closed category. The direct proof outlined here uses the equivalence of the category Equ to the category PEqu of PERs over algebraic lattices (a full subcategory of Top0 that is well known to be cartesian closed from domain theory). In another paper with Carboni and Rosolini (cited herein), a more abstract categorical generalization shows why many such categories are cartesian closed. The category Equ obviously contains Top0 as a full subcategory, and it naturally contains many other well known subcategories.

{"title": "Optimistic register coalescing.", "abstract": "Graph-coloring register allocators eliminate copies by coalescing the source and target nodes of a copy if they do not interfere in the interference graph. Coalescing, however, can be harmful to the colorability of the graph because it tends to yield a graph with nodes of higher degrees. Unlike aggressive coalescing, which coalesces any pair of noninterfering copy-related nodes, conservative coalescing or iterated coalescing perform safe coalescing that preserves the colorability. Unfortunately, these heuristics give up coalescing too early, losing many opportunities for coalescing that would turn out to be safe. Moreover, they ignore the fact that coalescing may even improve the colorability of the graph by reducing the degree of neighbor nodes that are interfering with both the source and target nodes being coalesced. This article proposes a new heuristic called optimistic coalescing which optimistically performs aggressive coalescing, thus exploiting the positive impact of coalescing aggressively, but when a coalesced node is to be spilled, it is split back into separate nodes. Since there is a better chance of coloring one of those splits, we can reduce the overall spill amount.", "id": "37", "src": "optimistic register coalescing . . graph coloring register allocators eliminate copies by coalescing the source and target nodes of a copy if they do not interfere in the interference graph . coalescing , however , can be harmful to the colorability of the graph because it tends to yield a graph with nodes of higher degrees . unlike aggressive coalescing , which coalesces any pair of noninterfering copy related nodes , conservative coalescing or iterated coalescing perform safe coalescing that preserves the colorability . unfortunately , these heuristics give up coalescing too early , losing many opportunities for coalescing that would turn out to be safe . moreover , they ignore the fact that coalescing may even improve the colorability of the graph by reducing the degree of neighbor nodes that are interfering with both the source and target nodes being coalesced . this article proposes a new heuristic called optimistic coalescing which optimistically performs aggressive coalescing , thus exploiting the positive impact of coalescing aggressively , but when a coalesced node is to be spilled , it is split back into separate nodes . since there is a better chance of coloring one of those splits , we can reduce the overall spill amount ."}

{"title": "Relating communicating processes with different interfaces.", "abstract": "We present here an implementation relation intended to formalise the notion that a system built of communicating processes is an acceptable implementation of another base, or target, system in the event that the two systems have different interfaces. Such a treatment has clear applicability in the software development process, where (the interface of) an implementation component may be expressed at a different level of abstraction to (the interface of) the relevant specification component.Technically, processes are formalised using Hoare's CSP language, with its standard failures-divergences model. The implementation relation is formulated in terms of failures and divergences of the implementation and target processes. Interface difference is modelled by endowing the implementation relation with parameters called extraction patterns. These are intended to interpret implementation behaviour as target behaviour, and suitably constrain the former in connection to well-formedness and deadlock properties.We extend the results of our previous work and replace implementation relations previously presented by a single, improved scheme. We also remove all the restrictions previously placed upon target processes. Two basic kinds of results are obtained: realisability and compositionality.

{"title": "Test sequence generation and model checking using dynamic transition relations.", "abstract": "The task of finding a set of test sequences that provides good coverage of industrial circuits is infeasible because of the size of the circuits. For small critical subcircuits of the design, however, designers can create a set of test sequences that achieve good coverage. These sequences cannot be used on the full design because the inputs to the subcircuit may not be accessible. In this work we present an efficient test generation algorithm that receives a test sequence created for the subcircuit and finds a test sequence for the full design that reproduces the given sequence on the subcircuit. The algorithm uses a new technique called dynamic transition relations to increase its efficiency .The most common and most expensive step in our algorithm is the computation of the set of predecessors of a set of states. To make this computation more efficient we exploit a partitioning of the transition relation into a set of simpler relations. At every step we use only those that are necessary, resulting in a smaller relation than the original one. A different relation is used for each step, hence the name dynamic transition relations. The same idea can be used to improve symbolic model checking for the temporal logic CTL.We have implemented the new method in SMV and run it on several large circuits. Our experiments indicate that the new method can provide gains of up to two orders of magnitude in time and space during verification.

{"title": "On the performance of group key agreement protocols.", "abstract": "Group key agreement is a fundamental building block for secure peer group communication systems. Several group key management techniques were proposed in the last decade, all assuming the existence of an underlying group communication infrastructure to provide reliable and ordered message delivery as well as group membership information. Despite analysis, implementation, and deployment of some of these techniques, the actual costs associated with group key management have been poorly understood so far. This resulted in an undesirable tendency: on the one hand, adopting suboptimal security for reliable group communication, while, on the other hand, constructing excessively costly group key management protocols.This paper presents a thorough performance evaluation of five notable distributed key management techniques (for collaborative peer groups) integrated with a reliable group communication system.

{"title": "Sizing router buffers.", "abstract": "All Internet routers contain buffers to hold packets during times of congestion. Today, the size of the buffers is determined by the dynamics of TCP's congestion control algorithm. In particular, the goal is to make sure that when a link is congested, it is busy 100% of the time; which is equivalent to making sure its buffer never goes empty. A widely used rule-of-thumb states that each link needs a buffer of size is the average round-trip time of a flow passing across the link, and C is the data rate of the link. For example, a 10Gb/s router linecard needs approximately 250ms x 2.5Gbits of buffers; and the amount of buffering grows linearly with the line-rate. Such large buffers are challenging for router manufacturers, who must use large, slow, off-chip DRAMs. And queueing delays can be long, have high variance, and may destabilize the congestion control algorithms. In this paper we argue that the rule-of-thumb now outdated and incorrect for backbone routers. This is because of the large number of flows (TCP connections) multiplexed together on a single backbone link. Using theory, simulation and experiments on a network of real routers, we show that a link with n flows requires no more than long-lived or short-lived TCP flows. The consequences on router design are enormous: A 2.5Gb/s link carrying 10,000 flows could reduce its buffers by 99% with negligible difference in throughput; and a 10Gb/s link carrying 50,000 flows requires only 10Mbits of buffering, which can easily be implemented using fast, on-chip SRAM.", "id": "61", "src": "sizing router buffers . . all internet routers contain buffers to hold packets during times of congestion . today , the size of the buffers is determined by the dynamics of tcp ' s congestion control algorithm . in particular , the goal is to make sure that when a link is congested , it is busy <digit> of the time which is equivalent to making sure its buffer never goes empty . a widely used rule of thumb states that each link needs a buffer of size is the average round trip time of a flow passing across the link , and c is the data rate of the link . for example , a 10gb s router linecard needs approximately 250ms x 2 . 5gbits of buffers and the amount of buffering grows linearly with the line rate . such large buffers are challenging for router manufacturers , who must use large , slow , off chip drams . and queueing delays can be long , have high variance , and may destabilize the congestion control algorithms . in this paper we argue that the rule of thumb now outdated and incorrect for backbone routers . this is because of the large number of flows ( tcp connections ) multiplexed together on a single backbone link . using theory , simulation and experiments on a network of real routers , we show that a link with n flows requires no more than long lived or short lived tcp flows . the consequences on router design are enormous a 2 . 5gb s link carrying <digit> , <digit> flows could reduce its buffers by <digit> with negligible difference in throughput and a 10gb s link carrying <digit> , <digit> flows requires only 10mbits of buffering , which can easily be implemented using fast , on chip sram ."}

{"title": "Style-based inverse kinematics.", "abstract": "This paper presents an inverse kinematics system based on a learned model of human poses.

This means that our IK system can generate any pose, but prefers poses that are most similar to the space of poses in the training data. We represent the probability with a novel model called a Scaled Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model. The parameters of the model are all learned automatically; no manual tuning is required for the learning component of the system.

{"title": "Self-stabilizing clock synchronization in the presence of Byzantine faults.", "abstract": "We initiate a study of bounded clock synchronization under a more severe fault model than that proposed by Lamport and Melliar-Smith [1985]. Realistic aspects of the problem of synchronizing clocks in the presence of faults are considered. One aspect is that clock synchronization is an on-going task, thus the assumption that some of the processors never fail is too optimistic. To cope with this reality, we suggest self-stabilizing protocols that stabilize in any (long enough) period in which less than a third of the processors are faulty. Another aspect is that the clock value of each processor is bounded. A single transient fault may cause the clock to reach the upper bound.

The solution is to dynamically partition the application and offload part of the application execution data to a powerful nearby surrogate. This allows delivery of the application in a pervasive computing environment without significant fidelity degradation or expensive application rewriting. Runtime offloading must adapt to different application execution patterns and resource fluctuations in the pervasive computing environment.

{"title": "The complexity of synchronous iterative Do-All with crashes.", "abstract": "The ability to cooperate on common tasks in a distributed setting is key to solving a broad range of computation problems ranging from distributed search such as SETI to distributed simulation and multi-agent collaboration. Do-All, an abstraction of such cooperative activity, is the problem of performing N tasks in a distributed system of P failure-prone processors. Many distributed and parallel algorithms have been developed for this problem and several algorithm simulations have been developed by iterating Do-All algorithms. The efficiency of the solutions for Do-All is measured in terms of work complexity where all processing steps taken by all processors are counted. Work is ideally expressed as a function of N, P, and f, the number of processor crashes. However the known lower bounds and the upper bounds for extant algorithms do not adequately show how work depends on f. We present the first non-trivial lower bounds for Do-All that capture the dependence of work on N, P and f. For the model of computation where processors are able to make perfect load-balancing decisions locally, we also present matching upper bounds. We define the r-iterative Do-All problem that abstracts facts the repeated use of Do-All such as found in typical algorithm simulations. Our f-sensitive analysis enables us to derive tight bounds for r-iterative Do-All work (that are stronger than the r-fold work complexity of a single Do-All). Our approach that models perfect load-balancing allows for the analysis of specific algorithms to be divided into two parts: (i) the analysis of the cost of tolerating failures while performing work under \"free\" load-balancing, and (ii) the analysis of the cost of implementing load-balancing. We demonstrate the utility and generality of this approach by improving the analysis of two known efficient algorithms. We give an improved analysis of an efficient message-passing algorithm.

{"title": "Exploiting medium access diversity in rate adaptive wireless LANs.", "abstract": "Recent years have seen the growing popularity of multi-rate wireless network devices (e.g., 802.11a cards) that can exploit variations in channel conditions and improve overall network throughput. Concurrently, rate adaptation schemes have been developed that selectively increase data transmissions on a link when it offers good channel quality. In this paper, we propose a Medium Access Diversity (MAD) scheme that leverages the benefits of rate adaptation schemes by aggressively exploiting multiuser diversity. The basic mechanism of MAD is to obtain instantaneous channel condition information from multiple receivers and selectively transmit data to a receiver that improves the overall throughput of the network, while maintaining temporal fairness among multiple data flows. We identify and address the challenges in the design and implementation of MAD's three phases: channel probing, data transmission, and receiver scheduling. We also use analytical models to examine the tradeoff between network performance improvement and overhead of channel probing, and derive an asymptotic performance bound for the receiver scheduling algorithms used by MAD.

{"title": "Pictorial Structures for Object Recognition.", "abstract": "In this paper we present a computationally efficient framework for part-based modeling and recognition of objects. Our work is motivated by the pictorial structure models introduced by Fischler and Elschlager. The basic idea is to represent an object by a collection of parts arranged in a deformable configuration. The appearance of each part is modeled separately, and the deformable configuration is represented by spring-like connections between pairs of parts. These models allow for qualitative descriptions of visual appearance, and are suitable for generic recognition problems. We address the problem of using pictorial structure models to find instances of an object in an image as well as the problem of learning an object model from training examples, presenting efficient algorithms in both cases.

{"title": "Constraint programming viewed as rule-based programming.", "abstract": "We study here a natural situation when constraint programming can be entirely reduced to rule-based programming. To this end we explain first how one can compute on constraint satisfaction problems using rules represented by simple first-order formulas. Then we consider constraint satisfaction problems that are based on predefined, explicitly given constraints. To solve them we first derive rules from these explicitly given constraints and limit the computation process to a repeated application of these rules, combined with labeling. We consider two types of rule here. The first type, that we call equality rules, leads to a new notion of local consistency, called rule consistency that turns out to be weaker than arc consistency for constraints of arbitrary arity (called hyper-arc consistency in Marriott & Stuckey (1998)). For Boolean constraints rule consistency coincides with the closure under the well-known propagation rules for Boolean constraints. The second type of rules, that we call membership rules, yields a rule-based characterization of arc consistency. To show feasibility of this rule-based approach to constraint programming, we show how both types of rules can be automatically generated, as CHR rules of Frhwirth (1995). This yields an implementation of this approach to programming by means of constraint logic programming. We illustrate the usefulness of this approach to constraint programming by discussing various examples, including Boolean constraints, two typical examples of many valued logics, constraints dealing with Waltz's language for describing polyhedral scenes, and Allen's qualitative approach to temporal logic.", "id": "90", "src": "constraint programming viewed as rule based programming . . we study here a natural situation when constraint programming can be entirely reduced to rule based programming . to this end we explain first how one can compute on constraint satisfaction problems using rules represented by simple first order formulas . then we consider constraint satisfaction problems that are based on predefined , explicitly given constraints . to solve them we first derive rules from these explicitly given constraints and limit the computation process to a repeated application of these rules , combined with labeling . we consider two types of rule here . the first type , that we call equality rules , leads to a new notion of local consistency , called rule consistency that turns out to be weaker than arc consistency for constraints of arbitrary arity ( called hyper arc consistency in marriott & stuckey ( <digit> ) ) . for boolean constraints rule consistency coincides with the closure under the well known propagation rules for boolean constraints . the second type of rules , that we call membership rules , yields a rule based characterization of arc consistency . to show feasibility of this rule based approach to constraint programming , we show how both types of rules can be automatically generated , as chr rules of frhwirth ( <digit> ) . this yields an implementation of this approach to programming by means of constraint logic programming . we illustrate the usefulness of this approach to constraint programming by discussing various examples , including boolean constraints , two typical examples of many valued logics , constraints dealing with waltz ' s language for describing polyhedral scenes , and allen ' s qualitative approach to temporal logic ."}

Characterizing this distribution is of fundamental importance in the analysis of many relevant properties of mobile ad hoc networks, such as connectivity, average route length, and network capacity. In particular, we have investigated under what conditions the node spatial distribution resulting after a large number of mobility steps resembles the uniform distribution. This is motivated by the fact that the existing theoretical results concerning mobile ad hoc networks are based on this assumption. In order to test this hypothesis, we performed extensive simulations using two well-known mobility models: the random waypoint model, which resembles intentional movement, and a Brownian-like model, which resembles nonintentional movement.

{"title": "Adaptive dissemination of data in time-critical asymmetric communication environments.", "abstract": "The proliferation of new data-intensive applications in asymmetric communication environments has led to an increasing interest in the development of push-based techniques, in which the information is broadcast to a large population of clients in order to achieve the most efficient use of the limited server and communication resources. It is important to note that quite often the data that is broadcast is time-critical in nature. Most of the related current research focuses on a pure push-based approach (Broadcast Disks model), where the transmission of data is done without allowing explicit requests from the users. More recently, some bidirectional models incorporating a low-capacity uplink channel have been proposed in order to increase the functionality of the Broadcast Disks model. However, the impact of integration of the uplink channel has been investigated using only static client profiles or ignoring the existence of time-sensitive data. None of the existing models integrates all the characteristics needed to perform effectively in a real-world, dynamic time-critical asymmetric communication environment. In this paper we present an adaptive data dissemination model and the associated on-line scheduling algorithms. These improve the functionality and performance of bidirectional broadcast models, maximizing the total number of satisfied users in asymmetric communication environments with dynamic client profiles and time requirements (e.g., mobile systems).

We analytically characterize the trade-off resulting from the inclusion or exclusion of a cell in a registration area in terms of expected change in aggregate database access cost and signaling overhead. This characterization is used to guide the registration area adaption in a manner in which the signaling and database access load on any given location register (LR) does not exceed a specified limit.

The STC algorithm organizes basic blocks into chains trying to make sequentially executed basic blocks reside in consecutive memory positions, then maps the basic block chains in memory to minimize conflict misses in the important sections of the program. We evaluate and analyze in detail the impact of the STC, and code layout optimizations in general, on the three main aspects of fetch performance: the instruction cache hit rate, the effective fetch width, and the branch prediction accuracy.

The first result of the paper is an impossibility theorem for a class of superstabilizing mutual exclusion protocols. Two unidirectional protocols are then presented to show that conditions for impossibility can independently be relaxed so that superstabilization is possible using either additional time or communication registers.

This paper addresses the following problem. Given a set of processes that take (basic) local checkpoints in an independent and unknown way, the problem is to design communication-induced checkpointing protocols that direct processes to take additional local (forced) checkpoints to ensure no local checkpoint is useless. The paper first proves two properties related to integer timestamps which are associated with each local checkpoint. The first property is a necessary and sufficient condition that these timestamps must satisfy for no checkpoint to be useless. The second property provides an easy timestamp-based determination of consistent global checkpoints. Then, a general communication-induced checkpointing protocol is proposed. This protocol, derived from the two previous properties, actually defines a family of timestamp-based communication-induced checkpointing protocols. It is shown that several existing checkpointing protocols for the same problem are particular instances of the general protocol.

One of the most important decisions in designing a data warehouse is the selection of materialized views to be maintained at the warehouse. The goal is to select an appropriate set of views that minimizes total query response time and the cost of maintaining the selected views, given a limited amount of resource, e.g., materialization time, storage space, etc. In this article, we have developed a theoretical framework for the general problem of selection of views in a data warehouse. We present polynomial-time heuristics for a selection of views to optimize total query response time under a disk-space constraint, for some important special cases of the general data warehouse scenario, viz.: 1) an AND view graph, where each query/view has a unique evaluation, e.g., when a multiple-query optimizer can be used to general a global evaluation plan for the queries, and 2) an OR view graph, in which any view can be computed from any one of its related views, e.g., data cubes. We present proofs showing that the algorithms are guaranteed to provide a solution that is fairly close to (within a constant factor ratio of) the optimal solution.

{"title": "Spatial gossip and resource location protocols.", "abstract": "The dynamic behavior of a network in which information is changing continuously over time requires robust and efficient mechanisms for keeping nodes updated about new information. Gossip protocols are mechanisms for this task in which nodes communicate with one another according to some underlying deterministic or randomized algorithm, exchanging information in each communication step. In a variety of contexts, the use of randomization to propagate information has been found to provide better reliability and scalability than more regimented deterministic approaches.In many settings, such as a cluster of distributed computing hosts, new information is generated at individual nodes, and is most \"interesting\" to nodes that are nearby. Thus, we propose distance-based propagation bounds as a performance measure for gossip mechanisms: a node at distance d from the origin of a new piece of information should be able to learn about this information with a delay that grows slowly with d, and is independent of the size of the network.For nodes arranged with uniform density in Euclidean space, we present natural gossip mechanisms, called spatial gossip, that satisfy such a guarantee: new information is spread to nodes at distance d, with high probability, in O(log1 steps. Such a bound combines the desirable qualitative features of uniform gossip, in which information is spread with a delay that is logarithmic in the full network size, and deterministic flooding, in which information is spread with a delay that is linear in the distance and independent of the network size. Our mechanisms and their analysis resolve a conjecture of Demers et al. [1987].We further show an application of our gossip mechanisms to a basic resource location problem, in which nodes seek to rapidly learn the location of the nearest copy of a resource in a network. This problem, which is of considerable practical importance, can be solved by a very simple protocol using Spatial Gossip, whereas we can show that no protocol built on top of uniform gossip can inform nodes of their approximately nearest resource within poly-logarithmic time. The analysis relies on an additional useful property of spatial gossip, namely that information travels from its source to sinks along short paths not visiting points of the network far from the two nodes.", "id": "135", "src": "spatial gossip and resource location protocols . . the dynamic behavior of a network in which information is changing continuously over time requires robust and efficient mechanisms for keeping nodes updated about new information . gossip protocols are mechanisms for this task in which nodes communicate with one another according to some underlying deterministic or randomized algorithm , exchanging information in each communication step . in a variety of contexts , the use of randomization to propagate information has been found to provide better reliability and scalability than more regimented deterministic approaches . in many settings , such as a cluster of distributed computing hosts , new information is generated at individual nodes , and is most interesting to nodes that are nearby . thus , we propose distance based propagation bounds as a performance measure for gossip mechanisms a node at distance d from the origin of a new piece of information should be able to learn about this information with a delay that grows slowly with d , and is independent of the size of the network . for nodes arranged with uniform density in euclidean space , we present natural gossip mechanisms , called spatial gossip , that satisfy such a guarantee new information is spread to nodes at distance d , with high probability , in o ( log1 steps . such a bound combines the desirable qualitative features of uniform gossip , in which information is spread with a delay that is logarithmic in the full network size , and deterministic flooding , in which information is spread with a delay that is linear in the distance and independent of the network size . our mechanisms and their analysis resolve a conjecture of demers et al . <digit> . we further show an application of our gossip mechanisms to a basic resource location problem , in which nodes seek to rapidly learn the location of the nearest copy of a resource in a network . this problem , which is of considerable practical importance , can be solved by a very simple protocol using spatial gossip , whereas we can show that no protocol built on top of uniform gossip can inform nodes of their approximately nearest resource within poly logarithmic time . the analysis relies on an additional useful property of spatial gossip , namely that information travels from its source to sinks along short paths not visiting points of the network far from the two nodes ."}

{"title": "Multiple Resolution Segmentation of Textured Images.", "abstract": "A multiple resolution algorithm is presented for segmenting images into regions with differing statistical behavior. In addition, an algorithm is developed for determining the number of statistically distinct regions in an image and estimating the parameters of those regions. Both algorithms use a causal Gaussian autoregressive model to describe the mean, variance, and spatial correlation of the image textures. Together, the algorithms can be used to perform unsupervised texture segmentation. The multiple resolution segmentation algorithm first segments images at coarse resolution and then progresses to finer resolutions until individual pixels are classified. This method results in accurate segmentations and requires significantly less computation than some previously known methods. The field containing the classification of each pixel in the image is modeled as a Markov random field. Segmentation at each resolution is then performed by maximizing the a posteriori probability of this field subject to the resolution constraint. At each resolution, the a posteriori probability is maximized by a deterministic greedy algorithm which iteratively chooses the classification of individual pixels or pixel blocks. The unsupervised parameter estimation algorithm determines both the number of textures and their parameters by minimizing a global criterion based on the AIC information criterion.

{"title": "Optimal weight assignment for signature generation.", "abstract": "Previous work on superimposed coding has been characterized by two aspects. First, it is generally assumed that signatures are generated from logical text blocks of the same size; that is, each block contains the same number of unique terms after stopword and duplicate removal. We call this approach the fixed-size block (FSB) method, since each text block has the same size, as measured by the number of unique terms contained in it. Second, with only a few exceptions [6,7,8,9,17], most previous work has assumed that each term in the text contributes the same number of ones to the signature (i.e., the weight of the term signatures is fixed). The main objective of this paper is to derive an optimal weight assignment that assigns weights to document terms according to  their occurrence and query frequencies in order to minimize the false-drop probability. The optimal scheme can account for both uniform and nonuniform occurence and query frequencies, and the signature generation method is still based on hashing rather than on table lookup. Furthermore, a new way of generating signatures, the fixed-weight block (FWB) method, is introduced. FWB controls the weight of every signature to a constant, whereas in FSB, only the expected signature weight is constant. We have shown that FWB has a lower false-drop probability than that of the FSB method, but its storage overhead is slightly  higher.

{"title": "What are race conditions?.", "abstract": "In shared-memory parallel programs that use explicit synchronization, race conditions result when accesses to shared memory are not properly synchronized. Race conditions are often considered to be manifestations of bugs, since their presence can cause the program to behave unexpectedly.  Unfortunately, there has been little agreement in the literature as to precisely what constitutes a race condition. Two different notions have been implicitly considered: one pertaining to programs intended to be deterministic (which we call general races) and the other to nondeterministic programs containing critical sections (which we call data races). However, the differences between general races and data races have not yet been recognized. This    paper examines these differences by characterizing races using a formal model and exploring their properties. We show that two variations of each type of race exist: feasible general races and data races capture the intuitive notions desired for debugging and apparent races capture less accurate notions implicitly assumed by most dynamic race detection methods. We also show that locating feasible races is an NP-hard problem, implying that only the apparent races, which are approximations to feasible races, can be detected in practice. The complexity of dynamically locating apparent races depends on the type of synchronization used by the program. Apparent races can be exhaustively located efficiently only for weak types of   synchronization that are incapable of implementing mutual exclusion. This result has important implications since we argue that debugging general races requires exhaustive race detection and is inherently harder than debugging data races (which requires only partial race detection). Programs containing data races can therefore be efficiently debugged by locating certain easily identifiable races. In contrast, programs containing general races require more complex debugging techniques.", "id": "158", "src": "what are race conditions . . in shared memory parallel programs that use explicit synchronization , race conditions result when accesses to shared memory are not properly synchronized . race conditions are often considered to be manifestations of bugs , since their presence can cause the program to behave unexpectedly . unfortunately , there has been little agreement in the literature as to precisely what constitutes a race condition . two different notions have been implicitly considered one pertaining to programs intended to be deterministic ( which we call general races ) and the other to nondeterministic programs containing critical sections ( which we call data races ) . however , the differences between general races and data races have not yet been recognized . this paper examines these differences by characterizing races using a formal model and exploring their properties . we show that two variations of each type of race exist feasible general races and data races capture the intuitive notions desired for debugging and apparent races capture less accurate notions implicitly assumed by most dynamic race detection methods . we also show that locating feasible races is an np hard problem , implying that only the apparent races , which are approximations to feasible races , can be detected in practice . the complexity of dynamically locating apparent races depends on the type of synchronization used by the program . apparent races can be exhaustively located efficiently only for weak types of synchronization that are incapable of implementing mutual exclusion . this result has important implications since we argue that debugging general races requires exhaustive race detection and is inherently harder than debugging data races ( which requires only partial race detection ) . programs containing data races can therefore be efficiently debugged by locating certain easily identifiable races . in contrast , programs containing general races require more complex debugging techniques ."}

{"title": "A Weighted Nearest Neighbor Algorithm for Learning with Symbolic Features.", "abstract": "In the past, nearest neighbor algorithms for learning from examples have worked best in domains in which all features had numeric values. In such domains, the examples can be treated as points and distance metrics can use standard definitions. In symbolic domains, a more sophisticated treatment of the feature space is required. We introduce a nearest neighbor algorithm for learning in domains with symbolic features. Our algorithm calculates distance tables that allow it to produce real-valued distances between instances, and attaches weights to the instances to further modify the structure of feature space. We show that this technique produces excellent classification accuracy on three problems that have been studied by machine learning researchers: predicting protein secondary structure, identifying DNA promoter sequences, and pronouncing English text. Direct experimental comparisons with the other learning algorithms show that our nearest neighbor algorithm is comparable or superior in all three domains. In addition, our algorithm has advantages in training speed, simplicity, and perspicuity.

{"title": "A conceptual framework for evolving software processes.", "abstract": "Software processes are complex entities that may last for long periods of time and are carried out through the interaction of humans and computerized tools. They need to continuously evolve in order to cope with different kinds of changes or customizations both in the organization and in the technologies used to support software production activities.In recent years, many software process support technologies have been developed, and have currently been further extended and used in trial projects. Moreover, some research prototypes have generated commercial products, that are marketed and currently used in industrial organizations. Despite these significant efforts and results, however, there is still little conceptual characterization and assessment of the properties of software processes and related support environments. It is difficult to compare and assess existing approaches. Even a common characterization of the problems to be addressed seems to be problematic and difficult to achieve. This is particularly true when we consider the process evolution problem, for which it does not seem that a common view of the issue has been established yet.This paper aims at proposing a conceptual framework to describe and assess flexible and evolving software processes.

{"title": "Dynamic NURBS with geometric constraints for interactive sculpting.", "abstract": "This article develops a dynamic generalization of the nonuniform rational B-spline (NURBS) model. NURBS have become a defacto standard in commercial modeling systems because of their power to represent free-form shapes as well as common analytic shapes. To date, however, they have been viewed as purely geometric primitives that require the user to manually adjust multiple control points and associated weights in order to design shapes. Dynamic NURBS, or D-NURBS, are physics-based models that incorporate mass distributions, internal deformation energies, and other physical quantities into the popular NURBS geometric substrate. Using D-NURBS, a modeler can interactively sculpt curves and surfaces and design complex shapes to required specifications not only in the traditional indirect  fashion, by adjusting control points and weights, but also through direct physical manipulation, by applying simulated forces and local and global shape constraints. D-NURBS move and deform in a physically intuitive manner in response to the user's direct manipulations. Their dynamic behavior results from the numerical integration of a set of nonlinear differential equations that automatically evolve the control points and weights in response to the applied forces and constraints. To derive these equations, we employ Lagrangian mechanics and a finite-element-like discretization. Our approach supports the trimming of D-NURBS surfaces using D-NURBS curves.

{"title": "Multiresolution stochastic hybrid shape models with fractal priors.", "abstract": "3D shape modeling has received enormous attention in computer graphics and computer vision over the past decade. Several shape modeling techniques have been proposed in literature, some are local (distributed parameter) while others are global (lumped parameter) in terms of the parameters required to describe the shape. Hybrid models that combine both ends of this parameter spectrum have been in vogue only recently. However, they do not allow a smooth transition between the two extremes of this parameter spectrum. We introduce a new shape-modeling scheme that can transform smoothly from local to global models or vice versa. The modeling scheme utilizes a hybrid primitive called the deformable superquadric constructed in an orthonormal wavelet basis. The multiresolution wavelet basis provides the power to continuously transform from local to global shape deformations and thereby allow for a continuum of shape modelsfrom those with local to those with global shape descriptive powerto be created. The multiresolution wavelet basis allows us to generate fractal surfaces of arbitrary order that can be useful in describing natural detail. We embed these multiresolution shape models in a probabilistic framework and use them for recovery of anatomical structures in the human brain from MRI data.

This is an important problem in medical imaging, surface reconstruction from topographic data, and other applications.

Our algorithm uses a partial curve matching technique for matching parts of the contours, an optimal triangulation of 3-D polygons for resolving the unmatched parts, and a minimum spanning tree heuristic for interpolating between non simply connected regions. Unlike previous attempts at solving this problem, our algorithm seems to handle successfully any kind of data.

{"title": "Using Genetic Algorithms for Concept Learning.", "abstract": "In this article, we explore the use of genetic algorithms (GAs) as a key element in the design and implementation of robust concept learning systems. We describe and evaluate a GA-based system called GABIL that continually learns and refines concept classification rules from its interaction with the environment. The use of GAs is motivated by recent studies showing the effects of various forms of bias built into different concept learning systems, resulting in systems that perform well on certain concept classes (generally, those well matched to the biases) and poorly on others. By incorporating a GA as the underlying adaptive search mechanism, we are able to construct a concept learning system that has a simple, unified architecture with several important features. First, the system is surprisingly robust even with minimal bias. Second, the system can be easily extended to incorporate traditional forms of bias found in other concept learning systems. Finally, the architecture of the system encourages explicit representation of such biases and, as a result, provides for an important additional feature: the ability to dynamically adjust system bias. The viability of this approach is illustrated by comparing the performance of GABIL with that of four other more traditional concept learners (AQ14, C4.5, ID5R, and IACL) on a variety of target concepts.

{"title": "Prototyping a Process Monitoring Experiment.", "abstract": "Features are often the basic unit of development for a very large software system and represent long-term efforts, spanning up to several years from inception to actual use. Developing an experiment to monitor (by means of sampling) such lengthy processes requires a great deal of care in order to minimize casts and to maximize benefits. Just as prototyping is often a necessary auxiliary step in a large-scale, long-term development effort, so, too, is prototyping a necessary step in the development of a large-scale, long-term process monitoring experiment. Therefore, we have prototyped our experiment using a representative process and reconstructed data from a large and rich feature development. This approach has yielded three interesting sets of results. First, we reconstructed a 30-month time diary for the lead engineer of a feature composed of both hardware and software. These data represent the daily state (where the lead engineer spent the majority of his time) for a complete cycle of the development process. Second, we found that we needed to modify our experimental design. Our initial set of states did not represent the data as well as we had hoped. This is exemplified by the fact that the \"Other\" category is too large. Finally, the data provide evidence for both a waterfall view and an interactive, cyclic view of software development.

{"title": "Generalization of Lambert''s reflectance model.", "abstract": "Lambert's model for body reflection is widely used in computer graphics. It is used extensively by rendering techniques such as radiosity and ray tracing. For several real-world objects, however, Lambert's model can prove to be a very inaccurate approximation to the body reflectance. While the brightness of a Lambertian surface is independent of viewing direction, that of a rough surface increases as the viewing direction approaches the light source direction. In this paper, a comprehensive model is developed that predicts body reflectance from rough surfaces. The surface is modeled as a collection of Lambertian facets. It is shown that such a surface is inherently non-Lambertian due to the foreshortening of the surface facets. Further, the model accounts for complex geometric and radiometric phenomena such as masking, shadowing, and interreflections between facets. Several experiments have been conducted on samples of rough diffuse surfaces, such as, plaster, sand, clay, and cloth. All these surface demonstrate significant deviation from Lambertian behavior.

{"title": "A clustering algorithm for radiosity in complex environments.", "abstract": "We present an approach for accelerating hierarchical radiosity by clustering objects. Previous approaches constructed effective hierarchies by subdividing surfaces, but could not exploit a hierarchical grouping on existing surfaces. This limitation resulted in an excessive number of initial links in complex environments. Initial linking is potentially the most expensive portion of hierarchical radiosity algorithms, and constrains the complexity of the environments that can be simulated. The clustering algorithm presented here operates by estimating energy transfer between collections of objects while maintaining reliable error bounds on each transfer. Two methods of bounding the transfers are employed with different tradeoffs between accuracy and time. In contrast with the O(s2) time and space complexity of the initial linking in previous hierarchical radiosity algorithms, the new methods have complexities of O(slogs) and O(s) for both time and space. Using these methods we have obtained speedups of two orders of magnitude for environments of moderate complexity while maintaining comparable accuracy.", "id": "241", "src": "a clustering algorithm for radiosity in complex environments . . we present an approach for accelerating hierarchical radiosity by clustering objects . previous approaches constructed effective hierarchies by subdividing surfaces , but could not exploit a hierarchical grouping on existing surfaces . this limitation resulted in an excessive number of initial links in complex environments . initial linking is potentially the most expensive portion of hierarchical radiosity algorithms , and constrains the complexity of the environments that can be simulated . the clustering algorithm presented here operates by estimating energy transfer between collections of objects while maintaining reliable error bounds on each transfer . two methods of bounding the transfers are employed with different tradeoffs between accuracy and time . in contrast with the o ( s2 ) time and space complexity of the initial linking in previous hierarchical radiosity algorithms , the new methods have complexities of o ( slogs ) and o ( s ) for both time and space . using these methods we have obtained speedups of two orders of magnitude for environments of moderate complexity while maintaining comparable accuracy ."}

{"title": "Inverse kinematics positioning using nonlinear programming for highly articulated figures.", "abstract": "An articulated figure is often modeled as a set of rigid segments connected with joints. Its configuration can be altered by varying the joint angles. Although it is straight forward to compute figure configurations given joint angles (forward kinematics), it is more difficult to find the joint angles for a desired configuration (inverse kinematics). Since the inverse kinematics problem is of special importance to an animator wishing to set a figure to a posture satisfying a set of positioning constraints, researchers have proposed several different approaches. However, when we try to follow these approaches in an interactive animation system where the object on which to operate is as highly articulated as a realistic human figure, they fail in either generality or performance. So, we  approach this problem through nonlinear programming techniques. It has been successfully used since 1988 in the spatial constraint system within Jack, a human figure simulation system developed at the University of Pennsylvania, and proves to be satisfactorily efficient, controllable, and robust. A spatial constraint in our system involves two parts: one constraint on the figure, the end-effector, and one on the spatial environment, the goal. These two parts are dealt with separately, so that we can achieve a neat modular implementation. Constraints can be added one at a time with appropriate weights designating the importance of this constraint relative to the others and are always solved as a group.

At times the page may migrate between processors at cost proportional to the distance times $D$, a page size factor.  The problem is to schedule movements on-line so that the total cost of memory references is within a constant factor $c$ of the best off-line schedule.  An algorithm that does so is called c-competitive.  Black and Sleator gave 3-competitive deterministic on-line algorithms for uniform networks (complete graphs with unit edge lengths) and for trees with arbitrary edge lengths. No good deterministic algorithm is known for general networks with arbitrary edge lengths.  Randomized algorithms are presented for the migration problem that are both simple and better than 3-competitive against an oblivious adversary. An algorithm for uniform graphs is given. It is approximately 2.28-competitive as $D$ grows large. A second, more powerful algorithm that works on graphs with arbitrary edge distances is also given. This algorithm is approximately 2.62-competitive (or, 1 plus the golden ratio) for large $D$.

{"title": "Effective cache prefetching on bus-based multiprocessors.", "abstract": "Compiler-directed cache prefetching has the potential to hide much of the high memory latency seen by current and future high-performance processors. However, prefetching is not without costs, particularly on a shared-memory multiprocessor. Prefetching can negatively affect bus utilization, overall cache miss rates, memory latencies and data sharing. We simulate the effects of a compiler-directed prefetching algorithm, running on a range of bus-based multiprocessors. We show that, despite a high memory latency, this architecture does not necessarily support prefetching well, in some cases actually causing performance degradations. We pinpoint several problems with prefetching on a shared-memory architecture (additional conflict misses, no reduction in the data-sharing traffic and associated latencies, a multiprocessor's greater sensitivity to memory utilization and the sensitivity of the cache hit rate to prefetch distance) and measure their effect on performance. We then solve those problems through architectural techniques and heuristics for prefetching that could be easily incorporated into a compiler: (1) victim caching, which eliminates most of the cache conflict misses caused by prefetching in a direct-mapped cache, (2) special prefetch algorithms for shared data, which significantly improve the ability of our basic prefetching algorithm to prefetch individual misses, and (3) compiler-based shared-data restructuring, which eliminates many of the invalidation misses the basic prefetching algorithm does not predict.

{"title": "An Experimental Comparison of the Nearest-Neighbor and Nearest-Hyperrectangle Algorithms.", "abstract": "Algorithms based on Nested Generalized Exemplar (NGE) theory (Salzberg, 1991) classify new data points by computing their distance to the nearest generalized exemplar (i.e., either a point or an axis-parallel rectangle). They combine the distance-based character of nearest neighbor (NN) classifiers with the axis-parallel rectangle representation employed in many rule-learning systems. An implementation of NGE was compared to the k-nearest neighbor (kNN) algorithm in 11 domains and found to be significantly inferior to kNN in 9 of them. Several modifications of NGE were studied to understand the cause of its poor performance. These show that its performance can be substantially improved by preventing NGE from creating overlapping rectangles, while still allowing complete nesting of rectangles. Performance can be further improved by modifying the distance metric to allow weights on each of the features (Salzberg, 1991). Best results were obtained in this study when the weights were computed using mutual information between the features and the output class. The best version of NGE developed is a batch algorithm (BNGE FWMI) that has no user-tunable parameters. BNGE FWMI's performance is comparable to the first-nearest neighbor algorithm (also incorporating feature weights). However, the k-nearest neighbor algorithm is still significantly superior to BNGE FWMI in 7 of the 11 domains, and inferior to it in only 2. We conclude that, even with our improvements, the NGE approach is very sensitive to the shape of the decision boundaries in classification problems.

{"title": "A case study in simulating PCS networks using Time Warp.", "abstract": "There has been rapid growth in the demand for mobile communications over the past few years. This has led to intensive research and development efforts for complex PCS (personal communication service) networks. Capacity planning and performance modeling is necessary to maintain a high quality of service to the mobile subscriber while minimizing cost to the PCS provider. The need for flexible analysis tools and the high computational requirements of large PCS network simulations make it an excellent candidate for parallel simulation.Here, we describe our experiences in developing two PCS simulation models on a general purpose distributed simulation platform based on the Time Warp mechanism. These models utilize two widely used approaches to simulating PCS networks: (i) the  call-initiated and (ii) the portable-initiated models.

{"title": "Probabilistic adaptive direct optimism control in Time Warp.", "abstract": "In a distributed memory environment the communication overhead of Time Warp as induced by the rollback procedure due to overoptimistic progression of the simulation is the dominating performance factor. To limit optimism to an extent that can be justified from the inherent model parallelism, an optimism control mechanism is proposed, which by maintaining a history record of virtual time differences from the time stamps carried by arriving messages, and forecasting the timestamps of forthcoming messages, probabilistically delays the execution of scheduled events to avoid potential rollback and associated communication overhead (antimessages). After investigating statistical forecast methods which express only the central tendency of the arrival process, we demonstrate  that arrival processes in the context of Time Warp simulations of timed Petri nets have certain predictable and consistent ARIMA characteristics, which encourage the use of sophisticated and recursive forecast procedures based on those models.

{"title": "Buffer management in shared-memory Time Warp systems.", "abstract": "Mechanisms for managing message buffers in Time Warp parallel simulations executing on cache-coherent shared-memory multiprocessors are studied. Two simple buffer management strategies called the sender pool and receiver pool mechanisms are examined with respect to their efficiency, and in particular, their interaction with multiprocessor cache-coherence protocols. Measurements of implementations on a Kendall Square Research KSR-2 machine using both synthetic workloads and benchmark applications demonstrate that sender pools offer significant performance advantages over receiver pools. However, it is also observed that both schemes, especially the sender pool mechanism, are prone to severe performance degradations due to poor locality of reference in large simulations using  substantial amounts of message buffer memory. A third strategy called the partitioned buffer pool approach is proposed that exploits the advantages of sender pools, but exhibits much better locality. Measurements of this approach indicate that the partitioned pool mechanism yields substantially better performance than both the sender and receiver pool schemes for large-scale, small-granularity parallel simulation applications.The central conclusions from this study are: (1) buffer management strategies play an important role in determining the overall efficiency of multiprocessor-based parallel simulators, and (2) the partitioned buffer pool organization offers significantly better performance than the sender and receiver pool schemes.

The aim of MEME is to discover new motifs in a set of biopolymer sequences where little or nothing is known in advance about any motifs that may be present.

First, subsequences which actually occur in the biopolymer sequences are used as starting points for the EM algorithm to increase the probability of finding globally optimal motifs. Second, the assumption that each sequence contains exactly one occurrence of the shared motif is removed. This allows multiple appearances of a motif to occur in any sequence and permits the algorithm to ignore sequences with no appearance of the shared motif, increasing its resistance to noisy data. Third, a method for probabilistically erasing shared motifs after they are found is incorporated so that several distinct motifs can be found in the same set of sequences, both when different motifs appear in different sequences and when a single sequence may contain multiple motifs.

Explicit redistribution of data can be performed between algorithm phases when a different data decomposition is expected to deliver increased performance for a subsequent phase of computation.

Preserving the semantics of the target (destination) distribution pattern, the technique manipulates the data to logical processor mapping of the target pattern.

{"title": "Adaptive Pattern Matching.", "abstract": "Pattern matching is an important operation used in many applications such as functional programming, rewriting, and rule-based expert systems.

By adapting the traversal order to suit the set of input patterns, it is possible to considerably reduce the space and matching time requirements of the automaton.  The design of such adaptive automata is the focus of this paper. We first formalize the notion of an adaptive traversal. We then present several strategies for synthesizing adaptive traversal orders aimed at reducing space and matching time complexity.  In the worst case, however, the space requirements can be exponential in the size of the patterns. We show this by establishing  an exponential lower bounds on space that is independent of the traversal order used.

{"title": "Synthesizing Petri nets from state-based models.", "abstract": "This paper presents a method to synthesize labeled Petri nets from state-based models. Although state-based models (such as Finite State Machines) are a powerful formalism to describe the behavior of sequential systems, they cannot explicitly express the notions of concurrency, causality and conflict. Petri nets can naturally capture these notions. The proposed method in based on deriving an Elementary Transition System (ETS) from a specification model. Previous work has shown that for any ETS there exists a Petri net with minimum transition count (one transition for each label) with a reachability graph isomorphic to the original ETS.

{"title": "Design verification via simulation and automatic test pattern generation.", "abstract": "We present a simulation-based method for combinational design verification that aims at complete coverage of specified design errors using conventional ATPG tools. The error models used in prior research are examined and reduced to four types: gate substitution errors (GSEs), gate count errors (GCEs), input count errors (ICEs), and wrong input errors (WIEs). Conditions are derived for a gate to be completely testable for GSEs; These conditions lead to small test sets for GSEs. Near-minimal test sets are also derived for GCEs. We analyze redundancy in design errors and relate this to single stuck-line (SSL) redundancy.

Such processors have highly irregular data-paths, and conventional code generation methods typically result in inefficient code. Instruction selection can be formulated as directed acyclic graph (DAG) covering. Conventional methods for instruction selection use heuristics that break up the DAG into a forest of trees and then cover them independently. This breakup can result in suboptimal solutions for the original DAG. Alternatively, the DAG covering problem can be formulated as a binate covering problem, and solved exactly or heuristically using branch-and-bound methods.

The complex nature of power as a cost function implies that the effects of several behavioral synthesis tasks like module selection, clock selection, scheduling, and resource sharing on supply voltage and switched capacitance need to be considered simultaneously to fully derive the benefits of design space exploration at the behavior level.

{"title": "An Analytical Model for Designing Memory Hierarchies.", "abstract": "AbstractMemory hierarchies have long been studied by many means: system building, trace-driven simulation, and mathematical analysis. Yet little help is available for the system designer wishing to quickly size the different levels in a memory hierarchy to a first-order approximation. In this paper, we present a simple analysis for providing this practical help and some unexpected results and intuition that come out of the analysis. By applying a specific, parameterized model of workload locality, we are able to derive a closed-form solution for the optimal size of each hierarchy level. We verify the accuracy of this solution against exhaustive simulation with two case studies: a three-level I/O storage hierarchy and a three-level processor-cache hierarchy.

{"title": "A persistent rescheduled-page cache for low overhead object code compatibility in VLIW architectures.", "abstract": "Object-code compatibility between processor generations is an open issue for VLIW architectures. A potential solution is a technique termed dynamic rescheduling, which performs run-time software rescheduling at the first-time page faults. The time required for rescheduling the pages constitutes a large portion of the overhead of this method. A disk caching scheme that uses a persistent rescheduled-page cache (PRC) is presented. The scheme reduces the overhead associated with dynamic rescheduling by saving rescheduled pages on disk, across program executions. Operating system support is required for dynamic rescheduling and management of the PRC. The implementation details for the PRC are discussed. Results of simulations used to gauge the effectiveness of PRC indicate that: the PRC is effective in reducing the overhead of dynamic rescheduling; and due to different overhead requirements of programs, a split PRC organization performs better than a unified PRC. The unified PRC was studied for two different page replacement policies: LRU and overhead-based replacement. It was found that with LRU replacement, all the programs consistently perform better with increasing PRC sizes, but the high-overhead programs take a consistent performance hit compared to the low-overhead programs.

Unfortunately optimum scheduling is computationally intractable, and one must resort to carefully crafted heuristics in practice. If the scope of application of a scheduling heuristic is limited to basic blocks, considerable performance loss may be incurred at block boundaries. To overcome this obstacle, basic blocks can be coalesced across branches to form larger regions such as super blocks. In the literature, these regions are typically scheduled using algorithms that are either oblivious to profile information (under the assumption that the process of forming the region has fully utilized the profile information), or use the profile information as an addendum to classical scheduling techniques. We believe that even for the simple case of linear code regions such as super blocks, additional performance improvement can be gained by utilizing the profile information in scheduling as well.

{"title": "Modulo scheduling of loops in control-intensive non-numeric programs.", "abstract": "Much of the previous work on modulo scheduling has targeted numeric programs, in which, often, the majority of the loops are well-behaved loop-counter-based loops without early exits. In control-intensive non-numeric programs, the loops frequently have characteristics that make it more difficult to effectively apply modulo scheduling. These characteristics include multiple control flow paths, loops that are not based on a loop counter, and multiple exits. In these loops, the presence of unimportant paths with high resource usage or long dependence chains can penalize the important paths. A path that contains a hazard such as another nested loop can prohibit modulo scheduling of the loop. Control dependences can severely restrict the overlap of the blocks within and across iterations. This paper describes a set of methods that allow effective modulo scheduling of loops with multiple exits. The techniques include removal of control dependences to enable speculation, extensions to modulo variable expansion, and a new epilogue generation scheme. These methods can be used with superblock and hyperblock techniques to allow modulo scheduling of the selected paths of loops with arbitrary control flow.

In some situations, resource allocation can be better optimized if a confidence level is assigned to a branch prediction; i.e. if the quantity of resources allocated is a function of the confidence level.

The objective is to concentrate as many of the mispredictions as practical into a relatively small set of low confidence dynamic branches.

We find that about 63 percent of the mispredictions can be localized to a set of static branches that account for 20 percent of the dynamic branches.

The approach exploits brightness information to organize and constrain the interpretation of the motion by using segmented regions of piecewise smooth brightness to hypothesize planar regions in the scene. Parametric flow models are estimated in these regions in a two step process which first computes a coarse fit and estimates the appropriate parameterization of the motion of the region (two, six, or eight parameters). The initial fit is refined using a generalization of the standard area-based regression approaches. Since the assumption of planarity is likely to be violated, we allow local deformations from the planar assumption in the same spirit as physically-based approaches which model shape using coarse parametric models plus local deformations. This parametric+deformation model exploits the strong constraints of parametric approaches while retaining the adaptive nature of regularization approaches.

In the case of derivative-pair detectors, we describe a family of scaling functions related to fractional derivatives of the Gaussian that are necessary and sufficient for causality.

{"title": "Rigidity Checking of 3D Point Correspondences Under Perspective Projection.", "abstract": "AbstractAn algorithm is described which rapidly verifies the potential rigidity of three-dimensional point correspondences from a pair of two-dimensional views under perspective projection. The output of the algorithm is a simple yes or no answer to the question \"Could these corresponding points from two views be the projection of a rigid configuration?\" Potential applications include 3D object recognition from a single previous view and correspondence matching for stereo or motion over widely separated views. The rigidity checking problem is different from the structure-from-motion problem because it is often the case that two views cannot provide an accurate structure-from-motion estimate due to ambiguity and ill conditioning, whereas it is still possible to give an accurate yes/no answer to the rigidity question. Rigidity checking verifies point correspondences using 3D recovery equations as a matching condition. The proposed algorithm improves upon other methods that fall under this approach because it works with as few as six corresponding points under full perspective projection, handles correspondences from widely separated views, makes full use of the disparity of the correspondences, and is integrated with a linear algorithm for 3D recovery due to Kontsevich.

CodeFinder also allows component representations to be modified while users are searching for information.

{"title": "Reducing Communication Latency with Path Multiplexing in Optically Interconnected Multiprocessor Systems.", "abstract": "AbstractReducing communication latency, which is a performance bottleneck in optically interconnected multiprocessor systems, is of prominent importance. A conventional approach for establishing connections in multiplexed networks uses a set of independent time slots (or virtual channels) along a path for each connection.

In this paper, we propose an approach to all-optical Time Division Multiplexed (TDM) communications in multiprocessor systems. The idea is to establish a connection along a path using a set of time slots (or virtual channels) that are dependent on each other, so that no time-slot interchanging is required.

{"title": "An Empirical Evaluation of Performance-Memory Trade-Offs in Time Warp.", "abstract": "AbstractThe performance of the Time Warp mechanism is experimentally evaluated when only a limited amount of memory is available to the parallel computation. An implementation of the cancelback protocol is used for memory management on a shared memory architecture, viz., KSR to evaluate the performance vs. memory tradeoff. The implementation of the cancelback protocol supports canceling back more than one memory object when memory has been exhausted (the precise number is referred to as the salvage parameter) and incorporates a non-work-conserving processor scheduling technique to prevent starvation.Several synthetic and benchmark programs are used that provide interesting stress cases for evaluating the limited memory behavior. The experiments are extensively monitored to determine the extent to which various factors may affect performance. Several observations are made by analyzing the behavior of Time Warp under limited memory: 1) Depending on the available memory and asymmetry in the workload, canceling back several memory objects at one time (i.e., a salvage parameter value of more than one) improves performance significantly, by reducing certain overheads. However, performance is relatively insensitive to the salvage parameter except at extreme values. 2) The speedup vs. memory curve for Time Warp programs has a well-defined knee before which speedup increases very rapidly with memory and beyond which there is little performance gain with increased memory. performance nearly equivalent to that with large amounts of memory can be achieved with only a modest amount of additional memory beyond that required for sequential execution, if memory management overheads are small compared to the event granularity.

{"title": "A Graph Partitioning Approach to Sequential Diagnosis.", "abstract": "AbstractThis paper describes a generalized sequential diagnosis algorithm whose analysis leads to strong diagnosability results for a variety of multiprocessor interconnection topologies. The overall complexity of this algorithm in terms of total testing and syndrome decoding time is linear in the number of edges in the interconnection graph and the total number of iterations of diagnosis and repair needed by the algorithm is bounded by the diameter of the interconnection graph. The degree of diagnosability of this algorithm for a given interconnection graph is shown to be directly related to a graph parameter which we refer to as the partition number. We approximate this graph parameter for several interconnection topologies and thereby obtain lower bounds on degree of diagnosability achieved by our algorithm on these topologies. If we let N denote total number of vertices in the interconnection graph and  denote the maximum degree of any vertex in it, then our results may be summarized as follows. We show that a symmetric d-dimensional grid graph is sequentially $\\Omega \\left( {N^{{{d \\over {d+1}}}}} \\right)$-diagnosable for any fixed d. For hypercubes, symmeteric log N-dimensional grid graphs, it is shown that our algorithm leads to a surprising $\\Omega \\left( {{{{N\\,{\\rm log\\,log}\\,N} \\over {log\\,N}}}} \\right)$ degree of diagnosability.

The algorithm uses only two virtual channels per physical channel creating two virtual networks. The messages are routed positive-first in one virtual network and negative-first in the other.

The use of finite energy sources in the face of dependent channel errors leads to new protocol design criteria. As an example, a simple probing scheme, which slows down the transmission rate when the channel is impaired, is shown to be more energy efficient, with a slight loss in throughput.

Example for such a measure is the Euclidean distance between feature points in the image and their corresponding points in the nearest view.

{"title": "On View Likelihood and Stability.", "abstract": "AbstractWe define two measures on views: view likelihood and view stability. View likelihood measures the probability that a certain view of a given 3D object is observed; it may be used to identify typical, or \"characteristic,\" views. View stability measures how little the image changes as the viewpoint is slightly perturbed; it may be used to identify \"generic\" views. Both definitions are shown to be identical up to the prior probability of camera orientations, and determined by the 2D metric used to compare images. We analytically derive the stability and likelihood measures for two feature-based 2D metrics, where the most stable and most likely view is shown to be the flattest view of the 3D shape.Incorporating view likelihood or stability in 3D object recognition and 3D reconstruction increases the chance of robust performance. In particular, we propose to use these measures to enhance 3D object recognition and 3D reconstruction algorithms, by adding a second step where the most likely solution is selected among all feasible solutions.

A distribution mixture is said to be generalized when the exact nature of components is not known, but each of them belongs to a finite known set of families of distributions. Estimating such a mixture entails a supplementary difficulty: One must label, for each class and each sensor, the exact nature of the corresponding distribution. Such generalized mixtures have been studied assuming that the components lie in the Pearson system. Adaptations of classical algorithms, such as Expectation-Maximization, Stochastic Expectation-Maximization, or Iterative Conditional Estimation, can then be used to estimate such mixtures in the context of independent identically distributed data and hidden Markov random fields. We propose a more general procedure with applications to estimating generalized multisensor hidden Markov chains. Our proposed method is applied to the problem of unsupervised image segmentation.

{"title": "Recursive 3-D Visual Motion Estimation Using Subspace Constraints.", "abstract": "The 3-D motion of a camera within a static environment produces a sequence of time-varying images that can be used for reconstructing the relative motion between the scene and the viewer. The problem of reconstructing rigid motion from a sequence of perspective images may be characterized as the estimation of the state of a nonlinear dynamical system, which is defined by the rigidity constraint and the perspective measurement map. The time-derivative of the measured output of such a system, which is called the 2-D motion field and is approximated by the optical flow, is bilinear in the motion parameters, and may be used to specify a subspace constraint on the direction of heading independent of rotation and depth, and a pseudo-measurement for the rotational velocity as a function of the estimated heading. The subspace constraint may be viewed as an implicit dynamical model with parameters on a differentiable manifold, and the visual motion estimation problem may be cast in a system-theoretic framework as the identification of such an implicit model. We use techniques which pertain to nonlinear estimation and identification theory to recursively estimate 3-D rigid motion from a sequence of images independent of the structure of the scene. Such independence from scene-structure allows us to deal with a variable number of visible feature-points and occlusions in a principled way. The further decoupling of the direction of heading from the rotational velocity generates a filter with a state that belongs to a two-dimensional and highly constrained state-space. As a result, the filter exhibits robustness properties which are highlighted in a series of experiments on real and noisy synthetic image sequences. While the position of feature-points is not part of the state of the model, the innovation process of the filter describes how each feature is compatible with a rigid motion interpretation, which allows us to test for outliers and makes the filter robust with respect to errors in the feature tracking/optical flow, reflections, T-junctions. Once motion has been estimated, the 3-D structure of the scene follows easily.

We conducted a series of experiments applying three learning approaches  lazy Q-learning, k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), and a genetic algorithm  to a particular differential game called a pursuit game.  Our experiments demonstrate that k-NN had great difficulty solving the problem, while a lazy version of Q-learning performed moderately well and the genetic algorithm performed even better.  These results motivated the next step in the experiments, where we hypothesized k-NN was having difficulty because it did not have good examples  a common source of difficulty for lazy learning.  Therefore, we used the genetic algorithm as a bootstrapping method for k-NN to create a system to provide these examples.  Our experiments demonstrate that the resulting joint system learned to solve the pursuit games with a high degree of accuracy  outperforming either method alone  and with relatively small memory requirements.", "id": "428", "src": "a teaching strategy for memory based control . . combining different machine learning algorithms in the same system can produce benefits above and beyond what either method could achieve alone . this paper demonstrates that genetic algorithms can be used in conjunction with lazy learning to solve examples of a difficult class of delayed reinforcement learning problems better than either method alone . this class , the class of differential games , includes numerous important control problems that arise in robotics , planning , game playing , and other areas , and solutions for differential games suggest solution strategies for the general class of planning and control problems . we conducted a series of experiments applying three learning approaches lazy q learning , k nearest neighbor ( k nn ) , and a genetic algorithm to a particular differential game called a pursuit game . our experiments demonstrate that k nn had great difficulty solving the problem , while a lazy version of q learning performed moderately well and the genetic algorithm performed even better . these results motivated the next step in the experiments , where we hypothesized k nn was having difficulty because it did not have good examples a common source of difficulty for lazy learning . therefore , we used the genetic algorithm as a bootstrapping method for k nn to create a system to provide these examples . our experiments demonstrate that the resulting joint system learned to solve the pursuit games with a high degree of accuracy outperforming either method alone and with relatively small memory requirements ."}

An instance of the Batched Searching and Ranking problem, (BSR, for short) involves a sorted matrix A of items from a totally ordered universe, along with a collection Q of queries. Q is an arbitrary mix of the following query types: For a search query qj, one is interested in an item of A that is closest to qj; for a rank query qj one is interested in the number of items of A that are strictly smaller than qj.

To prove this, we specify a small set of equations, called E-axioms, that capture the information loss in Mycroft's method and develop a new proof technique called E-rewriting. E-rewriting extends the standard notion of rewriting to permit the use of reductions using E-axioms interspersed with standard reduction steps.  E-axioms are a syntactic characterization of information loss and E-rewriting provides and algorithm-independent proof technique for characterizing the power of analysis methods.  It can be used to answer questions on completeness and incompleteness of Mycroft's method on certain natural classes of programs. Finally, the techniques developed in this paper provide a general principle for establishing similar results for other analysis methods such as those based on abstract interpretation.  As a demonstration of the generality of our technique, we give a characterization theorem for another variation of Mycroft's method called dd-analysis.", "id": "446", "src": "on the power and limitations of strictness analysis . . strictness analysis is an important technique for optimization of lazy functional languages . it is well known that all strictness analysis methods are incomplete , i . e . , fail to report some strictness properties . in this paper , we provide a precise and formal characterization of the loss of information that leads to this incompletenss . specifically , we establish the following characterization theorem for mycroft ' s strictness analysis method and a generalization of this method , called ee analysis , that reasons about exhaustive evaluation in nonflat domains mycroft ' s method will deduce a strictness property for program p iff the property is independent of any constant appearing in any evaluation of p . to prove this , we specify a small set of equations , called e axioms , that capture the information loss in mycroft ' s method and develop a new proof technique called e rewriting . e rewriting extends the standard notion of rewriting to permit the use of reductions using e axioms interspersed with standard reduction steps . e axioms are a syntactic characterization of information loss and e rewriting provides and algorithm independent proof technique for characterizing the power of analysis methods . it can be used to answer questions on completeness and incompleteness of mycroft ' s method on certain natural classes of programs . finally , the techniques developed in this paper provide a general principle for establishing similar results for other analysis methods such as those based on abstract interpretation . as a demonstration of the generality of our technique , we give a characterization theorem for another variation of mycroft ' s method called dd analysis ."}

The conclusion drawn is that if this algorithm is implemented with hyperbolic transformations in the factored form which is well known to provide numerical stability in the context of Cholesky downdating, then the generalized Schur algorithm will be stable.  If a more direct implementation of the hyperbolic transformations is used, then it will be unstable.  In this respect, the algorithm is analogous to Cholesky downdating; the details of implementation of the hyperbolic transformations are essential for stability.

{"title": "An Unsymmetric-Pattern Multifrontal Method for Sparse LU Factorization.", "abstract": "Sparse matrix factorization algorithms for general problems are typically characterized by irregular memory access patterns that limit their performance on parallel-vector supercomputers. For symmetric problems, methods such as the multifrontal method avoid indirect addressing in the innermost loops by using dense matrix kernels. However, no efficient LU factorization algorithm based primarily on dense matrix kernels exists for matrices whose pattern is very unsymmetric. We address this deficiency and present a new unsymmetric-pattern multifrontal method based on dense matrix kernels. As in the classical multifrontal method, advantage is taken of repetitive structure in the matrix by factorizing more than one pivot in each frontal matrix, thus enabling the use of Level 2 and Level 3 BLAS.

{"title": "Dynamic Verification of C++ Generic Algorithms.", "abstract": "AbstractDynamic verification is a new approach to formal verification, applicable to generic algorithms such as those found in the Standard Template Library (STL, part of the Draft ANSI/ISO C++ Standard Library). Using behavioral abstraction and symbolic execution techniques, verifications are carried out at an abstract level such that the results can be used in a variety of instances of the generic algorithms without repeating the proofs. This is achieved by substituting for type parameters of generic algorithms special data types that model generic concepts by accepting symbolic inputs and deducing outputs using inference methods. By itself, this symbolic execution technique supports testing of programs with symbolic values at an abstract level. For formal verification we also need to generate multiple program execution paths and use assertions (to handle while loops, for example), but we show how this can be achieved via directives to a conventional debugger program and an analysis database. The assertions must still be supplied, but they can be packaged separately and evaluated as needed by appropriate transfers of control orchestrated via the debugger. Unlike all previous verification methods, the dynamic verification method thus works without having to transform source code or process it with special interpreters.
