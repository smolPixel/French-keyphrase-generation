0	Représentation et fétichisation des femmes trans racisées dans les médias audiovisuels	This master's thesis focuses on the representation and fetishization of trans women of color in audiovisual media. This study first describes the evolution of trans-feminine representation from the 1950s to recent years. Trans women of color were virtually invisible in the early decades. The thesis distinguishes anti-assimilationist representation from integrationist representation. The film Paris Is Burning (1991, Livingston) announces a change and a new reality in media. The impact of the New Queer Cinema documentary is still significant to this day. The television series Pose (Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk, Steven Canals, FX, 2018-2021) pays homage to director Jennie Livingston's film almost thirty years later. The thesis examines the feminist, intersectional and queer theory of the 1990s to understand these studies' evolution. This analysis questions the subversion of gender roles and the impact of performance and performativity in trans* media images.

1	Du désir dans l’écriture (ailleurs, une rencontre) ; suivi de Peut-être que dehors	The essay Du désir dans l'écriture (ailleurs, une rencontre) proposes a quest for decompartmentalization – carried out in a pandemic context of confinement – for textual forms that require a rethinking of the categories defining (and limiting) the modes of existence and circulation of cultural objects. This reflection is articulated, among other things, through a reading of La nuit juste avant les forêts, a work by Bernard-Marie Koltès that is irreducible to what is called “theater” and that nevertheless invites the sharing of an experience: despite the endless flow of words drawn in one direction, the word overflows its medium (the page, the stage) and a true communion catches whoever is there, outside the diegesis, to welcome it. By approaching the text beyond its mediation, this thesis proposes an intuitive contribution, based on research-creation, to the thought of communication (and its impossibility). As an extension of the theory, Peut-être que dehors embodies this quest for a living word in practice. The artistic and meditative proposal takes the form of a series of fragments that render in a fragmented way a narrative of traumatic memory, made of holes and blanks. The textual configuration reflects on the one hand the stammering of saying what is usually kept silent, and on the other hand the space that is missing to breathe and heal. In conditions of solitude, of isolation, the voice of writing questions what it takes to create trust and encounter, community perhaps, with whoever receives the words.	interpellation , Bernard-Marie Koltès , La nuit juste avant les forêts , word , between , text , experience , calling , creative writing , utopia	en	26483.0
2	Agresseurs sexuels sadiques : profil psychodéveloppemental, et hétérogénéité du modus operandi	To date, there has been no consensus in the literature on the characteristics of the sadistic sexual aggressor. This has been largely the result of the limitations of studies of this phenomenon (e.g., idiosyncratic definitions of sexual sadism, heterogeneous samples, temporality fixed at adulthood). In an effort to address these limitations, we identified the distinguishing features of sadistic (n = 69) and nonsadistic (n = 137) sexual aggressors against adult women, all of whom were incarcerated in Quebec (Canada), using the Severe Sexual Sadism Scale (SESAS), an empirically validated measurement instrument for sexual sadism, as well as other variables. Bivariate (chi-square) analyses revealed that sadistic and nonsadistic sexual aggressors of adult women differed in several ways, including developmental (e.g., victimization before age 18), psychological (e.g., personality, psychopathology), sexological (e.g., deviant sexual fantasies), and criminological (e.g., modus operandi). To determine whether sexual sadism is a heterogeneous phenomenon, latent class analyses were conducted on the SESAS items. These analyses revealed that sexual sadism is not heterogeneous, manifesting itself differently depending on the characteristics of the sexual aggressor. The above results and their theoretical and clinical implications are discussed.	SESAS , Sexual sadism , Rapist , Latent class analysis , Developmental	en	26466.0
3	La gestion des bris de condition par les professionnels travaillant dans les centres résidentiels communautaires	This thesis aims to understand the decision-making process regarding the management of breach of condition for parolees in the community. More specifically, this study seeks to understand how the relation built between the parolee and his supervisor intervene in the decision-making process. The research also aims to explore how the organisational context and the sociopolitical context have an impact on the management regarding the breach of condition. To proceed, we used a methodology based on a qualitative approach. Accordingly, we conducted nine (9) semi-directed interviews with professionals supervising parolees and managing breach of condition in the community. Results from the interviews are divided in two categories. The first category includes the dimensions related to the interpersonal context. This context includes the representations of the participants regarding the parolees and the parole itself. These dimensions are operationalised in a key moment of this process, which is the disciplinary meeting. The second category describes the dimensions related to the organisational context. These dimensions include the community approach, the decision-making framework and the socio-political context around the management of the breach of condition. Our analyses illustrate how the decision-making process is related to the interrelation between multiple dynamics from which an expert knowledge is produced. Those dynamics are formed around the relation between the parolee and the professional, the knowledge from the organisational context, the dynamic from within the clinical team and the relation with the correctional service. The management of breach of condition also lies on the tension between the organisation’s philosophy, the representations of the participants and the discourses from the socio-political context. This context includes the political mainstream, the administrative context and the mediatic events that intervene on the expert knowledge produced by the professionals in which their discretionary power lies in the decision-making. Finally, we went back to our objectives and open the study on recommendations for future research.	Reintegration , community supervision , experience , work , risk assessment	en	26464.0
4	Zinc and Zirconium catalysts in rac-lactide polymerization	The phenoxy-imine ligand bearing heteroatom-containing N and O were prepared from condensation of paraformaldehyde, 4-(tert-butyl)-2-tritylphenol with di-(2-picolyl)amine. LZnN(SiMe3)2 was prepared by reaction of Zn(N(SiMe3)2)2 and the ligand. The complex has been studied by X-ray diffraction and NMR. Application of this complex in rac-lactide polymerization gave atactic PLA via a catalytic-site mediated chain-end control mechanism. Pyridylaminophenol ligands were prepared from phenol (2,4-di-tert-butylphenol, 2,4-di-cholorolphenol, 2,4-di-methylphenol), pyridine-2-ylmethylamine and formaldehyde (LH2 = (2,4-X2C6(OH)H2(5-CH2)2N(CH2C5H4N), X = Me or Cl). Reaction of Zr(OnPr)4 with 2 equiv of LH2 gave L2Zr. L2Zr were mixtures of C2-symmetric isomers, which was confirmed by NMR, DFT and X-ray diffraction studies. The only isomer for X=Me was the cis-isomer while the major isomer for X=Cl was the trans-isomer. All complex were active in rac-lactide polymerization at 140 °C and heterotactic PLA was obtained. L2Zr followed an activated monomer mechanism with benzyl alcohol as co-initiator.

5	La participation des Autochtones aux institutions démocratiques canadiennes	The political participation of those who identify themselves as Indigenous peoples in Canada's democratic institutions (whether through voting or running for election) is a subject that has received little attention in the scientific literature. Long banned and still criticized by many influential authors, today the political participation is a political reality. The electoral turnout of Indigenous peoples living on reserve has been above 50% since three federal elections. We also see an increase in the number of Indigenous people candidates since 2008 and the election of an ever-increasing number of Indigenous people as Members of Parliament (MPs) in each election since 2011. This phenomenon gives us an unprecedented opportunity to draw a portrait of Indigenous people’s complex relationship with Canadian democratic institutions and make sense of its signification for Canadian citizenship. This thesis by articles explores these issues from both a theoretical and an empirical perspectives. In a first article, we theoretically deal with the normative tension between Indigenous individuals’ electoral participation and self-determination. We argue that the normative tension between the two largely depends on one’s conception of self-determination as a political project. In the second article, we use quantitative data to study the electoral behavior of Indigenous peoples. We argue that beyond partisan considerations, the electoral behaviour of Indigenous communities is heavily influenced by affinity voting. In the third article, we deal with the representation of indigenous people’s interests by indigenous MPs elected under the 42nd legislature. Our qualitative analysis of speeches in the House of Commons suggests that Indigenous MPs do tend to address indigenous-related issues more frequently and do so differently than other MPs. We conclude that, contrary to many of its critiques, the participation of Indigenous communities in Canadian democratic institutions cannot be reduced to a form of assimilation or a straightforward acceptance of the rules of Canadian citizenship. This renewed engagement should instead be located within a broader political movement and collective agency in defending and promoting distinct Indigenous peoples identities and interests.

6	Environnement physique et environnement social : conséquences physiologiques de la sélection des habitats	Habitat selection is an important behaviour that relates individuals to the environmental conditions in their habitat, and is generally studied to infer population-level patterns of distributions. Habitat selection varies among individuals and there is growing evidence that individual differences often exceed population differences in habitat selection. On the one hand, if habitat selection is adaptive, it could be hypothesized that individuals would select habitats that would maximize their fitness. On the other hand, environmental conditions in habitats can have physiological consequences, which can be amplified or masked by the social environment. Therefore, the general objective of this thesis was to better understand the determinants and physiological consequences of habitat selection.  We created and compared the predictive capacity of habitat selection models for smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu integrating individual variability. Our results show that by integrating individual variability, we could identify variables influencing individual-, group-, and population-level habitat selection. Models that included variables referring to presence of shelter had the best predictive capacity. Further, we identified groups of individuals defined by their habitat selection. Nevertheless, variation in habitat selection among individuals was higher than that among groups.  Presence of shelter was the main correlate of habitat selection for smallmouth bass. We then we tested whether presence of shelter could influence smallmouth bass metabolic traits estimated during respirometry trials. In presence of shelter, resting metabolic rates (RMR) were lower than in absence of shelter for smallmouth bass from a lake population. There was no difference in RMR for smallmouth bass from a river population. Further, dominant individuals showed reduced recovery time (RT) in presence of shelter, while no difference was observed in subordinate individuals. We investigated how social group size and availability of shelter could influence metabolic rate. This project was conducted on Eurasian minnow Phoxinus phoxinus, a highly social fish. Fish held in smaller groups had higher standard metabolic rate as compared to that of fish held in larger groups. Presence of shelter during respirometry trials was associated with reduced metabolic rates, regardless of group size fish were held in. Our results suggest that social group size may directly influence energy demands of individuals, highlighting the importance of understanding the role of group size on variations in physiological traits associated with energy expenditure. Our results highlight the importance of considering the physical and social environment to better understand the physiological consequences of habitat selection.

7	Rôle de la sélection intersexuelle dans l’évolution de la cognition mâle et femelle : approche observationnelle et théorique	Choosing a mate is an important decision for an animal. Because this decision significantly affects an individual’s reproductive success, it must base its choice according to different traits that reflect the quality of potential mates. Recently, a particular attention has been given to cognitive traits in mate choice context. Indeed, the ability to perceive, integrate, memorize and use the information available in the environment allows individuals to act properly when facing a problem and to adjust their behaviours accordingly. Given that females could benefit from choosing males capable of responding to environmental changes, those with good cognitive abilities should have privileged access to females in mate choice contexts. Some evidence supports this idea by revealing positive relationships between males’ cognitive abilities and their mating and reproductive success as well as female mating preference for male cognitive abilities. However, these results stay contrasted, particularly in non-human animals for which the importance of mate choice in the evolution of cognition is still not clearly defined. The objective of my PhD was to explore the role of mate choice in the evolution of male and female cognition by combining an observational approach using a monogamous bird species and a theoretical approach using an agent-based model. Specifically, by running laboratory experiments on zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata), I tested whether females demonstrated a mate preference for males able to adjust their foraging behaviour following an environmental change. Then, I investigated whether females, depending on their own cognitive abilities, demonstrated a mate preference for better performers in four different psychometric tests. I finally explored the relative role of natural and sexual selection by simulating the evolution of cognition under different environmental scenarios. The results of this PhD project revealed that zebra finch females preferred males exhibiting greater behavioural plasticity in their foraging tactic use as well as males performing better in several cognitive tasks. However, females’ preference for cognitive abilities was not unanimous but depended on females’ own abilities to perform in these tasks. At the evolutionary scale, intersexual selection through mate choice changed the evolutive patterns observed under natural selection alone. In fact, intersexual selection promoted good cognitive abilities under most favourable environments but maintained cognitive diversity under the harsher ones. Taken together, these results suggest that mate choice plays an important role in the evolution and maintenance of cognitive diversity within populations. Nevertheless, the evolutive consequences of mate choice on individual cognitive abilities should depend on i) the adaptive value of mating with a male with better performance, and thus, on the cognitive ability considered, ii) the female characteristics and iii) the local environment during mate choice.	intersexual selection , cognitive abilities , sexual preference , cognitive diversity , Zebra finch , agent-based model	en	26433.0
8	Detector dose response to megavoltage photon beams coupled to magnetic fields	Magnetic resonance-guided radiation therapy promises more accurate dose delivery than conventional techniques by allowing real-time visualization of internal structures before and during treatment. However, the dosimetry must be performed in the presence of magnetic fields. While the magnetic field does not affect the transport of uncharged particles, it affects the transport of secondary charged particles due to the Lorentz force, which modifies the radiation field and the detector dose-response. This thesis aims to understand the effect of the magnetic field on detector dose-response, characterize it, and provide quality correction factors accounting for the impact of the magnetic field. In the first article, four small-cavity ionization chambers were characterized via Monte Carlo simulations and experimental measurements. It was found that the magnetic field emphasized all the geometrical details. An accurate description of the effective sensitive volume is crucial in the simulations. Also, the modelled geometry must be as close as possible to the actual geometry, including the internal air layers. Quality correction factors accounting for the magnetic field and its uncertainty budget uncertainty are presented for different configurations. The second article evaluated the magnetic field effect on perturbation factors of five small volume detectors, including three ionization chambers and two solid-state detectors. The perturbation factors from extracameral components, density and volume averaging factors were determined for different field sizes and orientation setups. Additionally, quality correction factors were calculated in the same conditions. Results show that the magnetic field significantly impacts the density perturbation factor in the ionization chambers. In contrast, its impact is more pronounced in the extracameral components in the solid-state detectors. The purpose of the third article was to provide more insight into the understanding of detector dose-response in magnetic fields via calculations of electron fluence spectra. The electron fluence differential in energy in the detector cavity can be severely modified in magnetic fields, and fluence perturbations are generally more evident for low-energy electrons. These calculations showed the interplay between multiple factors that make the perturbation effects unpredictable in photon beams coupled to magnetic fields: 1) detector and magnetic field orientation, 2) cavity size and shape, 3) extracameral components, 4) air gaps and their asymmetry, and 5) energy.

9	Plaques de glace permanentes : étude de leurs caractéristiques intrinsèques et de leurs effets sur la dynamique hydrologique et biogéomorphologique des versants du désert polaire arctique	Ice patches are small perennial masses of ice and snow that are considered as part of the continuum between seasonal snow and glacier. They are ubiquitous in the Polar Regions, which gives them an important function in slope hydrology and geomorphology. Ice patches have, however, received very little scientific attention so far. Gaining new knowledge on these cryospheric elements thus appears essential, not only to understand their intrinsic characteristics, but also because it holds important perspectives for understanding the dynamics of the polar geosystem. To address this need, this thesis aims to investigate the origin and functioning of the ice patches at Ward Hunt Island (Canadian High Arctic) and to understand their effects on polar desert slope dynamics. This research on ice patches was guided by a multidisciplinary approach, involving glaciological, snow, hydrological and biogeomorphological studies. Our results demonstrated that ice patches develop through the aggradation of superimposed ice that forms by the refreezing of meltwater at the base of the seasonal snowpack. The texture and physical properties of this ice vary according to its age and the intensity of recrystallization processes. The spatio-temporal variability of ice patches is mainly controlled by local topography and micrometeorological conditions. In winter, the snow supply to the topographic niches where ice patches form is provided by the wind. In summer, the intensity of ablation is strongly influenced by wind and fog, which modulate energy exchange at the surface of the patches. The evolution of ice patches is characterized by long-term stability due to a self-regulating mass balance mechanism provided by the topoclimatic context. However, because of their small size, ice patches can disappear very quickly when summer ablation exceeds a threshold at which topoclimatic conditions can no longer ensure their preservation. At Ward Hunt Island, the presence of the ice patches for at least several centuries makes them important drivers of slope development. Sustained meltwater and sediment supplies delivered by ice patches to their pronival margin have triggered a sequence of abiotic and biotic azonal processes. This led to the formation of a biogeomorphic system, consisting of solifluction lobes and humid zones colonized by vegetation and an organic crust cover. Morphological and physical changes in the soil downslope of the ice patches influenced the surface thermal regime and thaw depths. Furthermore, our results show that the humid zone development leads to a local modification of the physical properties of snow by enhancing kinetic metamorphism responsible for the growth of a depth hoar layer at the base of the snowpack. Through a comprehensive understanding of polar ice patches and their effects, this thesis provides important empirical and conceptual advances that contribute to a better understanding of polar desert geosystem dynamics at a pivotal time when these environments are undergoing a rapid transition in response to climate change.

10	L’invention de la rencontre : contrat et transaction dans les représentations littéraires de l’échange prostitutionnel	This thesis focuses on the literary representation of prostitutional exchange in its ambiguous relationship to the concepts of contract, intimacy and encounter. It is based on an analysis of texts by Villiers de L'Isle-Adam, Maupassant, Flaubert, Arcan and Duras, as well as Manet's painting, Olympia.  First, I focus on a theme addressed by some writings within the corpus which has become commonplace: the idea of prostitution as the too wide extension of capitalism, as it “reifies the world.” I show the various deployments of this metaphor. In a second step, I analyze literary works that put forward the prostitutional exchange by returning to another relationship that it maintains with the market (intimately linked to the first): that of the closure and the clarity of the rapport allowed by the contract. The texts offered for study herein problematize this “cancelled” meeting. In this, I address on the one hand the development of “surpassing” of the contract towards intimacy, and on the other, on the staging, replayed in the prostitutional exchange, of an impediment of the relationship. How does prostitution become the pejorative metaphor for venality? How does it also become the place of repetition of an impossible “real” sexual encounter? These queries spark others to unfold through the thesis, in that the latter questions the prostitutional exchange in literature as a paradigmatic place of the contract, paradoxically developed from within by the invention of an encounter constantly yearning to be inexistant.

11	Impact longitudinal du soutien du superviseur sur l’adaptation émotionnelle des intervenants en protection de la jeunesse exposés à une agression commise par un usager	While performing their mandate, child protection workers (CPWs) are exposed to numerous occupational hazards. One such hazard is the psychological abuse and physical hostility directed at them by service users. Since many families view a CPW’s involvement in their lives as an unwelcome intrusion, CPWs frequently find themselves needing to de-escalate tense situations, some of which devolve into abusive acts. Over time, these emotionally charged encounters can interfere with CPW health and wellbeing. This thesis aims to further our current understanding of how CPWs cope in the aftermath of abusive acts perpetrated upon them by service users in the work setting. The thesis project opens with a comprehensive overview of the current scientific literature on the topic, followed by three scientific articles—two qualitative and one quantitative—that contribute much-needed information on the experience of at-risk CPWs. The first thesis article—a thematic analysis of 30 CPWs’ experiences—then provides an overview of the abusive acts that are directed at CPWs in the workplace. Specifically, it describes the various forms of hostility or abuse the CPWs experience, along with their subjective perception of it and the coping strategies they employ. This first article highlights more specifically how service-user hostility is a constant concern for CPWs, whether they practice in the community or in residential treatment centers. CPWs draw upon a variety of positive coping methods as adjustment strategies, such as teamwork and supervisor support; and sometimes employ harmful coping strategies, such as denial and minimization, in order to keep fulfilling their mandate. The author reveals that feeling “safe” whilst being confronted with repeated acts of aggression proves a constant struggle for CPWs, who often report high levels of distress and few sources of organizational support. Findings from the first article suggest that CPW distress sometimes leads to their mishandling tense situations. In consideration of this, the main objective of the second article was to study the interrelationship between emotional distress and revictimization. Using cross-lagged panel analysis, this second article reveals that the emotional distress reported by 173 CPWs subsequent to a potentially traumatic workplace event can in fact be linked to higher rates of revictimization when dealing with service users up to two months later, but not six or twelve months later. This suggests that CPWs are particularly at risk of hostile acts recurring after a recent distressing event in their work setting. Although supervisor support can be correlated with lower levels of emotional distress after a potentially traumatic event, this variable does not moderate the relationship between emotional distress and revictimization, suggesting that its influence is more complex than previously described. Mixed results from the second article motivated a more thorough analysis of the CPWs who seek support from their supervisors after having suffered an abusive encounter with a service user. The last article consists of a qualitative longitudinal study of the lived realities of 30 CPWs who had recently been subjected to an act of aggression. Findings reveal that the quality of the supervisor/CPW relationship greatly influences how CPWs manage their distress and how they seek out and perceive support from their supervisors. Indeed, when CPWs have a strong and open relationship with their supervisors, they express emotions more freely and are more open to involving their supervisors in their adjustment efforts which, in turn, leads to more favorable outcomes (e.g., less emotional distress, greater professional growth, meaning-making). To the contrary, when the supervisor/CPW relationship is perceived as poor, CPWs have low expectations and choose to manage the distress on their own—which sometimes translates into their opting for strategies which may lead to greater emotional distress over time, such as minimization or denial. The thesis closes with a discussion on how the availability and quality of personal and organizational resources—such as supervisor support—greatly influence the adjustment capacity of CPWs when facing abusive encounters with service users. In fact, CPWs may not be able to rely on their supervisors when in need, either due to the poor quality of the relationship or due to other factors such as time constraints resulting from excessive workloads. This places additional pressure on CPWs who must find alternative strategies to manage distress on their own—which sometimes means more frequent recourse to ineffective coping strategies. Using Job Demands and Resources Theory (Demerouti et al., 2001), this thesis concludes by explaining how the organizational context can constrain and shape the way CPWs choose to adapt. Indeed, adaptation does not solely depend on workers or their supervisors, but also on the resources made available by their employer. Unfortunately, this thesis also describes how organisational resources are often insufficient to counteract the effects of job demands, such as repeated aggression. Still, this thesis recommends several avenues that could help organizations to provide CPWs with more effective support by eliminating some constraints that promote ineffective coping strategies and by increasing both the availability and the quality of resources that encourage the adoption of more effective coping strategies.

12	Legislation, health policy, and the utilisation of sexual and reproductive health services by people with disabilities : a mixed methods study in post-conflict Northern Uganda	Introduction: Sexual and reproductive health (SRH) rights are essential to achieve universal health coverage (UHC) for all, including people with disabilities. Uganda emerged from a 20-year armed conflict which created both disability and damage to health systems, especially in the Northern region. One Ugandan in five lives with some disability. Uganda adopted a series of normative tools promoting the rights of people with disabilities. However, their access to SRH services remains limited. More broadly, ableist gendered roles remain pervasive and men and youth with disabilities are less targeted by SRH programmes (Article 1). Health policies and their implementation need deeper contextualised analysis  to protect the right to health of people with disabilities. This thesis aimed to examine the perceived and empirical relationships among legislation, health policies, and SRH service utilisation among people with disabilities in post-conflict Northern Uganda.  Methods: A sequential exploratory mixed methods design was informed by the Intersectionality-based Policy Analysis (IPBA) framework. First, I conducted a multiple case study with five groups of policy actors (people with disabilities, service providers, disabled people’s organisations, national and international organisations, and national policy-makers). I thematically analysed 45 in-depth interviews and nine focus groups and observed seven health facilities regarding accessibility. Second, I analysed secondary data with multivariable logistic regressions, from the 2006, 2011, and 2016 Uganda Demographic and Health Surveys regarding SRH service use among 15,739 individuals in the decade following the adoption of national legislation promoting the rights of people with disabilities. Third, I conducted a systematic review examining the relationships among legislation, health policies, and SRH service use among vulnerable populations in sub-Saharan Africa (1994-2019).  Results: This thesis highlights four main findings. First, the IBPA framework revealed complex relationships among legislation, health policy, and the use of SRH services by people with disabilities in Northern Uganda. These relationships were marked by policy implementation challenges, disability rights violation through multiple barriers to access, and intersecting vulnerabilities experienced by people with disabilities, exacerbated by underlying societal power structures. On one hand, the perceptions of different groups of policy actors converged by emphasising the ongoing SRH inequities faced by people with disabilities  (Articles 2 and 3). On the other hand, although SRH service use improved over time, it did not improve equally for everyone. The 10-year SRH service use trend showed nuanced patterns across people with different impairments; notably, richer women with hearing impairments were less likely than poor non-disabled women to have used safe motherhood services (Article 4). Second, despite identifying legislation and policy implementation challenges, the five groups of policy actors suggested several concrete and complementary recommendations to address barriers and operationalise transformative measures, such as disability data collection and budgeting (Articles 2 and 3). Third, research findings at the local level (Uganda) contextualised the findings at the regional level (sub-Saharan Africa), and vice versa. A 25-year systematic review showed that people with disabilities continue to be a blind spot in research on SRH service use and policy analysis (Article 5). Finally, the practice of reflexivity throughout the research revealed tensions in the application of ethics norms in the context of global health qualitative research with people with disabilities conducted in the Global South (Article 6).  Conclusion: The IPBA framework proved to be a useful and transformation-oriented analytical tool to disentangle complex policy implementation issues and multiple intersecting vulnerabilities and barriers to SRH service access and utilisation by people with disabilities. This thesis proposes two adapted conceptual frameworks for future disability-sensitive research focusing on equity-focused policy analysis in global health, integrating IBPA with Kingdon’s Policy Streams framework to enhance sensitivity to equity and Walt and Gilson’s Policy Triangle model to enhance sensitivity to the multiple dimensions of (in)equity. The Sustainable Development Goals emphasise inclusiveness and accountability. UHC for all is only possible through transformative action and research to fill knowledge and programmatic gaps, focusing on equity and human and disability rights. This thesis provides evidence enabling policy actors at different levels to act – now – to address and redress the social health inequities experienced by people with disabilities.

13	Examining negative online social reaction to police use of force : the George Floyd and Jacob Blake events	Dealing with use of excessive force by the police has historically been a struggle in the United States. The 1992 protests in Los Angeles following the death of Rodney King are one example of public response to an instance of excessive use of force. More recently, the death of George Floyd led to widespread protests against excessive use of force and the current model of policing in general. The increasing popularity and availability of social media over the past decade have made it a powerful tool for mobilizing citizens and provided a place for protest. This study looks at the negative reactions of social media users to police use of force in the United States based on analysis of two significant instances: the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and the shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha. Using quantitative, forensic linguistics, and advanced topic modelling methodologies, three prominent aspects of policing identified in the literature – excessive use of force, racial bias, and legitimacy – were analysed from 14 days of tweets following each event. Analyses deal with trends in frequency, case similarities, and topic modelling. The results show important differences in negative online reaction to the two events, particularly regarding excessive use of force: those following the Floyd death focused on the technicalities of the intervention, while those responding to the Blake death focused on its aftermath. Analysis of tweets related to racial bias and police legitimacy revealed similar patterns, with users repeating criticisms such as differential treatment according to race and the need for changes in the policing model. The results also suggest that perceptions of excessive use of force and racial bias are deeply intertwined. Implications and issues are discussed.

14	Molecular interactions of tannic acid with proteins associated with SARS-CoV-2 infectivity	The overall impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on our society is unprecedented. The identification of small natural ligands that could prevent the entry and/or replication of the coronavirus remains a pertinent approach to fight the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Previously, we showed that the phenolic compounds corilagin and 1,3,6-tri-O-galloyl-β-D-glucose (TGG) inhibit the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the SARS-CoV-2 target receptor on the cell membrane of the host organism. Building on these promising results, we now assess the effects of these phenolic ligands on two other crucial targets involved in SARS-CoV-2 cell entry and replication, respectively: transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and 3-chymotrypsin like protease (3CLpro) inhibitors. Since corilagin, TGG, and tannic acid (TA) share many physicochemical and structural properties, we investigate the binding of TA to these targets. In this work, a combination of experimental methods (biochemical inhibition assays, surface plasmon resonance, and quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring) confirms the potential role of TA in the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity through the inhibition of extracellular RBD/ACE2 interactions and TMPRSS2 and 3CLpro activity. Moreover, molecular docking prediction followed by dynamic simulation and molecular mechanics Poisson–Boltzmann surface area (MMPBSA) free energy calculation also shows that TA binds to RBD, TMPRSS2, and 3CLpro with higher affinities than TGG and corilagin. Overall, these results suggest that naturally occurring TA is a promising candidate to prevent and inhibit the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2.

15	Untargeted and targeted metabolomics reveal that adenosine nucleotides released in Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae supernatant inhibit porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus replication	Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is one of the most devastating viruses in the swine industry and causes major economic losses. To date, there has not been an effective antiviral treatment for the disease. We have shown in previous studies that culture supernatant of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (App), the causative agent of porcine pleuropneumonia, possesses antiviral activity in vitro against PRRSV, and we have clearly established that the antiviral activity was mediated by small molecular weight (i.e., <1 kDa), heat resistant metabolites present in the App supernatant ultrafiltrates. However, the identity of those metabolites remains unknown. The objective of the current study was to identify the active metabolites using untargeted and targeted mass spectrometry-based metabolomics and test their respective antiviral activity against PRRSV in the Jude Porcine Lung Epithelial Cell Line (SJPL). The results presented reveal very significant antiviral activity of App supernatant ultrafiltrates against PRRSV in SJPL cells. Consequently, we identified and quantified several adenosine nucleotide metabolites present in App supernatant ultrafiltrates using mass spectrometry-based metabolomics, and the concentrations detected were very high. SJPL cells infected with PRRSV and treated with 2′-adenosine monophosphate (2-AMP), 3′-adenosine monophosphate (3-AMP) or 5′-adenosine monophosphate (5-AMP) significantly reduced PRRSV infection. Interestingly, many antiviral drugs or prodrugs are adenosine analogs, and the mechanism of action was previously elucidated. Currently marketed nucleoside analog drugs could potentially be used to treat PRRSV infection.

16	The influence of residential workers social climate on the use of restraint and seclusion : a longitudinal study in a residential treatment center for youth	Restraint and seclusion (R&S) are two types of interventions residential workers can use to manage aggressive behaviors in youth residential treatment centers (RTC). Factors related to the environment, children, and residential workers have all been associated with their use. Although research in psychiatric settings has shown a relationship between social climate and the use of R&S, no similar studies have been conducted in RTC. The first objective of this paper was to assess the extent to which social climate was associated with the use of R&S in RTC. The second objective was to observe how each dimension of social climate predicted the use of R&S. To accomplish this, a sample of 198 residential workers completed a monthly questionnaire on their unit’s social climate at three different time points. Crossed-lagged analyses were performed to test associations between different dimensions of social climate and the use of R&S over time. Results suggest that good communication and openness among team members are associated with lower rates of R&S use while the focus on common objectives and planning are associated with an increased use of these measures. Perceptions of a negative team climate were not associated with the use of R&S. Results imply that if residential workers had the time and the training needed to meet the needs of individual children they would favor alternative interventions instead of worrying about creating tensions with colleagues.

17	Rôle des protéines ERM au cours de la morphogenèse cellulaire	Cell morphogenesis represents the set of events that dictate the shape and structure of a cell. These morphological changes are important for many vital mechanisms such as embryonic development, inflammatory response, or wound healing. Cell morphogenesis depends mainly on the remodeling of the cell cytoskeleton which forms the framework of the cell when associated with the plasma membrane. Ezrin, radixin and moesin belong to the ERM family and crosslink the plasma membrane to the actin cytoskeleton and microtubules. Therefore, ERMs are involved in various fundamental processes requiring remodeling of the cell cortex such as mitosis and migration. In a pathological context, overexpression and/or overactivation of ERMs correlate with high metastatic potential and poor prognosis in patients. Thus, a better understanding of the regulation of these three proteins could help in the development of new therapeutic solutions. The aim of my PhD work was to identify and characterize novel signaling pathways regulating ERMs. In a first step (i), I participated in the development and characterization of BRET2 biosensors allowing to follow the activity of each ERM protein in real time. These BRET2 biosensors are compatible with large-scale studies which will allow us to perform genomic and chemical screens to identify, respectively, new upstream regulators and pharmacological inhibitors of ERMs. Secondly (ii), based on BRET2-chemical screen, we identified microtubules as new negative regulators of ERMs. We then showed that depolymerization of interphase microtubules at mitosis entry triggers ERM activation and cell rounding. Finally (iii), we showed that the G protein-coupled receptor TPα regulates the activity of ERMs in triple negative breast cancer cells. This regulation is important for the motility of these cells. To conclude, in addition to having developed new tools useful for large-scale studies, my PhD work has uncovered two new signaling pathways regulating ERMs during mitosis and cell motility. In addition to providing new information on a fundamental aspect, my work has provided new insights into the roles of ERMs in the development of metastasis.

18	Essays in financial economics	This thesis reviews some economic risk factors (labor income risk, shadow banking risk, and carbon risk) using new data sources and novel methodologies. The first chapter investigates how the response of consumption to human capital risk affects household finance. Using joint data on consumption, income, and assets of representative US households, I document the excess smoothness of consumption as an essential factor for portfolio choice and show that it can explain household finance puzzles. Furthermore, I formalized the effect of the excess smoothness on the portfolio choice using a structural life-cycle model where a household faces an idiosyncratic wage income risk. The model is calibrated to match relevant aspects of the dynamics and the life cycle of risky asset holding from the PSID. The second chapter assesses banks’ risk-shifting in the non regulated banking activity, also called shadow banking. Exploiting variations in risks disclosed by banks in their financial reports and using textual analysis tools, this document provides a new measure non regulated banking activity. The paper empirically documents that (1) banks are more likely to shift risk out of the regulator’s reach when their risk-based capital constraints become binding, (2) there is a positive relationship between risk-shifting and tail risk of banks. The paper then rationalizes banks’ risk-shifting behavior using a macroeconomic model with a financial sector. In the model, the event of default on debt and the presence of externality due to imperfect regulation enforcement encourage banks to engage in risk-shifting strategies. As a result, banks behave as cross-sector arbitrageurs. Finally, the paper uses this framework to study optimal regulation. We show that a tax on sectoral activity effectively reduces banks’ risk-shifting compared to other bank’s equity regulation policies. Finally, the third chapter studies the effect of carbon risk on economic stability using a consumption-based carbon emissions approach for 50 U.S. states over the years 1998 - 2018. The paper assumes a cross-sectional dependence from unobserved common factors (e.g., trade linkage, financial integration) between the states. Under this assumption, we find that one unit decreases in carbon emissions is associated with 4.5 percentage points decrease in the per capita output growth over the long run. Besides, we find differential impacts across the distribution of per capita states income. These findings inform the debate over the optimal transition path toward a low carbon economy.

19	La métaphore vacante : concurrence des images entre 1929 et 1936 : photographie, surréalisme, revue, publicité	This thesis in visual history revisits Surrealist photography from interwar Paris in order to demonstrate the role of periodicals and advertising as agents (dispositifs) of photographic production and dissemination between 1929 and 1936. During a period which I refer to as the “second birth of photography,” I identify a previously overlooked relationship between the dissemination strategies used for photography in periodicals produced in the Surrealist context and the logics of the spectacle that governed the intensified circulation of images through print media. To explore this relationship, I draw upon the concept of competition (concurrence), which I elaborate by way of a pragmatic and energetic approach inspired by theories of the “iconic turn” (such as W. J. T. Mitchell’s), by Jean-François Lyotard’s idea of the dispositif, and by intermedial studies of the kind practiced by the Centre de Recherches sur l’Intermédialité (arts, lettres, techniques).  Adopting the tenets of microhistory, this thesis is structured around a series of case studies involving varied configurations between photography, Surrealism, the periodical and advertising. I offer close readings of the Surrealist periodical Le Surréalisme au service de la révolution (1930–1933), the first publication years of Minotaure (1933–1935), as well as the Électricité portfolio (1931), an advertising commission completed by Man Ray, and the advertising projects for Pétrole Hahn (1933–1935) produced by the Kéfer-Dora Maar studio. My analysis of this carefully chosen body of works sheds new light on the medial relations shaping the vitality of photographic images in the context of an intense visual proliferation. By proposing new conceptual tools to interpret visual sequences and image circulation, the thesis contributes to current conversations in visual studies regarding periodicals and the dissemination of photographs. The history of Surrealist photography I offer, with its novel concern for the energetics of images, also demonstrates the value of continuing to re-evaluate historical avant-gardes in the light of methodological innovations.

20	Terres de nos aïeux : la représentation du territoire historique dans l’historiographie canadienne-française	Migratory movements from Quebec between the mid-19th century and 1930 led to the  establishment of Francophone communities in various regions of North America, thus creating  contexts favourable to the formulation of historical discourse. In the course of this dissertation, we  analyze whether this discourse contributed to the great historical narrative of the French-Canadian  nation, or if it proposed a region-specific narrative. The dissertation compares the historiography  produced in Quebec to that emerging in the periphery, in Ontario, Western Canada and New  England, examining more specifically the representations of historical territory and the  development of a discours d’enracinement (or a sense of rootedness). This comparative study  provides a better understanding of the dynamics between regions and nation that influence  historical narrative in French Canadian history. Spanning more than a century, the study focuses on certain key moments in historical  production in Quebec and in the selected regions we study. By drawing parallels between historical  production in Quebec and in various minority settings, we examine the points of convergence and  divergences between historical work in the regions and in Quebec. This dissertation therefore  examines the place of the nation and the region in historical discourse, through the analysis of  the discours d’enracinement or sense of rootedness, in order to understand the role it plays in  Quebec’s historiography and in historical work being produced in the French Canadian  diaspora until the 1960s. The objective here is to highlight regional experiences and  the similarities and contrasts that have generally escaped researchers.	nation , Franco-Ontariens , Franco-Manitobains , historiography , intellectual history , territory , Canadian francophone communities , minority setting , Western Canada , Franco-Ontarians , Franco-Manitobans , Franco-Americans	en	26268.0
21	Synthesis and evaluation of selectin antagonists targeting acute inflammation	The first step for leukocyte adhesion and rolling along the vascular endothelium during the immune system inflammatory response involves the recognition of the tetrasaccharide sialyl LewisX (sLeX) by selectin glycoproteins. Dysfunction of the immune response, a consequence of several pathologies of inflammatory disease, leads to an excessive influx of leukocytes that necessitates therapeutic intervention. The development of glycomimetics, small molecule therapeutics that imitate complex glycans, is a promising strategy for treating inflammation. Specifically, a targeted approach amenable to severe acute inflammation, such as in hospitalized patients suffering from vaso-occlusive crises (VOC) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Building off the first generation of selectin antagonists developed by our laboratory, the aim of this work was to synthesize and evaluate the potency of a new class of sLeX glycomimetics for use as selectin antagonists targeting acute inflammation. This work describes the development of two novel strategies for sLeX glycomimetics incorporating a challenging trans-bicyclo[4.4.0] 3-O,4-C-fused galactopyranoside scaffold with a conformationally restricted carboxylate moiety. In the first approach, the key bicyclic galactopyranoside intermediate was accessed through a 13-step sequence with 19% overall yield from D-galactose pentaacetate. An unprecedented intramolecular cyclization reaction provided the desired axially configured bicyclic intermediate independent of the precursor stereochemistry. The origin of stereoselectivity was proposed to be under Curtin-Hammett kinetic control; a hypothesis supported by an experimental study and theoretical DFT calculations. The equatorial carboxylate series was also prepared using a desilylation strategy capitalizing on the migration of an β,γ-unsaturated ester. The second approach is highlighted by an orthogonal dual-glycosidation strategy that takes advantage of the conformationally restricted scaffold. The key bicyclic intermediate, bearing an α-configured C9 nitrile moiety, was prepared in 12 steps with a 53% overall yield. This approach led to a series of selectin antagonists incorporating axially-locked amide, amine, and tetrazole modifications at the C9 position, as well as an analogue incorporating a C6-benzamide. The modular galactopyranoside framework achieved using this approach can be exploited to prepare additional carboxylic acid bioisosteres for future SAR studies. A hybrid analogue was prepared, that combines the bicyclic galactopyranoside scaffold and a synthetic approach to selectin antagonists incorporating sidechain modifications to the first-generation tartrate diester. This synthetic route was also elaborated to access sLeX glycomimetics bearing a benzophenone-based photoaffinity probe. This analogue will serve as a valuable tool in the photoaffinity labeling of selectin proteins to elucidate key active site residues. The second-generation analogues were evaluated for their ability to inhibit selectin adhesion. A qualitative method to rank the binding strength towards recombinant P- and E-selectin proteins using SPR biosensor technology was developed, as well as a preliminary competitive inhibition in solution experiment with immobilized PSGL-1. Several compounds were also evaluated using an in vitro HL-60 cell adhesion assay, and a live-cell imaging experiment. An in vivo peritoneal lavage cellular migration assay was used to validate the potency of our lead compounds at inhibiting neutrophil recruitment in an acute inflammation model. Key results from the biological evaluations include an improvement in activity by restricting the conformation of the carboxylate moiety to the axial configuration, as well as an enhancement in potency over the lead compound from the first-generation series. Remarkably, specificity for P-selectin inhibition was observed with the galactopyranoside series, while the arabinopyranoside series, incorporating a tetrazole bioisostere, displayed significant activity towards E-selectin. The combination of the two modifications yielded remarkable pan-selectin activity that warrants further investigation.

22	L’utilisation du discours spontané pour le diagnostic précoce de la maladie d’Alzheimer	Subjective Cognitive Decline (SCD) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) are part of the preclinical and prodromal Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) phases, respectively and represent risk factors for progression to AD. Subtle changes in language abilities could be apparent many years before signs and symptoms of cognitive decline are noticed by an individual and/or their family and friends, and could potentially be used to facilitate the early diagnosis of AD. Connected Speech (CS) tasks are particularly well suited to study these linguistic changes because they share many similarities with the communication situations that individuals encounter in their everyday lives. Many studies have highlighted deficits in the CS of individuals with MCI and more and more studies are investigating the CS characteristics of individuals with SCD. The need to analyse CS manually currently represents a barrier to a more widespread use of CS tasks in a clinical environment. To overcome this barrier, many studies have shown the potential of Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning Classification computational methods. In addition to synthesizing these studies’ findings, this article will review the different types of CS tasks used in the literature (picture description tasks, narrative tasks, interviews) and the results of studies on the characteristics of CS in SCD and MCI. The linguistic characteristics reviewed in this article are broken down into six categories: speech production, fluency, lexical, semantic, syntactic, and pragmatic characteristics.

23	Analyse de la mise en œuvre de la pédagogie Montessori dans deux écoles du primaire en Haïti	The education system in Haiti is currently undergoing major reforms. The new policies favor the implementation of the Competency Based Approach, encouraging school leaders and teachers to use more proactive teaching methods. Efforts are already being made by some schools, private ones for the most part. However, those methods still remain fairly or poorly known by the teaching staff. This study aims to assess the implementation of Montessori pedagogy currently used by teachers at the primary level. Through the literature we were able to identify five principles that are freedom, respect for rhythm, intrinsic motivation, manipulation and cooperative learning and teaching practices. We developed two questionnaires for semi-structured interviews and observation grids that allowed us to assess the understanding of the principles and their implementation. The results suggested that most of the teachers' practices are in compliance with the principle of Montessori approaches. Adjustments were made to consider the teacher's understanding of the principle, the school schedule and environmental context.

24	Prévoir la différenciation pédagogique : l’exemple de la résolution de situations-problèmes mathématiques au deuxième cycle du primaire au Québec	In this qualitative study in a descriptive/interpretative model, we look for how teachers, supposedly experts in second grade in primary school in Québec predict differenciated instruction in solving problems. To understand the constraints and conditions around this prediction, we used Verschaffel, Greer and De Corté’s model (2000) wich is a didactic model to understand the different steps of the student to solve a problem. To complete this model, we used the differenciated devices of Tomlinson (2000) : differenciated process, differenciated productions, differenciated structures and differenciated contents. In the five phases of the process and in each device evocated by the teachers, we explained adaptation in general and adaptation for one or several students. It shows that predicting how to differenciate in solving problems is a challenge. Indeed, even if the teachers say they predict to use a certain amount of adaptations to take in consideration the needs of all the students, they seem to wanting to keep hold on most of the explanation before letting the student to start to try and solve the problem on their own. We explain this by the constraints to deal with and their perception of the scaffolding to be put in place during the search of solving. As consequence, it does not expose enough the at risk students to the work with their peers – altough they get great advantage of the immediate retroactions of the teacher- and has the tendency to left on side the needs of the advanced students.	differenciated instruction , solving word problems , mathematics , solving problems , practice gestures , inclusive practice , primary school , teaching practice	en	26226.0
25	Lung cancer risk associated with occupational exposures to cleaning agents and biocides : analysis of two case-control studies in Montreal, Canada	Background: Cleaning agents are materials that aid water in the cleaning process. Biocides include materials used to disinfect, deodorize, sterilize, and sanitize. The use of cleaning agents, biocides, and other cleaning-related agents is ubiquitous. Some studies suggest that occupational exposure to cleaning-related substances may be associated with lung cancer. Objective: To examine the association between lung cancer risk and occupational exposure to cleaning-related agents. Methods: This study uses data from two population-based case-control studies on lung cancer (Study 1: 1979-1986; Study 2: 1996-2001) carried out in Montreal. In both studies, cases included men diagnosed with incident histologically confirmed lung cancer identified across 18 Montreal metropolitan hospitals. In both studies, a set of population-based controls randomly selected from the Quebec electoral list was established (Study 2: 762 cases and 899 controls); while in Study 1, an additional cancer control group was selected from a pool of other patients diagnosed with incident cancer (857 cases, 533 population controls, 1349 cancer controls). In both studies, detailed lifetime job histories were collected during interviews; a team of chemists and industrial hygienists then evaluated occupational exposure to many occupational substances including cleaning agents, biocides, aliphatic alcohols, ammonia, caustic soda, and waxes and polishes. Unconditional multivariate logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for lung cancer risk associated with various metrics of occupational exposure to these six agents, while adjusting for established risk factors. Interactions by smoking intensity and asthma status were explored with the inclusion of cross-product terms. Results: Overall, there was no consistent association supporting a role of occupational exposure to cleaning agents, biocides, and other cleaning-related agents in lung cancer etiology. Though there was some evidence that smoking intensity may modify the association between caustic soda and lung cancer risk in Study 1, where, among never-low intensity smokers, a threefold increase in risk was observed in comparison to a null association observed among medium-heavy intensity smokers (pInteraction=0.03). While, in Study 2, those occupationally exposed to aliphatic alcohols and who have ever had asthma experienced a four-fold increase in lung cancer risk in comparison to a null association observed among those who have never had asthma (pInteraction = 0.04). Conclusion: Taken together, the results of this study do not support the role of occupational exposure to cleaning agents, biocides, and other cleaning-related agents in lung cancer etiology.

26	The role of the insula in heart rate variability	Cumulative evidence supports the role of the insula in cardiac autonomic regulation whose dysfunction may be involved in the pathophysiology of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Heart rate variability (HRV) is a simple and reliable tool to assess autonomic function; it is even considered a potential predictor of ventricular tachycardia and sudden death in patients after myocardial infarction. Over the last two decades, heart rate variability (HRV) has also received much interest in epilepsy research. Several studies have tried to assess HRV changes in different epilepsy types but the results have been heterogeneous and sometimes contradictory; its role as a marker of SUDEP remains uncertain. Of note, most studies involved TLE patients and TLE surgeries; none have looked at HRV changes in insulo-opercular epilepsy (IOE) and how insular resection can affect autonomic function. In this study, we aimed to investigate changes in interictal HRV in IOE. We further evaluated the effect of insulo-opercular surgery on these HRV changes. Fourteen IOE patients who had a good outcome (Engel I-II) after an insulo-opercular surgery were enrolled in this study. Fourteen age- and sex-matched patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) who were seizure-free after temporal lobectomy and 28 age- and sex-matched healthy individuals were also included. HRV measurements including time domain root mean square of successive RR interval differences (RMSSD) and percentage of successive RR intervals that differ by more than 50ms (pNN50) and frequency domain low-frequency (LF) and high-frequency (HF) parameters were carried out in pre- and post-operative periods (6-204 months). Presurgical HRV values for epileptic patients were calculated using EKG obtained simultaneously with video-EEG recordings during the presurgical evaluation. HRV of healthy individuals and post-surgical HRV from all operated epileptic patients were calculated from a 1-hour resting electrocardiogram at the laboratory. We also collected the patients’ presurgical data to calculate the SUDEP-7 risk inventory score.  Findings showed no statistically significant differences in all HRV measurements between groups of IOE patients, TLE patients before the surgery, and healthy controls. In IOE patients, the SUDEP-7 score ranged from 1 to 6 (mean 2,9; SD: 1,6) and was positively correlated with pNN50 (r=0,671; p<0,009) and LnRMSSD (r=0,591; p<0,026). Postoperatively, HRV measurements were not statistically different from either preoperative values or those of controls. We conducted exploratory analyses where we stratified IOE patients into those whose preoperative LnRMSSD values were below (Group 1a) versus above (Group 1b) a cut-off threshold of 3,52 (mean value of our healthy sample). Preoperatively, in Group 1a, all time and frequency domain values (LnRMSSD, pNN50, LnLF, and LnHF) were significantly lower than those of controls (p<0,01) while in Group 1b, only time-domain values (LnRMSSD and pNN50) were significantly higher than those of control subjects (p<0,01). In both groups, HRV values tended to normalize postoperatively. In contrast, anterior temporal lobectomy for TLE patients did not alter HRV values.  Our preliminary results suggest that in refractory IOE, HRV may be either decreased globally in sympathetic and parasympathetic tones or increased in parasympathetic tone. The increase in parasympathetic tone observed preoperatively may be of clinical concern as it was positively correlated with the SUDEP-7 score. The insulo-opercular resection did not affect the HRV; successful surgery might even have a good impact on HRV changes. Confirmation with a larger sample size is necessary.

27	Conception des jeux sérieux éducatifs : comment concevoir une expérience optimale d’apprentissage?	Serious games are part of a movement that seeks to explore digital games in contexts where the primary purpose is other than pure entertainment. In education, this use is justified by the ability of these games to impact cognitive, emotional, and social learning. Empirical studies conducted to verify the presumed benefits of these games tend to confirm their relevance and instructional effectiveness. Nevertheless, they suggest that these benefits depend on the quality of their design and implementation.  However, the existing approaches and theories related to serious games design are at an early stage of construction and are far from consensual. More specifically, these approaches have limitations in terms of theoretical foundations, a lack of detailed design methodologies, and a difficulty of integrating, in a balanced way, the elements that promote motivation and those that promote instruction. In this context, this thesis aims to remedy these limitations by proposing a serious game design model that supports the design and development of serious games for an educational purpose. To this end, we have implemented a methodology based on the Design-based research approach to answer the following research question: how to design serious games that are pedagogically effective and intrinsically motivating? Therefore, our methodology consisted, following Reeves’ model (2006), of four phases: analysis of a practical problem, development of a solution informed by existing design principles and technological innovations, iterative cycles of testing and refinement of the solution, and reflection to produce new design principles generalizable to other contexts. Our goal was to develop a comprehensive, coherent, and integrated approach to serious game design. As a result, our research proposes a theoretical model describing an optimal learning experience through serious games, a set of five design principles that should guide the design process, and tools to support instructional designers during the design process. The implications of the proposed approach are multiple. It helps to fill knowledge gaps concerning the design of serious games. More specifically, it describes the expected learning experience through these games and determines the characteristics and conditions of emergence of this experience. It reduces the complexity inherent to the design process by proposing design principles, detailed methodology, and practical tools. It structures the design process based on principles from the instructional design and game design fields. Finally, the approach links theory to practice by providing a descriptive theoretical framework of the design process and clear practical implementation guidelines. Likewise, the accompanying tools can serve as educational support to initiate instructional designers into the design process and as a communication tool to support the relationship between different stakeholders during a participatory user-centred design process.

28	Are older people living alone socially isolated? : a qualitative study of their experiences	This article discusses the experiences of social isolation among older people living alone. The current state of knowledge suggests that they are at a higher risk of social isolation which, in turn, can compromise their health and well-being to varying degrees. Yet, few qualitative studies have tried to understand the subjective experience of living alone and the ways it can impact older people’s relationships. The data presented here are based on 43 individual interviews with men and women aged 65 to 93 living alone in the Montreal area (Canada), and group discussions with 120 actors involved in intervention. The results showed that the majority of the participating older people did not see living alone as a problem. Their stories revealed the extent of their resilience and their ability to maintain satisfactory social relations with family and peers. However, for a minority, mostly men over 80 years old, solo living translated into being alone and could become problematic. The article presents reflections for social work intervention, inviting practitioners to consider different vulnerabilities affecting the capacity of older people living alone to maintain their social networks and highlighting the importance of fostering reciprocity in their relationships.

29	Fréquence et prédicteurs de cancer occulte en accident vasculaire cérébral ischémique	Introduction: Cancer promotes thromboembolism through inflammation and hypercoagulability, and an ischemic stroke may be the first sign of an undiagnosed (occult) malignancy. The frequency and predictors of occult cancer in people with acute ischemic stroke, however, remains unclear. We first sought to summarize the existing published data regarding the frequency and predictors of cancer after an ischemic stroke in a systematic review. We also conducted a retrospective matched cohort study to compare the incidence of cancer in people who experienced an ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) to that of people without stroke, using data from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging. Methods: For our systematic review, we searched seven databases from January 1980 to September 2019 for articles reporting malignant tumors and myeloproliferative neoplasms diagnosed after an ischemic stroke (PROSPERO protocol: CRD42019132455). For our matched cohort study, we used data from the comprehensive sub-group (n=30,097) of the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging, a large population-based cohort of individuals aged 45-85 years when recruited (2011-2015). We built a retrospective cohort with individual exact matching for age (1:4 ratio). We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate hazard ratios of new cancer diagnosis with and without a prior stroke/TIA. Results: For our systematic review, we screened 15,400 records and included 51 articles. The pooled cumulative incidence of cancer within one year after an ischemic stroke was 13.6 per thousand (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.6 to 24.8), higher in studies focusing on cryptogenic stroke (62.0 per thousand; 95% CI, 13.6 to 139.3 vs 9.6 per thousand; 95% CI, 4.0 to 17.3; p- value=0.02) and those reporting cancer screening (39.2 per thousand; 95% CI, 16.4 to 70.6 vs 7.2 per thousand; 95% CI, 2.5 to 14.1; p-value=0.003). The incidence of cancer after stroke was higher overall compared to people without stroke. Most cases were diagnosed within the first few months after stroke. Several predictors of cancer were identified, namely older age, smoking, involvement of multiple vascular territories, as well as elevated C-reactive protein and d-dimers. For our cohort study, we respectively included 920 and 3,680 individuals in the stroke and non- stroke groups. We observed a higher incidence of cancer in the first year after stroke/TIA that declined afterwards. The hazard of new cancer diagnosis in the first year after stroke/TIA was significantly increased (hazard ratio=2.36; 95% CI, 1.21 to 4.61; p-value=0.012) as compared to age-matched non-stroke participants after adjustments. The most frequent primary cancers in the first year after stroke/TIA were prostate (n=8, 57.1%) and melanoma (n=2, 14.3%). Conclusion: We observed in both studies of our research project that the frequency of incident cancer after an ischemic stroke is low overall, but higher as compared to people without stroke. The frequency of new cancer diagnosis after stroke is also higher in cryptogenic stroke and after cancer screening. Several predictors may increase the yield of cancer screening after an ischemic stroke. The pooled incidence of post-stroke cancer is likely underestimated due to methodological issues in most studies of our review. Larger prospective studies with systematic ascertainment of cancer after stroke are needed to produce more valid and precise estimates of post-stroke cancer risk and guide randomized controlled studies of cancer screening in people with acute ischemic stroke.

30	Étude de la polycystine-1 délété de son motif coiled-coil sur les mécanismes intracellulaires in vivo	Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most prevalent genetic disorder that is characterize by the formation of bilateral renal cysts and leads to kidney failure. It results from mutations in the PKD1/polycystin-1(PC-1) gene, containing a coiled-coil motif, and in the PKD2/PC-2 gene, the functions of which remain to be elucidated. From a bacterial artificial chromosome, the murine Pkd1 gene (Pkd1-BAC) was modified in order to obtain 4 transgenic mouse lines deleted from it coiled-coil motif (Pkd1Δcoiled-coil) and 3 Pkd1TAG control lines possessing 1-35 copies of the transgene. These two transgenes have an expression profile identical to the endogenous gene and their expression depends on the number of copies. While Pkd1TAG mice develop ADPKD with a severity proportional to the level of expression, the Pkd1Δcoiled-coil lines are spared. These results demonstrate the importance of the coiled-coil motif in the disease. Pkd1Δcoiled-coil mice crossed by Pkd1-/- (lethal by birth), Pkd1-/-; Pkd1Δcoiled-coil survive after birth and allow the interactions, signaling and physiological role of the coiled-coil motif to be analyzed in vivo. These Pkd1-/-; Pkd1Δcoiled-coil mice with one copy of the transgene show kidney cysts and die ~ 2-weeks while high-copy ones have no phenotype as opposed to Pkd1-/-; Pkd1TAG who eventually develop cyst after 1 year. The genetic and biochemical results demonstrate that Pc-1Δcoiled-coil is hypomorphic. Although Pc-1Δcoiled-coil undergoes its autoproteolytic cleavage, analysis of the intracellular transport of Pc-1Δcoiled-coil shows a delay in maturation. While Pc-1 and Pc-2 appear to interact in vitro through their coiled-coil motif and co-transport, a Pc-1Δcoiled-coil -Pc-2 interaction is conserved in the kidney, suggesting a distinct mechanism of interactions in vivo. Thus, our results show that the coiled-coil motif of Pc-1 in vivo is involved in the maturation independently of Pc-2, highlighting the existence of a critical partner in intracellular transport.	polycystine-2 , coiled-coil , maturation , interaction , ADPKD , polycystin-1 , polycystin-2 , transgenic mice , trafficking	en	26148.0
31	Le jeune entrepreneur face au cadre juridique des affaires en Haïti : état des lieux	The legal framework for business in Haiti and, in particular, the 2002 Investment Code are neither able to attract foreign direct investment nor facilitate entrepreneurial activities. This legal framework is not adapted to the particular situation of young entrepreneurs in Haiti or to that of entrepreneurs from the diaspora interested in doing business in their home country. Some Haitian government initiatives to promote entrepreneurial activities in the country, encourage young people to start a business or convince the diaspora and foreigners to invest in the country are not producing satisfactory results. There is a need to question the obstacles that prevent the Haitian business climate from being attractive and competitive. Such obstacles are political, financial, administrative, structural and legal. Those related to the legal framework in force and the administrative procedures for carrying out entrepreneurial activities have been the subject of a particular analysis in the context of this brief. This analysis has made it possible to highlight the administrative burden, the difficulty in finding financing and the lack of definition of the status of “entrepreneur”  and the lack of a framework for entrepreneurial activities as such. The current legal framework for business, limited to traditional commercial law, needs to be updated in order to be adapted to the particularities of young entrepreneurs. Hence the formulation, in this brief, of a set of proposals that take into account, on the one hand, the various obstacles that complicate the realization of entrepreneurial activities in Haiti and, on the other hand, the particularities of young entrepreneurs or youth entrepreneurship.

32	Étude des transitions de carrière causées par des blessures et des maladies professionnelles chez les artistes de la danse à Montréal	Artistic careers have been under-studied in the field of industrial relations. This is the case despite several researchers having recently suggested that an increasing number of professions, including academic and creative ones, are likely to evolve and present similar organizational conditions and employment forms to the ones we observe in artistic labour markets. This research addresses the factors influencing professional dance artists to undertake a career transition. More precisely, we study how career transitions induced by occupational injuries and diseases operate, and how they are experienced by professional dance artists in Montreal. We take into consideration different manifestations of occupational injuries and diseases such as wear, decreasing physical abilities and disability.   From a methodological standpoint, this research is supported by a transversal analysis of both quantitative and qualitative data. The double comparison of convergent and divergent data relating to the experience of career transitioning, including the participants’ opinions, perceptions, feelings and attitudes, allows us to draw larger conclusions. This study highlights that (1) career transitions induced by physical factors are challenging because of their unexpected nature. We consider these transitions to be constrained ones, because they are forced upon professional dance artists instead of being the result of a voluntary and planned process. This study also shows that (2) career transitions induced by physical factors represent a challenging experience for professional dance artists because of their association with major psychological and identity difficulties.   This research shows the existence of two different degrees of career transitions induced by physical factors in the professional dance sector in Montreal. The first relates to transitions induced by occupational injuries or diseases. The second relates to transitions induced by a gradual settling of pain due to a microinjury, wear or decreasing physical abilities. By studying the events leading to these two degrees of transitions, we define our concept of constrained transition and detail the characteristics of the different types of transitions the formers can lead to. We conclude that the two types of transitions correspond to constrained transitions, which makes them challenging experiences because of their unexpected nature. Beyond concluding that constrained transitions are associated with different major psychological and identity difficulties, we also identify the reasons explaining the emergence of those difficulties.  This study allows for a better understanding of the factors leading to constrained career transitions in the professional dance sector in Montreal. This opens up new perspectives to reflect on the services offered by the Commission des normes, de l’équité, de la santé et de la sécurité du travail (CNESST). General reflections and contributions applying to other precarious professions are also discussed.

33	Personalized question-based cybersecurity recommendation systems	With the proliferation of the virtual universe and the multitude of services provided by the World Wide Web, a major concern arises: Security and privacy have never been more in jeopardy. Nowadays, with the Covid 19 pandemic, the world faces a new reality that pushed the majority of the workforce to telecommute. This thereby creates new vulnerabilities for cyber attackers to exploit. It’s important now more than ever, to educate and offer guidance towards good cybersecurity hygiene. In this context, a major effort has been dedicated by researchers, governments, and businesses alike to protect people online against hackers and cybercriminals. With a focus on strengthening the weakest link in the cybersecurity chain which is the human being, educational and awareness-raising tools have been put to use. However, most researchers focus on the “one size fits all” solutions which do not focus on the intricacies of individuals. This work aims to overcome that by contributing a personalized question-based recommender system. Named “Cyberhelper”, this work benefits from an existing mature body of research on recommender system algorithms along with recent research on non-user-specific question-based recommenders. The reported proof of concept holds potential for future work in adapting Cyberhelper as an everyday assistant for different types of users and different contexts.

34	La représentation des interfaces utilisateur au cinéma : d'une image informatique à une image cinématographique	The blue bubble of a text message, the window of a web browser, the programming lines in a computer terminal, the diagrams displayed on the control screens of a spaceship: from 2001 to 2020, these images of interfaces are everywhere in the movies. In computer science, the user interface is the virtual environment useful to the user to interact with the machine. In cinema, the representation of the interface is the way to represent this interaction while immediately borrowing from the machine's images. If the interfaces are more and more frequent in the cinema, their representation is nevertheless very standardized, obeying most often very faithfully the conventions of the cinematographic genres that have shaped it. However, by drawing up an inventory of four main types and observing a few exceptions, their representation reveals a cinematographic grammar endowed with new narrative means, filmic tricks and editing effects that remain to be defined and whose added value will be measured.	interface , interaction , compositing , Graphic , User , Computing , Tricking , Computer , Pictogram , Software	en	26060.0
35	Périurbanisation à Yangon, Myanmar : une géographie politique des dynamiques foncières marchandes locales	This master’s research focuses on the process of peri-urbanization in Yangon, Myanmar’s metropolis, in a context of metropolization and liberalization of land resource management. In this thesis, I defend the idea that peri-urbanization must be considered as a process of reconfiguring political spaces and land commodification dynamics fueled by the actors of the peripheral areas of Yangon. An approach to peri-urbanization through political geography and a relational perspective of the concept of commodification allows us to understand the complexity of power relations and market land dynamics that help shape the peri-urban spaces of Yangon.  This research is based on a study of land practices and strategies of local actors in Thanlyin, a peri-urban township of Yangon, in a context of accelerated development of its territory. The analysis produced in this research demonstrates that peri-urbanization is a complex process of territorialization of the tension between land formality and informality, of formation of land assemblage favoring land commodification and of new multi-scale political space production.

36	Le stress minoritaire, la violence conjugale et la santé mentale des femmes de la diversité sexuelle : une étude pancanadienne	Canadian and American population surveys show that people from the sexual diversity and gender-diverse people are more at risk of mental health problems (psychological distress, depression, anxiety disorders, substance use problems) and of being victims of intimate partner violence (IPV) in their lifetime. But the LGBTQ+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and other) community is not homogeneous: between the different subgroups of this population, sexual minority women (SMW) are at particularly high risk of experiencing stigma, mental health problems and being victims of IPV. This vulnerability can be explained by the sexual and gender minority stress model, stating that sexual and gender minority people suffer from specific stress factors added to general stressors, leading to more mental health and relationship problems. Those stress factors can be distal, such as prejudice events one suffers from based on their sexual or gender identity (harassment, discrimination, physical violence, etc.). But they can also be proximal, and therefore more subjective, such as expecting to be rejected or discriminated (also called stigma consciousness), concealing one’s sexual or gender identity, or suffering from internalized homophobia or transphobia.  The main goal of this Master’s thesis was to assess the impact of minority stress factors and of different forms of past IPV victimization on the current mental health of Canadian SMW, as a function of their sexual and gender identity.  In total, 209 individuals identifying as women (M age = 33,9), living in Canada and who lived in a violent intimate relationship with a woman in the past answered our online survey. Questionnaire assessed sexual orientation and gender identity, IPV behaviors, minority stress factors, and symptoms of depression and anxiety.  Hierarchical regressions showed that psychological aggression was positively associated with anxiety symptoms and sexual coercion with depressive symptoms. Not being strictly attracted to women (i.e. identifying as bisexual, pansexual, queer or something else) was also associated to high symptoms of depression and age was negatively associated to anxiety symptoms. After controlling for age, race/ethnicity, sexual and gender identity and IPV victimization, having negative feelings about being a SMW was strongly associated with both depression and anxiety symptoms.  This Master’s thesis provides new information on the interconnected associations among IPV, minority stress and SMW’s mental health. It shows the importance of LGBTQ+ specific stress factors, particularly of negative feelings about being a SMW, on the mental health of SMW IPV survivors. It highlights the necessity to evaluate the needs of SMW IPV survivors and, more broadly, of all sexual and gender minorities. This could allow clinical intervention to be more adapted to the needs of LGBTQ+ IPV victims and therefore help buffer against victimization they are faced by.

37	Entre locals et incomers : « Where is the community? » : appropriation collective d’une île écossaise et conflit social	The Scottish land tenure system is one of the most unequal in Europe. Most of the territory is owned by a minority of landowners. In the early 1990s, some rural communities in the Highlands and Islands created the first Community Land Trusts (CLT) and thus developed new forms of local governance based on direct democracy. These small local revolutions culminated in the consolidation of a national land reform in the early 2000s. At first glance, this contemporary legal upheaval fosters competition between two interest groups : landowners and crofters (Scottish peasants). The objective of this dissertation is to put this binary vision of social conflict into perspective. My ethnographic research carried out on the island of Great Bernera in the Outer Hebrides was focused on intra-community conflict in this new political and legal context. My analysis concentrate on the contradictions of a model of democratic governance based on the principle of the Rule of Law with the constraints of the old local normative system characterized by relational, identity and cultural logics. I present the testimonies of a group of residents who consider themselves “locals” and who value cultural and genealogical criteria as founding principles of a community. This vision contradicts the point of view of foreigners (“incomers”) who, by the culmination of the project of collective appropriation of the island, hope for the realization of a political social community.

38	L'accès du public aux terrains privés pour la randonnée pédestre au Québec : quelle compatibilité avec l'exercice des droits de propriété?	This paper focuses on the collaboration between two groups of actors who make nature trails accessible to the public on private land: landowners and hiking trails managers. Often based on right of way agreements, their partnership meets a growing social demand for outdoor recreation, which is even stronger near urban areas. However, it is based on a precarious foundation. Given the limited knowledge we have on these issues in Quebec, this exploratory research aims to understand the extent to which public access to formal hiking trails located on private land can be compatible with the exercise of private property rights. We identify both the factors influencing this compatibility and the strategies mobilized by managers and owners to use these factors as levers or, on the contrary, to reduce their scope. A qualitative field survey was conducted in two phases: first with hiking trail managers located in several regions of Quebec (first phase), and then with managers and private landowners in Sainte-Brigitte-de-Laval (case selected for the second phase). The research results show that public access can be compatible with the exercise of private property rights when associated with two major factors: the actors’ ability (1) to accomplish their own uses and representations of the land and (2) to trust each other. The manifestations of these factors and the strategies employed by the two groups of actors are outlined. Then, we identify the main issue for each of them. The private landowners want to keep on benefitting from the property despite and beyond the presence of the trail. The managers – aware of the asymmetrical nature of the relationship between them and the owners – try to build trust with the latter while dealing with limited resources. Finally, a reflection on possible avenues of intervention is initiated based on the solutions mentioned by the participants and an examination of various urban planning tools. The research presents its contribution on the theoretical, methodological, and practical levels. It was an opportunity to revisit the scope and limits of the exercise of property rights in Quebec and to demonstrate the heuristic value of access theory. Its exploratory, iterative approach, and the methods used have generated new empirical knowledge for Quebec. The reflection on possible avenues of intervention could enlighten land use planning professionals.	outdoor recreation , private property , public access , natural resources management , multifunctionality , right of way	en	26009.0
39	The perceptual qualities of concrete : a change in paradigm	The research investigates the quality perceptions of concrete artifacts from an industrial design standpoint. In order to document and examine how the material is being used and perceived nowadays, the study looks into the evolution of concrete technologies including its recipes, manufacturing techniques, and uses, as well as its appraisals. A literature review helped us understand the problem field and organize the data amassed in order to find answers to our research questions. We were thus able to identify the critical milestones that triggered change throughout concrete’s historical evolution, as well as gather different testimonies of its perceptions within various contexts. Qualitative research methods were used to interpret our findings. We validated the data based on selected cases as well as non-participatory empirical observations of urban concrete artifacts from a first-person view. This method is influenced by the author’s lived experiences, cultural background, and disciplinary gaze. Therefore, it was necessary to complement the author’s interpretation by triangulating the data retrieved with information gathered from historical, scientific, technical, and mediatic literature. The results were organized and analyzed using various analytical tools and methods. Timeline mappings were used to isolate and illustrate critical milestones triggering change and important developments (e.g. the discovery of Portland Cement, etc.). Categorizations helped us clarify and compare the data gathered to provide a more specific overview of concrete recipes and uses (e.g. primitive – modern concretes, structural – non-structural recipes, etc.). Semantic mappings allowed us to interpret the complied testimonies on how concrete artifacts are perceived in addition to helping us isolate semantic qualities within a bipolar semantic space (e.g. concrete is ugly – beautiful, concrete is cold – warm, etc.). Lastly, a product and material experiences framework (Desmet & Hekkert, 2007) was used to interpret concrete artifacts’ appraisals as found within the testimonies retrieved, in addition to the first-person empirical observations. The research revealed that concrete’s quality perception is facing a dualism which draws attention to its ecological footprint as well as its surface’s premature deterioration with time. Although many seem to appreciate the material’s versatility, accessibility, and structural performance, the dualism can be partially attributed to the evolving collective consciousness which makes actors more aware of concrete’s environmental impacts across its lifecycle. The study thus showed that, despite modern society’s production and consumption habits which focus on the superficial perfection of the material world, ideologies are seen to be evolving and are increasingly interested in more sustainable practices and lifestyles. This can help motivate designers to seek inspiration from emotionally-durable and resilient principles, thus allowing them to better address urban challenges. The latest trends revealed new concrete mixes (e.g. substitution of Portland Cement with by-products of other industries, etc.) and manufacturing techniques (e.g. 3D-printing, etc.) which can offer eco-friendly and innovative alternatives to traditional concrete productions. These emerging solutions are seen to pave the way for unexpected applications in various fields (e.g., product design, art, cinematography, etc.), thus attracting other disciplines beyond engineering and architecture. The changing paradigm in the perception of concrete artifacts shows that value and beauty are not always associated with superficial perfection. In fact, more and more actors are found to reject premature obsolescence by embracing materials’ natural and imperfect behavior as they age with time.

40	Design, morale et justification : le design pour la santé sexuelle	Industrial designers work in a multitude of sectors wherein understanding consumer and their choices is fundamental. This means that understanding why industrial designers’ choices as professionals allows them to be on the lookout for personal biases that can influence the value of the project. Professional ethics may involve moral components that affect the designer as much as their product and that are no longer linked to the aesthetics of the object alone. There are values attached to that object. In this study our interest is to understand the industrial designer’s way of practicing in these diverse sectors, especially when the sector is that of sexuality and sexual health. While in constant search of innovation, the field of sexual health involves issues that arise in terms of taboos, cultural diversity, beliefs and personal backgrounds. Being human, the designer is confronted with states of moral conscience in this field. This study questions the moral commitment of a design professional grappling with issues that present strong moral implications. We explore the industrial designers’ intentions and justifications and their personal implication vis-à-vis such subjects. This study proceeds as an exploratory study, with data collection that included 4 narratives extrapolated from a design charrette with four teams, and a total of eleven participants. Exploratory analysis of the justifying discourse of designers is supported by The Six cities2 model proposed by Boltanski and Thévenot (1991) in the book “De la justification” and focuses on social competences in terms of justification of decision-making. The overarching hypothesis is that the work of the designer will be justified mainly by an “industrial city” perspective, supported by the principle of efficiency, a quality specific to industrial design product development. The analysis revealed emergent themes and issues of relevance to this model and the principles explored. This study proposes that the designer has a role to play in the consideration of topics with a strong moral implication. The designers’ discourse develops according to the constraints encountered and the type of project being developed. In addition, the design project can be impacted by professional’s comfort with such a difficult topic or even their personal preferences, and. ultimately understanding the motivating aspects of their choices during the project is of value in future products and the training received by designers.	contrainte morale , justification , Design , Sexual health , Moral constraints , innovation , social abilities , industrial design , contraintes morales	en	26007.0
41	La construction discursive de la justice et des injustices spatiolinguistique.s dans le capitalisme contemporain : l’exemple de l’action et de l’organisation communautaires à Verdun – Montréal	This research problematizes and questions empirically the theoretical concept of spatiolinguistic justice, developed in French urban sociolinguistics. This term spatiolinguistic justice, inspired from spatial justice as used in critical geography and urban studies, requires that the researcher inquires his own political theorization behind his use of terms such as “inequality” “discrimination” “exploitation” and “segregation”, terms that are often considered as observed “realities” rather than as discursively constructed. Spatiolinguistic justice also allows the researcher to examine the diversity of approaches to justice as expressed by participants in ethnographic research, and the way justice and injustice are discursively institutionalized through language practices. In this thesis, spatiolinguistic justice is investigated through community action and organization in Verdun (a borough of Montreal) in Quebec. Adopting a (mainly) Marxian perspective to problematize institutions, ideology/ideologies and subjects, the purpose of this study is to examine the way capitalist urban space and neoliberal governmentality affect community organizing actors and their discourse. Weaving together theorization in urban sociolinguistics, social linguistics, critical sociolinguistics and political sociolinguistics, this study approaches spatiolinguistic justice and injustice through the analysis of discourse on spatial transformation and through social and sociolinguistics territorialization. This is done through a lexical entry method to discourse analysis but also through the study of the participants’ counter-interpelling “discourse acts”, “discursive scenography”, “reported speech” and other approaches to critical analysis of language practices.	institutions , urban sociolinguistics , discourse analysis , spatiolinguistic justice , spatial justice , community organizing , ideology/ideologies , hegemony , subjects , sociolinguistic territorialisation	en	25998.0
42	Predicting scleral lens rotation based on corneoscleral toricity	Scleral lens orientation becomes extremely important to maximize vision and lens stability in patients who are fitted in front-toric lenses. Current clinical techniques to determine the rotation of a scleral lens involve the use of diagnostic lenses; however, these methods require a substantial amount of chair time to achieve an optimal fit. Contemporary equipment exists to evaluate ocular surface shape, which could be useful in predicting scleral lens rotation and increasing the overall efficiency of scleral lens adjustments. The goal of this comparative and randomized study was to evaluate scleral lens rotation based on the values provided by two scleral topographers. Fifteen participants were recruited and both eyes were imaged using two scleral topographers: the Eye Surface Profiler (ESP) and the Cornea Sclera Profile (CSP). Participants were fitted with the OneFit MED on one eye and the Zenlens on the other. Each lens’s rotation was evaluated at the slit lamp and compared to the steep axis of conjunctival astigmatism identified by each topographer. While the rotations from both instruments are not comparable, the ESP predicted rotation within 15˚ from slit lamp observation, which makes it clinically acceptable for lenses with low values of cylindrical power. The visual acuity of patients wearing lenses with a high amount of toricity may be affected by the amount of rotation and are not suitable for empirical fittings at this point in time.

43	Use of a novel peripheral nerve conduit to support sciatic nerve regeneration in an animal model	Background: Synthetic nerve conduits constitute alternative surgical options to autografts in the repair of peripheral nerve injuries. Silk polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) as a biomaterial and novel conduit designs have been proposed to improve peripheral nerve regeneration. In my master’s project, my objective is to assess whether silk PEM can improve peripheral nerve regeneration in vivo and to assess whether our novel conduit design (“jelly roll”) can better support rat sciatic nerve regeneration than a hollow conduit design. Methods: In this study, an in vivo rat model of sciatic nerve laceration and repair was used. Five experimental conduit conditions (autograft, hollow conduit with and without silk PEM, and jelly roll with and without silk PEM) were implanted (n=2 rats per condition). After 4 weeks, the conduits were harvested and immuno-stained for neurofilament and myelin basic protein (MBP). Conduit performance was assessed by its ability to support axonal outgrowth throughout the conduit’s length and at various locations along its width. Results: Each condition supported axonal regeneration at varying levels of success. Overall, the autograft group outperformed all other groups by supporting the longest and widest occupying regenerating fibers. Conduits with silk PEM performed similarly to conduits without silk PEM. In addition, the hollow conduit design demonstrated better regenerative outcomes than the jelly roll design. Conclusion: The autograft remains the superior conduit to support peripheral nerve regeneration. Conduits with silk PEM support nerve regeneration in the same capacity as non silk-coated conduits while the jelly roll design underperformed in comparison to the hollow conduit design.	peripheral nerve regeneration , nerve autograft , silk polyelectrolyte multilayer , jelly roll , peripheral nerve surgery , peripheral nerve injuries , axonal outgrowth	en	25984.0
44	Experiences of accessing mental health services among homeless youth : differences between linguistic majority and linguistic minority youth	Background: Most mental illnesses begin in youth. The homeless youth population reports a high level of unmet mental health needs; a situation which is possibly worse for linguistic minority homeless youths.  Objectives: To describe the factors associated with homeless youths’ experiences of accessing mental health services and to highlight differences in such experiences between linguistic majority (Francophones) and linguistic minority (Anglophones and Allophones) groups.  Methods: 22 youths between 18 to 25 years old participated in community mapping, an arts-based qualitative research method in which participants draw maps of resources they use to receive help with their mental health. Discussion groups enabled youths to express their emotions and perceptions towards access and services. Thematic analysis was user on verbal and visual data.  Results: Factors associated with of access to mental health services were grouped into two categories: (1) care adapted at the individual level, and (2) availability and structure of services. Homeless youths need services that are adapted to the specific needs of homeless youths and minorities (including linguistic minorities), with an approach to care centered on an individual’s needs. Linguistic minority homeless youths identify less diversity in services and often turn to informal mental health strategies or to adult-oriented homeless services.  Conclusion: Services that are co-located and integrated with mental health and basic needs services help bypass a lot of identified barriers to care for homeless youths. Particular attention needs to be paid to linguistic minority homeless youths as they experience more barriers than their counterparts.	homeless youth , access to mental health services , qualitative research , community mapping	en	25982.0
45	Variations diurnes dans l’abondance et la vitesse de synthèse de protéines chez le dinoflagellé Lingulodinium	Industrialization and globalization has led to industrial eutrophication in many regions of the oceans resulting in different types of ecological emergencies. One of these is the uncontrolled proliferation of dinoflagellates which are responsible for the harmful algal blooms called “red tides”. Certain species release toxins which can harm aquatic flora and fauna and, through consumption of contaminated fish or seafood, can affect public health. Dinoflagellates are also at the base of the food chain in the marine environment, and certain species form symbioses with anthozoans thus allowing growth of coral reefs. There is thus a strong need for fundamental research on dinoflagellate biology. Using the dinoflagellate Lingulodinium polyedra as a model, we have examined how cells adapt to the daily changes in light and dark. In particular we have examined changes in protein amounts as well as changes in protein synthesis rates to gain insight into how cells differ during the day and night. In a first project, the daily proteome was examined by mass spectrometry using algae extracts harvested over a 24 hour cycle in conditions of 12 hours of day followed by 12 hours of night. Key proteins involved in biological rhythms have shown quantitative variations synchronized with the times of the biological rhythms involving them, ie a quantitative increase in key proteins is necessary for the accomplishment of the various cellular processes. Thirteen proteins were identified, of which two were previously documented to change in amount over the daily cycle. In a second project we addressed the origin of these quantitative protein variations. By applying the technique of ribosome profiling on algal samples, first collected in triplicate at three times and then at two hour intervals throughout the 24 h cycle, we have identified iv variations in the synthesis rate of thousands of proteins. These include the proteins found in the proteomic analysis as well as four proteins whose synthesis rate variations had already been observed using in vivo metabolic labeling. Interestingly, classification of the regulated proteins into GO categories also revealed a late night increase in the synthesis of many amino acid biosynthetic enzymes, potentially linking amino acid synthesis associated with the daily metabolism of nitrate. These advances in our understanding of the regulation of the daily rhythms of the dinoflagellate Lingulodinium will provide new tools in the ecological fight against red tides. They may also open new perspectives in understanding the daily rhythms of other organisms.

46	La transition de carrière chez les artistes du cirque : une étude de cas du Cirque du Soleil	Career transition is a phenomenon inherent in the performing arts and particularly in the circus arts. The often constrained nature of the career transition and the difficulty for those who undertake it, are considered major issues for all circus actors. However, few studies have looked at the dynamics of career transition in the circus arts. At the time when the COVID-19 pandemic is forcing employers to suspend circus performances, the reflection on a possible professional reorientation comes earlier in their career in comparison to artists who worked before the pandemic. In January 2021, 94% of circus artists considered having another career, according to the national grouping of circus arts En Piste. Highlighting the factors of the artistic profession that lead circus artists to undertake a career transition, is what this original research offers. Thus, we conducted a qualitative survey including 14 Cirque du Soleil artists. We have observed, heeded and comprehended the representations and perceptions of artists regarding their career. During the interviews conducted between January and November 2020, we collected valuable and revealing data to identify the main triggers for this transition. We have thus shown that artists leave the scene relatively early in their career. The combination of several factors such as the chronology over time, the risk of injury which increases by age, the very particular working conditions of circus artists, the work / family balance, the self-exclusion of women in comparison to their peers, the emotional exhaustion or even the exceptional context of COVID-19, contribute to the fact that artists leave the scene relatively early in their professional artistic pathway. Thus, this work aims to understand the work of circus artists who have made a career transition or are about to make it.	artistic work , circus arts , career transition	en	25970.0
47	L'épuisement professionnel des enseignants et les comportements extériorisés d'élèves du 2e et 3e cycle du primaire : le rôle de la relation maître-élèves	Students with externalized behavioral problems in elementary school represent an important issue for Québec schools and society. Indeed, they are more at risk to encounter psychosocial difficulties throughout their school career and at the start of their adulthood. Consequently, to find new possible interventions, it is necessary to study factors of school context that allow development, maintenance, and exacerbation of these behaviors. This study therefore focuses on teacher burnout, a factor that may influence student behavior in the classroom, but on which little research has been done. With a longitudinal design, the aim of this study was first to assess whether teacher burnout is associated with increase in externalized behavioral problems among students in 2nd and 3rd cycle of elementary school. Secondly, we aimed to determine if this association is moderated by the quality of the teacher-student relationship. Hierarchical regression analyzes were performed on two samples differing by their multiethnic composition. Data from the first sample were collected of 735 students and their 43 teachers, in seven francophone elementary schools of Montérégie. Data from the second sample were collected of 616 students and their 64 teachers, in five francophone elementary schools of Montréal. Results suggest that teacher burnout is associated with an increase in externalized behaviors among students. However, results do not allow to conclude a generalized moderating role of the teacher-student relationship. Implications of the results for research and psychoeducational practice are discussed. We suggest that psychoeducators can prevent and reduce the signs of professional burnout among teachers by practicing an advisory role with teachers and management, by leading professional development workshops and by setting up intervention programs.

48	Inflammation d’origine non-pathogénique durant la gestation, implication dans les complications de la grossesse et impact sur le développement cérébral	INTRODUCTION: Intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR), preeclampsia (PE) and preterm birth (PTB) are important pathologies of pregnancy strongly associated with poor placental function, a central organ for fetal development. About 5-12% of all pregnancies are pathological and this increases the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders. Inflammation is central to all pregnancy complications and the causal link has been demonstrated with several animal models of prenatal inflammation leading to brain damage in newborns. However, these models use infectious stimuli although pathogens are rarely detected clinically. Despite the absence of detectable infection, evidence of inflammation, such as elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and alarmins, is observed. Alarmins are endogenous mediators, another cause of inflammation increasingly associated with pathological pregnancies. Uric acid is one of the most studied alarmins, however its effect on pregnancy is mostly unknown. Thus, my hypothesis was that prenatal exposure particularly to uric acid is associated with pregnancy complications and is a cause of placental damage which subsequently impairs fetal neurodevelopment, leading to long-term brain damage in the child.  My general OBJECTIVE was to understand the link between non-pathogenic prenatal inflammation, pregnancy complications and its effect on the placenta and the developing brain. Specifically, I detected the presence of inflammation in major pregnancy complications and subsequently focused on PE and its immune activation. In parallel, I established the causal link between non-infectious inflammation, placental damage and IUGR. Finally, I evaluated brain development following in utero inflammation and investigated a therapeutic target in my preclinical model.  METHODS AND RESULTS: I analyzed the inflammatory profile of 200 women with or without pregnancy complications (Ctrl, IUGR, PE, PTB) and demonstrated that each complication has a distinct circulating inflammatory profile, particularly in women with PE. In addition, I further analyzed women with PE and observed a uric acid increase in the maternal circulation, related to an altered immune profile and structural changes in the placenta. To determine the direct effects of uric acid, we used cultures of primary trophoblasts, the main cell of the placenta, and human placental explants. We have shown that uric acid induces a pro-inflammatory profile, particularly increasing the secretion of IL-1β and IL-6 and induces apoptosis of trophoblasts. In parallel, I developed a new preclinical model of pregnant rats that were injected intraperitoneally with uric acid from gestation time 18 (G18) to G21. The injection of uric acid at the end of gestation in the rat caused increase cytokines (IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-6), the infiltration of immune cells in the placenta as well as an IUGR in the fetus that persisted into the postnatal period. Additionally, babies exposed to uric acid in utero have neurodevelopmental impairment characterized by microglial and astroglial activation in addition to decreased motor function. These effects of uric acid was dependent on IL-1β and was blocked by the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra).  CONCLUSIONS: Inflammation is associated with all pregnancy complications, however, with different profiles depending on the pathology studied. PE is associated with significant immune changes. Uric acid at the maternal-fetal interface induced inflammation and altered placental functions in an IL-1-dependent manner. Ultimately, exposure to uric acid in late rat pregnancy induced placental inflammation, IUGR, and impaired brain development. Prenatal anti-inflammatory treatment helped minimize inflammation and these negative effects on the brain.

49	Effets de la trazodone sur le comportement et le cortisol sérique du gnou bleu (Connochaetes taurinus)	Trazodone is a dose-dependant serotonin antagonist and agonist used in human and veterinary medicine to treat anxiety-related conditions. Trauma has been identified as the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in several wild ruminant species and can be exacerbated by stress. In a recent study in domestic goats, trazodone reduced activity levels without adverse effects. Trazodone could allow for safer capture and handling in ruminant species. The objectives of the present study were to identify a dose of trazodone that decreases activity levels in captive blue wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus), to evaluate its effects on serum cortisol levels following a routine veterinary procedure, and its safety. A pilot study using ethograms identified a 15 mg/kg oral dose of trazodone as effective to reduce activity levels. Over 6 hours, this dose resulted in a 111% increase in time spent sleeping/resting (P=0.0003), a 41% increase in time spent lying down (P=0.0016), a 64% reduction in time spent moving (P=0.005), and a 65% reduction in time spent being vigilant (P=0.026). Systemic absorption of trazodone was identified when plasma concentrations were measured after 2 hours (95 ± 48 µg/L). Serum cortisol levels during a routine venipuncture event were not significantly different following trazodone adminstration (P > 0.05). Mild hyporexia was the only adverse effect noted at 15 mg/kg and was absent at a 12 mg/kg dose. Trazodone appears safe and promising to decrease activity in the blue wildebeest and might thus have a positive effect on wild ruminant welfare and the safety of veterinary procedures.

50	Revue systématique sur les valeurs estimées de paramètres influençant la détection de la tuberculose bovine chez les cervidés d’élevage	Bovine tuberculosis is a zoonotic disease mostly transmitted by inhalation of contaminated material. This disease leads to the economic losses (e.g. condemnation of meat from infected animals at the abattoir) and impede trade since countries can stop importing live cervids from tuberculosis endemic countries. In Canada, the control of bovine tuberculosis started in 1923 in cattle and then was implemented in farmed cervids in 1989. This program is composed of surveillance, response to the outbreaks and movement control of cervids. The capacity of detecting this disease during the surveillance activities depends on the performance of diagnostic methods used at each step of the component of the surveillance system. At the abattoir, the inspection is carried out by visual inspection of organs and carcass and diagnostic tests carried on abnormal tissues by using histopathology, PCR or culture. In live cervids, the detection is carried out through skin or serological testing. The main objective of this project was to provide, through a systematic literature review, the estimates of main parameters that can influence the probability of detecting bovine tuberculosis in the context of surveillance activities in farmed cervids at the abattoir and in live cervids. The probability of presence of macroscopic lesions estimated by studies ranged from 20% to 100% while the estimate of probability of detection of lesions was greater than or equal to 90%. The estimate of sensitivity of diagnostic tests used during bovine tuberculosis surveillance at the abattoir (histopathology, PCR and culture) ranged from 63.6% to 98.6%. In live cervids, studies that investigated the performance of serological tests reported an estimate of sensitivity ranging from low to high (1.4% to 100.0%)  while skin tests were reported to have a sensitivity ranging from 65.0% à 100.0%. Given that the stage of the disease affects the performance of most diagnostic test while that variable was not reported by studies, it was difficult to compare  the performance of the various tests. Bovine tuberculosis prevalence estimated by studies using a cross-sectional or disease control design reported a low prevalence (prevalence at the animal level within a herd). One study carried out in Canada evaluated the risk factors for bovine tuberculosis infection and found that the increase of herd size was associated with an increase of risk of herd positivity to bovine tuberculosis. This information on the performance and limits of bovine tuberculosis diagnostic tests is critical for orienting the choice of appropriate diagnostic method and for a valid evaluation of the surveillance activities	M. bovis , Surveillance , Bovine tuberculosis , Cervids	en	25913.0
51	Peut-on contraindre un État à sauver l'environnement ?  La problématique du respect des obligations en droit international environnemental	Can we compel a State to save the environment? Whereas recents judgements made in domestic law seems to want to answer to this question in an affirmative way, it is not as clear in international law. Erected around the Westhpalian-inherited glass ceilling, the international legal sphere is confronted to limits that were self-imposed : the impossibilty to constrain a State to act against its will.  In an attempt to restrain the acts of those supranational all-mighty entities in their competencies, many environnemental agreements were made. Inside a process of manufacturing new norms that is controled by the subject and the author of the future provision, the international organizations are aware of the fact that they are powerless. Especially regarding the difficulty to strike a intrusive surveillance or rigid sanctions, in sum anything that is included in an effective compliance mechanism. The State's supreme power is not tied with an invincibility on the international scene, as diverses means to lead to global environnemental governance are starting to emerge.

52	Development of a tissue engineering platform using bovine species as a model : placental scaffolds seeded with bovine adipose-derived cells	Stem cell technologies and biomaterial sciences have advanced and grown more popular all over the world. The researchers aim to investigate and evaluate different sources of cells and biomaterials that, in combination, could provide a low cost, highly scalable tissue engineering platform that could be used in drug tests, cell therapies and cell transplantation. The three most important components of tissue engineering systems in general are cell source, biomaterial source (scaffolding system), and the creation and maintenance of an environment that is conducive to tissue formation. When these three components are successfully managed, the tissue engineering treatment achieves a faithful imitation of the in vivo environment, allowing for the differentiation of cells into the desirable cell types. Decellularized bovine placenta has been demonstrated to be rich in extracellular matrix (ECM) and to have well-developed vasculature, representing a highly available, low cost, practically scalable biomaterial. However, it is not known if placental scaffolds have the potential to support recellularization with adipose-derived cells and their subsequent differentiation into different lineages. Thus, in order to provide information on the ability of the mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) - placental scaffold complex to be used in tissue engineering approaches, the objectives of this thesis were: to study the potential of bovine placental scaffolds to support adipose-derived cell recellularization and their differentiation into osteogenic and chondrogenic lineages. The first article of this thesis is a literature review that discusses the nature of mesenchymal stem cells, their applications in regenerative medicine, the importance of stem cell technologies to the livestock industry and the use of bovine species for translational medicine. The second article consists of an evaluation of scaffold recellularization and the differentiation of cells on the scaffolds. The bovine placentae were decellularized by umbilical vessel sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) perfusion and cell lines were established after the enzymatic digestion of adipose tissue from six cows and cell selection by rapid adherence to the culture plate. Then, cells were seeded onto the scaffolds and cultured in a 2D rocker system for 21 days in either differentiation or maintenance medium. The isolated cells, when cultured in the plastic dish, exhibited fibroblast-like morphology, CD90, CD73 and CD105 expression, and lacked CD34 and CD45 expression. Moreover, the cells were able to undergo differentiation into chondrogenic and osteogenic lineages, providing evidence of their mesenchymal nature. 8 Subsequently, the cells adhered to the scaffolds by cell projections, established cell-scaffold communication, and proliferated while maintaining cell-cell communication, which was evidenced by histological and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) assays. Throughout a 21- day culture period in the osteogenic medium, the cells exhibited proliferation and differentiation in a time-dependent manner, which can be observed by the greater abundance of cells in later periods, evidenced by cell nuclei staining (4′,6-diamidino-2- phenylindole - DAPI) and increased intensity of staining for COLLAGEN 1 (COL1) in the immunohistochemical assay, and by its expression as measured by real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). This same pattern was observed by histological analysis. Widespread calcium accumulations were also more abundant on the scaffolds as time progressed, as evidenced by Von Kossa staining. The SEM analysis revealed that cells secreted globular/round structures when seeded under osteogenic induction conditions, in accordance with histological findings. Regarding chondrogenic differentiation, Safranin O and Fast Green staining revealed successful differentiation through staining of proteoglycans, chondrocyte-like cells and type II collagen on the scaffold. The SEM analysis showed that the cells changed morphology from fibroblast-like to globular when cultured with chondrogenic induction medium for 21 days. Additionally, cell-scaffold complexes expressed a cartilage marker, COLLAGEN 2 (COL2), which is conducive to the histological and SEM observations. Considering the results as a whole, this study demonstrated that placental scaffolds seeded with adipose-derived cells have the potential to be used in bone and cartilage tissue- engineering applications	Cartilage tissue engineering , Bone tissue engineering , Placenta , Mesenchymal stem cells , Decellularization , Recellularization , Cows , Translational medicine , Recellularisation	en	25892.0

54	L’expérience institutionnelle des femmes qui font carrière au sein des Forces armées canadiennes : comment expliquer leur manque d’accès aux postes névralgiques?	The current crisis amongst the senior leadership of the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) brings to the forefront structural gaps within Canadian military culture more broadly. The paltry representation of women within key posts has resurfaced questions surrounding barriers to entry. The objective of this thesis is primarily to present the career trajectories of Regular Force female members of the military and to highlight the obstacles they face because of their gender. The empirical data taken from these narratives allows for identifying structural barriers, their nature, their construction, and their reproduction. This research is the result of 15 semi-directed in-depth interviews conducted with female members of the military in the Regular Force. These women develop differently according to the three distinct elements of the CAF (Royal Canadian Navy, Canadian Army and Royal Canadian Air Force) and bear witness to careers lived across more than ten different trades. The empirical data allows for the triangulation of key moments within each woman’s career and to then proceed to crossreferencing. On an individual career level, this thesis shows that the dominant normative culture derives from hegemonic masculinity. Furthermore, trades belonging to the combat arms are still the most valued within the organisation and represent the path to the highest attainable ranks. Structurally, the liaison between theory and empirical practice, and those between structures and individuality confirm the existence of multilateral relationships of power. These relationships go beyond the topdown logic of hierarchy. This multilateralism is lived horizontally because of the normative culture, vertically based on the hierarchization of gender roles, and also amidst the exchanges between leaders and subordinates. Combined with the CAF’s institutional requirements, this exacerbates the invisible challenges which confront women as they climb the ranks, notably with regard to credibility, worklife balance, motherhood, and the tokenism of being the “first woman.” By giving a platform to these narratives from currently serving women, this thesis serves to break invisible lived realities and identify the gendered structural barriers intrinsic to the CAF. On an empirical level, the method used contributes to the advancement of research on the career trajectories of woman in the Canadian Armed Forces. On a theoretical level, the method used applies new analytical perspectives related to state feminism and directs them toward an atypical bureaucracy. The theories discussed within this project upend the current policies which seek to promote retention amongst women already serving. This research also contributes to the body of francophone literature which deals with female military leadership and with gender issues in the CAF.	promotions , Canadian Armed Forces , senior officers , senior military leadership , retention , female leadership , military careers , gender and militaries , tokenism , state feminism , military sociology , military culture , role congruity , gender stereotypes	en	25845.0
55	La dualité ethnographe-physicienne : étude réflexive sur les négociations identitaires en physique	Being a female physicist, I have acted and interacted in an environment where women, like many other historically marginalized groups, are under-represented. According to social justice principles, everyone should be able to contribute to the construction of scientific knowledge. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the social mechanisms that limit the participation of certain groups. While the notion of under-representation has often been used to address the relative presence or absence of individuals in certain categories, I prefer to speak about diversity and inclusion which decompartmentalise individuals. My starting point is the observation that various aspects, causes, and consequences related to the lack of diversity and inclusion in the scientific community are complex and manifest themselves in communication and lived experience. I use the concept of identity work to analyze the interpenetration of personal, institutional, and communicational elements that restrict diversity and inclusion in my organization (a university physics department) and to reflect on systemic issues that go beyond organizational boundaries. Building on my insider’s point of view, I conducted an “at-home” ethnography in which I describe identity work at the physics department of Université de Montréal as I experienced and observed it. Specifically, I target three elements that are central to daily life in Department, that engage both students and professors, and that trigger identity work: seminars, research projects and departmental committees. Throughout this ethnographic tale with confessional tones, I link my internal identity processes as an individual contributing to scientific knowledge throughout identity facets historically marginalized. In addition, I show how, for a given environment, confidence in one’s research skills can be rebuilt after collapsing. Giving hope, my ethnographic tale highlights the importance of discussion groups on diversity and inclusion in departmental units and research groups and, furthermore, offers avenues and tools to scientists that want to engage with social issues in their research. Finally, as far as I know, this is the first at-home ethnography of a scientific community produced by a female physicist.

56	Analyse de qualité d’un MOOC: le point de vue des étudiants	New York Times headlines in 2012 was the «year of the MOOC», putting the spotlight on a new trend, but since then, research stance on this phenomenon is more critical. Hence, the pursuit of quality may be as important in MOOCs in distance education? This research aims to examine the experience of 631 learners in two MOOC of HEC Montreal, based on their perceptions, by applying a qualitative inductive approach without any theoretical a priori, from three open questions. Results highlight criteria that are very close to some of the ones used in distance education quality frameworks, but that are operationalized differently: a special attention to content relations between theory and practice, accessibility of contents, teachers’ performances and clarity of tests and quizzes.

57	Early childhood education and care access for children from disadvantaged backgrounds : using a framework to guide intervention	Early childhood education and care (ECEC) can have substantial beneficial effects on overall child development and educational success for children from disadvantaged backgrounds. Unfortunately, it is well documented that they are underrepresented in quality ECEC programs. In order to improve access to quality ECEC, it is important to understand the factors leading to these inequities. This paper is based on a synthesis of published literature on interventions aimed at improving access to ECEC. We propose a framework identifying the spectrum of factors influencing access to quality ECEC for disadvantaged populations. We also present, in the context of our proposed framework, different interventions that have been taken to improve access to ECEC opportunities for children from low socioeconomic and/or new immigrant backgrounds. We believe that the framework proposed in this paper serves not only as a framework by which to understand the overlapping processes, factors, and stages affecting access to ECEC, but also as a model to help decision makers coordinate their efforts and maximize their impact towards more equity in access to quality early childhood education.

58	Instruments to evaluate mobility capacity of older adults during hospitalization : a systematic review	Independent mobility is a key factor in predicting morbidity and determining hospital discharge readiness for older patients. The main objective was identify and appraise relevant instruments for the measurement of mobility of hospitalized geriatric patients. A systematic review was performed in two consecutive steps. Based on the definition of mobility of the International Classification of Functioning (ICF). Step 1 identified mobility measurement instruments used to assess patients 60 years of age and over hospitalized in acute care or intensive geriatric rehabilitation unit. Aim of the instrument, coverage of mobility construct, applicability (format, training required, administration time and use of assistive devices) were extracted. For each included instrument, Step 2 identified and appraised articles reporting about their measurement properties. Consensus-based Standards for the selection of health status Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) was used by two independent reviewers to critically appraise and compare the measurement properties. Step 1 resulted in 6350 articles, of which 28 articles reported about 17 different instruments. Step 2 retained 11 instruments with 70 articles reporting about their measurement properties in various settings. Judgement-based instruments (n = 5) covered the ICF mobility construct more broadly than performance-based measures (n = 6). Our results showed that 3 instruments (DEMMI, SPPB and Tinetti scale) had the most extensive and robust measurement properties, and from those, SPPB and DEMMI covered the mobility construct more broadly but SPPB had the longest administration (10–15 min). Conclusion SPPB presents the best balance between mobility coverage, measurement properties and applicability to acute care or intensive geriatric rehabilitation unit.

60	Resiniferatoxin hampers the nocifensive response of Caenorhabditis elegans to noxious heat, and pathway analysis revealed that the Wnt signaling pathway is involved	Resiniferatoxin (RTX) is a metabolite extracted from Euphorbia resinifera. RTX is a potent capsaicin analog with specific biological activities resulting from its agonist activity with the transient receptor potential channel vanilloid subfamily member 1 (TRPV1). RTX has been examined as a pain reliever, and more recently, investigated for its ability to desensitize cardiac sensory fibers expressing TRPV1 to improve chronic heart failure (CHF) outcomes using validated animal models. Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) expresses orthologs of vanilloid receptors activated by capsaicin, producing antinociceptive effects. Thus, we used C. elegans to characterize the antinociceptive properties and performed proteomic profiling to uncover specific signaling networks. After exposure to RTX, wild-type (N2) and mutant C. elegans were placed on petri dishes divided into quadrants for heat stimulation. The thermal avoidance index was used to phenotype each tested C. elegans experimental group. The data revealed for the first time that RTX can hamper the nocifensive response of C. elegans to noxious heat (32 – 35 °C). The effect was reversed 6 h after RTX exposure. Additionally, we identified the RTX target, the C. elegans transient receptor potential channel OCR-3. The proteomics and pathway enrichment analysis results suggest that Wnt signaling is triggered by the agonistic effects of RTX on C. elegans vanilloid receptors.

61	The role of point-of-care ultrasound monitoring in cardiac surgical patients with acute kidney injury	The approach to the patient with acute kidney injury (AKI) after cardiac surgery involves multiple aspects. These include the rapid recognition of reversible causes, the accurate identification of patients who will progress to severe stages of AKI and the subsequent management of complications resulting from severe renal dysfunction. Unfortunately, the inherent limitations of physical examination and laboratory parameters results are often responsible for a sub-optimal clinical management. In this review article, we explore how Point-Of-Care ultrasound, including renal and extra-renal ultrasound, can be used to complement all aspects of the care of cardiac surgery patients with AKI, from the initial approach of early AKI to fluid balance management during renal replacement therapy. The current evidence is reviewed including knowledge gaps and future areas of research.	Acute kidney injury , Cardiac surgery , Point-Of-Care ultrasound , Doppler ultrasound	en	25768.0
62	"The Plan S Rights Retention
Strategy is an administrative and
legal burden, not a sustainable open
access solution"	The Plan S Rights Retention Strategy (RRS) requires authors who are submitting to subscription journals to inform publishers that the author accepted manuscript (AAM) will be made available under a Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) licence. The laudable stated aim of the RRS is to achieve immediate open access to research outputs, while preserving journal choice for authors. However, proponents of the RRS overlook the significant administrative and legal burdens that the RRS places on authors and readers. Even though compliance with existing green open access (self-archiving) policies is poor at best, the RRS is likely to rely on authors to successfully execute the CC licensing of their work in the face of publisher resistance. The complexity of copyright law and CC licensing gives many reasons to doubt the legal validity of an RRS licence grant, which creates legal risk for authors and their institutions. The complexity of RRS CC BY licensing also creates legal risk for readers, who may not be able to fully rely on the reuse rights of a CC BY licence on the AAM. However, cOAlition S has released no legal advice that explains why the RRS is valid and legally binding. Publishers of legacy subscription journals have already begun implementing strategies that ensure they can protect their revenue streams. These actions may leave authors having to choose between paying publication fees and complying with their funding agreements. The result is that the RRS increases the complexity of the copyright and licensing landscape in academic publishing, creates legal risk and may not avoid author fees. Unless increased complexity and conflict between authors and publishers drives open access, the RRS is not fit for its stated purpose as an open access strategy.

63	The abiding voter : the lengthy horizon of retrospective evaluations	Although the theory of retrospective voting receives wide support in the literature on voting behavior, less agreement exists on voters’ time horizon when assessing the government’s performance – i.e., whether voters are myopic. Previous studies on voter myopia tend to focus on aggregate-level measures of the economy, or use an experimental approach. Using panel data, this paper offers the first investigation into voter myopia that uses individual-level evaluations of government performance in a representative survey at several points during the electoral cycle. Our study focuses on The Netherlands, but we also provide tests of the generalizability and robustness of our findings, and a replication in the U.S. context. The results indicate that voter satisfaction early in the government’s term adds to explaining incumbent voting. Thus, rather than the myopic voter, we find evidence of the abiding voter – steady at her or his post, evaluating government performance over a long length of time.

64	Do women vote less correctly? The effect of gender on ideological proximity voting and correct voting	Studies on political knowledge routinely find that women have lower levels of political knowledge than men. This gender gap in political knowledge is usually interpreted as troublesome for democracy, because a lack of political knowledge could imply that women’s participation in politics is less effective and that their interests will be represented less well than those of men. In this short article, we present a direct test of the assumption that women are less effective voters because of this lack of political knowledge. We make use of CSES data to study gender differences in proximity voting and correct voting. Our results do not suggest that women vote less correctly than men—a conclusion that prompts important questions about the role of different forms of political knowledge, and the seemingly gendered nature of the vote choice.

65	Pathological implications of the interaction between neurexins and alpha-synuclein in synucleinopathies	Parkinson’s disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) are the second and the third most common neurodegenerative disorders and are part of a class of diseases called synucleinopathies. Synucleinopathies are associated with an α-synuclein (α-syn) pathology which shows an accumulation of α-syn in neurons, forming Lewy bodies. This pathological α-syn can form oligomers and fibrils, which are toxic for neurons and their synapses. One of the first changes to occur in patients’ brain with synucleinopathies is synaptic dysfunction often combined with synapse loss. Synaptic α-syn oligomers were revealed to precede the formation of Lewy bodies, and their transmission to other neurons to correlate with the progression of the symptoms. Yet, the molecular mechanisms underlying how α-syn leads to synaptic dysfunction are unknown. Synaptic function is highly regulated by a protein family called synaptic organizers. Synaptic organizers are cell adhesion molecules that regulate synaptogenesis, plasticity, neurotransmitter release, synaptic plasticity and cognitive functions. Of this family, we have found that α-syn interacts with the β-isoforms of the neurexins (NRXs) family members (β-NRXs). My project aimed to characterize α-syn/β-NRX interaction and to evaluate how this interaction contributes to α-syn pathology. We hypothesized that this interaction affects NRX trafficking and its synaptic function. Firstly, to test our hypothesis, the α-syn/β-NRX interaction was characterized by performing cell surface binding assays. I found that α-syn oligomers strongly bind to NRX1,2β in a histidine rich domain (HRD)-dependent manner, without disrupting NRX binding to its postsynaptic binding partners, neuroligin 1 (NLG1) and leucine rich repeat transmembrane neuronal 2 (LRRTM2). Moreover, using internalization assays, we discovered that α-syn oligomers impair NRX trafficking by increasing NRX1β internalization in an HRD-dependent manner and impair NRX-dependent inhibitory presynaptic differentiation. Thereby, we suggest that this increased internalization affects the inhibitory synaptogenic function of NRX-based synaptic organizing complexes. This work contributes to a better understanding of how α-syn causes synaptic dysfunction, providing promising new molecular mechanisms and pharmacological insights into synucleinopathies.

66	Effets d’un test de propulsion en fauteuil roulant sur l’intégrité tendineuse des muscles biceps et supra-épineux : étude d’imagerie musculosquelettique par ultrasonographie	Relevance. The completion of performance-based maximal cardiorespiratory fitness tests among manual wheelchair user is highly relevant to develop personalized cardiorespiratory fitness training programs and to assess their impacts over time. However, these tests could potentially increase risk exposure for the development of upper limb secondary musculoskeletal impairments specifically to the shoulder. Hence, finding an equilibrium between the need to measure aerobic fitness and the increased risk of developing secondary musculoskeletal impairments when completing performance-based  test is fundamental. Objective. To characterize the effect of the completion of a recently- developed treadmill-based progressive workload incremental test on the integrity of the  long head of the biceps and supraspinatus tendons using musculoskeletal ultrasound imaging biomarkers. Method. Fifteen manual wheelchair users living with a spinal cord injury completed the treadmill-based progressive workload incremental test. Ultrasound images of the long head of the biceps and supraspinatus tendons were recorded with a musculoskeletal ultrasound imaging device in the transversal and longitudinal planes before, immediately after, and 48 hours after the completion of the test using a standardized protocol. Geometric, luminosity, and texture-related ultrasound biomarkers of a region of interest have characterized tendon integrity. Results. The participants propelled an average of 10.2 ± 2.9 minutes with the majority (N = 13/15) reached at least the eighth stage of the test (speed = 0.8 m/s; slope = 3.6 ̊). None of the geometric, luminosity and texture biomarkers characterizing the integrity of the two tendons, measured in the longitudinal and transversal planes, changed significantly (p=0.063 to 1.000) between the three measurement times. Conclusion. The performance of the treadmill-based progressive workload propulsion test to assess aerobic capacity does not result in any observable deleterious change immediately after and 48 hrs after the performance of the test.

67	The effects of celastrol on endothelial cells survival and proliferation	Introduction: Coronary artery bypass grafts are most commonly performed using saphenous vein grafts to complement the internal thoracic artery. The saphenous vein will remain popular despite its lower patency rate because it is easily accessible and lengthy enough to perform multiple bypasses. Therefore, several approaches have been studied, with the common goal of finding the optimal conditions that reduce graft failure. They include novel harvest techniques, new preservation preparations, innovative genetic therapies and experimental drugs. We believe a pharmacological pre-conditioning with an anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory drug during the crucial time of harvest may spark beneficial survival response from the endothelial cells. One particular compound is Celastrol, an HSP90 inhibitor, which displays those antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Methods: Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were pretreated with various concentrations of Celastrol (10-10M, 10-8M and 10-6M). In order to reproduce oxidative stress found in ischemia/reperfusion, cells were exposed to hydrogen peroxide for a short and extended period (1h and 24h). To mimic storage condition encountered in clinical settings, cells were also exposed in heparinized normal saline. The viability was assessed by LIVE/DEAD assay. As for migrative and proliferative properties, scratch tests were performed. Finally, various protective intracellular pathways were evaluated by Western blot. Results: This study shows that pre-treatment with Celastrol promotes survival in HUVEC submitted to oxidative stress. Notable improvement in cellular viability was detected as early as 1 hour after oxidative stress (H2O2 4 mM), 76.6% vs 66.1% (p=0.005). Significant survival benefits are also reported after prolonged oxidative stress (H2O2 0.5 mM for 24 hours); viability was 93.7% vs 76.9% (p=0.001) for Cel 10- 8 M and 96.6% vs 76.9% (p=0.002) for Celastrol 10-10M when compared to the vehicle. Celastrol, however, did not significantly affect viability of HUVEC stored in heparinized normal saline.  Celastrol at 10-6 M promotes faster and more complete wound closure compared to the vehicle or to lower dosages. Celastrol triggers early activation of the RISK pathway, inducing activation of both Akt and ERK1/2 within the first 15 minutes of treatment. Celastrol also induces the expression of HSP70 and HO-1, effectors of the Heat Shock Response and the anti-oxidative response respectively.  Conclusion: Pre-treatment by Celastrol provides survival benefits in endothelial cells under oxidative stress. It also stimulates endothelial cell proliferation and migration, promoting faster and more complete re-endothelialisation. Celastrol can potentially be used as an additive to storage solutions to limit endothelial injury and promote graft protection.

68	Predictive carboplatin treatment response models for epithelial ovarian cancer : comparison of 2D, 3D and in-vivo models	Epithelial ovarian adenocarcinoma (EOC) is the most lethal gynecological cancer. The drug discovery pipeline is heavily based on preclinical models. Typically, 2D cell line (CL)-based models are used to screen compounds followed by validation in animal models to generate the evidence needed to design clinical trials. This process incurs a high cost to the research pipeline and still results in high drug attrition rates. This may in part reflect the poor translation of preclinical to clinical results and points to deficiencies in modeling. Previous work from our laboratory shows that the sensitivity of our EOC CLs to carboplatin therapy varies between 2D and 3D in vitro models, however it is unclear how these differences align with the in vivo response. We hypothesize that 3D models will more closely reflect therapeutic in vivo response. The objective of this study was to characterize the carboplatin sensitivity of EOC CLs in 2D and 3D-spheroids and compare them to in vivo response using mouse xenografts. We injected mice with 6 different EOC CLs that were treated with 3 different carboplatin concentrations. Tumor volume measurements and immunofluorescence viability stains were used to categorize CLs by their sensitivity. The same CLs were seeded in low attachment plates to form, and thereafter treat, spheroids. Flow cytometry analysis was used to classify CLs by their 50% inhibitory response (IC50). The 2D response (IC50) for these CLs has previously been published. Our results show that therapeutic response changes significantly for a single CL between different systems, and the 3D model was most concordant with the in vivo model. Our ultra-resistant CL in 2D became more sensitive in 3D/mouse models. In contrast, the highly 2D sensitive CL became more resistant in our xenograft/spheroid models. The results are important to consider when investing time/funds in drug screening and therapeutic response prediction studies.

69	Caractérisation de nouveaux modèles TDP-43/TDP-1 de Caenorhabditis elegans pour la maladie sclérose latérale amyotrophique	Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by a progressive and selective loss of motor neurons. ALS is incurable and there are no effective treatments available for people living with the disease. About 90% of the cases are sporadic whereas 10% are familial, and patients usually die two to five years after symptom onset. Many gene defects are associated with ALS, including mutations in genes encoding FUS, C9orf72, SOD-1 and TDP-43 proteins. We have developed a transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans model expressing human mutant TDP-43(Q331K) in GABAergic motor neurons. We have also obtained by mutagenesis and CRISPR-Cas9 physiologically accurate models based on mutations in tdp-1, the C. elegans ortholog of TARDBP. Our objective is to characterize these models and determine if they can recapitulate key aspects of the disease such as motor deficits and age-dependent neurodegeneration causing paralysis. We believe that the TDP-1 model will reflect more precisely the physiological expression of the gene in the human disease because of its mutation in an endogenous gene, the absence of overexpression and ubiquitous protein expression. Our results show that both TDP-43 and TDP-1 models have motor deficits, synaptic transmission impairments and age-dependent neurodegeneration. However, only the TDP-43 mutation seems to have an effect on lifespan. These models provide different physiological expression of mutant proteins and thus phenotypes of varying intensity levels. They will be useful tools to elucidate new pathogenic mechanisms of ALS as well as being good candidates for drug screening and developing therapeutic strategies.

70	Analyse comparative de modèles de la qualité des habitats basés sur la densité instantanée et cumulative de poissons	Aquatic ecosystems contain approximately 25% of the global biodiversity and are among the most affected by human activity. This may be caused by the position of “receivers” rivers, lakes and oceans have in their watershed. Aquatic species, specially in freshwater, are thus at high risk of being affected by human activity. Assuring the survival of these species may include protecting and restoring their habitats. Habitat quality models (HQM) can be used to determine which habitats to protect and how to restore damaged habitats. HQM are relationships between habitat quality indices (HQI, e.g., density) and environmental conditions prevailing in those habitats. However, how well an HQM performs depends on the chosen HQI it is computed with. For this research, we compared HQM based on two HQI estimated for fish in a river : 1) instantaneous density, sampled by transect snorkeling survey and 2) cumulative density, sampled by fixed stereo-video recording. Analyses of twelve HQM show that, contrary to our hypothesis, HQM based on instantaneous density had higher explanatory capacities. However, environmental conditions selected by both types of HQM to explain a species’ distribution were different. This may in part be explained by inherent differences of the sampling methods (e.g., spatial scale). We conclude that instantaneous density as HQI produces HQM of higher explanatory capacities, yet both HQI may provide complementary information on the characteristics of habitats to protect and restore.	video camera , snorkeling , habitat quality model , habitat quality indices , instantaneous density , cumulative density , fish , aquatic ecosystem	en	25623.0
71	L’entrepreneuriat féminin : du démarrage de l’entreprise à l’opération effective, quels facteurs expliquent l’aboutissement des démarches entrepreneuriales chez les femmes au Québec?	Entrepreneurship is a source of job creation and a major driver of economic development in our society. In this sense, the presence of women in business has become a concern of public policies in Quebec and Canada. Several levers have been adopted to stimulate entrepreneurship with the aim of increasing the number of women in business. However, despite these measures, women remain less likely than men to undertake such activities. Nevertheless, while women are under-represented in the entrepreneurial ecosystem, they show entrepreneurial intentions in encouraging proportions, which are close to the statistics observed for men. As a result, this suggests that a slowdown in their entrepreneurial momentum occurs once the start-up actions have been initiated.   Through this research, we seek to understand factors influencing the entrepreneurial journey of women, from the first steps to the completion of their business project. Our study is part of the Schmitt’s Global Entrepreneurial Approach (3M Theory) (2017). The question we ask ourselves is: What factors explain the success of women’s entrepreneurship in Quebec? Through the qualitative analysis of 19 interviews conducted with two samples of women entrepreneurs, one group having experienced entrepreneurial success and one group having stopped their project, the study highlighted the influence of multiple factors on the entrepreneurial process and outcome. Our research highlights the major impact that the nature of project is likely to have in the choice to stop entrepreneurial approaches. Furthermore, the important role of the entrepreneur and her ecosystem in entrepreneurial success has also been observed. A typology of the different reasons for stopping entrepreneurial journeys has been developed and correlated with factors motivating that decision. In sum, the project will have made it possible to better understand the different realities experienced by women in all their complexity and suggest possible solutions to increase the presence of women in entrepreneurship in Quebec.

72	Advancing social inclusion of people with disabilities through awareness and training activities : a collaborative process between community partners and researchers	Objective The main objectives were to 1) search and map current disability awareness and training activities in Quebec, Canada, 2) collectively reflect on these practices, and 3) develop a five-year strategic plan.  Methods We used an integrated knowledge translation approach whereby researchers and community partners were involved in all stages. This project consisted of two sequential phases: 1) an environmental scan (web review and interview) of current practices, and 2) a reflection process with an external expert-facilitator in social transformation. Outcome results and process data are reported.  Results We identified 129 activities (71 training, 58 awareness) from 39 organizations (from 123 organizations initially invited). A wide range of characteristics were collected for each activity which allowed for the identification of gaps. The working group met seven times in one year to discuss results from phase 1 and co-create a five-year strategic plan. Main priorities are 1) the development of a methodology for measuring collective impact and 2) content synchronization of activities.  Conclusion Involvement of partners and researchers enabled a concerted and efficient approach to the development of a five-year strategic plan.  Practice implications A transition committee led by partners will ensure implementation and sustainability of the plan across the province.

73	Randomized Quasi-Monte Carlo Methods for Density Estimation and Simulation of Markov Chains	The Randomized Quasi Monte Carlo method (RQMC) is often used to estimate an integral over the s-dimensional unit cube (0,1)^s. This integral is interpreted as the mathematical expectation of some random variable X. It is well known that RQMC estimators can, under some conditions, converge at a faster rate than crude Monte Carlo estimators of the integral. For Markov chains simulation on a large number of steps by using RQMC, little exists. The most promising approach proposed to date is the array-RQMC method. This method simulates n copies of the chain in parallel using a set of independent RQMC points at each step, and sorts the chains using a specific sorting function after each step. This method has given empirically significant results in terms of convergence rates on a few examples (i.e. a much better convergence rate than that observed with Monte Carlo standard). However, the convergence rates observed empirically have not yet been theoretically proven. In the first part of this thesis, we examine how RQMC can improve the convergence rate when estimating not only X's expectation, but also its distribution. In the second part, we examine how RQMC can be used for Markov chains simulation on a large number of steps using the array-RQMC method. Our thesis contains four articles. In the first article, we study the effectiveness of replacing Monte Carlo (MC) by either randomized quasi Monte Carlo (RQMC) or stratification to show how they can be applied to make samples more representative. Furthermore, we show how these methods can help to reduce the integrated variance (IV) and the mean integrated square error (MISE) for the kernel density estimators (KDEs). We provide both theoretical and empirical results on the convergence rates and show that the RQMC and stratified sampling estimators can achieve significant IV and MISE reductions with even faster convergence rates compared to MC in some situations, while leaving the bias unchanged. In the second article, we examine the combination of RQMC with a conditional Monte Carlo approach to density estimation. This approach is defined by taking the stochastic derivative of a conditional CDF of X and provides a large improvement when applied. Using array-RQMC in order to price an Asian option under an ordinary geometric Brownian motion process with fixed volatility has already been attempted in the past and a convergence rate of O(n⁻²) was observed for the variance. In the third article, we study the pricing of Asian options when the underlying process has stochastic volatility. More specifically, we examine the variance-gamma, Heston, and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic volatility models. We show how applying the array-RQMC method for pricing Asian and European options can significantly reduce the variance. An efficient sample path algorithm called (fixed-step) t-leaping can be used to simulate stochastic biological systems as well as well-stirred chemical reaction systems. The crude Monte Carlo (MC) method is a feasible approach when it comes to simulating these sample paths. Simulating the Markov chain for fixed-step t-leaping via ordinary randomized quasi-Monte Carlo (RQMC) has already been explored empirically and, when the dimension of the problem increased, the convergence rate of the variance was realigned with those observed in several numerical experiments using MC. In the last article, we study the combination of array-RQMC with this algorithm and empirically demonstrate that array-RQMC provides a significant reduction in the variance compared to the standard MC algorithm.

74	(In)visibilité de la radioactivité dans l’art et la photographie du Japon après « Fukushima » : médiations et expositions	On the 11th March 2011 an earthquake and tsunami struck Japan triggering a catastrophic chain of events at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant that seeded fear and confusion in the population. In the face of the government’s hesitant handling of the crisis and of inadequate media coverage regarding the scale of the disaster, Japanese artists mobilized to create their own responses relating to the ongoing and invisible effects of the calamity. In the shadow of the catastrophe, haunted by traumatic events and by an encompassing radiophobia, these artists have come to question the limits of figurability and also to ask what art is capable of and what its role can be. This thesis examines the emergence of “post-Fukushima art,” a term coined to describe a new, more politicized impulse in Japanese art, one that strives to provide an iconography adequate to the nuclear disaster and to render radiation visible. The thesis explores the photographic works of three artists in particular, Arai Takashi, Kagaya Masamichi and Takeda Shimpei. The trio employ analogue photographic techniques – daguerreotype, autoradiography and radiography – as a means to document and expose traces of irradiation. Their art is viewed through the prism of varied (in)visibilities linked to the nuclear catastrophe and addresses issues such as mediation and exposure. Exposure is understood in multiple senses, including exposure of a photosensitive support to light (such as radioluminescence), exposure to radioactive material generated by the disaster and, drawing on the French term exposé, exposure in the sense of exhibition. Exhibitions involve exposing viewers to photographs that relate to the catastrophe. On the eve of the tenth anniversary of the triple disaster, the thesis outlines the continuing stakes involved in post-Fukushima art as an effort to remember the event. It contributes to broader efforts aimed at refocussing attention on the aftermath of the disaster, including the radioactive contamination it caused.

75	Entre aspirations et contraintes: analyses du vécu de l'allaitement maternel chez les primipares au prisme des inégalités sociales	This thesis examines diversity and inequalities in breastfeeding experiences. It seeks to: 1)  understand how mothers’ initial breastfeeding aspirations compare with their post-birth  realities; 2) explore how inequalities related to gender, “race”, class, and immigrant status  influence breastfeeding experiences from the perspective of both mothers and  breastfeeding professionals; and 3) capture how mothers articulate and make sense of their  diverse experiences .   In this study, four data collection techniques were used: longitudinal semi-structured  interviews with 20 first-time mothers conducted when they were pregnant and then  approximately six months after the birth of their child; documentary analysis of maternal  diaries; semi-structured interviews of 21 breastfeeding professionals; and observation  during prenatal classes and breastfeeding support sessions.   As the sample is composed of women attempting breastfeeding for the first time, many  women felt disillusioned by three types of discrepancies they felt between what they  imagined breastfeeding would be and the reality of their experiences: 1) between the initial  aspirations and recommendations of public health and medical literature; 2) between their  own expectations and their lived realities of breastfeeding; and 3) between the standardized  conceptions of successful breastfeeding experiences according to public health  recommendations and the concept of success as experienced by the women. Further, the  data from both mothers and breastfeeding professionals demonstrate that constraints on  breastfeeding are unevenly distributed and founded mainly on social relations such as sex,  gender, ethnicity, class, immigration, and race.   This study also discovered a tendency among breastfeeding professionals to pride  themselves on their ability to differentiate between their clientele on the basis of these  categories. While sometimes appropriate, these classifications tend to exaggerate the  homogeneity of subgroups, relying on and reproducing stereotypes. An important  implication of this is that such practices lead to substantial differences in the services  rendered by these professionals.   Overall, this thesis provides a better understanding of the ambivalence at the center of the  breastfeeding experience and the complex relationships mothers undertake with public  health recommendations, the promotion or encouragement of the act of breastfeeding and  breastfeeding professionals.

76	Complications cardiométaboliques chez les survivants de la leucémie lymphoblastique aiguë pédiatrique : rôles de la dysbiose intestinale et de la nutrition dans leur développement	As a result of therapeutic advances, more than 90% of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) survive the disease. However, many survivors are at risk of developing long-term morbidities caused by the cancer and its treatments, especially since these are administered during a crucial period of their development. Long-term adverse effects include cardiometabolic disorders such as obesity, dyslipidemia and type 2 diabetes. Although their precise etiology is not fully understood, some mechanisms underlying the development of long-term complications have been proposed. Surprisingly, few studies have evaluated the relationship between diet and cardiometabolic complications in childhood cancer survivors. In the general population, poor dietary habits are associated with the incidence of metabolic syndrome components and atherosclerosis. Also, the intestinal microbiota appears to play a major role in the pathogenesis and progression of cardiometabolic disturbances in the general population. This role has been poorly studied in cancer survivor populations, where treatments could lead to significant changes in intestinal microbiota composition, diversity and function. We studied the cardiometabolic and nutritional health status of childhood ALL survivors and determined the associations between the two. In addition, we explored the intestinal microbiota as an underlying mechanism of cardiometabolic complication development. This work was carried out as part of the PETALE (Preventing Late Effects of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treatments) study at the Centre hospitalier universitaire Sainte-Justine in Montreal. Our results highlighted the high prevalence of cardiometabolic complications in adolescent and young adult survivors of childhood ALL. They also confirmed their increased cardiovascular risk compared to the general Canadian population, particularly those exposed to cranial radiotherapy. In addition, alterations in lipoprotein and apolipoprotein profiles, indicative of an increased risk of atherosclerosis, were identified.  We observed that survivors have poor compliance with dietary recommendations and that poor eating habits affect their nutritional and metabolic status. Our results confirm the association of diet quality and a better survivors’ cardiometabolic health. We identified an inverse association between a high intake of specific macro- and micronutrients (protein, selenium, zinc, copper, riboflavin and niacin) as well as meat and the risk of having low HDL-C levels in survivors, while fast food was positively associated with this risk.  It should be noted that despite low vitamin D intake, the prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency is no greater among survivors than in the general Canadian population. We identified associations between plasma biomarkers of visceral inflammation and endotoxemia and cardiometabolic complications in childhood ALL survivors. We also demonstrated the relationship between metabolic endotoxemia, inflammation and the presence of cardiometabolic complications. A review of the literature detailed the emerging role of intestinal dysbiosis in the metabolic sequelae found in survivors. In our exploratory work, we found that, in a large proportion of metabolically unhealthy survivors, there was a reduced abundance of bacteria families with protective role towards endotoxemia. We also demonstrated the feasibility of using a xenogenic mouse model of ALL to study the mechanisms explaining the development of cardiometabolic complications.  The identification of biomarkers and biological mechanisms and a better understanding of how diet and nutritional components may affect survivors of childhood ALL will allow the development of prevention strategies to minimize long-term sequelae, improve patient follow-up and optimize the quality of life of this high-risk population.	nutrition , inflammation , Cancer survivors , acute lymphoblastic leukemia , metabolic syndrome , dyslipidemia , nutrition , dysbiosis , endotoxemia , oxidative stress , inflammation	en	25544.0
77	Études structurales et ingénierie du ribozyme VS de Neurospora	Non-coding RNAs play essential roles in many biological processes, ranging from the regulation of gene expression to enzymatic activity. To perform their cellular functions, RNAs must adopt specific three-dimensional structures, and understanding how these structures fold is crucial to elucidate their mechanism of action. However, our fundamental understanding of the structure and dynamics of RNA at atomic resolution remains rather limited. To better understand the structure, dynamics and engineering of RNA, our laboratory is investigating the Neurospora VS ribozyme, a small RNA (~160 nucleotides) with catalytic activity.  The VS ribozyme was originally found 30 years ago in natural isolates of Neurospora fungi. It has been thoroughly investigated as an ideal model system to study the structure and function of RNA in vitro, due to its small size, its complex three-dimensional structure and easily detectable activity. Like other small nucleolytic ribozymes, the VS ribozyme catalyzes the cleavage and ligation reactions of a specific phosphodiester bond. However, it has the unique ability to recognize and cleave an isolated hairpin substrate through the formation of a highly stable kissing-loop interaction, which is of great interest for RNA engineering purposes. Recent crystal structures have provided useful information on the closed state of the ribozyme, in which the active site is formed. However, the VS ribozyme is also known to adopt an open state in solution and there is still very little structural information regarding this state and how it is converted into the active closed state. In order to characterize the solution structure of the ribozyme and its dynamics, an NMR-based divide-and-conquer approach was previously undertaken in which high-resolution structures of each of the key structural subdomains were determined.  The work presented in this thesis aims to characterize the structure of the complete VS ribozyme in solution and to explore its ability to cleave an RNA hairpin of interest, different from its natural substrate. First, an engineering study was undertaken to create VS ribozyme variants capable of recognizing an RNA stem-loop derived from the HIV-1 Trans-Activation Response Element RNA. Using in vitro selection, highly active ribozyme variants were identified, and their sequence analysis suggests that the improved activity observed in some variants depends on increased conformational sampling of the kissing-loop interaction. Complementary molecular dynamics studies indicate that the kissing-loop interaction acts as a dynamic hinge to facilitate the formation of the closed state of the ribozyme. Next, the divide-and-conquer approach for structural investigation of the VS ribozyme was completed by combining NMR and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data. High-resolution structures were determined for both a minimal catalytic domain and a complex between a more extended trans ribozyme and a non-cleavable substrate. By comparing these solution structures to the previously reported crystal structures, we uncovered an important structural rearrangement associated with the formation of the active site. Overall, this work provides a better understanding of the global architecture of the VS ribozyme and how it fulfills its function by dynamic exchange of many conformational states. More generally, the structural and dynamic knowledge generated from this work will help to guide future engineering studies of the VS ribozyme and other functional RNAs.

78	Évaluation de la fidélité des interventions en santé publique dans le cadre des essais randomisés en grappes dans les pays du Sud : revue systématique et étude de cas	Evidence-based public health should be based on the best available evidence to make informed decisions and to implement interventions aimed at maintaining and improving the health and well-being of all people. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are often used in clinical research to test the effects of a drug, therapy, or intervention on an experimental group that may benefit from the intervention, comparing it to a control group that received either a placebo or no intervention treatment. Although the debate persists, randomized controlled trials are an important and objectively high quality method for evaluating the effectiveness of health interventions. Due to multiple factors, cluster randomized trials (CRTs) are widely used to assess the delivery of health services and public health interventions. In this type of trial, it is no longer individuals who are randomized, but groups of individuals such as families, doctors, and village communities who receive the intervention. These interventions may differ during implementation as a result of various factors related to the complexity of the intervention design, context, participants, and stakeholders involved. These factors should be considered at the time of assessment and before replication in other contexts. Implementation fidelity assessment, a key tool in process evaluation, examines study processes to assess the extent to which the intervention was carried out as originally intended. The fidelity of implementation is an essential part of the scale-up process.  This thesis aimed to examine the fidelity of implementation of public health interventions in the context of cluster randomized trials, to determine whether the interventions implemented under a controlled model should consider this type of evaluation to strengthen their results and facilitate their replication on a large scale. This thesis has two parts: a systematic review and a single case study with three units of analysis using a mixed triangulated approach. The first article assessed the implementation fidelity of public health interventions in the context of cluster randomized trials. The systematic review highlighted the finding that public health interventions implemented under this model did not systematically consider this type of evaluation, that the way of doing it was very heterogeneous, and that the evaluation was not adequately documented. The second and third articles were the research findings of the evaluation of an intervention, using a case study as the research method, that was conducted to first examine the plausibility of the intervention theory and to better understand the design and context of the intervention being evaluated, and second, to evaluate implementation fidelity and its acceptability among the participants with the aim of making improvements (if necessary) before large-scale replication. The evaluation of the case study highlighted several key findings. First, the results of the evaluation reflected that the underlying theory and model of the public health intervention were well designed to achieve the desired results. The evaluation provided key points and actions to consider during intervention development to serve hard-to-reach communities and improve health outcomes. Further, it was shown that the results demonstrated a high degree of implementation fidelity. The clarity of the theory of the intervention, the motivation and commitment of the stakeholders as well as the periodic meetings of supervisors with the field team largely explained the high level of fidelity obtained. Contextual factors such as geographical distance to the intervention, access to a mobile phone, level of education, and gender norms contributed to the heterogeneity of the participation of the intervention target group. Finally, this evaluation underlined the finding that the mobile platform coupled with community mobilization, both key components of the intervention, were well received by the participants and may be an effective means of improving health knowledge and changing health-related behaviors.  This thesis contributes to the development of methodological knowledge concerning the evaluation of the fidelity of implementation of public health interventions by identifying gaps in this field, and by suggesting a tool that facilitates advancing this evaluation practice. This thesis also contributes to the strengthening of research in implementation sciences, and empirically provides key elements essential to assess the fidelity of the implementation of this type of intervention using CRT studies and evaluation of this fidelity, which is the subject of this doctoral research.

79	"Impact of deoxynivalenol (DON) contaminated feed on intestinal
integrity and immune response in swine"	This study was performed to characterize the influence of consuming DON naturally contaminated feeds on pig's intestinal immune defenses, antibody response and cellular immunity. Sixteen 4-week-old piglets were randomly allocated to two dietary treatments: control diet or diet contaminated with 3.5 mg DON/kg. At days 7 and 21, animals were immunized with ovalbumin (OVA). On day 42, intestinal samples were collected for measurement of gene expression involved in immune response, oxidative status and barrier function. Primary IgG antibody response to OVA was increased in pigs fed DON diet compared to control animals. In the ileum of pigs fed DON diet, claudin, occludin, and vimentin genes involved in integrity and barrier function were down-regulated compared to controls. Results also revealed that expression of two chemokines (IL-8, CXCL10), interferon-γ, and major antioxidant glutathione peroxidase 2 (GPX-2) were up-regulated whereas expression of genes encoding enzymatic antioxidants including GPX-3, GPX-4 and superoxide dismutase 3 (SOD-3) were down-regulated in pigs fed DON-contaminated diet. These results strongly suggest that ingestion of DON naturally contaminated feed impaired intestinal barrier and immunological functions by modulating expression of genes coding for proteins involved in tight junctions, tissue remodelling, inflammatory reaction, oxidative stress reaction and immune response.

80	Effet des médicaments immunomodulateurs sur la progression de la sclérose en plaques et l’utilisation des soins	Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease that can impact on the quality of life of patients in multiple ways. Objectives: The main goal of this thesis is the modelling of the temporal aspects of MS and its treatment. The specific goals of the thesis are: 1) To estimate the long-term effect of immunomodulatory drugs on the progression and the disease activity of MS; 2) To describe, at the population level, the evolution of health services related to MS and to estimate the effect of age at diagnosis on the use of health services for MS; 3) To assess the propensity of group-based trajectory modelling to detect the number of trajectories, the shape of trajectories and the number of subjects in each group of trajectories; 4) To propose a new graphical representation to visualize longitudinal patterns of medication dose and apply it to an immunomodulator used for treating MS patients. Methods: The analysis of objectives 1 and 4 were carried out using data from patients with a diagnosis of MS treated at the Montreal MS clinic, CHUM. The study was based on information collected during the clinical follow-up of patients between September 1975 and December 2016. The socio-demographic characteristics, reproductive history in women, disease progression, comorbidities and medications were collected at each medical visit. For objective 2, the Québec Birth Cohort on Immunity and Health was used. The individuals in this cohort were born between 1970 and 1974 and follow-up was carried out until 2014 using administrative health and demographic databases. Socio-demographic variables and information regarding the use of health services for MS were obtained for everyone. For objective 3, data were generated based on scenario from the literature. The analyses carried out include the use of marginal structural models (objective 1), generalized additive models (objective 2) and group-based trajectory methods (objectives 3 and 4). Results: The results showed that the use of interferon-beta and glatiramer acetate is associated with a decrease in the rate of progression of disability and relapses. We also found some differences in neurologist and general practitioner visit rates between people diagnosed with MS before age 29 and those diagnosed later. In addition, we have shown the importance of using several statistical criteria in order to assess the adequacy of groups of trajectories. Conclusions:  The use of several variables for the outcomes in the first two objectives gave us a holistic view of the treatment, care and progression of MS. This thesis also makes recommendations for the good use of the trajectory modelling and proposes a graphic alternative to visualize patterns of medication dose.

81	Knowledge translation in public health, a case study in Manguinhos, Brazil	Knowledge translation (KT) is a collaborative process between knowledge producers (mostly researchers) and knowledge users (communities and decision-makers) involving many elements like synthesis, dissemination, and sharing. This thesis' main objectives are to understand KT in different research projects and management practices and propose a KT roadmap adapted to the Brazilian context. The three specific objectives pursued were to: i) describe three projects as examples of three different modalities of KT, ii) perform a post hoc analysis of the KT actions and strategies implemented by three projects of the PDTSP-Teias network in the period from 2009 to 2013, and iii) verify how participation in the PDTSP-Teias network facilitated KT between knowledge producers and knowledge users. To this end, this thesis examines KT practices between health promotion research and health practice in the Program for Technological Development and Innovation in Public Health/Programa de Desenvolvimento e Inovação Tecnológica em Saúde Pública (PDTSP-Teias network). An existing KT plan from the Quebec Public Health Institute (Institut national de santé publique du Québec - INSPQ) was employed as a theoretical framework to orient the deductive-inductive approach used to generate and analyze documents, interviews, and focus group materials. Methods: This thesis used a retrospective qualitative multiple case study with three cases nested in the PDTSP-Teias network. The focus was on relevant questions concerning KT in health promotion in Brazil, such as i) what KT approaches did the PDTSP-Teias network adopt, ii) what KT actions and strategies did the three projects of the PDTSP-Teias network implement, and iii) how did participation in the PDTSP-Teias network facilitate KT between knowledge users and knowledge producers. The empirical data included document analysis (reports, books, and scientific papers), semi-structured interviews with knowledge producers (N=9), and one focus group with knowledge users (N=4 participants). The interview guide addressed three sets of questions: project development, KT product elaboration, and interaction between knowledge producers and knowledge users. Results: Regarding the first objective, we were able to distinguish different KT expertise, approaches, and practices of the research groups. From this initial analysis, examples of three different KT practices were identified as Predominantly, Moderately, and Hardly or Not at all. These examples were then analyzed using the eight dimensions proposed by the theoretical framework. The second objective found that six of the eight dimensions analyzed seemed to be better integrated in the projects: D1 Analysis of the Context and Users’ Needs, D2 Knowledge to be Translated, D3 Knowledge about the Knowledge Users, D4 KT Partners, D5 KT Strategies, and D6 Overall KT Approach. However, two dimensions were less well-integrated: D7 KT Evaluation and D8 Resources. The third objective allowed us to see that the lack of KT project evaluation, issues related to KT projects financial resources, lack of organizational and political support addressed to KT projects, and lack of conceptual KT tools to implement KT projects are barriers to KT in Brazil. Nevertheless, albeit with some limits, participation in the PDTSP-Teias network seems to have facilitated KT practices. These results provided a description and an in-depth analysis of the complexity of KT practices in areas of high social vulnerability and contributed to a better understanding of KT practices in Brazil. Conclusion: Considering how the cases were characterized, it can be concluded that KT practices can be quite different even in a similar context and research conditions. These contrasting KT practices may be due to the absence of a suitable conceptual KT tool. Such a tool can fill the gap in Brazil's KT approaches and strategies. Thus, the adaptation of the INSPQ KT plan can allow the evolution of the dialogue between knowledge producers and knowledge users in research projects, understand the context, and contribute to the validation and adoption of KT products. These changes would benefit the change in knowledge, attitudes, and behavior of the different groups involved. Lastly, this thesis offers a seminal adaptation of the INSPQ KT plan to the Brazilian context.

82	Characterization of oral pain in cats after dental extractions in a multidisciplinary approach	Oral disease is one of the most commonly reported diseases in veterinary medicine, and tooth extractions are commonly required as the treatment. The procedure, however, is invasive, and long-term pain management is necessary. In veterinary medicine, opioids, local anesthetic blocks and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are administered as perioperative analgesic intervention. Behavioral signs of oral disease-induced pain have not been systematically investigated in cats, and the current knowledge is mostly based on anecdotal evidence or studies performed in other species. It is not known how oral disease and the treatment (i.e. tooth extractions) can affect perioperative food intake, pain scores, additional analgesic requirements and behaviors in cats. Also, it is not known if a facial expression-based pain scale (Feline Grimace Scale: FGS) could be used for oral pain assessment as well. The objectives of this PhD program were: 1) to identify the specific behaviors associated with oral disease by using video assessment, and to verify their correlation with the real-time pain scores, 2) to assess the impact of oral disease and pain on food intake and feeding-related behaviors, 3) to determine the effects of oral disease treatment on behavior, pain scores and food intake, 4) to assess the inter-rater reliability of the FGS in cats undergoing dental extractions and 5) to evaluate the analgesic efficacy and adverse events of a high-concentration formulation of buprenorphine hydrochloride formulation (Simbadol, 1.8 mg/mL) in comparison with a standard buprenorphine hydrochloride formulation (Vetergesic, 0.3 mg/mL) as part of a multimodal regimen in cats undergoing dental extractions. The hypotheses were: 1) specific behaviors associated with oral disease would be identified and correlated with real-time pain scores, 2) cats with severe oral disease would have lower food intake and higher pain scores, and require rescue analgesia when compared with cats with no/minimal oral disease, 3) treatment of oral disease would reduce the prevalence of specific behaviors and pain scores and improve food consumption of these animals, 4) the FGS scores scored by different raters would be reliable in cats undergoing dental extractions and 5) both Simbadol and Vetergesic would produce similar postoperative pain scores, adverse events and timing and prevalence of rescue analgesia when using the Glasgow Composite Measure Pain Scale-Feline (CMPS-F). The project was divided into two studies and four articles (study 1: articles 1-3, study 2: article 4): 1) investigation of pain scores, rescue analgesia requirements and the amount of food intake in cats undergoing oral treatment, 2) investigation of the pain-induced specific behaviors related to oral pain in cats undergoing oral treatment, 3) investigation of inter-rater reliability of FGS in cats undergoing oral treatment, and 4)  comparison of the analgesic efficacy of two dosage regimens using two different concentrations of buprenorphine in cats undergoing dental extractions. In article 1, twenty-four cats were equally divided into minimal (minimal dental treatment) or severe (multiple dental extractions) oral disease groups based on a dental scoring system which involved the number and location of teeth extraction and hospitalized for 7 days (admission on day 0, oral examination, radiographs and treatment under general anesthesia on day 1 and discharge on day 6). During hospitalization, pain scores based on CMPS-F, the prevalence of rescue analgesia (CMPS-F ≥ 5/20), dry and soft food intake (%) during periods of 3 minutes and 2 hours, daily soft food intake and serum inflammatory cytokines were analyzed and compared. In article 2, cats were filmed remotely for 10 min throughout the study at different time points (total of 36h of video recording). The videos consisted of four parts namely general, playing, feeding and post-feeding behaviors. The duration and frequency of different behaviors based on an ethogram were analyzed. In article 3, ninety-one image captures (i.e. screenshots) from videos filmed at days 1 (postoperative 6 hours) and 6 for article 2 and videos filmed before/after rescue analgesia were included. The FGS comprises five action units (AU): eyes, ears, muzzle, whiskers and head position. The FGS scores of the images were independently scored by four blinded raters. Inter-rater reliability of each AU and total FGS scores and the effect of the caregiver’s presence were evaluated. In study 2 (article 4), twenty-three cats undergoing tooth extractions were included. Cats randomly received either Simbadol (1.8 mg/mL; 0.24 mg/kg SC, every 24h, n = 11) or Vetergesic (0.3 mg/mL; 0.02 mg/kg IM, every 8h, n = 12) throughout the study. They were admitted on day 0, underwent oral examination, radiographs and treatment under general anesthesia on day 1 and discharged on day 4. Sedation and pain were scored using the dynamic interactive visual analog scale (day 1) and CMPS-F¬, respectively. Sedation and pain scores and the prevalence of rescue analgesia (CMPS-F ≥ 5/20) and resentment (defined as any type of escape behavior associated with aversion to drug administration) were analyzed. The studies found that the pain scores and the prevalence of rescue analgesia were significantly increased, and dry and soft food intakes were significantly decreased in cats with severe disease when compared with those with minimal disease, and the oral disease influences inflammatory cytokines and induces the specific behaviors. FGS is a reliable tool for the assessment of oral pain and is not affected by the caregiver’s presence. Pain scores and the prevalence of rescue analgesia in cats administered Simbadol were not significantly different from those administered Vetergesic, and some cats administered Vetergesic developed resentment to the administration of the drug, which was not significantly different from those administered Simbadol. Long-term analgesia is required after dental extractions in cats with severe oral disease. A decrease in food intake and specific behaviors identified in the studies could be used to differentiate painful versus pain-free cats in clinical practice. The FGS is a reliable tool for pain assessment in cats undergoing dental extractions. Simbadol produced similar analgesic effects to Vetergesic without resentment during drug administration.

83	Étude exploratoire sur le travail en équipe d’étudiants dans l’atelier de design : vers un modèle d’évaluation pour l’apprentissage basé sur la théorie de l’activité et l’apprentissage expansif	This thesis proposes an exploratory study on teamwork practices of design students in the context of project-based learning (in the domains of product and service design, interior design, urbanism, etc.). This study aims to develop a model of assessment for learning teamwork.  For the past few decades, teamwork has been integrated within most design curricula. These social learning experiences place students in authentic situations, but recurring challenges keep emerging regarding their educational integration. We aim to enhance our understanding of assessment, which has a crucial influence on learning experiences. Based on a literature review on teamwork dynamics, the research is structured in two stages. Firstly, the research focuses on better understanding team learning experiences. Secondly, we seek to identify guidelines to enhance assessment for learning teamwork during design projects. Our research objectives are developed into the following questions: How do students experience their learning process when they work as a team while designing? And how to support the development of teamwork skills? Assessment for learning will guide us in considering assessment as a key aspect to engage learners in judging their performance. Assessment for learning values social externalization over internalization through the zones of development. This position guides toward a theoretical framework based on the activity theory and the theory of expansive learning. The combination of these frameworks offers a strong theoretical structure based on collectivity, mediation, and orientation toward an expansive object. Expansive learning sees learning as moving from an abstract understanding to concrete actions to improve the system’s initial state. The adoption of an interventionist approach, as proposed by activity theory, will redefine the researcher’s role to encourage participants to take action. The methodological strategy is organized around the team projects of 22 students from the Faculty of environmental design of University of Montreal (Canada). The data was collected from multiple case studies over few weeks of teamwork. It was gathered through weekly questionnaires and interviews. Using these complementary qualitative tools, participants shared their experiences by discussing their processes. A multiphase strategy allowed for simultaneous data collection and analysis.  The first stage of analysis uncovers the characteristics of the learners’ lived teamwork experiences. In total, 33 characteristics and their respective factors were organized into the 5 categories of our model entitled: “zone of proximal development for teamwork skills”, structured according to training levels. The second part of the analysis concentrates on the theoretical validation of the model by enriching the model with the components to instruct and to assess (according to the stage of the object, types of knowledge, task qualities, learners’ capacities, and types of regulation). Finally, these guidelines are tested in regard to expansive learning by looking closely at the challenges and tensions experienced by the participants to translate each participant’s cognitive journey. This study seeks to contribute to the proposition of a coherent pedagogical framework in accordance with training levels and the basics of the discipline. Our model offers a pedagogical structure that is constructive and dynamic as it brings new knowledge to the student while being guided by an expansive structure towards collaborative design. The proposed framework is built on the reflective journey of students on themselves and others, solicited for greater autonomy. The contributions of this study are pertinent for design students, practitioners, and teachers. They seek an enhanced coherence with the discipline supported by an active perspective for better preparation of students to their future professional work environment.

84	First report and genomic characterization of a bovine-like coronavirus causing enteric infection in an odd-toed non ruminant species (Indonesian tapir, Acrocodia indica) during an outbreak of winter dysentery in a zoo	Bovine Coronavirus (BCoV) is associated with three distinct clinical syndromes in cattle i.e. neonatal diarrhea, hemorrhagic diarrhea in adults (the so-called winter dysentery syndrome, WD) and respiratory infections in cattle of different ages. In addition, bovine-like CoVs have been detected in various species including domestic and wild ruminants. However, bovine-like CoVs have not been reported so far in odd-toed ungulates. We describe an outbreak of WD associated with a bovine-like CoV affecting several captive wild ungulates, including Indonesian tapirs (Acrocodia indica) an odd-toed ungulate species (Perissodactyla) which, with even-toed ungulates species (Artiodactyla) form the clade Euungulata (Graur et al, 14). Genomic characterization of the CoV revealed that it was closely related to BCoVs previously reported in America. This case illustrates the adaptability of bovine-like CoVs to new species and the necessity of continued surveillance of bovine-like CoVs in various species.

85	Le modèle bayésien de l’intégration identitaire : vers une approche dynamique des processus internes du soi	Societies grow and modify themselves continually. It becomes more and more difficult for people to avoid social change. When social change does show up, people need to modify who they are as to adapt themselves to their new environment and experience well-being. Several studies propose stages that lead to identity integration, but these processes remain limited to a static perspective. Static processes cannot explain how people actualize their identities on an iterative basis every day. The goal of the present study is to develop a new dynamic conceptualization of identity integration. To do so, we merge two fields of research: social psychology and fields of computed neuroscience and machine learning as to create our model: The Bayesian Model of Identity Integration (BMII). We discuss and test the BMII in two studies. In the first study, we describe the theoretical basis of our model along with two examples of how the BMII could explain a personal and a social identity integration. In the second study, we test several parts of the BMII in the context of cannabis legalization in Canada. Such context may have changed people’s integration of cannabis into their identity of Canadians. We measure cannabis integration of 1682 Canadians over three measurement time questionnaires. The BMII is used on all three questionnaires and produce scores that aim to predict cannabis integration at time 3. Regression tests between predicted scores and actual scores of cannabis integration at time 3 shows positive predictions. Theoretical, methodological and practical implications are discussed.

86	Changements développementaux dans la survenue d'épisodes de somnambulisme chez les patients somnambules adultes	Far from being benign, somnambulistic episodes can be frequent and/or severe and with high risk of injury. Episodes may also be accompanied by sleep mentation with variable degrees of retrograde amnesia. The present thesis investigated how somnambulistic episodes unfold over time, a topic that remains understudied. Adult sleepwalkers with a diagnosis of primary somnambulism and a childhood onset of the disorder (n = 113) were assessed for changes in frequency of their episodes, recall of episode-related sleep mentation and aggressive episodes during childhood, adolescence and adulthood. Additionally, sleepwalkers (n= 52) with childhood- onset of sleep terrors (a NREM parasomnia commonly experienced by sleepwalkers) were assessed for developmental changes in sleep terror frequency. The frequency of somnambulistic episodes remained unchanged during childhood and adolescence before increasing into adulthood. An opposite trend was observed for the frequency of sleep terrors. The frequency of aggressive somnambulistic episodes and of sleep mentation associated with somnambulism increased from childhood to adolescence and into adulthood. By contrast, the recall of sleep mentation associated with sleep terrors did not change over time. Additionally, a higher frequency of aggressive somnambulistic episodes predicted a higher frequency of sleep mentation associated with somnambulism. These findings were similar between men and women. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that in chronic sleepwalkers, sleep mentation associated with somnambulistic episodes increases with age while episodes worsen in frequency and severity from childhood to adulthood.

87	"The ""Effect of Education"" on kinship ties in Jane Austen's Mansfield Park"	Drawing on Mary Wollstonecraft’s and John Locke’s philosophies of female and childhood education, respectively, this thesis examines “the effect of education” (Austen 211) on kinship ties in Jane Austen’s Mansfield Park. Like many novelists and writers of conduct books during her lifetime, Austen addresses the state of education in the early nineteenth century. She proposes a more gender-neutral education that revolves around reason and virtue, like Locke and Wollstonecraft, and involves personal development and lifelong learning, which allows the individual to develop a sense of self and consequently form strong interpersonal bonds. Inhabiting a society undergoing rapid transformations, Austen also discusses the influence of social learning on the individual and their relationships. The first chapter addresses childhood education within the home and family and examines the ways various types of learning are instrumental to identity formation and determine relationships. This chapter also compares and contrasts Austen’s conception of education with Wollstonecraft’s and Locke’s. The second chapter considers the interdependent relationship between the individual, the family, and society and discusses in which respect power dynamics in home and country determine interpersonal relations. This chapter focuses on the inequality and oppression inherent in British colonialism, slavery, and female subjugation in the early nineteenth century, which hinder the development of profound attachments between individuals, as shown in the novel.

88	Analyse de contaminants d’intérêt émergent dans l’Estuaire et le Golfe du Saint-Laurent par chromatographie liquide couplée à la spectrométrie de masse haute résolution	Contaminants of Emerging Concern (CECs) have been increasingly studied since recent years, for instance in aquatic ecosystems. However, there exist significant knowledge gaps regarding their occurrence and distribution in complex hydrological systems, including their vertical distribution in different water bodies. Seasonal variations between summer and winter conditions are also difficult to establish because of the rigorous winter weather conditions in Canada, restricting the accessibility of samples. Thus, this project focused on the study of 90 CECs, including pesticides, pharmaceuticals and anthropogenic markers, hormones, and perfluorinated substances in an oceanographic environment, namely the St. Lawrence Estuary and Gulf (SLEG). Two expeditions were conducted under winter conditions (winters 2019 and 2020) and one under summer conditions (summer 2019). These expeditions first assessed the spatial distribution of CECs along the SLEG and, secondly, the seasonal and annual variations of the concentrations associated with the different temperatures, salinities, ice cover, degradation processes or seasonal river flow. In addition, sampling at multiple depths during the winter of 2020 allowed for documenting the vertical profiles of CECs throughout the SLEG. Finally, the filtration of large volumes of surface water during the winter of 2020 allowed for the evaluation of the CECs adsorbed onto suspended particle matter (SPM) and consequently, the partitioning between dissolved and particulate phases, influenced by salinity and SPM variations. Analyses were performed following the development and validation of a new multi-residue method involving ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report the occurrence of emerging contaminants in the SLEG, especially during the winter season and across the water column.

89	Effets de l'activité physique sur l'appétit, l'ingestion alimentaire, l'olfaction et la gustation	Introduction: Overeating, sedentary behaviour and physical inactivity are modifiable and important causes in the development of obesity and related health disorders. It is known that in addition to having beneficial effects on metabolism, exercise increases energy expenditure and helps to maintain the energy balance. Recent studies have shown that exercise may also cause a decrease in caloric intake, leading to better control of the energy balance and may have beneficial health effects, even when practised at low intensity. The objectives of this thesis are to explore the effects of under-studied exercise parameters in weight control by 1) documenting the impact of low to very low intensity tasks (i.e., active workstations) in individuals with excess body weight and on food intake and 2) determining how chemosensory factors related to appetite control are affected by exercise practice relative to rest and in response to various timings of the exercise session.  Methods and results: To address the first research objective, a systematic review was conducted to document the impact of the use of active workstations in individuals with excess body weight (article 1). Nineteen studies were included, of which 12 involved standing workstations, 9 involved treadmill workstations, 3 involved a cycle device, and one involved a stepping device. The results indicate that these workstations are effective in increasing work-hour energy expenditure and reducing sedentary behaviour. An experimental study was conducted to determine the impact of a standing workstation, compared to a conventional sitting workstation, on dietary intake. Thirty-six men and women were randomly assigned to a standing or seated workstation (article 2). They took part in cognitive tasks for about 1h30min on the assigned workstation and were then served an ad libitum snack. The results of the study indicate that there is no significant difference in dietary intake between participants who took part in the sitting condition (427.8 ± 301.8 kcal) and those who were standing (461.2 ± 272.8 kcal; p=0.472). To meet the second objective, we first observed the effect of high-intensity exercise on chemosensory perceptions related to food intake (article 3). Fourteen men took part in random order in two visits consisting of A) a long sedentary break and B) a short sedentary break followed by an exercise session (running at 70% of VO2 max). Upon arrival (8:30), as well as immediately before dinner (11:40), they were subjected to olfactory and taste tests. Then, an ad libitum buffet was served to them at noon. The results showed no significant difference in dietary intake between sedentary and exercise conditions (p=0.888). These results are consistent with the lack of difference in olfactory and gustatory perceptions between conditions (all p >0.05). The concept of timing is relatively new to the field of physical activity and more particularly to the control of the energy balance. The objective of the last project (article 4) was to observe whether the timing of exercise represents a parameter of interest that can optimize the appetite-suppressing effect via chemosensory perceptions. In a protocol similar to article 3, twelve men were subjected in random order to two conditions: A) an exercise session (30 min at 70% of VO2 max) followed by a sedentary break (90 minutes) or B) the sedentary break followed by the exercise session. They took part in olfactory and taste tests upon arrival (8:30 AM) and before the ad libitum dinner (11:40 AM). The results indicate that the timing of the exercise had no impact on olfactory (all p >0.05) and gustatory (all p >0.05) perceptions, or total dietary intake (p=0.459). Conclusion: In conclusion, our work is the first to show that in acute situations the use of a standing workstation does not increase food consumption during a subsequent meal. Moreover, the high-intensity exercise did not result in acute food compensation at the subsequent meal, regardless of the timing of the session. Contrary to the hypotheses put forward, the exercise alone or the timing of the session did not modify olfactory and gustatory perceptions.	physical activity , anorexigenic effect , taste , smell , active workstation	en	25414.0
90	The role of coping style in the relationship between stressful life events and depressive symptoms in young adults	Introduction: Identifying potential mechanisms underpinning the association between stressful life events and depression is key to developing targeted public health interventions. To cope with stressful experiences, individuals adopt coping styles which are differentially associated with depressive symptoms. However, no study has assessed whether coping style mediates and/or moderates this association. Objectives: To examine each of problem-focused, emotion-focused and avoidant coping style as a mediator and/or moderator of the association between stressful life events and depressive symptoms in young adults. Methods: The Nicotine Dependence in Teens (NDIT) is a longitudinal study including 1294 participants recruited in grade 7 from 10 high schools in Montreal Quebec between 1999–2000. The current analysis uses data (n = 782) from self-report questionnaires collected post-high school between 2011–2012. Using VanderWeele’s four-way decomposition approach, the total effect of stressful life events on depressive symptoms was decomposed into components representing moderation only, mediation only, mediated interaction and neither mediation nor moderation by each coping style. Results: We observed moderation by problem-focused coping (β ̂(95%CI)=-1.51(-2.22, -1.06)) and mediation (0.15(0.05, 0.17)) and moderation (1.16(1.05, 1.68) by emotion-focused coping.  An avoidant coping style neither mediated nor moderated this association. Thus, individuals reporting more problem-focused coping experienced fewer depressive symptoms when exposed to more stressful life events; those reporting more emotion-focused coping experienced more depressive symptoms. Conclusion: These results suggest that preventive interventions for depression in young adults should include components to reinforce problem-focused coping strategies and should minimize negative emotion-focused coping strategies.

91	Voir l'espace architectural en coupe : exploration du rôle de la coupe dans la conception de l'espace moderne	Seeing architectural space in section exploration of the section in the conception of modern space. Progress of digital technology allows hyper-developing of representation modes free from instruments which are more and more considered as obsolete to produce new spaces. However, referring to the spread which is given to the section when presenting projects, or in teaching practices, it is often described as a device for stimulating, designing and building. This theorical research observes the use and the status of section at the end of the twentieth century, at the dawning of modelling development. According to Jacques Guillerme and Hélène Vérin , section appears within surveys and studies of antic ruins as a physic reality, the one of a building truncated by its own partial collapse. Many theorists, as Barbara Stafford and Robin Evans , make a connection between section and dissection as opening modes on the inside and by the development of both practices during the Eighteenth century. According to Robin Evans, to reveal the essence of the building is the real function of architectural drawing. The approach is to explore the drawing and the evolution of sections through traces of the designing process, in order to understand how section act as a “générateur” of the project. The research question may be : How, and to which spread, architectural section has a generating dimension of space and it intervene in the elaboration process of modern houses designed after the “Resolving the project in space” ? Based on archives drawings a reference corpus of six modern emblematic houses sections designed between twenties and sixties have been observed in their representation and space. Six other emblematic houses sections conceived from seventies to two thousand ten have been observed through a comparative analysis with the reference corpus. The expected results are to detect the spatial issues raised by the section, to extend its agreed definition as a representation tool to a designing tool and to settle a methodology for analysing cut space.

92	Les avancées et les limites de l’essai néodéveloppementaliste au Brésil : le projet socio-économique des gouvernements petistas (2003-2015)	This dissertation problematizes the ins and outs of the development strategy adopted in Brazil by the Workers' Party between 2003 and 2015, called neo developmentalism, considering the country's peripheral position in the international system. It seeks to demonstrate that the Workers' Party governments, even though they have provided the social protection guaranteed by the 1988 Constitution and have made significant social advances, have not been able to break with the neoliberal logic that has been hegemonic in the country since the 1980s. To this end, we return to the discussion of Brazilian development in the 20th century, from the Vargas era (1930) to the end of the military dictatorship (1985). We then discuss the neo-liberal period - which began in the mid-1980s but was consolidated in the 1990s – and its consequences, as well as the rise to power of the Workers' Party and its attempt to resume national development. Finally, we discuss the impossibility of neo developmentalism being able to generate real changes with respect to neoliberalism, since it not only seeks to reconcile itself with the current hegemonic logic, but also reinforces it.	development , neo developmentalism , neo liberalism , macroeconomic policies , social policies	en	25384.0
93	A simplified approach to extravascular lung water assessment using point-of-care ultrasound in patients with end-stage chronic renal failure undergoing hemodialysis	Background: Fluid overload leading to pulmonary congestion is an important issue in patients undergoing hemodialysis. This study aimed to determine if a simplified method of extravascular lung water assessment using ultrasound provided clinically relevant information.  Methods: This prospective study recruited 47 patients from a single hemodialysis center. Pulmonary ultrasound was performed before and after 2 hemodialysis sessions in 28 regions on the thorax. The B-line score was defined as the percentage regions where B-lines were present.  Results: When B-lines were detected before hemodialysis, a significant relationship was found between fluid removal and the change in B-line score. Patients with a B-line score of ≥21.4% (4th quartile) after the second hemodialysis session were more likely to be hospitalized for pulmonary edema or acute coronary syndrome.  Conclusions: A simplified pulmonary assessment using ultrasound provides relevant information about pulmonary congestion in hemodialysis patients and identifies patients at risk of hospitalization for heart-related problems.

94	Nonspecific interactions in biomedical applications	Nonspecific interactions play a major role in the microscale functioning of biological units. Exploiting these interactions in design and application of biomedical systems has been beneficial in different branches of biomedicine. In this review, recently designed biomedical systems that function mainly, or partially, based on nonspecific interactions, including but not limited to electrostatic, hydrophobic, and steric interactions, are discussed. The focus will be on the application of these interactions in biolubrication, bioadhesion and antifouling, drug delivery, and tissue engineering. The information gathered in this review can be helpful in guiding the readers in the direction that the field has been following in the past few years.

95	Positive communication in a catastrophic crisis : the mixed effects of COVID-19 on the tone of Canadian governments’ media coverage	Crisis management strategies have taken a new significance amidst the COVID-19 crisis. In Canada, while the tone of media coverage of political leaders is usually stable over time, the pandemic has provoked variation that provides an opportunity to test the effect of leaders’ crisis management strategies on the tone of media coverage. Using a unique dataset of online front-page articles from 11 Canadian media outlets, an automated textual analysis, and a regression discontinuity design, this paper estimates how Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Quebec Premier François Legault’s COVID-19 early crisis management affected the media coverage devoted to them. Results show that Legault’s crisis management had a short-term positive effect on his media coverage, while Trudeau’s effect is null. These findings raise questions about the link between media, decision-makers and public opinion.	Political communication , Media coverage , COVID-19 crisis	en	25348.0
96	Photoactive/passive molecular glass blends : an efficient strategy to optimize azomaterials for surface relief grating inscription	: Irradiation of azomaterials causes various photophysical and photomechanical effects that can be exploited for the preparation of functional materials such as surface relief gratings (SRGs). Herein, we develop and apply an efficient strategy to optimize the SRG inscription process by decoupling, for the first time, the important effects of the azo content and glass transition temperature (Tg). We prepare blends of a photoactive molecular glass functionalized with the azo Dis‐ perse Red 1 (gDR1) with a series of analogous photopassive molecular glasses. Blends with 10 and 40 mol% of gDR1 are completely miscible, present very similar optical properties, and cover a wide range of Tg from below to well above ambient temperature. SRG inscription experiments show that the diffraction efficiency (DE), residual DE and initial inscription rate reach a maximum when Tg is 25 to 40 °C above ambient temperature for low to high azo content, respectively. Indeed, for a fixed 40 mol% azo content, choosing the optimal Tg enables doubling the SRG inscription rate and increasing DE sixfold. Moreover, a higher azo content enables higher DE for a similar Tg. Spectroscopy measurements indicate that the photo‐ orientation of DR1 and its thermal stability are maximal with Tg around 70 °C, independent of the azo content. We conclude that the SRG potential of azomaterials depends on their capability to photo‐orient but that the matrix rigidity eventually limits the inscription kinetics, leading to an optimal Tg that depends on the azo content. This study exposes clear material design guidelines to optimize the SRG inscription process and the photoactivity of azomaterials.

97	Raman spectroscopy of individual poly(ethylene oxide) electrospun fibers : effect of the collector on molecular orientation	Electrospun fibers are complex polymeric materials with a typical diameter of a few hundred nanometers that are often frozen in out-of-equilibrium states due to the fast solvent evaporation and high elongational forces during the process. Their molecular orientation, and the parameters affecting it, is a critical (although challenging) parameter to characterize because it allows improving and tuning many properties. In this paper, we characterize molecular orientation of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) fibers produced with the three most common collectors by applying our recently developed Raman spectroscopy methodologies to probe individual fibers. Results reveal an extremely high orientation in all PEO fibers and, surprisingly, the absence of any effect of the collector on molecular orientation. This contrasts with reports by several other research groups in the context of studies on bundles of fibers, as well as with our WAXD results on the same fibers. It is concluded that studies on bundles composed of thousands of imperfectly aligned fibers lead to a systematic underestimation of the orientation and to apparent results that prevent us from drawing clear conclusions on the molecular impact of processing parameters when they generate different levels of macroscopic alignment. This work highlights how Raman spectroscopy helps to overcome one of the major challenges in the field, the characterization of individual fibers, to reach a better understanding and control of electrospun fibers properties.

98	Long-term randomized clinical trial evaluating the effects of fixture surface acid-etching and machined collar design on bone healing	Objectives: An implant with an acid-etched fixture surface and internal-hex collar may achieve greater osseointegration. The goal of this research was to study the effects on long-term bone healing of fixture surface acid-etching and machined collar design.  Method and materials: Three two-part implant types were compared: standard Brånemark (with an external-hex 1.2 mm long machined flat collar), Swede-Vent (a copy of the Brånemark design, with an identical collar but a fixture surface acid-etched to 1 to 3 µm), and Screw-Vent (with a fixture surface acid-etched identically to that of Swede-Vent, but a longer internal-hex machined flat collar that did not require countersinking). Fifty-eight subjects each received the three types in alternate fashion at five sites between mental foramen, and a fixed full-arch prosthesis. Abutment-implant interface/microgap (MG) was placed at the crest, and first bone-to-implant contact point-to microgap (fBIC-MG) was measured at mesial and distal sides of each implant. Mean fBIC-MG values were compared after 15 to 20 years of function. Statistical analysis was based on the mixed linear model with the level of significance set at P < .05 and Bonferroni correction for pairwise comparisons.  Results: Brånemark had less mean marginal bone loss (-1.08 mm, standard error [SE] 0.20) compared with Swede-Vent (-1.28 mm, SE 0.20), but pairwise comparisons showed that the difference was not statistically significant (mean difference of 0.20 mm, P = .662). Screw-Vent had the greatest loss (-1.92 mm, SE 0.20), and pairwise comparisons showed that the difference was statistically significant compared with Brånemark and Swede-Vent (difference ≥ 0.64 mm, P < .001).  Conclusion: According to accepted standards for osseointegration, all three implant types achieved very acceptable long-term results. However, while Brånemark had the least bone loss, the implant with the acid-etched fixture surface and longer internal-hex collar design had the greatest loss. Within the confines of this study, shorter collar length of 1.2 mm may be more important to limit long-term bone loss with microgap placed at the crest.

99	Selective isotopic labeling resolves the gel-to-fluid phase transitions of the individual leaflets of a planar-supported phospholipid bilayer	Knowledge of the thermotropic phase behavior of solid-supported bilayer lipid assemblies is essential to mimick the molecular organization and lateral fluidity of cell membranes. The gel-to-fluid phase transitions in a homologous series of single phospholipid bilayers supported on planar silicon substrates were investigated by temperature-controlled atomic force microscopy and attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy to obtain complementary information at the mesoscopic and molecular scales. Symmetric bilayers of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and vertically asymmetric bilayers composed of a leaflet of DPPC and another of acyl-chain-deuterated DPPC (DPPC-d62) were prepared by the Langmuir–Blodgett technique. The selective deuteration of one of the bilayer leaflets enabled the simultaneous monitoring by IR spectroscopy of the acyl chain melting in each leaflet via the spectrally isolated CH2 and CD2 stretching vibrations. Two gel-to-fluid transitions were discerned for both the symmetric and asymmetric bilayers in ultrapure water. The deuterium isotope effect observed in free-standing membranes was maintained for the supported bilayers. IR spectroscopy revealed that the melting of one leaflet promotes the disordering of the acyl chains in the adjacent one. The findings suggest that the two leaflet phase transitions do not evolve in isolation. This work sheds insight into the nature of leaflet–leaflet interactions and the thermodynamic properties of surface-confined phospholipid bilayers.

and tough nanofibers with low crystallinity :
towards next generation nanostructured
superfibers"	Advanced fibers revolutionized structural materials in the second half of the 20th century. However, all high-strength fibers developed to date are brittle. Recently, pioneering simultaneous ultrahigh strength and toughness were discovered in fine (<250 nm) individual electrospun polymer nanofibers (NFs). This highly desirable combination of properties was attributed to high macromolecular chain alignment coupled with low crystallinity. Quantitative analysis of the degree of preferred chain orientation will be crucial for control of NF mechanical properties. However, quantification of supramolecular nanoarchitecture in NFs with low crystallinity in the ultrafine diameter range is highly challenging. Here, we discuss the applicability of traditional as well as emerging methods for quantification of polymer chain orientation in nanoscale one-dimensional samples. Advantages and limitations of different techniques are critically evaluated on experimental examples. It is shown that straightforward application of some of the techniques to sub-wavelength-diameter NFs can lead to severe quantitative and even qualitative artifacts. Sources of such size-related artifacts, stemming from instrumental, materials, and geometric phenomena at the nanoscale, are analyzed on the example of polarized Raman method but are relevant to other spectroscopic techniques. A proposed modified, artifact-free method is demonstrated. Outstanding issues and their proposed solutions are discussed. The results provide guidance for accurate nanofiber characterization to improve fundamental understanding and accelerate development of nanofibers and related nanostructured materials produced by electrospinning or other methods. We expect that the discussion in this review will also be useful to studies of many biological systems that exhibit nanofilamentary architectures and combinations of high strength and toughness.

101	Amélioration de la géométrie des modèles musculosquelettiques de l'épaule	Understanding and treating musculoskeletal disorders of the shoulder requires additional knowledge of the contribution and function of each muscle of the glenohumeral joint. The analysis of muscle and joint forces is an important step in understanding injury mechanisms and pathologies. These muscle forces can be estimated non-invasively using musculoskeletal models. The challenge is to physiologically predict muscle trajectories and moment arms to ensure consistency of muscle forces in musculoskeletal models. The aim of this thesis was to improve muscle geometry in musculoskeletal models of the shoulder by testing several different techniques for implementing muscle trajectories. Our specific objectives were to: (1) improve muscle geometry of rigid multibody models by using transverse constraints; (2) assess the reliability of a finite element model for estimating moment arms and (3) evaluate the sensitivity of moment arm predictions to uncertainties in muscle insertion areas; (4) create a database of 3D moment arms for movements with high ranges of motion; (5) experimentally quantify muscles’ architectural changes between resting state and different levels of isometric contractions. (1) Two rigid multibody models of the rotator cuff were developed: a classic model representing muscles with lines of action in 1D and a 2D model with transverse constraints between lines of action of a single muscle. The 2D model (with transverse constraints) gives a more physiological representation of muscle trajectories and moment arms than the classical 1D model. However, for arm movements beyond 90° of elevation, when the origin and insertion points get closer, moment arms and muscle lengths are misestimated due to the mode’s inability to account for muscle volume deformations. (2) A finite element model of the glenohumeral joint was developed based on medical imaging. Moment arms were computed and compared to the literature and MRI data. Our finite element model produces moment arms consistent with the literature and MRI data. Unlike rigid multibody models, our finite element model accounts for the fact that one muscle can have several actions depending on the position of its line of action relative to the centre of rotation of the joint. (3) The model was used to study moment arm sensitivity: insertion areas of rotator cuff muscles and the deltoid were moved, and associated moment arms have been computed. Results showed that a 10 mm variation in insertion points on the humeral head could cause a muscle to change function (for example performing adduction rather than abduction). (4) The 3D moment arms were assessed on four post-mortem human surrogates during movements with high ranges of motion. Results of the study gave us a better understanding of muscle functions during different movements. The main findings of the study were that the anterior deltoid was the largest flexor and had an adduction component, the median deltoid was a strong abductor, and the posterior deltoid acted in extension. Unlike the deltoid, the infraspinatus and teres minor were the largest external rotators of the shoulder. (5) Experimental measurements were performed on 14 subjects in order to quantify changes in muscle geometry and pennation angles associated with different levels of contraction for the biceps, triceps and deltoid. Pennation angles were measured on subjects using a portable ultrasound system. External muscle deformations were measured with an iPad equipped with a structure sensor. Changes in muscle architecture for the biceps, triceps and deltoid during isometric contractions occurred mostly between 0 and 25% of maximal voluntary contraction (no significant difference was observed between 25 and 50%). Changes were higher for the biceps than other muscles. This thesis evaluated different approaches to model muscle geometry: the approach leading to the most physiological result was the finite element model due to modeling of the interactions between structure and muscle deformations. Additionally, we demonstrated the importance of rigorously estimating input parameters (muscle insertion areas) and of properly evaluating the bio-fidelity of the models developed before using them in clinical contexts. New data was acquired regarding muscle deformations and pennation angles to evaluate models integrating muscle activation.

102	Identification of copper metabolism as a KRAS-specific vulnerability in colorectal cancer	KRAS is amongst the most frequently mutated genes driving human cancers, including ~ 45% of colorectal cancers (CRC). Despite intense efforts to curb its oncogenic potential, mutant KRAS is frequently associated with drug resistance and is extremely challenging to target therapeutically. Cell-surface proteins are often spatially dysregulated in cancers and are attractive therapeutic targets due to their easy accessibility. We performed RNA sequencing of mutant KRAS-expressing intestinal epithelial cells and observed that cells undergoing transformation exhibited dramatic changes in cell surface-coding genes. Therefore, our goal was to identify novel druggable targets expressed at the cell surface of mutant KRAS-transformed cells. Using a cutting-edge cell surface proteomics approach, we identified several differentially expressed proteins at the surface of KRAS-mutant cells compared to wild-type counterparts. We then performed a cell surface based CRISPR/Cas9 screen, which revealed that loss of the copper exporter Atp7a differentially affected the fitness of intestinal epithelial cells, depending on their KRAS status. Interestingly, we found that ATP7A was upregulated in KRAS-mutant cells compared to wild-type counterparts. ATP7A has a dual role in cells; while it is essential for maturation of copper (Cu)-dependent enzymes, ATP7A protects cells from excess Cu-induced toxicity (cuproptosis). In humans, ATP7A mutations result in disorders characterized by systemic deficiencies in Cu transport and levels. In animals and in tissue culture models, including intestinal epithelial cells, intracellular Cu levels are directly correlated with the post-transcriptional abundance of ATP7A. In line with this, we observed that KRAS-mutant CRC cells and tissues had relatively more intracellular Cu, and ATP7A-overexpression protected KRAS-mutant cells from cuproptosis, compared to wild-type counterparts. We also observed that in vivo growth of KRAS-mutant xenografts was reduced when mice were fed a Cu-deficient diet. Cu is utilized by several enzymes that regulate critical cellular functions including mitochondrial respiration, cell motility and proliferation. We show that KRAS-mutant cells were more sensitive to the Cu chelating drug ammonium tetrathiomolybdate (TTM), compared to wild-type cells. Moreover, TTM-treated KRAS-mutant cells displayed reduced activities of Cu-dependent MEK1/2 and mitochondrial electron transport chain enzyme, cytochrome c oxidase (CCO). We were surprised to find that the high-affinity CTR1 importer is downregulated in KRAS-mutant cells, and so we hypothesized that KRAS cells must uptake Cu through alternate means. In accordance with this, we found that macropinocytosis acts as a non-canonical Cu-supply route in KRAS-mutant cells. In vivo, treating cells with the macropinocytosis inhibitor EIPA, inhibited the expression of ATP7A and decreased bioavailable Cu in KRAS xenografts. In conclusion, our results show that KRAS-mutant cells increase Cu and ATP7A levels, likely to support tumorigenesis by elevating cuproenzymatic activity and parallelly dealing with cuproptosis. This study is relevant to cancer as tumor tissues and patients contain higher Cu levels than normal controls. Recent studies have highlighted a potential for repurposing the clinically available copper chelator TTM, which is used to treat Cu disorders. Our results demonstrate that copper bioavailability could be exploited to treat KRAS-mutated CRC with such inhibitors. Future work includes identification of combinatorial strategies that may be synthetic lethal to copper chelation.	Copper , RAS , ATP7A , cell surface , Colorectal Cancer	en	25272.0
103	Implication de la signalisation de la tyrosine kinase Yes dans la carcinogenèse hépatique	Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the first lethal neoplasia of the liver, representing 80 to 90% of cases. Currently, for most patients the therapeutic option only provides modest efficiencies. The high etiological variety and heterogeneity of the tumors as well as the absence of known key oncogenic mediator in the development of this pathology is mainly responsible for the lack of therapeutic option. Based on a genetic screen of the human kinome, we identified the tyrosine kinase Yes as a major player in the proliferation of HCC cells. Yes belongs to the family of Src kinases which control many cellular processes including proliferation, motility and survival. The over-expression or abnormal activation of Yes is detected in many cancers and is often associated with poor prognosis. We have demonstrated in vitro and in vivo the pro-proliferative activity of Yes as well as its oncogenic potential. In particular, in a mouse model of hepatic carcinogenesis induced by diethylnitrosamine, the genetic depletion of Yes completely abolishes the formation of tumors. Thanks to the transcriptional profiles obtained in several cellular models of CHC, we discovered that the activity of Yes is associated with an increase in the gene signatures of the transcriptional regulators YAP and TAZ as well as of the transcriptional factor c-Myc. These observations led to the identification of YAP, TAZ and c-Myc as new substrates for the tyrosine kinase Yes.  We have shown that the phosphorylation of YAP and TAZ by Yes mediates their recruitment into the nucleus associated with an increase in their transcriptional activity. We have also confirmed the importance of YAP and TAZ in the proliferative properties of Yes in various mouse models of hepatocarcinogenesis. Interestingly, we observed that nearly 50% of human CHCs exhibit an abnormal activation of Src kinases that correlates with phosphorylation and activation of YAP.  Moreover, in vitro and in vivo experiments revealed that Yes stabilizes c-Myc. Indeed, the transgenic expression of constitutively active Yes into hepatocytes leads to the accumulation of c-Myc protein at early stages of tumor development and to the induction of several of its target genes at later stages. In addition to their synergistic action, this study suggests that Yes is involved in the oncogenic properties of c-Myc.  Finally, we discovered that Yes kinase plays a role in the progression of fatty liver diseases. Indeed, the progression of the pathology is abolished following the depletion of Yes or the pharmacological inhibition of Src kinases. In addition, the survival of Yes-active tumor cells is associated with the induction of PD-L1/2 immune checkpoints that protect cells from immune elimination.   In conclusion, we have discovered and characterized three new key effectors of the oncogenic tyrosine kinase Yes in HCC. Interestingly, the gene signature induced by Yes can predict the survival of patients with HCC. These data provide strong evidence for targeting the tyrosine kinase Yes in HCC.

104	Adaptation florale aux pollinisateurs : étude des Gesneriaceae antillaises et de l’Impatiente du Cap	The environment has a considerable effect on plants through various abiotic (climate, soil, urbanization) or biotic (pollinators, herbivores) factors. The strong selection pressures exerted by these factors on phenotypic traits often results in adaptations. Pollinators exert selection pressure on floral traits that result in converging adaptations called pollination syndromes. The study of syndromes, as well as the pollination performance of each floral visitor, allows us to better understand the intensity of a/biotic selection pressure and floral evolution. In this thesis, we relied on two plant models: the Gesneriaceae family in the Antilles, and the common Jewelweed, Impatiens capensis Meerb. Due to their pollination strategies and their floral variation, both of these models are suitable for studying floral adaptation to biotic factors, specifically, their pollinators. We were thus able to test the following hypotheses: 1) whether the floral form is explained by the beak shape of pollinating hummingbirds in West Indies Gesnericeae; 2) whether the Gesnericeae Rhytidophyllum bicolor Urb. has a generalist strategy for pollination and whether their different functional types of pollinators have similar pollination performances; 3) whether urbanization affects the floral form of the common Jewelweed, through changes in pollinator communities. To test these hypotheses, geometric morphometric approaches were used (hypotheses 1 and 3), as well as in situ pollination observations, and estimation of the visitation rate (hypotheses 2 and 3). Pollination performance was measured by counting pollen grains deposited on the stigma after each visit, and by measuring the visitation rate. Finally, statistical tests (ANOVA, linear regressions) and multivariate analyses (redundancy analysis, principal component analysis) were carried out on the data obtained to test each hypothesis. The first results show a positive correlation between the length of the corolla of flowers specialized for hummingbirds and the beak length of pollinators. Although less significant, our results of the comparisons of global shapes, obtained by applying geometric morphometry, indicate that this approach is promising for this kind of analysis. We show that the floral form of generalist flowers is impacted by pollinating hummingbirds, albeit in a different way from specialists. For the second hypothesis, our prediction that R. bicolor has a generalist pollination strategy was validated, since this plant is pollinated by hummingbirds, bats and bees. However, faced with the decline in hummingbird populations after Hurricane Matthew hit Haiti in 2016, only the pollination performance of bees and bats could be measured. Our results show that bats are efficient and consistent pollinators of R. bicolor, although the performance of bees is not negligible. Thus, it has been possible to put forward that the generalist pollination strategy seems to be an advantage for plants present in areas subject to fluctuations in their pollinator populations, as can often be the case on hurricane-prone islands. The third study shows that urbanization does not have a direct effect on the flower form of common Jewelweed, but that urbanization does have significant indirect effects through changes caused on pollinator communities. At the six sites sampled, the main pollinators, Bombus sp. Latreille and Apis mellifera Linnaeus, are the same. However, diversity rates show variation between sites, due to the presence of certain species of occasional pollinators in some sites and not in others. These rates are not lower in the most urban sites. Our results indicate that certain floral forms are associated with particular pollinator species. Since different pollinator species have different selection pressures on floral traits, urbanization has an indirect impact on the floral form in the species studied. Through three different studies, this thesis highlighted the impact that the environment can have on floral traits, indirectly, via pollinators. While the second and third studies showed the pressure exerted by pollinators on floral traits in different cases of habitat disturbance, the first study helped to better highlight the remarkable adaptation of flowers to their pollinators, even for generalist species in pollination.

105	Compréhension intégrée de quatre syndromes génétiques impliqués dans la déficience intellectuelle via des biomarqueurs électrophysiologiques, les manifestations comportementales, le fonctionnement adaptatif et les interventions disponibles sur le plan clinique.	Down syndrome (DS), Fragile X syndrome (FXS), Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) and SYNGAP1 mutations are caused by dysfunctions of the molecular pathways which lead among others to an imbalance in excitation and inhibition of the neuronal activity that would impact the brain development and its functioning. However, it is difficult to directly bridge the gap between the molecular imbalances observed in animal models with the structural, functional and cognitive characteristics observed in human with these syndromes. To our knowledge, few studies have compared those different genetic syndromes on sensory processing, basic learning or on their behavioural issues using similar and translational paradigms then allowing a better understanding of their specificities.  The first part of this thesis aims to identify whether electroencephalographic activity would be an adequate biomarker representing neurobiological alterations both in sensory processing and learning in humans with these syndromes. The goal of study #1 was to describe auditory sensory processing, as a very first basic process, in SYNGAP1 mutations being a genetic condition still little studied in humans. Results showed a decrease in phase synchronization and an increase in the power of gamma band which distinguish this genetic condition both from participants without ID and from DS. Still in order to identify electroencephalographic biomarkers, but this time at a basic cognitive level, study #2 aimed to compare all these syndromes in a repetition suppression (RS) paradigm in order to observe the presence of RS and compare basic learning in these populations. The results identified a RS pattern in both DS and FXS. FXS also exhibited relatively higher habituation then indicating specific features according to the syndrome.  The second part, addressing clinical aspects, permits to compare the behavioural profiles associated with adaptive functioning between syndromes and to describe existing interventions on ID population. Study #3 notably highlighted that IQ and ADHD symptoms are associated with adaptive functioning especially in FXS and TSC. This article also made it possible to describe the behavioural profiles of these syndromes, revealing more difficulties reported in individuals with FXS, while DS presented fewer behavioural issues. Finally, article #4 highlighted various interventions used with ID population, notably cognitive-behavioural and compensatory strategies.  This thesis therefore makes it possible to gain a better understanding of these genetic syndromes concerning their electrophysiological signature during sensory processing and learning as well as in terms of behavioural comorbidities and their relationship with adaptive functioning, to then address current ID interventions. These different syndromic particularities identified at several levels made it possible to generate suggestions that could guide future interventions in this field.	interventions , Fragile X syndrome , Tuberous sclerosis complex , SYNGAP1 mutations , Down syndrome , Intellectual disability , Electrophysiology , Auditory sensory processing , Adaptive functioning , Repetition suppression and interventions	en	25257.0
106	Hyperactivation cérébrale et réseaux fonctionnels associés chez les individus à risque de développer la maladie d'Alzheimer	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in older adults. Its early diagnosis is essential to better understand the brain mechanisms underlying the phenotypical manifestation of the disease and develop consequent interventions. The study of individuals at risk of AD, for example those presenting with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI), offers the opportunity to examine the neuropathophysiological processes preceding the dementia stage. This would allow, among other things, to identify early biomarkers of the disease. The general aim of this thesis was to determine the presence of cerebral hyperactivation and to assess functional brain networks associated with hyperactivation. Hyperactivation is defined by the presence of higher levels of brain activation in individuals at risk of AD (i.e. SCD, MCI) in comparison to cognitively healthy controls. Hyperactivation is most often measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while participants perform a cognitive task. In this thesis, the reader will first be exposed to the studies which used fMRI to examine patterns of brain activation and connectivity in individuals with a clinical diagnosis of AD, MCI or presenting with SCD. Theoretical models resulting from these studies will then be presented. The scientific issues remaining to be addressed to better understand the phenomenon of hyperactivation and its relation to functional brain networks will then be described (Chapter 1). Three empirical studies forming the core of this thesis will be presented. The first study aimed to assess the presence, localization and longitudinal evolution of hyperactivation associated with an episodic memory task in individuals meeting criteria for MCI and having subsequently progressed towards dementia (Chapter 2). The second study aimed to determine the trajectory of brain activation associated with an associative memory task as a function of disease severity in a group of individuals at risk of AD. It also aimed to determine if hyperactivation is present in viii participants meeting criteria for SCD plus (or SCD+), who are individuals presenting with memory complaint in addition to genetic and/or neurodegeneresence markers of AD (Chapter 3). The third and last study aimed to examine patterns of functional connectivity related to regions of hyperactivation, and to assess how hyperactivation and its associated functional networks relate to memory performance in individuals at risk of AD (Chapter 4). Results from the first study highlighted the presence of hyperactivation in individuals with MCI who subsequently progressed to the dementia stage. Findings from the second study revealed a quadratic function describing the relationship between proxies of disease severity (neurodegeneration, memory performance) and left superior parietal activation in a group of individuals at risk of AD (SCD+ and MCI). Moreover, higher levels of activation, i.e. hyperactivation, were found in hippocampal and temporo-parietal regions in the SCD+ group. Hypoactivation was rather found in the left superior parietal area in the MCI group. Finally, results from the third study revealed that hyperactivation of predetermined regions was associated with dysfunction of functional brain networks underlying associative memory in SCD+ and MCI. Moreover, these hyperactivation-network interactions were associated with increasing symptomatology. The implications of this thesis and its limits are addressed in the discussion section (Chapter 5).

107	Consommation de cannabis, impulsivité et comportements routiers à risque chez les jeunes conducteurs	Despite many prevention efforts, young drivers are overrepresented in road crashes. Some studies show that cannabis use and impulsivity are significant predictors of risky driving behaviour among young drivers. The aim of this thesis is to better understand the association between cannabis use and risky driving behaviour, while considering the driver’s impulsivity. For this purpose, this thesis is divided into two articles. The first article aims to verify whether the frequency of cannabis use predicts risk-taking over and above the impulsivity traits of young drivers. 209 participants aged between 17 and 25 completed questionnaires on their driving behaviours, impulsivity, and frequency of cannabis use. Results show that the frequency of cannabis use is a significant predictor of risky driving over and above the five impulsivity traits. Furthermore, positive urgency is the only impulsivity trait which predicts risky driving, regardless of the frequency of cannabis use. Several explanations of these results are proposed, including one we found particularly relevant: the probability of driving under the influence is higher with more frequent use, so the substance effects could explain risky driving behaviour. Therefore, in our second study, we wanted to test whether cannabis use was associated with risky driving behaviour even if the user was not driving under the influence. Moreover, since frequent use can be symptomatic of a cannabis use disorder (CUD), we wanted to verify its impact on risky behaviours. The second article, therefore, compares two groups of cannabis users (with or without CUD) on several driving behaviours, while considering their impulsivity. A sample of 76 male participants, cannabis users, aged 18 to 25, completed a driving simulation task and a stop-signal task, abstaining from cannabis use in the 12 hours preceding the experiment. They also completed questionnaires about their cannabis use patterns, impulsivity traits and risk-taking. Results show that users with a CUD displayed more risky behaviours in the simulator than users without a CUD, regardless of their impulsivity level and without being under the effects of the substance. Several explanations have been proposed: difficulty adjusting to driving without the influence of the substance for users with a CUD; presence of a confounding variable different from the impulsivity; or residual effects of cannabis, not detected by the stop-signal task. In summary, this thesis emphasizes that cannabis use is a contributing factor to young drivers’ risky behaviours, regardless of their impulsivity. Moreover, cannabis users are not a homogeneous group, which is why it is important to specifically target problematic users in prevention campaigns.	cannabis , young drivers , risky driving behaviour , cannabis use disorder , impulsivity , disinhibition , driving simulator , stop-signal task	en	25255.0
108	Contribution de l’imagerie dronique pour la caractérisation des paramètres biophysiques des cultures agricoles	Thanks to information technologies and GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System), precision agriculture is refining the scale of observation and intervention, from the field to the individual plant. Remote sensing, in particular through satellite imagery, has also made it possible to monitor the crop dynamics, with increasing time frequency and spatial resolution. Crop vigor is a crucial parameter allowing the optimization of inputs, and consequently economic and environmental benefits. Several ways to estimate crop vigor are possible. For a row crop such as corn (Zea Mays L.), aboveground biomass has been favored and will serve as a proxy for vigor. Our study is based on the hypothesis that the recent advent of agricultural UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) will pave the way for a better estimation of crop vigor. We assume that the flexibility of the UAV combined with the very high spatial resolution of their images will allow a more accurate monitoring of crop vigor, both in space and time – conditions which are critical for the deployment of precision agriculture. Research over the past 15 years has relied on the UAV to collect images of very high spatial resolution. However, the processing of those images is mainly based on vegetation indices, especially the NDVI. Several questions arise from the above observations: – Is the use of NDVI the most efficient way to exploit the spatial resolution of UAV images? If not, is there a better way to exploit this imagery? – How to respond to time and logistical constraints in the image processing so that it is ultimately adopted by farmers? – Since UAV-borne sensors can be oriented quite freely, what are the effects of the acquisition angles on the results? First, we assessed the relevance of the traditional approach which uses the NDVI index to determine crop parameters. To do that, we compared the UAV platform with the GreenSeeker proximal sensor. The results showed that the UAV is less efficient than the GreenSeeker in estimating corn biomass. We thus moved away from the traditional approach and opted for a method extracting the apparent leaf area, through computer vision techniques applied to RGB images. This method took advantage of the very high spatial resolution offered by UAV images and produced a robust proxy for corn biomass, at the surface (per square meter) and row levels. We also found that the results were not affected by the acquisition angles of the images (nadir and oblique). Therefore, this research opens the perspective to UAV applications in precision agriculture, for the estimation of vigor and other fundamental parameters used in input optimization algorithms. It also offers the possibility to imagine non-UAV based platforms for the acquisition of very high resolution images in the context of fertilization.

109	La vie économique dans le roman québécois (1956-1983) : représentations, histoire et pratiques	This thesis proposes an analysis, through the prism of the imaginaire social, of literay works that represent economic life, from the industrial boom that marked the post-war period to the 1980s. Combining cultural history and sociocriticism, we study the representations of economic life, their conditions of possibility, production and circulation. Our work focuses in particular on the ideological and political dimension of the working classes and of fictitious workers among marginal authors (Jean-Jules Richard, Pierre Gélinas, Germain Archambault, Maurice Gagnon and Élisabeth Vonarburg) and others who are better known (Claude Jasmin, Jacques Ferron, Jacques Renaud, Francine Noël). As the figure of the writer, the worker is a “complex normative focus” (Hamon, 1984). By crossing the analysis of different cultural productions with the reading of specific novels, the thesis questions the supposed disinterest of Québec literature for economic life.  We first attempt to rethink the categories and oppositions of literary history: realism, regionalism, “documentary” and the social novel. An analysis of the discourse of writers and critics in periodicals sheds light on the different definitions of the social role of literature and of the writer circulating in the 1950s discourse. The contrasting reception of social novels indicates the average literary quality of some of those literary works but a certain enthusiasm for social representations. Articulating history, politics and industrial work, the novels of Pierre Gélinas and Jean-Jules Richard offer a marginal point of view on the workers' strikes of the time informed by a communist sensibility. In their works, as in those published in the review and in Éditions Parti pris, the representations of women offer, by their complexity, a significant perspective on economic life. The exploration of marginality and mobility in the publishing house's publications creates the figure of the taxi driver, a modern-day coureur des bois. The last chapter focuses on the figure of the housewife and on the issue of housework. By studying Francine Noël's Maryse and Élisabeth Vonarburg's Le Silence de la Cité, we reassess the presupposition that realism is the preferred form of economic representation.

110	Optimizing doxorubicin-G-CSF chemotherapy regimens for the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer	Cytotoxic chemotherapy continues to be a first-line treatment option for the majority of cancers. A major side effect in chemotherapy regimens is neutropenia. Prophylactic therapy with granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), an endogenous cytokine responsible for regulating neutrophil production, is administered concomitantly; the exact timing of the combination chemotherapy and G-CSF is crucial for achieving treatment results. Leveraging on previous work that optimized treatment regimens based on G-CSF timing, we developed a quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) framework to study dose frequency and intensity of chemotherapy in order to maximize anti-tumor effects while minimizing neutropenia. In this work, we performed an optimization across a wide range of cycle lengths and dose sizes to identify the best cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens with G-CSF support. Our results suggest that doxorubicin 45mg/BSA every 14 days, has a positive impact on tumour growth control, and that to minimize the risk of neutropenia and the burden to patients it is best to delay the administration of G-CSF to day seven after chemotherapy and give fewer doses . This study suggests possible avenues for optimal chemotherapy regimens with prophylactic support of G-CSF in the context of Triple Negative Breast Cancer.

111	Rôle du complexe LINC dans la propagation du virus de l’herpès simplex de type 1	HSV-1 is widely used to study viral cycles and host-pathogen interactions of Herpesvirdidae, because it replicates quickly and efficiently in many cells types. The transcription, replication and capsid assembly of HSV-1 take place in the nucleus of the infected cell. The assembled HSV-1 capsid must exit the nucleus to continue the viral cycle. The nuclear membranes constitute a barrier for the nuclear egress of nucleocapsids (125 nm) given the exclusion size of the nuclear pores is approximately 40 nm. The nucleocapsids therefore pass through the nuclear membranes by an envelopement-deenvelopement process. The capsids acquire an envelope from the inner nuclear membrane when they are released into the perinuclear space. This primary viral envelope then fuses with the outer nuclear membrane, enabling the capsid to reach the cytoplasm. Situated between the two nuclear membranes is the linker of the nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complex. It is involved in the maintenance of the perinuclear space, nuclear positioning and force transmission between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. The LINC complex is composed of two families of proteins, SUN and KASH proteins. SUN proteins are found in the inner nuclear membrane, their N-terminal interacts with the nucleoskeleton and the C-terminal includes a conserved domain, the SUN domain, which interacts in the perinuclear space with the conserved domain of KASH proteins. The implication of the LINC complex in the propagation of the pseudorabies virus (PrV), a member of the alphaherpesviruses, has already been demonstrated. Since PrV is part of the same family as HSV-1, we hypothesized it may also play a role in HSV-1 propagation. My work shows that overexpression of a dominant negative form of SUN2 or its depletion shows a proviral effect on HSV-1 propagation. This result differs to what has been previously found for PrV, where SUN2 displays an antiviral phenotype. This work confirms our hypothesis but reveals a more complex scenario than anticipated.

112	Association entre la stéatose hépatique non alcoolique et les hyperchylomicronémies familiale et multifactorielle	Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a disorder caused by hepatic triglyceride accumulation. It ranges from hepatic steatosis to steatohepatitis with fibrosis. Obesity and other elements of the metabolic syndrome, such as hypertriglyceridemia and type 2 diabetes, are risk factors for NAFLD, which affects between 20% and 29% of Canadians. These statistics are alarming, especially knowing that there is still no treatment for this condition and considering the increasing prevalence of obesity. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) hydrolyzes triglycerides contained in very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) and chylomicrons. LPL is often down-regulated in the metabolic syndrome and some patients may present triglycerides level higher than 10 mmol/L, as multifactorial chylomicronemia syndrome (MCS). Chylomicronemia also characterizes total LPL deficiency, known as familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS). FCS and MCS are two dyslipidemias associated with severe hypertriglyceridemia, which is associated with increased risk of recurrent acute pancreatitis. Whereas FCS is monogenic, MCS is polygenic and directly related to the metabolic syndrome with a significant influence of the environment. Results of the present study compare the expression of NAFLD in FCS and MCS patients. NAFLD was assessed using transient elastography performed in 18 FCS and 18 MCS patients matched for age and sex. Controled attenuation parameter (CAP) score ≥ 280 dB/m, suggesting NAFLD expression, were observed in 50% of FCS and 83.3% of MCS. The difference between degrees of hepatic steatosis in both groups is significant with a p-value of 0.036. In addition, only 22.2% of FCS with NAFLD are obese compared to 71.4% for MCS (p = 0.001). It is also interesting to note that FCS patients have NAFLD even in the presence of a very low body mass index (BMI<18 kg / m2). Besides, CAP score in FCS was negatively correlated with the number of acute pancreatitis (p=0.004). Our study shows that NAFLD was frequently observed in FCS and MCS but occurred independently of BMI and could be associated with a lower occurrence of acute pancreatitis.

113	Prédiction de la capacité de marche à un an lors de la phase aiguë du traumatisme chez les patients blessés médullaires traumatiques	Traumatic spinal cord injury (TSCI) has important neurological consequences including impaired walking ability. Predicting early the ability to walk again after the trauma has inspired the development of multiple clinical prediction rules. Simple and accurate, they do predict walking on short indoor distances but do not consider the quality of walking. Moreover, the usefulness and added value of these rules have never been evaluated and compared to the unstructured clinical judgment of the physicians for whom they are intended.  The objective of this thesis was to identify elements of the acute INSCSCI (International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury) standardized evaluation that would allow the development of a clinical prediction rule for outdoor independent community walking one year after a TSCI, ensuring good internal and external validity as well as clinical usefulness when compared to clinical judgment. The strength of the strongest lower limb and preserved light touch sensation are the best predictors of independent walking. A clinical prediction rule was developed to meet the objective: this rule is relevant; generalizable; simple; takes into consideration the quality of walking; and is focused on community living, social participation and quality of life.  The performance of a clinical prediction rule for indoor walking is statistically similar to that of clinicians using their unstructured judgment, but can vary depending on different factors.  This research recommends the use of clinical prediction rules as a decision aid in patients who have undergone a TSCI, including the one developed for independent functional community walking.	spinal cord , spinal cord injury , trauma , functional recovery , clinical prediction rule , walking	en	25190.0
114	Biocompatible polymer coatings for implants in the peripheral nervous system : in vivo study of polymer-coated microbeads in the rat sciatic model	Background: Implants in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) can potentially restore sensory feedback, improve motor control and alleviate phantom-limb pain in upper-limb amputees. However, nervous system implants have poor long-term function and biocompatibility when implanted into the body due to foreign body reaction. Dendrimer (DND) and Poly-D-Lysine (PDL) are two synthetic polymers with properties that could improve the performance of these interfaces. In my masters’ research, my objective is to determine whether these synthetic polymers could promote the formation of presynaptic elements on artificial surfaces in vivo making intraneural implants more biocompatible and long-lasting. Methods: In the coated microsphere in vivo experiment, a nerve crush injury model in the rat was used for the study. PDL-coated, DND-coated and uncoated beads were injected into the rat sciatic nerve at the crush site and 5 mm distal to the crush site. The nerves were then harvested after 4, 6 and 8 weeks and stained for neurofilament and synaptophysin. Synaptophysin puncta were then counted on the bead surface for each group. Additionally, in a proof-of-concept experiment, two uncoated electrodes were implanted into the rat sciatic nerve. Nerve recordings were then performed every week, and the threshold nerve potential in the sciatic nerve was measured by only varying the pulse duration of the stimulation. Results: The coated microsphere in vivo experiment demonstrated that DND-coated microspheres had a significantly higher number of synaptophysin puncta around their surface from 4 to 8 weeks compared to uncoated beads. At 4 weeks, the DND condition also showed a significantly higher number of synaptophysin puncta around its microbeads vs. the PDL condition for the distal site. In the uncoated electrode in vivo experiment, the results showed that the two implants could stimulate and record threshold nerve potentials in the rat sciatic nerve for one week and two weeks respectively before being non-functional. Conclusion: Our study showed for the first time that DND has a stable synapse-promoting property that is superior to PDL in vivo and that our electrode design can be used to assess the long-term signal stability of peripheral nerve implants.

115	La protection des renseignements personnels dans l'exploitation des assistants vocaux.	Voice assistants bring a new way for humans to interact with technology by only using their voice. Scalable and interactive technology thanks to artificial intelligence. We will see that the technical and software characteristics of voice assistants contribute to a massive collection of personal information by companies.  The imprecision of confidentiality policies, the absence of information on the mode of operation, the imperfection of the Natural Language Processing characterized by false positives and the difficulties inherent in the exercise by individuals of some of their rights contribute to the mismatch between voice assistants and various existing laws. In addition, the possibility for people to interact with the object as well as its lack of autonomy tend to complicate the application of civil liability regimes, including that resulting from the act of thing.  This recent appearance of voice assistants has so far not giving judges the possibility to rule on the right to privacy, protection of personal information and civil liability. Current case law doesn’t seem to be well adapted to the technological context around the voice assistant, and more generally the voice. The Oakes test, which was design to determining the reasonableness of a violation of the rights and freedoms set out in the Canadian Charter, appears to be unsuited to this new context. We will see that the lack of powers conferred on the competent authorities represents a major obstacle in monitoring the application of the rule of law.

116	Pouvoir d’action des artistes dans le cadre de la commande publique : étude de cas de la Politique québécoise d’intégration des arts à l’architecture	The Politique d'intégration des arts à l’architecture et à l'environnement des bâtiments et des sites gouvernementaux et publics, or “ Politique du 1%”, endeavours to promote the creation in the province of Québec of contemporary artworks integrated into their environment. It has three main objectives: to provoke the creation of artistic works integrated into their spatial environment, to make Québec based artists and their works more visible while enriching the living environment of citizens, and finally to make contemporary art more accessible to the entire population of the Québec province. The application of the process undertaken for the realization of the integration of an artwork is managed by a committee set up for each project, and is done according to specific criteria which meet the diverse interests of the actors concerned, especially the general public and the experts of the artistic world. The challenge for the artist, through the creation of an integrative work, is then to meet the expectations generated by each group of actors. This research therefore aims to reveal the means by which artists cope with such expectations and our question thus relates to the power of action of the “integrating” artists within the framework of the process of creation and of integration of their work: what is the possibility of incorporating their values, their intimate approach but also their own interpretation of what a successful integration is, while creating a meaningful piece of art. The research thus reveals that an adaptation of their approach and practice is necessary in this new context. The analysis of the artists' discourse also highlights a spectrum of adaptability, which enables to understand how this adaptation is possible given the confrontation of values such as freedom and autonomy to the constraints inherent in the policy.	intégration des arts , politique , public commission , integration of the arts , creation , artists , policy , creative freedom , visual arts	en	25157.0
117	L’activisme environnemental privé comme comportement politique	"Contemporary environmental issues require the mobilization of all societal actors. In this context, it is essential to be able to adequately understand citizen political participation regarding the environment. In reviewing the literature, we note that certain analytical currents conclude that there is a need to broaden the concepts of political participation and environmental activism in order to better consider the impact of lifestyle and the private sphere. Based on the highlights of these two literatures, we propose a typology that differentiates pro-environmental activist actions according to their ""novelty"" (as analytical objects of a political nature) and their radicality. In order to empirically validate this model and to determine whether new environmental activist behaviours are truly political, we analyzed data from a survey of 3458 Canadians from the general population and 2653 members of Canadian environmental groups. We first conducted an exploratory factor analysis to identify different types of pro-environmental actions. After associating the resulting factors to the quadrants of our typology, we conducted a series of linear regression analyses to compare the characteristics of conventional political actions and new activist behaviours. The results tend to confirm the view that the latter have a strong political resonance. It therefore seems necessary to consider the broader potential of the notion of political behaviour in order to draw more accurate conclusions, both in terms of assessing citizen political participation and activist engagement in environmental issues."

118	Mécanismes neuronaux de la stimulation thêta-burst intermittente du cortex dorsolatéral préfrontal	Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a neuromodulation technique used as a treatment of major depressive disorder. Intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS), a specific kind of rTMS, offers a reduced stimulation duration. Yet, its mechanism of action and optimal duration are still largely unknown. In clinical settings, standard duration is often increased with the expectation of increasing therapeutic effects. However, this hypothesis has never been tested. This master thesis aims to provide better understanding of neuronal mechanism associated with iTBS on the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of healthy participants and to determine the optimal stimulation duration over the three more commonly used durations in clinical practice: 600 (standard), 1,200 and 1,800 pulses. This was explored in 14 neurotypical participants who experienced each of the three conditions during three different sessions. The induced brain activity was measured combining transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroencephalography, via TMS evoked potentials (TEP) and event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP). These measures were compared before and after each condition using a mixed linear model. For the three durations, no significant difference was found in all cortical activity measures. Specifically, after iTBS, the amplitude of most of the TEPs, as well as of the ERSP of theta band, are reduced. Therefore, the iTBS standard protocol induces a modification of cortical activity which is similar to longer durations, showing the importance of replicating this study on a clinical population.

119	Étude de la variabilité photométrique dans le vent des étoiles Wolf-Rayet	We present an analysis of photometric observations of Wolf-Rayet stars in an effort to characterize their ubiquitous short-term stochastic variability and the origin of the periodic variability due to atmospheric eclipses in two specific systems. With data from BRITE-Constellation, we investigated what we initially thought to be atmospheric eclipses in the WR22 and WR48 systems. Both stars’ datasets were first analyzed using an analytical atmospheric eclipse model, and then a fully numerical core and wind eclipse model was used to better characterize the ambiguous case of WR22. The mass-loss rate of the Wolf-Rayet component, the optical depth of the wind and the inclination angle of the system were accurately determined for WR22, whereas for WR48 an upper limit was found for those parameters using an inclination angle from the litterature. The study of the short-term stochastic variability in the winds of 55 Wolf-Rayet stars was obtained with 70 time-series produced by MOST, BRITE and TESS. The amplitude spectra of these stars were analyzed using a semi-Lorentzian function that allowed us to extract characteristic parameters. Comparisons between the values we obtained and those from the litterature were carried out and we discuss the possible contribution to the variability of various physical processes, namely the line de-shadowing instability, the presence of a subsurface iron-group driven convection zone and possibly of internal gravitational waves generated at the boundary between the convective core and the radiative layer to the observed variability.

120	Décharge à courant alternatif (AC) dans l’air et en contact avec l’eau : caractérisation fondamentale et application au traitement des eaux	Gas phase discharges in contact with liquids is a relatively novel research field in plasma physics. Plasma-liquid systems are very promising for various technological applications, such as medicine, solid-state physics, and environmental remediation. However, further development of the applications requires understanding of plasma-liquid interactions. In this thesis, interaction between an air plasma directly coupled in contact with water is studied. This thesis includes three chapters. Chapter 1 presents a general introduction of the plasma-liquid interactions and their applications in water treatment. Chapter 2, an article published in Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics, is an investigation of the spatial and temporal dynamics of an air plasma produced by AC discharge between a pin electrode and water. Chapter 3, an article published in Plasma Chemistry and Plasma Processing, is an investigation of the various modes produced by an AC-driven air discharge in contact with water. The electrical characteristics of each discharge mode are presented in detail, and variations in water properties (namely water acidity and conductivity) are also discussed. The efficiency of each discharge mode on the degradation rate of methylene blue, a standard pollutant, is also reported.

121	L'énactivisme autopoïétique : une réponse au problème difficile?	The “hard problem” of consciousness is one of the central problems of philosophy of the mind. Echoing Descartes’s mind-body problem, the hard problem highlights the epistemological and ontological difficulties of physicalism in its attempt to reduce subjective experience to a physical and functional character. This thesis proposes a potential answer to the hard problem of consciousness by the enactive approach, more specifically a variant of the enactive approach that we sometimes call autopoietic enactivism. Autopoietic enactivism presents itself as an alternative approach to “brain-bound” approaches in cognitive science. In contrast to the cognitivist trend, autopoietic enactivism presents a conception of the mind centred around the embodied activity of an organism. At the heart of this embodied conception of the mind lies the concept of autopoiesis, a theory of organic life and biological autonomy defined by the sense-making activity of living organisms. This concept is central to autopoietic enactivism’s solution to the hard problem, as it reveals the deep similarities between both life and mind.

122	Modélisation de l'interaction entre les virus de la grippe et de la rougeole	People infected with measles experience immune suppression. This work focuses on the influence of this characteristic of measles on another pathogen, here the flu. We also have that the flu will increase the production of other pathogens in a co-infection model. Modeling the immune response to such virus-virus interaction is currently of signficant relevance, given the limited knowledge on SARS-CoV-2/influenza interactions. A model of each pathogen will be developed and analysed. We will look for the fixed points, conditions for their stability and we will observe some numerical results of their evolution over time. Then a model following the evolution of the two pathogens having simultaneously infected an individual will be designed. In this model we will include the interactions of the pathogens on each other to theoretically determine the effects in individuals infected with both influenza and measles. Then we can compare between the different populations when there is no interaction and with the different interactions between the two pathogens.

123	Le superhéros dans le cinéma étatsunien : approche générique et mythologique	This essay examines the construction of a mythological discourse by analyzing superhero movies, a genre whose popularity exploded after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. This essay traces back the origins of the superhero figure through the history of the comic book medium in the 20th century all the way to contemporary Hollywood cinema. We will demonstrate how the terrorist attacks have been central to the production of this type of movie, of which we will examine the most important characteristics: a strongly mythological content, supported by a representation of absolute evil, and an ideological function, mainly based on the principle of social cohesion. A case study on the character of Batman will be able to show the mythological content and the ideologies present in four movies, produced between 1943 and 2012. The writings of Gérard Bouchard on the social myth as well as the theories of Robert Jewett and John Shelton Lawrence on the American monomyth will be used to demonstrate the importance of this type of movie in the American culture since 2001.	batman , superhero , mythology , myth , september 11, 2001 , american politics	en	25092.0
124	La « Ludo-simulation » : étude de la simulation comme matière créative dans la construction d’un jeu de survie	This master thesis aims to study the survival game genre through the prism of the simulation.  Most of the computer games published today present atypical game structures with a tendency  to liberate the player from any prescribed constraint for the benefit of a more expressive play.  Minecraft (Mojang, 2010) is a prime example not explicitly offering “modalities of play” to the  player, confronting most of the more traditional ludic forms, like game or sport, in which  objectives are usually more convenient to determine. This tendency of games to develop complex  agencies without necessarily prescribing an associated “must do” is the basis of several ongoing  questions. Imposing a simulation perspective for the benefit of game studies makes possible to  answer several of these questions by focusing research attention on the broader “modalities of  doing” rather than on the prescriptions of uses which tend more and more to disappear.   The objective of this work is to reflect on the contributions of simulation in a corpus of six  survival games in order to study the crossing between game and simulation to understand how a  game perspective increases the creativity of a simulation which, in turn, increases the practicable  complexity of the game. In order to achieve this, we first develop the necessary theoretical  foundation to tackle the question of simulation. Then, an exposition of survival in games is offered  in chapter 2 in order to fully understand how the subject is modelled inside the medium. Our  methodological presentation in chapter 3 aims to develop a descriptive introduction of the results  and an interpretative analysis of the survival of the corpus in chapter 4. The objective of this work  is to advance two new concepts for video game studies: Ludic-simulation as a research posture  and the Videogame survivalist as a player posture. These two concepts are further defined in  chapters 1 and 2 and questioned in chapter 4.	ludic simulation , simulation , survival , video game , videogame survivalist	en	25091.0
125	«Avec salutations socialistes» : lettres de plaintes et relations socio-étatiques en République démocratique allemande, 1953-1967	This master’s thesis analyzes the dynamics between the German Democratic Republic and its citizens through complaint letters that East Germans sent to the State between 1953 and 1967 regarding housing problems. It argues that the complainants adopted “socialist values” throughout their discourses as a way of justifying the legitimacy of their complaints. In other words, they used the discourse and principles of the state against it in order to demand action and a resolution to their problems or concerns. This thesis not only highlight these various strategies, utilizing a “history from below” approach, but it also investigates the state’s reaction to the complaints of its citizens. It argues that the state responded overall better in the 1960s as it did in the 1950s, showing evolution in the relationship between state and society as well as a shift in the state’s way to understand socialism. By the 1960s the East German government had had time to slowly adapt its domestic politics towards the population’s needs. The analysis of these letters is at the crossroads of two methods: First I employ a discursive analysis that allows me to identify the recurring strategies by which the state and its citizens sought to influence each other.  Second, I use a statistical analysis of the State’s responses coupled with an examination of domestic politics that allows me to capture the changing attitude of the government towards its population.

126	La Promenade Masson : une étude de l'évolution du paysage alimentaire	The increase in the cost of housing is a phenomenon observed in several Canadian cities and Montreal is no exception. Even within the Quebec metropolis, this growth is taking place in certain boroughs such as Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie. Indeed, the increase in the cost of housing is significant and leads researchers to speak of residential gentrification. This study deepens the reflection of this process of socio-economic transformation of the district by integrating the commercial aspect of gentrification. Indeed, for several years now, the commercial development of Promenade Masson has been oriented towards offering better quality, more refined and more upscale products. Through various initiatives, merchants are even going so far as to offer a shopping experience to the consumer to create an emotional link between the consumer and the business. This is what leads us to consider the food landscape as a dynamic and complex space that is in keeping with David Harvey's tripartite conception of space. Thus, we approach the food landscape by considering its absolute, relative and relational dimensions. Following this contextualization, we question the link between commercial gentrification and the evolution of the food landscape. This research project also identifies 1) the social, demographic and economic evolution of the neighbourhood between 1996 and 2016; 2) the evolution of the food stores on Promenade Masson since the 2000s and 3) the mobilization of the food landscape by consumers.

127	Intertextualidad y espacio social : de Lima la horrible a Yo amo a mi mami	Since the colonial period, the elite groups have kept the authority of power in Peru by creating economic and racial differences. The social structure benefits a minority to the detriment of the majority. The minority dominance is carried out exclusively from Lima, and this supremacy causes the administrative, social and economic centralism of the capital.   Our research problem reflects on how the literary text establishes the relationships between the centralism in Lima, the organization of the urban space, and the social inequalities in Peru. Many Peruvian authors have devoted their literary production to this topic. In our study, we analyze two literary works: Lima la horrible (1964) by Sebastián Salazar Bondy, and Yo amo a mi mami (1999) by Jaime Bayly, paying specific attention to how Bayly's work refers through a series of intertextual strategies to that of Salazar Bondy.  The space of the city of Lima serves as the substrate for the dialectics of the storyline in both Bayly’s novel and Salazar Bondy’s essay. The space operates as leit motive and transtextual structure. It is our hypothesis that Lima la horrible is a palimpsest of Yo amo a mi mami, and that the discourse presented in Salazar Bondy's work is embedded in Bayly´s novel. In these works the representation of the urban space emerges from the lived experience of the authors, who question the sociocultural foundations of their country.

128	Les théories implicites comme facteurs de risque derrière la délinquance sexuelle des cyberdélinquants	Studies that initially focused on sexual assault against children looked at the various risk factors behind engaging and maintaining those criminal behaviors, thus highlighting the role of cognitive distortions. Ward and Keenan (1999), the first authors to present a more precise definition of these mistaken beliefs, explained that they are emerging directly from underlying cognitive patterns which they call “implicit theories”. Interconnected among themselves, these implicit theories act directly on criminal behaviour. However, their place among online sex offenders is still unknown. This thesis therefore aims to study the role of implicit theories behind the various sexual offences committed by this particular subgroup.  In collaboration with the Sûreté du Québec, this study examines the relationships between the beliefs maintained by 137 online sex offenders during their interrogation and the various sexual offences listed in their criminal record; more precisely, offences related to child pornography, luring of children and sexual contacts with minors. Following various bivariate and multivariate analyzes, the results show that the implicit theory “Nature of harm” would be associated with heavier criminal record in terms of sexual delinquency, this one being overall the most criminogenic. This study also highlights that only certain implicit theories are associate with sexual delinquency, some not related with any indicator. The results show us that certain implicit theories are more strongly associated with the fact that an individual has exclusively committed offences relating to child pornography and would therefore reduce the chances that an online sex offender initiates virtual or offline contacts with his victim. As for the implicit theory “Children are sexual beings”, this one would increase by more than twice the chances of an online sex offender to act out outside the virtual world. On the other hand, the area under the curve of this model raises the fact that it would not predict, significantly better than chance, the inclusion of online sex offenders to this particular subgroup of mixed offenders.

129	Étude de cas de substitution de solvant pour le nettoyage de disjoncteurs haute tension	This article presents a study of substitution of a solvent used for the cleaning of silicone grease when performing maintenance tasks on high voltage circuit breakers. A nine steps systematic methodology of substitution was applied. A substitution committee was set up. The Securo solvent (mixture of trichloroethylene, perchloroethylene and saturated hydrocarbons) was identified as the source of problems of mucous membrane irritation experienced by several workers. Exposure monitoring revealed a potential of overexposure. In addition, trichloroethylene and perchloroethylene are classified as carcinogens. A literature search and information from suppliers made it possible to identify seven potential substitutes: OS-20 (octamethyltrisiloxane), ethyl lactate, Varsol® 3139, Skysol (mixture of saturated hydrocarbons and MMB (3-methoxy-3-methyl-1-butanol)), Voltz Red (mixture of saturated hydrocarbons and d-limonene), Ultrasolv 221 (saturated hydrocarbons) and Teksol (mixture of saturated hydrocarbons and n-butyl lactate). Small scale tests discarded four solvents on the basis of slow evaporation or objectionable odour. Three solvents, Varsol® 3139, Skysol and OS-20 were selected for a thorough evaluation based on considerations of health, safety and environment. The final recommendation was the OS-20 solvent. For cost considerations, the company did not select the latter but chose Skysol. The use of the Vapour Hazard Ratio (VHR) made the comparison of the replacement options easier, although it was limited by the absence of occupational exposure limits for certain substances like MMB.

130	Diagnosis and surgical management of cholecystolithiasis in two adult inland beardeddragons (pogona vitticeps)	Two male inland bearded dragons (Pogona vitticeps) of 5 and 6 yr of age were presented for anorexia with and without lethargy, respectively. In both cases, a firm, spherical, and mobile mass, measuring 2 cm in diameter, was palpated in the cranio-medial coelom. Radiographs were unremarkable. Ultrasonographic evaluation was highly suggestive of cholecystolithiasis. Coeliotomy confirmed the presence of a markedly enlarged gallbladder containing a cholecystolith in both cases, and cholecystectomies were performed. Both dragons resumed eating after 1–7 days and were doing well 3–6 months postoperatively. The gallbladder wall was unremarkable on histology, and the choleliths were composed of protein and calcium carbonate crystals. Cholecystolithiasis in bearded dragons has been the subject of very few case reports, probably due to its low occurrence. The lack of available data on the diagnosis and management may have led to this condition being underdiagnosed in this species. Ultrasonography was essential to the clinical diagnosis of cholecystolithiasis in our two cases and should be recommended as part of the diagnostic approach of bearded dragons with cranio-medial coelomic masses.

131	"Pathogenic and transmission potential of wildtype and
chicken embryo origin (CEO) vaccine revertant infectious laryngotracheitis virus"	Infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT) is an infectious upper respiratory tract disease that impacts the poultry industry worldwide. ILT is caused by an alphaherpesvirus commonly referred to as infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV). Vaccination with live attenuated vaccines is practiced regularly for the control of ILT. However, extensive and improper use of live attenuated vaccines is related to vaccine viruses reverting to virulence. An increase in mortality and pathogenicity has been attributed to these vaccine revertant viruses. Recent studies characterized Canadian ILTV strains originating from ILT outbreaks as related to live attenuated vaccine virus revertants. However, information is scarce on the pathogenicity and transmission potential of these Canadian isolates. Hence, in this study, the pathogenicity and transmission potential of two wildtype ILTVs and a chicken embryo origin (CEO) vaccine revertant ILTV of Canadian origin were evaluated. To this end, 3-week-old specific pathogen-free chickens were experimentally infected with each of the ILTV isolates and compared to uninfected controls. Additionally, naïve chickens were exposed to the experimentally infected chickens to mimic naturally occurring infection. Pathogenicity of each of these ILTV isolates was evaluated by the severity of clinical signs, weight loss, mortality, and lesions observed at the necropsy. The transmission potential was evaluated by quantification of ILTV genome loads in oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs and tissue samples of the experimentally infected and contact-exposed chickens, as well as in the capacity to produce ILT in contact-exposed chickens. We observed that the CEO vaccine revertant ILTV isolate induced severe disease in comparison to the two wildtype ILTV isolates used in this study. According to ILTV genome load data, CEO vaccine revertant ILTV isolate was successfully transmitted to naïve contact-exposed chickens in comparison to the tested wildtype ILTV isolates. Overall, the Canadian origin CEO vaccine revertant ILTV isolate possesses higher virulence, and dissemination potential, when compared to the wildtype ILTV isolates used in this study. These findings have serious implications in ILT control in chickens.

132	More ‘Europe’, less Democracy? : European integration does not erode satisfaction with democracy	The process of European integration, through institutions such as the European Union, the Eurozone, or Schengen, implies a shift in political decision-making away from the national governments and towards international institutions. This gradual shift in the balance of power, furthermore, is increasingly debated by citizens. As a result, European integration might lead to an erosion of satisfaction with democracy in European countries. By means of a longitudinal analysis of the determinants of satisfaction with democracy in European countries, we test this expectation. We find no indication that the shift in the balance of power, and the trend towards more European integration indeed have eroded satisfaction with the functioning of (national) democracy.

133	La nucléation à partir de cristaux mixtes : une nouvelle approche pour augmenter la diversité polymorphique	Chemical compounds that exist in multiple crystalline forms are said to exhibit polymorphism. Polymorphs have the same composition, but their structures and properties can vary markedly. In many fields, conditions for crystallizing compounds of interest are screened exhaustively to generate as many polymorphs as possible, from which the most advantageous form for the desired application can be selected. Here we report a new way to increase polymorphic diversity, based on crystallization induced by suitably designed mixed-crystal seeds. Also reported herein is a new strategy of suspended-melt crystallization, which can be used to induce the formation of single crystals that are too unstable to be produced by traditional methods. This strategy allows for a broader scope of crystalline structures to be resolved by X-ray diffraction. The efficacy of the above methods has been demonstrated by using them to produce new polymorphs of the benchmark compound ROY as single crystals structurally characterized by X-ray diffraction. This allows ROY to reclaim a share of the crown as the most polymorphic compound in the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD).

134	Enhancing relationships between criminology and cybersecurity	‘Cybercrime’ is an umbrella concept used by criminologists to refer to traditional crimes that are enhanced via the use of networked technologies (i.e. cyber-enabled crimes) and newer forms of crime that would not exist without networked technologies (i.e. cyber-dependent crimes). Cybersecurity is similarly a very broad concept and diverse field of practice. For computer scientists, the term ‘cybersecurity’ typically refers to policies, processes and practices undertaken to protect data, networks and systems from unauthorised access. Cybersecurity is used in subnational, national and transnational contexts to capture an increasingly diverse array of threats. Increasingly, cybercrimes are presented as threats to cybersecurity, which explains why national security institutions are gradually becoming involved in cybercrime control and prevention activities. This paper argues that the fields of cyber-criminology and cybersecurity, which are segregated at the moment, are in much need of greater engagement and cross-fertilisation. We draw on concepts of ‘high’ and ‘low’ policing (Brodeur, 2010) to suggest it would be useful to consider ‘crime’ and ‘security’ on the same continuum. This continuum has cybercrime at one end and cybersecurity at the other, with crime being more the domain of ‘low’ policing while security, as conceptualised in the context of specific cybersecurity projects, falls under the responsibility of ‘high’ policing institutions. This unifying approach helps us to explore the fuzzy relationship between cyber-crime and cyber-security and to call for more fruitful alliances between cybercrime and cybersecurity researchers.

135	Entre la philosophie et la science : le reconstructionnisme hermeneutique de J. Habermas	This paper deals with the theoretical reframing that takes place between Knowledge and Human Interest (1968) and the Theory of Communicative Action (1981). In Knowledge and Human Interest two theoretical approaches corresponding to the pair “traditional theory and critical theory” overlapped: 1- a description of the knowledge interests conceived as anthropological invariants (the technical and the practical interests), and 2- the taking up of the concept of “critique” proper to the Frankfurt School according to which theory is self-referential since it is strictly contextualized and aims at the discovery of unnoticed determinations. The interest in this case is emancipatory and psychoanalysis can serve as an example for it. As we can see, the distribution of the knowledge interests in 1968 was asymmetrical because of these two distinct theoretical approaches. Yet the transition to the theory of communicative action will maintain the two approaches, in a renewed manner however, in accordance with the two functions delineated in the new definition of the role of philosophy: 1- “Platzhalter” and 2- “Interpret.”		en	24912.0
136	Start small : how nanomedicine could alleviate the burden of rare CNS Diseases	The complexity and organization of the central nervous system (CNS) is widely modulated by the presence of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and the blood–cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB), which both act as biochemical, dynamic obstacles impeding any type of undesirable exogenous exchanges. The disruption of these barriers is usually associated with the development of neuropathologies which can be the consequence of genetic disorders, local antigenic invasions, or autoimmune diseases. These disorders can take the shape of rare CNS-related diseases (other than Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s) which a exhibit relatively low or moderate prevalence and could be part of a potential line of treatments from current nanotargeted therapies. Indeed, one of the most promising therapeutical alternatives in that field comes from the development of nanotechnologies which can be divided between drug delivery systems and diagnostic tools. Unfortunately, the number of studies dedicated to treating these rare diseases using nanotherapeutics is limited, which is mostly due to a lack of interest from industrial pharmaceutical companies. In the present review, we will provide an overview of some of these rare CNS diseases, discuss the physiopathology of these disorders, shed light on how nanotherapies could be of interest as a credible line of treatment, and finally address the major issues which can hinder the development of efficient therapies in that area.

137	Art and democracy in Habermas	Within the framework of Habermas’s theory of communicative action, art represents one of the three spheres of cultural modernity, beside science and morality. According to this framework, art belongs to the sphere of the aesthetic-expressive whose criterion is authenticity. Yet how adequate is such a criterion for art? The question is all the more legitimate that, with the publication of his Philosophical Discourse of Modernity, Habermas is led to give up his project of developing a philosophical aesthetics, leaving the task of interpretation to art criticism. This giving up is due according to me to the interference produced by authenticity as a criterion stemming from the theory of communication. For example, how are we to trace with such a criterion the inner logic of the artwork? In this regard Adorno’s approach seems more adequate.

138	Contribution of a reflective debriefing to nursing students' clinical judgment in patient deterioration simulations : a mixed-methods study	Background While reflection is a hallmark of debriefing, there is little understanding of how it contributes to nursing students' clinical judgment.  Objectives The aim of this study was to describe how nursing students perceived that the Reflective dEbriefing after a PatieNt Deterioration simulation (REsPoND) fostered learning and how it contributed to their clinical judgment in patient deterioration simulations.  Design A sequential explanatory mixed-methods study.  Participants Nineteen students who showed the greatest clinical judgment score variation in a randomized controlled trial of the effectiveness of REsPoND.  Methods Students participated in interviews on their learning experience in REsPoND. Data were subjected to thematic analysis and themes were contrasted according to students' score variations.  Results Through guided exchanges with their peers, students configured a causes–observations–interventions framework that embodied their understanding of the patient's situation. They evaluated their own simulation performance based on that framework. The contribution of REsPoND to students' clinical judgment differed depending on (1) the value placed on the review of the simulation through a systematic assessment approach; (2) their focus on anticipating the situation or on performing in the simulation; and (3) their preference for who participated more in debriefing.  Conclusion Clinical judgment might be improved when a systematic assessment approach is used to structure debriefing. The relationship between reflection and self-assessment during debriefing remains to be disentangled.

139	Testing nursing students’ clinical judgment in a patient deterioration simulation scenario : development of a situation awareness instrument	Background: Situation awareness may be used to operationalize nursing students' clinical judgment of patient deterioration simulation scenarios.  Objectives: To develop and test an instrument to measure bachelor-level nursing students' situation awareness in a patient deterioration simulation scenario, using the Situation Awareness Global Assessment Technique (SAGAT).  Design: Instrument development and validation.  Settings: A faculty of nursing of a French-Canadian university.  Participants: 15 critical care experts and 234 bachelor-level nursing students from a critical care course.  Methods: The queries were developed from evidence and guidelines regarding nurses' assessment and response to patient deterioration and an inventory of nursing diagnosis. After expert content validation, the instrument was administered to three cohorts of nursing students in a high-fidelity simulation with a scenario of hypovolemic hemorrhagic shock. Difficulty, discrimination, and fidelity indices were computed. The impact of the instrument on student's performance was assessed with a post-simulation survey.  Results: The instrument comprised 31 queries, which obtained high content validity indices. Most showed satisfying difficulty, discrimination, and fidelity properties. Inadequate properties of the queries may be explained by the content of the simulation scenario, the assessment practices of nursing students, and their reliance on medical assistance. Students perceived that completing the instrument helped them realize what they forgot to assess in the simulation.  Conclusions: This instrument appears as a promising research tool, although it still needs to be tested with other populations and in other patient deterioration simulation scenarios.

140	Domaines nodaux et points critiques de fonctions propres d’opérateurs de Schrödinger	The theme of this thesis is the study of the eigenfunctions of the Laplacian and Schrödinger operators. Let (M,g) be a manifold and V : M → R. We are looking at solutions of the following equation: (∆_g + V ) f_λ = λ f_λ .  The operator ∆_g + V is called a Schrödinger operator and V is called the potential. The simplest and most studied example is the Laplacian (we put V ≡ 0 on M ). If M is compact and without boundary, then there exists a sequence 0 = λ_0 < λ_1 ≤ λ_2 -> +∞ that makes the spectrum of ∆_g and a sequence of eigenfunctions f_n such that ∆_g f_n = λ_n f_n . This decomposition also holds for various potentials and manifolds. Firstly, we studied the nodal domains of the eigenfunctions as the eigenvalues tend to infinity. The nodal domains of a function f on M are the connected components of M \f^{−1} (0). They can be used to understand the oscillatory character of eigenfunctions by counting the number of times that f changes sign. The principal goal of this thesis was to generalize Pleijel’s nodal domain theorem [52] to other Schrödinger operators. In the article [2], we showed that the upper bound in Pleijel’s theorem also holds for the quantum harmonic oscillator. Furthermore, this bound can be improved depending on the quadratic form that defines the potential. Afterwards, in the article [3], we generalized the result from [2] to a large class of radial potentials, including ones that tend to zero at infinity. These include the Coulomb potential, which modelizes the hydrogen atom in free space.  We also studied the number of critical points of Laplace eigenfunctions. Until recently, there were only known lower bounds for certain manifolds [36], but no upper bound was known. In 2019, Buhovsky, Logunov and Sodin [18] constructed a metric on T^2 and a sequence of Laplace eigenfunctions which all have infinitely many critical points. In our article [4], we used a different method to create metrics on T^2 and S^2 and Laplace eigenfunctions for these metrics that have infinitely many critical points. Furthermore, these metrics can be taken arbitrarily close to the flat metric on T^2 and the round metric on S^2. These constructions also provide strong counterexamples to the Courant-Hermann conjecture on the number of nodal domains of linear combinations of Laplace eigenfunctions.

141	Advances in deep learning methods for speech recognition and understanding	This work presents several studies in the areas of speech recognition and     understanding.     The semantic speech understanding is an important sub-domain of the     broader field of artificial intelligence.     Speech processing has had interest from the researchers for long time     because language is one of the defining characteristics of a human being.     With the development of neural networks, the domain has seen rapid progress     both in terms of accuracy and human perception.     Another important milestone was achieved with the development of     end-to-end approaches.     Such approaches allow co-adaptation of all the parts of the model     thus increasing the performance, as well as simplifying the training     procedure.     End-to-end models became feasible with the increasing amount of available     data, computational resources, and most importantly with many novel     architectural developments.     Nevertheless, traditional, non end-to-end, approaches are still relevant     for speech processing due to challenging data in noisy environments,     accented speech, and high variety of dialects.      In the first work, we explore the hybrid speech recognition in noisy     environments.     We propose to treat the recognition in the unseen noise condition     as the domain adaptation task.     For this, we use the novel at the time technique of the adversarial     domain adaptation.     In the nutshell, this prior work proposed to train features in such     a way that they are discriminative for the primary task,     but non-discriminative for the secondary task.     This secondary task is constructed to be the domain recognition task.     Thus, the features trained are invariant towards the domain at hand.     In our work, we adopt this technique and modify it for the task of     noisy speech recognition.      In the second work, we develop a general method for regularizing     the generative recurrent networks.     It is known that the recurrent networks frequently have difficulties     staying on same track when generating long outputs.     While it is possible to use bi-directional networks for better     sequence aggregation for feature learning, it is not applicable     for the generative case.     We developed a way improve the consistency of generating long sequences     with recurrent networks.     We propose a way to construct a model similar to bi-directional network.     The key insight is to use a soft L2 loss between the forward and     the backward generative recurrent networks.     We provide experimental evaluation on a multitude of tasks and datasets,     including speech recognition, image captioning, and language modeling.      In the third paper, we investigate the possibility of developing     an end-to-end intent recognizer for spoken language understanding.     The semantic spoken language understanding is an important     step towards developing a human-like artificial intelligence.     We have seen that the end-to-end approaches show high     performance on the tasks including machine translation and speech recognition.     We draw the inspiration from the prior works to develop     an end-to-end system for intent recognition.

142	Canadian reds : the Young Communist League of Canada, international communism and the Soviet experience (1917-1939)	The dissertation represents the first attempt to construct a narrative about the Young Communist League of Canada (founded in 1923) during the inter-war period, so far absent in existing research on Canadian communism or socialism. The thesis focuses on the evolution of the relationship between the Young Communist League (YCL) and the Communist International and Young Communist International where Soviet Communists played a predominant role. It sheds light on numerous minor and major changes of policy shaped by the national and international contexts in which these organisations had to act.  The dissertation argues that despite genuine enthusiasm toward the International’s line and the Soviet experience, Young Canadian Communists often found it difficult to implement the International’s directives in Canada. Neither the International nor the communist movement in Canada was monolithic. On the contrary, there appear to have been numerous conflicts on three levels: between the International and the League; between the League and the Communist Party of Canada; and between local or linguistic groups in the League and its national leadership. The state repression of the left during the whole inter-war period, derisory level of funding and membership numbers also impeded the implementation of the International’s policies. At the same time, the International’s weaker levels of control allowed for a certain degree of flexibility and autonomy in the Canadian League’s policies. Following the position of the Young Communist International, the Canadian communist youth placed special emphasis on anti-capitalist and anti-imperialist, and later anti-fascist and anti-Nazi, militancy. However, the League appeared to have acted independently as far as immediate demands of the youth and cultural policies were concerned, especially during the Great Depression era. The League engaged in joint activism with other youth organisations, even when Moscow did not encourage such strategy. The initiatives often came from local grassroots organizers, although Canadian authorities were convinced that Moscow was behind each and every action of the League.  In the 1930s in particular the YCL, through a network of social and cultural organisations, gained access to youth of different political orientations – the socialist left, centre-left and even “bourgeois forces.” The YCL’s impact and outreach were further increased by the fact that the organisation’s sympathizers, if not members, belonged to diverse social backgrounds and included not only young workers and farmers but also High School and University students, artists, sportsmen, young white collars, many of them belonging to religious youth groups. For these young people, the YCL was the place that provided Marxist solutions to burning questions of the time such as youth unemployment and absence of welfare, social injustice, growth of fascism and imperialism in Canada and abroad.

143	Conception, synthèse et applications biologiques d’inhibiteurs de biofilms à base d’imidazole et de benzimidazole	Antibiotic resistance is one of the most serious threats to global health nowadays. Emergence of resistant bacteria encourages researchers to develop new antibiotics and strategies to mitigate their different resistance mechanisms. One of these defense mechanisms is the formation of biofilms. In this form, bacteria develop a protective extracellular matrix making them more resistant to various antimicrobial treatments. We have designed and synthesized membrane destabilizing compounds with three key features: a benzimidazolium or an imidazolium cation, a hydrophobic apolar chain, and a lipophilic anion recognition site. These characteristics give these compounds increased antimicrobial activity and greater ability to disrupt cell membranes. These membrane-disrupting compounds act via a fast and efficient mechanism and showed good results against MRSA (methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus) strains as promising antibiofilms candidates. These new agents have the potential to disperse and inhibit the formation of biofilms and could have a positive impact on human medicine in the future.

144	Factors influencing dietary supplements use help identifying athletes with risky behaviors	Dietary supplements (DS) consumption is widespread among athletes. Despite evidence-based benefits, DS have proven to represent a risk for transitioning toward prohibited substances and even failing an anti-doping test due to contamination. A sequential mixed-method research design was used to explore the factors affecting athletes’ decision-making process underlying DS use. Varsity athletes (n=10) participated in semi-structured interviews that were thematically analyzed. In addition, a survey was conducted (n=162). Results indicated that athletes who consume DS to improve performance and experiencing little to no benefits could be more prone to transition toward prohibited substances. A high prevalence of DS use in varsity athletes was also observed (>90%), with males consuming more DS products. Nutritionists were ranked as the most importance source of information regarding DS; however, only 4% of athletes consulted one. A follow-up preliminary study conducted on elite athletes (semi-structured interviews: n=7; questionnaire: n=36) was also performed to compare those athlete populations. Minimizing DS consumption risks could be achieved by targeting the most vulnerable segment of the athletics population based on the following criteria: 1) being a male; 2) not being enrolled in a health program; 3) not having followed a DS workshop; 4) consuming DS to improve performance without experiencing significant improvements; or 5) consuming more than three different DS.

145	Brexit - populist reaction to the 2008 speculative bubble bursting?	As evidence accumulates about the harmful effects Brexit is likely to cause to the British economy, one may wonder what made a majority of Brits vote to leave the EU. Rather than treat it as a fit of ill temper or an unfortunate accident, this paper explores the idea that it should be seen as a populist reaction triggered by the burst of the speculative bubble in 2008-2009 and the subsequent economic mayhem. To make the case, the paper looks at (1) what populism is, (2) how it can arise as part of long-term economic waves and (3) what precisely happened in Britain before and after 2009.

146	Mesure de la déformation pleurale régionale durant la ventilation mécanique par élastographie ultrasonore : une étude preuve de concept	Mechanical ventilation is a common therapy in operating rooms and intensive care units. When ill-adapted, it can lead to ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), which in turn is associated with poor outcomes. Excessive regional pulmonary strain is thought to be a major mechanism responsible for VILI. Scarce bedside methods exist to measure regional pulmonary strain. We propose a novel way to measure regional pleural strain using ultrasound elastography. We conducted a single blind randomized crossover pilot study in 10 patients requiring general anesthesia. After induction, patients were received tidal volumes of 6, 8, 10 and 12 mL.kg-1 in random order, while pleural ultrasound cineloops were acquired at 4 standardized locations. Ultrasound radiofrequency speckle tracking allowed computing various pleural translation, strain and shear components. These were screened to identify those with the best dose-response with tidal volumes using linear mixed effect models. Goodness-of-fit was assessed by the coefficient of determination. Intraobserver, interobserver and test-retest reliability were calculated using intraclass correlation coefficients. Analysis was possible in 90.7% of ultrasound cineloops. Lateral absolute shear, lateral absolute strain and Von Mises strain varied significantly with tidal volume and offered the best dose-responses and data modelling fits. Point estimates for intraobserver reliability measures were excellent for all 3 parameters (0.94, 0.94 and 0.93, respectively). Point estimates for interobserver (0.84, 0.83 and 0.77, respectively) and test-retest (0.85, 0.82 and 0.76, respectively) reliability measures were good. Thus, strain imaging is feasible and reproducible, and may eventually guide mechanical ventilation strategies in larger cohorts of patients.

147	Strain ultrasound elastography of aneurysm sac content after randomized endoleak embolization with sclerosing and non-sclerosing chitosan-based hydrogels in a preclinical model	Background: Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is the modality of choice for the treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). EVAR is limited by the development of endoleaks, which necessitate long-term imaging follow-up. Conventional follow-up modalities suffer from unique limitations. Strain ultrasound elastography (SUE) has been recently proposed as an imaging adjunct to detect endoleaks and to characterize aneurysm mechanical properties. Once detected, certain endoleaks may be treated with embolization; however, success is limited. In this context, the embolic agent CH-STS—containing a chitosan hydrogel and the sclerosant sodium tetradecyl sulphate (STS)—was created. CH-STS demonstrates favorable mechanical properties in vitro; however, its behavior in vivo and impact on sac evolution compared to a non-sclerosing chitosan-based embolic agent (CH) merit further characterization. Purpose: To compare the mechanical properties of the constituents of endoleaks embolized with CH and CH-STS—including the agent, the intraluminal thrombus (ILT), and the overall sac—via SUE. Methods: Bilateral common iliac artery aneurysms with type I endoleaks were created in nine dogs. In each animal, one endoleak was randomly embolized with CH, and the other with CH-STS. Duplex ultrasound (DUS) and radiofrequency cine loops were acquired at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and—in 3 subjects—6 months post-embolization. Contrast-enhanced CT was performed at 3 months and—where applicable—6 months post-embolization. Histopathological analysis was performed at time of sacrifice. Radiological studies and histopathological slides were co-registered to identify three regions of interest (ROIs) on the cine loops: embolic agent (at sacrifice), ILT (at sacrifice), and aneurysm sac (at all follow-up times). SUE was performed using segmentations from two independent observers on the cine loops. Maximum axial deformation (MAD) was the main outcome. Statistical analysis was performed using general linear mixed models and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). Results: Residual endoleaks were identified in 7/9 (77.8%) and 4/9 (44.4%) aneurysms embolized with CH and CH-STS, respectively. CH-STS had a 66 % lower MAD (p < 0.001) than CH. The ILT had a 37% lower MAD (p = 0.010) than CH and a 77% greater MAD (p = 0.079; trending towards significance) than CH-STS. There was no difference in the ILT between treatment groups. Aneurysm sacs embolized with CH-STS had a 29% lower MAD (p < 0.001) than those with CH. Residual endoleak increased MAD of the aneurysm sac by 53% (p < 0.001), regardless of the agent used. The ICC for MAD was 0.807 between readers’ segmentations. Conclusion: CH-STS confers lower strain values to embolized aneurysms. Persistent endoleaks result are associated with increased sac strain, which may be useful for clinical follow-up.

148	Development of a protocol with concentrated bacteria for fecal microbiota transplantation and impact on the equine fecal microbiota after antibiotic-induced dysbiosis	The equine gut microbiota plays an important role in maintaining the health of the host. The gut microbiota is composed of many microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and archaea. However, the majority of these microbial cells are bacterial cells, and consequently, many studies, including the present one, focus on exploring bacterial communities in the gut. An imbalance of the gut microbiota, termed dysbiosis, has been observed in several conditions such as colitis, colic, after antibiotic administration, or diet modification. Restoration of the gut to a healthy state can be performed through fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). Studies using current recommendations for FMT have shown clinical recovery in horses with diarrhea, but the microbiota remains largely unchanged after FMT and no controlled studies have been performed.  The hypotheses of this project were that treatment with concentrated FMT will correct dysbiosis faster than conventional FMT and the vehicle, and that the gut microbiota of horses treated with concentrated FMT will resemble the gut microbiota of the donor. The objective of this project was to develop an improved protocol for FMT in horses, by increasing the concentration of bacteria found in the donor stool using centrifugation, and to test it in horses with antibiotic-induced intestinal dysbiosis.   The antibiotic trimethoprim sulfadiazine (TMS) was administered to nine horses to induce intestinal dysbiosis. Horses were separated into three groups: horses receiving concentrated FMT (cFMT) (n=3); horses receiving fresh FMT (fFMT), as per current recommendations (n=3); horses receiving a vehicle (VEH) with 10% glycerol in 0.9% saline (n=3). Fecal samples were collected before and after antibiotic administration, as well as before, during, and after transplantation. Sequencing was performed using the Illumina MiSeq platform and data analysed using the software Mothur.  As expected, the antibiotic TMS significantly decreased the richness in all horses (P < 0.05). Unexpectedly, the membership of the cFMT and fFMT donor fecal suspensions was significantly different from cFMT and fFMT recipients’ baseline membership, respectively. The membership of the cFMT and fFMT recipient horses was significantly different after transplantation, while the vehicle recipients were not. In addition, the Escherichia genus was found in significantly higher relative abundances in the cFMT donor fecal suspensions when compared to the fFMT donor fecal suspensions.  The main limitations of this study are the small sample size and exposure of cFMT donor stool to oxygen and freeze-thawing. In addition, the dysbiosis model may not be optimal to test the efficacy of FMT, and studies performing FMT in horses with diarrhea are warranted. This study contributed to the search for novel approaches to improve FMT in horses. The weak effect of both FMT protocols on the gut microbiota and the increase in Escherichia suggest that further clinical studies are needed before FMT can be recommended to treat and prevent dysbiosis in horses.

149	La gaine carpienne chez le cheval : comment améliorer les techniques diagnostiques de base actuelles?	Objective: (1) To assess the effect of carpal sheath anaesthesia on skin sensitivity of the distal forelimb and to determine potential locations for desensitisation of palmar nerves. (2) To investigate the use of a needle arthroscope for diagnostic tenoscopy of the carpal sheath in standing horses. Study design: Experimental ex vivo and in vivo studies. Animals: Cadaveric limbs (n=20+6) and live horses (n=8+6). Methods: (1) Mechanical nociception of the distal forelimb was measured with a dynamometer on 8 horses between t0 and t180mn after intrathecal anesthesia (mepivacaine). Twenty cadaveric limbs were prepared and dissected transversally or longitudinally. (2) Needle and regular arthroscopes were compared during carpal sheath tenoscopy of 6 cadaveric limbs. Then, standing carpal sheath tenoscopy was performed in 6 sedated healthy horses with the needle arthroscope.  Results: (1) Six out of 8 horses were completely desensitized on both heel bulbs. Cadaveric specimens revealed close proximity between the sheath and palmar nerves at 2 possible diffusion sites identified. (2) Needle arthroscopy allowed thorough visualization of the proximal region of the carpal sheath in cadaveric limbs and standing horses (6/6). However, remaining flexor tendons tension limited visualization of the superficial digital flexor tendon in 4/6 of horses. Conclusion: (1) Carpal sheath anaesthesia should be interpreted within 15min post-injection and perineural or articular blocks distal to the carpus should be delayed for more than 3 hours post-carpal sheath anesthesia.

150	Impacts de divers régimes d’élevage sur l’abondance des gènes de résistance et sur le microbiote cæcal de poulets de chair au Québec	The ever-increasing problem of antibiotic resistance makes routine use of antibiotics in animal production no longer considered as a reasonable and viable practice. Preserving the effectiveness of antibiotics represents a major challenge for public and animal health. The Chicken Farmers of Canada have developed and are implementing an Antimicrobial Use Reduction Strategy which ultimate goal is eliminating the preventive use of medically-important antibiotics in broiler chicken and turkey productions. While it is known that the reduction of antibiotics in broiler chicken farms is associated with an increase in the incidence of necrotic enteritis caused by Clostridium perfringens, to which a proportion of this bacterial population produces the enterotoxin who can also generates consequences for human health, very little is known about the real overall impact of an antibiotic use reduction strategy in complex ecosystems such as the bird intestine or the commercial broiler chicken farm. The main objectives of the present study were to quantify the abundance of antibiotic resistance genes, to assess the presence of Clostridium perfringens and his enterotoxin and to characterize the composition of the cæcal microbiota in broiler chicken flocks from six commercial farms located in Québec and submitted to either a short-term conventional or drug-free program (15 months) or a long-term conventional or judicious antibiotic use program (six years). Implementing an antibiotic-free program over a 15-month period did not reduce the abundance of many antibiotic resistance-encoding genes, whereas a judicious use of antibiotics over six years did. The short-term antibiotic withdrawal and the long-term judicious use strategy altered the cæcal microbiota composition, with Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae families being negatively impacted, in agreement with the lower production performance and with the increased C. perfringens populations observed for farms phasing out the use of antibiotics in a short-term antibiotic withdrawal. Adopting a long-term conventional rearing program on commercial broiler chicken farms selected for specific antibiotic resistance-encoding genes in many barns. This study highlights the potential impacts of different rearing programs in poultry production and will help guide future policies in order to reduce the use of antibiotics and ultimately reduce the phenomenon of antibiotic resistance.

151	"Symphonie no 3 en mi bémol majeur, op. 55, dite « Eroica », de Ludwig van Beethoven : a
nalyse musicale de l’Allegro con brio et exégèse maçonnique"	At the beginning of the 19th century, the changes coming from France dominate the European sociopolitical landscape. In reaction to these, Franz I restricts individual freedom of the subjects of the Holy Roman Empire, while within the aristocracy, the numbers of adepts of the Aufklärung movement and believers in freedom and tolerance are growing. It is in this context that Beethoven composes his Third Symphony in 1803-104. Solomon (2004) has demonstrated that his whole life, the composer was surrounded with members of the  Aufklärung, many of them also freemasons. Masonic symbols in Beethoven’s hand are even to be found on a page of his sketchbook for the Eroica (Lockwood, 2013). Therefore, it only seems logical to analyse the symphony from the angle of a masonic interpretation. A formal analysis of the first movement according to Caplin’s method (1998), the first of its kind to be applied to a whole movement from a Beethoven symphony, brings to the fore a marked recurrence of the number three throughout numerous parameters (tonality, measure, rhythm, form, instrumentation). Furthermore, all three steps of the masonic initiation rite (death, burial and resurrection) are represented in the first three movements, whereas one also finds references to the French motto of Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité in the last three. This new reading of a fundamental work of the symphonic canon represents a novel contribution to the historiography of Beethoven.

153	Diverse perspectives on interdisciplinarity from the Members of the College of the Royal Society of Canada	Various multiple-disciplinary terms and concepts (although most commonly “interdisciplinarity”, which is used herein) are used to frame education, scholarship, research, and interactions within and outside academia. In principle, the premise of interdisciplinarity may appear to have many strengths; yet, the extent to which interdisciplinarity is embraced by the current generation of academics, the benefits and risks for doing so, and the barriers and facilitators to achieving interdisciplinarity represent inherent challenges. Much has been written on the topic of interdisciplinarity, but to our knowledge there have been few attempts to consider and present diverse perspectives from scholars, artists, and scientists in a cohesive manner. As a team of 57 members from the Canadian College of New Scholars, Artists, and Scientists of the Royal Society of Canada (the College) who self-identify as being engaged or interested in interdisciplinarity, we provide diverse intellectual, cultural, and social perspectives. The goal of this paper is to share our collective wisdom on this topic with the broader community and to stimulate discourse and debate on the merits and challenges associated with interdisciplinarity. Perhaps the clearest message emerging from this exercise is that working across established boundaries of scholarly communities is rewarding, necessary, and is more likely to result in impact. However, there are barriers that limit the ease with which this can occur (e.g., lack of institutional structures and funding to facilitate cross-disciplinary exploration). Occasionally, there can be significant risk associated with doing interdisciplinary work (e.g., lack of adequate measurement or recognition of work by disciplinary peers). Solving many of the world’s complex and pressing problems (e.g., climate change, sustainable agriculture, the burden of chronic disease, and aging populations) demand thinking and working across long-standing, but in some ways restrictive, academic boundaries. Academic institutions and key support structures, especially funding bodies, will play an important role in helping to realize what is readily apparent to all who contributed to this paper—that interdisciplinarity is essential for solving complex problems; it is the new norm. Failure to empower and encourage those doing this research will serve as a great impediment to training, knowledge, and addressing societal issues.

154	Des enseignants du secondaire aux prises avec des transformations corporelles et langagières transcontextuelles et socialement situées	What happens when the secondary school teacher is at a distance from his students? When teacher and students are not familiar ? How much are the teacher's social experiences about his practice ? These are some of the questions that interest us in this work. Teachers transform and partially adjust their dispositions. This is based on exploratory work. But also on a campaign of interviews with secondary school teachers. The information collected in this context is the heart of the material used in this thesis. This work offers describe, understand and explain the forms of socializations and transformations - bodily and language - teachers who are fulfilled according to the work contexts. And explore the difficulties of teachers to transform and adapt to their students.	Dispositions , Corps , Sociology of education , Teachers , Body , Language	en	24653.0
155	Evolution of cooperation in evolutionary games with the opting-out strategy and under random environmental noise	In this thesis, we study the effects of a stochastic environment and the use of an opting-out strategy on the evolution of cooperation in evolutionary games. The thesis contains 8 articles, among which 6 are already published in peer-reviewed journals. Apart from the introduction, the thesis is divided into two parts, Part 1 made with 5 articles and Part 2 with 3 articles. Part 1 studies randomized payoffs in evolutionary games. Article 1 introduces stability concepts for 2x2 matrix games in infinite populations undergoing discrete, non-overlapping generations in a stochastic environment and gives conditions for an equilibrium, either on the boundary or in the interior of the simplex of all strategy frequencies, to be stochastically locally stable or unstable. Article 2 extends the results of Article 1 to the case where fitness is an exponential function of expected payoff in random pairwise interactions and shows that, unexpectedly, environmental random noise can break a periodic cycle and promote stability of an interior equilibrium. Article 3 discusses the effects of weak selection. While stability conditions in a random environment return to conditions in the deterministic case as selection intensity diminishes, random fluctuations in payoffs can accelerate the speed of convergence toward a stable equilibrium under weaker selection. Article 4 applies stochastic evolutionary stability theory to a randomized Prisoner's dilemma game and shows that increasing the variance in payoffs for defection is conducive to the evolution of cooperation. Article 5 studies randomized matrix games in finite populations and gives conditions for selection to favor the evolution of cooperation in the context of a randomized Prisoner's dilemma. Part 2 considers a repeated Prisoner's dilemma game with an opting-out behavior adopted by every player in pairwise interactions. Article 6 studies the evolutionary dynamics of cooperation and defection in this context and shows possible long-term coexistence, assuming an infinite population and fast (actually, instantaneous) equilibrium in the pair frequencies. Article 7 reports experimental results with 264 university students using the opting-out strategy that support the theoretical prediction of a long-term coexistence of cooperation and defection. Article 8 extends the analysis of the model with the opting-out strategy to the case of a finite population and provides a rigorous proof of the two-time scales for the frequencies of cooperation and defection on one hand and the frequencies of strategy pairs on the other.

156	Nouvelles approches dans l’immunothérapie de la leucémie aigüe lymphoblastique utilisant les récepteurs chimériques d’antigène	Immunotherapy has allowed major advances in cancer therapy. The treatment using modified T cells with a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) completely changed the vision of leukemia therapy. The efficiency against resistant cancer paved the way to cellular and gene therapy in this context. Despite very positive results at first, the disappearance and exhaustion of therapeutic cells seems to be a major problem to maintain the efficiency of the CAR treatment and prevent relapses. The work of this thesis is to allow the use cell types other than T cells for CAR therapy. The hypothesis is that NK cells or hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) could overcome the limitation of CAR therapy using T cells. To allow the use of CAR NK cells, a major technical issue is the transduction by viral vectors. The work presented here shows the use of BaEV envelope to pseudotype vectors allows an efficient transduction of NK cells. Using this method, we were able to produce large amounts of CAR NK cells, showing the possibility to use NK cells in CAR therapy. The use of HSC in CAR therapy, could allow the permanent replenishment of the pool of CAR T cells once exhausted. Despite that advantage, the overexpression of a CAR receptor on all hematopoietic cells coming from those HSC could be an issue. To allow the use of HSC, we developed short specific promoters restraining the expression of the transgene to a precise population. We prove the specificity of a T cell promoter and demonstrated the possibility to use it in CAR therapy using HSC. This work is a proof of concept of the use of other population than T cells in CAR therapy.

157	Effects of an interactive Web training to support parents in reducing challenging behaviors in children with autism	Many children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) engage in challenging behaviors, which may interfere with their daily functioning, development, and well-being. To address this issue, we conducted a four-week randomized waitlist control trial to examine the effects of a fully self-guided interactive web training (IWT) on (a) child engagement in challenging behaviors and (b) parental intervention. After 4 weeks, parents in the treatment group reported lower levels of challenging behaviors in their children and more frequent use of behavioral interventions than those in the waitlist groups. Furthermore, within-group analyses suggest that these changes persisted up to 12 weeks following completion of the IWT. Our results highlight the potential utility of web training, but our high attrition rate and potential side effects prevent us from recommending the training as a standalone treatment.

158	Using whole-exome sequencing data in an exome-wide association study approach to identify genetic risk factors influencing acute lymphoblastic leukemia response : a focus on asparaginase complications & vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy	Treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), a malignant disorder of lymphoid progenitor cells has improved significantly over the past decades and treatment success rates have surpassed 90% in favorable settings. However, treatment-related toxicities can be life-threatening and cause treatment interruption or cessation. Allergy, pancreatitis and thrombosis are common complications of ALL treatment associated with the use of asparaginase (ASNase), while vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy (VIPN) is a frequent toxicity of vincristine (VCR). It is a sensitive process and a constant struggle to adjust the dosing regimen to ensure maximum efficacy and minimum toxicity. Pharmacogenetics studies show alterations in the genetic component between individuals can influence the observed variability in treatment response. A better understanding of the molecular basis of this variability in drug effect could significantly improve treatment outcome by allowing the personalization of ALL treatment based on the genetic profile of the patient. Emerging reports suggest the benefit of applying exome analysis to uncover variants associated with complex human traits as well as drug response phenotypes. Our objective in this work was to use available whole-exome sequencing data to perform exome-wide association studies followed by stepwise filtering and validation processes to identify novel variants with a potential to modulate the risk of developing ASNase complications and VIPN. Twelve SNPs were associated with ASNase complications in the discovery cohort including 3 associated with allergy, 3 with pancreatitis and 6 with thrombosis. Of those, rs3809849 in MYBBP1A, rs11556218 in IL16 and rs34708521 in SPEF2 genes were associated with multiple complications and their association with pancreatitis was replicated in an independent validation cohort. As for VCR, three variants were associated with modulating the risk of VIPN: rs2781377 in SYNE2, rs10513762 in MRPL47 and rs3803357 in BAHD1. We also demonstrate a strong combined effect of harbouring multiple risk variants for each of the studied toxicities, and provide internally-validated risk-prediction models based on the weighted genetic risk score method for pancreatitis and VIPN. Furthermore, given the association of the polymorphism in MYBBP1A gene with multiple treatment outcomes, we aimed at understanding how this genetic alteration translates into differences in ASNase treatment response through cell-based functional analysis. Using CRISPR-CAS9 technology we produced gene knockout of PANC1 (pancreatic) cancer cell-lines and tested the difference in viability between the knockouts and wild-type cells following gene deletion and ASNase treatment. Our results suggest a functional role of this gene in modulating the viability, proliferation capacity and the morphology of the knockout cells as well as their sensitivity to ASNase and further advocates the implication of the gene in influencing the outcome of ALL treatment with ASNase. The present work demonstrates that using whole-exome sequencing data in the context of exome-wide association study is a successful “hypothesis-free” strategy for identifying novel genetic markers modulating the effect of childhood ALL treatment and highlights the importance of the synergistic effect of combining risk loci.

159	Impact de la rigidité artérielle sur le cerveau et effets bénéfiques potentiels de l’œstradiol et de la vitamine K	Epidemiological studies have associated arterial stiffness with cognitive decline and dementia. However, its effects on the brain biology remain unknown. In our first study, using a new murine model of arterial stiffness, we wanted to characterize the effects of arterial stiffness on the brain independently of age and pressure. Our results indicate that arterial stiffness impairs the regulation of cerebral blood flow and the integrity of the cerebrovascular system, damaging the blood-brain barrier and leading to cognitive deficits. Arterial stiffness results in significant alterations in resting cerebral blood flow and mechanisms regulating cerebral blood flow such as cerebral autoregulation, neurovascular coupling, and endothelial function.  In our second study we sought to understand sexual dimorphism in arterial stiffness and its consequences on the brain in the same model. Our results show that arterial stiffness leads to impaired neurovascular coupling and endothelial-dependent vascular reactivity in male mice but not in female reproductive mice. In ovariectomized mice this protection was suppressed but was restored by estradiol treatment. In the third study, we wanted to study the possibility of preventing arterial stiffness and its subsequent effects on the brain. In this study, we used vitamin K (phylloquinone or VK1 and menaquinone-4 or MK-4) for its anti-calcifying action and its beneficial effects on the cognitive functions observed in other animal models and in humans. This study demonstrated that VK prevent cognitive impairment in part by restoring the resting cerebral blood flow but also by preventing vascular calcification. Learning abilities increase with the contribution of food VK, which in turn correlates with the VK content of the brain. These studies provide a better understanding of arterial stiffness and demonstrate the potential of VK and hormone therapy with estradiol in preventing its effects on the brain. However, further studies are needed to determine all the mechanisms involved in the brain protection by VK and estradiol.

160	Using AB designs with nonoverlap effect size measures to support clinical decision-making : a Monte Carlo validation	Single-case experimental designs often require extended baselines or the withdrawal of treatment, which may not be feasible or ethical in some practical settings. The quasi-experimental AB design is a potential alternative, but more research is needed on its validity. The purpose of our study was to examine the validity of using nonoverlap measures of effect size to detect changes in AB designs using simulated data. In our analyses, we determined thresholds for three effect size measures beyond which the type I error rate would remain below 0.05 and then examined whether using these thresholds would provide sufficient power. Overall, our analyses show that some effect size measures may provide adequate control over type I error rate and sufficient power when analyzing data from AB designs. In sum, our results suggest that practitioners may use quasi-experimental AB designs in combination with effect size to rigorously assess progress in practice.

161	The mediating role of adolescents’ loneliness and social withdrawal in the association between maternal depressive symptoms and suicidality in adolescence : a 20-year population-based study	We examined whether adolescents’ loneliness and social withdrawal mediated the association between maternal depressive symptoms and adolescent suicidality. Secondary analyses on the Québec Longitudinal Study of Child Development data were conducted (n = 1,623). Each mother completed the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (at child ages 5 months, 1.5, 3.5, 5, and 7 years). Adolescent's social withdrawal (adolescent, father, and teacher reported at 10, 12, and 13 years) and loneliness (adolescent reported at 10, 12, and 13 years), were assessed using items from the Social Behavior Questionnaire and the Loneliness and Social Satisfaction Questionnaire, respectively. Adolescents completed self-reports to assess suicidal thoughts and attempts at 13, 15, 17, and 20 years. Children of mothers with higher levels of maternal depressive symptoms had an increased risk for suicidality (OR = 1.15, 95% CI: 1.03–1.28). Loneliness explained 16% of the total effect of maternal depressive symptoms on adolescent suicidality (indirect effect OR = 1.02, 95% CI: 1.00–1.04). There was no indirect effect of maternal depressive symptoms on adolescent suicidal outcomes via social withdrawal (indirect effect OR = 1.00, 95% CI: 0.99–1.02). Interventions that target loneliness may be beneficial for decreasing the risk for suicidality among adolescents of mothers with depressive symptoms.

162	Le programme FADéPI et l’actualisation du leadership de la direction d’école dans le cycle de vie de plan d’intervention	The quebecor school, as it is today, holds numerous roles within society and in the developmental process of the child. Its multiple and different roles are continuously growing in complexity, while needing to address and service various learning profiles, precisely special needs students. At the head of the school’s ecosystem, there is a leader commonly called a school principal. The role of this individual calls for a wide array of skills, knowledge and abilities to perform daily educational, logistical and financial operations, all while ensuring the well-being and success of all students through a reflective leadership which cares for matters related to an inclusive education. In the case of students with special needs, the intervention education plan (IEP) is recognized as a life cycle for the planning, elaborating and reviewing of interventions. Taking into account the growing proportion of students, whose success depends on the quality of the interventions they benefit from, the IEP has become a fundamental tool for their inclusion, both educational and social. According to the Public Instruction Act, within the school, the responsibility for IEPs goes to the school principal.  There are many projects, programs and support systems to successfully complete the IEP life cycle, Myara (2011). However, the different leadership practices in relation to the IEP life cycle are not always clear. For this reason, our specific exploratory research aims, first of all, to document and analyze the forms and levels of involvement of the school principal in the IEP life cycle. Secondly, this study attempts to explore the evolution of the leadership practices in the IEP life cycle following the implementation of a training and support program for its development (FADéPI).    Overall, our research results have enabled us to establish that the school principal’s leadership in the IEP life cycle comes in different forms of involvement (direct and indirect) that are in fact a set of knowledge, abilities and skills. In addition, our results have also enabled us to witness an evolution, rather a change or an improvement of these leadership practices. Finally, the purpose of our study is to suggest forms of involvement and leadership practices in the IEP life cycle that can help promote inclusion and success for the student with special needs.	leadership , inclusion , Individualized education plan , IEP , special needs students , school principal	en	24561.0
163	Relation entre l’exposition aux parabènes et les hormones de la reproduction : une étude chez les jeunes filles canadiennes	Background: Parabens are chemical substances used as preservatives for their antibacterial and antifungal properties in many everyday products (personal care, cosmetics, pharmaceutical and food). Several in vitro and in vivo studies have shown their endocrine disrupting potential, raising some concerns for potential adverse human health effects.  Objective: To assess the cross-sectional association between urinary concentration of parabens and serum reproductive hormones (estradiol, progesterone, follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone) in girls in the general Canadian population. Methods: Data from the Canadian Health Measures Survey (2014 – 2015) on girls aged 6-17 were used for this study. Associations between hormones and parabens were analyzed with multivariable linear regressions, adjusting for potential confounders (i.e., age, body mass index, ethnicity, household income, and sampling season). Results: The girls and teens included in the study (n=382) were mostly white (76%), had a normal body mass index (73%), and detectable levels of at least one paraben (92%). We observed significantly lower concentrations of reproductive hormones with higher paraben concentrations; there was no association with progesterone concentrations. A doubling in urinary parabens was associated with lower estradiol by 5.8% (95% CI -9.3, -2.1), lower FSH by 4.2% (95% CI -7.9, -0.3), and lower LH by 10.8% (95% CI -17.4, -3.7). Discussion: This study shows that exposure to parabens is associated with lower circulating levels of reproductive hormones in young girls in the general population. The cross-sectional design does not allow to make causal inferences. However, these results are consistent with animal studies and suggest that exposure to parabens during development may affect the functioning of the reproductive system. Future studies should employ a longitudinal design verify these results.

164	L'étendue effective de la pratique des infirmières œuvrant en soins de longue durée	According to world demographics, the population is aging and the complexity of health problems and the demand for geriatric care will continue to increase. In Quebec, it is estimated that 3% of elderly people with loss of autonomy are living in long-term care centres (CHSLDs). The complex health problems of long-term care residents are well known and are on the rise. In fact, 66% of the people housed are suffering from comorbidity, i.e., they have at least three chronic health problems. There is therefore an urgent need to adapt the care and services offered for the specific needs of residents in order to ensure safe and quality care. In 2018, the Ministry of Health and Social Services of Québec (MSSS) and the Order of Nurses of Quebec (OIIQ) issued recommendations to CHSLDs for the optimization of nursing practice. However, to meet the specific needs of CHSLD residents, nurses must be able to exercise their full scope of practice. To date, the studies available in the scientific literature on this subject have mainly explored the scope of nursing practice in hospitals rather than in CHSLDs. The results of these studies show that nurses only partially apply the knowledge gained from their education and experience in various care settings. To our knowledge, no study has measured the practice of nurses in CHSLDs. The purpose of this study is therefore to describe the scope of practice of nurses working in CHSLDs, using the scope of practice questionnaire (QÉPI), and to analyze whether there is an association with their level of education, either collegial or university. A descriptive correlational design was used for this study. Nurses (n = 93) from an integrated health and social services center (CISSS) in Quebec participated in the survey in the form of an online questionnaire. The results show an effective scope of practice of nurses working at the CISSS of 4,58/6 (SD = 0,74), which is greater than the results of other studies conducted with the QÉPI in hospital settings in Quebec. Analysis of the results did not allow us to conclude that there was a correlation between the level of collegial or university education and the effective scope of practice of nurses working in CHSLDs. This study is the first to have described and analyzed the effective scope of nursing practice in this setting using the QÉPI. Further studies will therefore be necessary in order to learn more about the scope of practice in a long term care environment.

165	La pratique infirmière en procréation médicalement assistée au sein d’un établissement de santé québécois : une étude autoethnographique	Problem: Infertility – classified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a reproductive system disease – affects an ever-increasing number of women and men. Today, one couple out of six of reproductive age struggles with this condition in Canada and in Quebec. It has an impact on the patients’ physical and psychological well-being, often leaving both partners stigmatized and socially isolated as infertility remains a societal taboo for many.  Infertility can be treated via Assisted Reproduction Technologies (ART) where the patients-families are cared for by fertility nurses, whose practice is both complex and diversified, but remains little-known. Purpose: This study explores the field of fertility nursing as it is practised in a Quebec healthcare institution. Method: The student-researcher chose to do an autoethnography in order to draw from her own experience as both a fertility nurse and a fertility patient. Semi-directed interviews, participant observation and field journal were used to collect data. A thematic analysis of data then followed. Results: The patients-families’ infertility experience is at the heart of the fertility nurse’s practice and relational care is the main dimension of that practice, regardless of which nursing activities are assigned to them in the clinic. These other dimensions were also reported : leadership/advocacy, learning/teaching, collaboration and technical interventions. These results coincide with the student-researcher’s experience, both as a fertility patient and as a fertility nurse. Impact: The student-researcher documented the practice of fertility nursing and showcased a method rarely used in nursing science: autoethnography.	advocacy , fertility nursing , assisted reproduction technologies , relational care , patient advocacy , autoethnography	en	24542.0
166	Composition avec la modalité multicyclique	This memoir elaborates on the outcome of my work during my master's degree in the instrumental composition program of Université de Montréal. It begins with a presentation of my poetic approach towards composition, where experiences of landscapes and happenings within them are illustrated through musical devices. What follows is a discussion of all methods I apply to harness the power of intervals to create these experiences. A significant chapter will be devoted to a rather intervallic approach towards modality in the form of multicyclical modes, as most of my work of this master's degree focuses on development of their use. The next chapter focus on all my explorations outside the modal structures, which are at earlier stages of development but have already given me solutions to procedures that are less applicable in a strictly modal context. That includes the treatment of cells, working with just pure intervals and integration of colours derived from the folk traditions of Eastern Europe, more specifically the Balkans. Finally, there will be a chapter that analyzes every individual work included here while digging deeper into the extra-musical imagination behind every work, determining its form and the character of all the sections including the mode of choice if there is one.

167	Insulin-induced retinal ganglion cell dendrite regeneration : characterization and identification of novel molecular mechanisms	Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. High intraocular pressure (IOP) is the most important risk factor to develop the disease. The retraction of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) dendrites is one of the earliest pathological changes leading to substantial functional deficits. We recently demonstrated that insulin, administered after arbor retraction, promoted remarkable RGC dendrite and synapse regeneration. Here, we asked the following questions: 1) is insulin effective at promoting RGC dendrite regeneration in experimental glaucoma? 2) is reduction of IOP sufficient to promote dendrite regeneration in the absence of exogenous insulin? 3) what are the signaling components downstream of insulin that stimulate RGC dendrite regeneration in glaucoma? Thy1-YFP mice, which allow visualization of RGC dendritic arbors, received an intracameral injection of magnetic microbeads to induce ocular hypertension. RGC dendrites were imaged by confocal microscopy and arbors were 3D reconstructed. Total RGC dendritic length and complexity increased in glaucomatous eyes treated with insulin to values similar to those found in intact non-injured controls, but not in eyes treated with brinzolamide, to lower IOP, or vehicle. RGCs were isolated by Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) from insulin- or vehicle-treated glaucomatous retinas as well as shamoperated controls, followed by RNA sequencing analysis (RNA-seq). Our data show a global decrease in transcriptional efficiency in glaucomatous retinas. In addition, we identified a number of key regulatory pathways potentially implicated in insulin-induced RGC dendrite regeneration including: the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), glycolysis, fatty acid metabolism, DNA repair, and myc-targets. These data allow us to draw the following conclusions: 1) insulin promotes robust RGC dendrite regeneration in glaucoma, 2) IOP reduction alone is not sufficient to promote dendritic regrowth, and 3) multiple molecular pathways are activated during insulin-mediated regeneration. These findings support a critical role for insulin administration to restore RGC dendritic structure, and identify differential gene expression that might reveal novel therapeutic targets for glaucoma.

168	La détermination d’un seuil moteur pour la stimulation vestibulaire galvanique (GVS) basé sur l’évaluation de l’accélération de la tête	INTRODUCTION: Galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) is used to assess the integrity of the vestibular system and to improve our understanding of the mechanisms of balance. However, the GVS-induced responses show great inter-individual variability, which makes it difficult to understand the contribution of the vestibular system in maintaining balance. OBJECTIVE: To develop a protocol identifying an objective vestibular threshold for GVS in order to limit this variability observed on GVS-induced responses. METHODS: Eighteen healthy right-handed subjects stood on a force platform, eyes closed, head forward. The head acceleration was recorded when the GVS (duration: 200 ms) was applied at intensities varying between 1 and 4.5mA. Recruitment curves were reconstructed to determine the objective threshold (T). Then, the participants were stimulated at different intensities relative to threshold (0.5T; 0.75T; 1T and 1.5T). The 95% confidence ellipse area, the velocity of the center of pressure (CoP) displacement and the electromyographic activity of the soleus muscle (SOL) were measured. RESULTS: 1) An objective threshold was determined for each subject based on the acceleration of the head. 2) The area of the ellipse, during stimulation, correlated with the stimulation intensity (r = 0.95; p = 0.03). 3) The amplitude of the 1st peak of the three-phase CoP velocity pattern also correlated with the stimulation intensity (r = 0.98; 0.04). 4) In addition, the amplitude of the medium latency response induced by the GVS on the SOL showed a significant correlation with the stimulation intensity (r = 0.7; p = 0.045). DISCUSSION: An objective vestibular threshold can be identified by an accelerometer. The vestibular responses measured by the ellipse area and the CoP are proportional to the stimulation intensities relative to the determined objective threshold.

169	Effect of spatial learning on the protein tyrosine phosphatase STEP	The Striatal-Enriched Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase (STEP) plays an important role in the regulation of synaptic strength, namely through its ability to oppose synaptic strengthening and encourage long term depression. Abnormal levels of STEP can impair normal learning and memory, and have been implicated in a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders such as Alzheimer's Disease. Though there are many known substrates and regulators of STEP, the full range of STEP interactions remains to be discovered. In this study, we used Proximity-dependent Biotin Identification (BioID) and affinity-purified mass spectrometry (AP-MS) in order to identify novel interactors of STEP. We then used the Morris water maze (MWM) protocol in rats to determine the effect of a spatial learning event on STEP61, non-phosphorylated STEP, neuromedin U receptor 1 (NMUR1) and neurologin-1 (NLGN-1) levels in the hippocampus of rats. Throughout our experiments, we determined that a natural environment rich with dramatically different distal cues was more conducive to spatial learning than a more uniform environment with only images available to be used as distal cues. We found also that total STEP61, non-phosphorylated-STEP, and NMUR1 did not change as a result of a spatial learning event, but that NLGN-1 was increased in one of the protocols used. Finally, we were unable to induce changes in STEP levels through the use of NMDA or DHPG to induce long-term depression (LTD) in dissociated hippocampal cultures. Further research is required in order to determine the nature of the novel interactions discovered, as well as how these are impacted by a spatial learning event, and the role of LTD or long-term potentiation (LTP) in these processes.

170	Développement d’un nouveau modèle de criblage tridimensionnel pour la découverte de médicaments épigénétiques contre le cancer du poumon	Small molecule development in oncology mainly involves high-throughput drug screenings and preclinical validation studies using cancer cells grown in two-dimension (2D). However, classical cell culture methods poorly reflect tumor biology and cell epigenome. Here, our objective is to develop a 3D model that displays key epigenetic features of solid tumors in order to identify new actionable targets. First, we determined culture conditions for long-term expansion of adenocarcinoma spheroids to allow cell adaptation and the occurrence of specific epigenetic features triggered by 3D condition. Our results demonstrate that cells cultivated in 3D spheroids exhibit significant phenotypic and epigenetic changes as compared to 2D monolayers. Notably, we observed numerous expression changes of key epigenetic regulators, all taken place at a different time-point of the 3D cell culture. We observed a decrease in the expression of the KAT3A/KAT3B complex as well as BRG1. HDAC6 expression also increased in 3D. Then, we asked whether epigenetic changes triggered by 3D culture would modify drug sensitivity. We performed a screening of 154 epigenetic drugs on cancer cells cultivated in 2D and in 3D at two different time points. 60% of epigenetic drugs showed significant anticancer activity against 2D monolayers. Interestingly, A549 cells in 3D spheroids became gradually resistant over time. Against 3D spheroids cultivated for 10 days, only 9% of epigenetic drugs in the drug library showed anticancer activity. Against 3D spheroids cultivated for 24 days, only a single epigenetic compound called MS023, a selective agent against type I PRMTs, reduced cell viability significantly. This sensitivity is correlated with an increase of arginine methylation observed within spheroids.  Taken together, we show that 3D spheroids trigger a time-dependent epigenetic context that increases lung cancer cells sensitivity to type I PRMT inhibition. 3D spheroids of well-characterized cancer cell lines will improve our understanding of tumor biology and drug discovery and can overcome the high false discovery rate associated with 2D classical models. 	High Throughput Screening , Lung Cancer , Epigenetics , 3-dimensional Models , Pharmacology , Drug discovery	en	24521.0
171	Differentiable PKC activation on pacemaking activity of cardiomyocytes derived from mouse embryonic stem cells	Cardiovascular diseases are often caused by arrhythmias that originate from an obstruction within the cardiac conduction system. The key player within that system is the sinoatrial (SA) node, which is responsible for initiation the electrical impulses at a regular interval, insuring the heartbeat at a normal pace. Dysfunction of the SA node would lead to electrical instabilities in the heart.  An acquired heart disease, such as rheumatic heart disease, or a conduction block are just some of many cases that would require an electronic pacemaker to monitor the heart rate and generate an impulse when it beats abnormally. Although the electric pacemaker is considered as a reliable therapy, it is not without limitations. These limitations include surgery complication, lead infection as well as limited battery lifespan, which requires replacement every few years thus adding to the hospital burden.  Several approaches have been taken to develop a more adequate therapeutic method. A strategy that will be investigated involves using a graft of pacemaker cells, fundamentally creating a biological pacemaker.  Cell therapy approaches use embryonic stem cells to evolve into the cardiac cell lines, including pacemaker cells. These pacing cells are characterized by spontaneous depolarization that create the rhythmic impulses in the heart and control the heart rate. An important element of the pacemaker cells that give rise to the spontaneous depolarization are the hyperpolarization- activated and cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels that are activated during hyperpolarization and conduct the funny current by increasing the cell’s inward permeability to sodium-potassium currents. On the other hand, the conduction rate is determined by connexin 30.2 and connexin 45, which are transmembrane proteins that assemble to form gap junctions. Both HCN expression and connexin expression has been linked to T-box factor 3 (Tbx3) in the development of atrial myocytes.  A practicable approach to modulate gene expression and consequently protein expression is using chemical conditioning. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) is a Protein Kinase C (PKC) activator that has linked to Tbx3 expression, and consequently HCN and   connexin expression, and lead to a modification in spontaneous activity.  Mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are cells that are isolated from the inner cell mass of early embryos. These cells can differentiate into all somatic cell types. Given the proper combination of growth factors, these cells can differentiate into cardiomyocytes.  We hypothesize that chronic conditioning of mice cardiomyocytes with PMA lead to an upregulation of Tbx3 expression and consequently an upregulation of HCN expression and connexin expression, therefore promoting the development of pacemaker cells within the cardiomyocyte population.  In order to test our hypothesis, we purchased cells from the mouse E14TG2A cell line. These cells were cultured in glass bottom petri dishes and differentiated into cardiomyocytes using a three-step protocol (shown in Methods section). The cardiomyocytes are then exposed to PMA in varying concentration (0.1 µM vs 1 µM) for either 1h (acute exposure) or 24 h (chronic exposure). The results varied between the experimental groups compared to the control. In all experimental conditions there seems to be an initial increase in spontaneous activity, but this is quickly reversed at the 24 h mark, where pacing decreased. Different concentration plays a dose-dependent role in long-lasting inhibitory effect on the pacing of the cells	Embryonic Stem Cells , Biological Pacemaker , PKC activator	en	24520.0
172	Investigation of the effect of lymphocytic microparticles on the activity of Müller cells in the oxygen-induced retinopathy mouse model	Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a potentially blinding ocular disorder in premature infants. It is caused by the formation of aberrant retinal neovascularization (NV). Recent studies have demonstrated that Müller cells are the primary producers of inflammation-inducing cytokines and growth factors in pathological conditions. Additionally, the recruitment of macrophages is significantly increased during retinal NV, which exerts a proangiogenic role in ROP. Lymphocytic microparticles (LMPs) are small membrane-wrapped vesicles released from human CEM T lymphocytes, which is a cell line of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In our previous studies, we demonstrated that LMPs derived from apoptosis-induced human CEM T lymphocytes possess potent angiostatic capacities. Therefore, we hypothesized that LMPs inhibit pathological retinal NV via targeting Müller cells in an ischemia-induced retinopathy mouse model. In this study, we investigated the effect of LMPs both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, we determined the influence of LMPs on Müller cell properties using rat Müller cells rMC-1 and murine macrophages RAW 264.7. The results revealed that LMPs were internalized and reduced cell proliferation of rMC-1 dose-dependently without inducing cell apoptosis. LMPs also inhibited the chemotactic capacity of rMC-1 on RAW 264.7, as well as the expression of the chemokines (VEGF and SDF-1) in rMC-1. In vivo, we intravitreally injected LMPs and found that LMPs was internalized by Müller cells. LMPs attenuated aberrant retinal NV and the infiltration of macrophages. LMPs also downregulated the expression of angiogenic factors/chemokines (VEGF and SDF-1) in Müller cells. Furthermore, LMPs downregulated the expression of ERK1/2 and HIF-1α in Müller cells. These findings expand our understanding of the effects of LMPs, providing evidence that LMPs are a potential treatment for retinal NV diseases.

173	Efficacité d'un programme d'activité physique basé sur le modèle transthéorique et sur les préférences-patient chez des individus atteints de troubles psychotiques	Introduction: Although 90 minutes or more/week of physical activity (PA) is recommended, few individuals with early psychosis (IEP) practice it despite the frequent presence of metabolic complications. The literature suggests that a PA intervention including their preferred PA and motivational counseling would facilitate their adherence. Objectives: To determine the feasibility, acceptability and impact of a PA intervention on PA motivation, PA level, sedentary time and social participation. Methods: Open clinical trial (pilot study) conducted with IEP. The PA intervention of 24 supervised PA sessions is based on “patients-preferences” and includes motivational counseling using the transtheoretical model. Feasibility and acceptability were measured by drop-out rates and attendance and satisfaction level. PA motivation, PA level, level of physical inactivity and social participation were measured pre and post intervention. Results: Of the 40 IEP (age: 25.63 ± 4.22 years, 52.5% of women) recruited, 40% dropped out and the attendance rate was 67.5%. The satisfaction was rated (94%) “very satisfied” to “very much”. The PA level increased from 52,71 to 91.79 minutes/week (reaching recommendations) and physical inactivity decreased from 90,85 to 33.75 ± 49.16 minutes. The intervention had no impact on PA motivation and social participation. Conclusion: Our preliminary results suggest that an intervention based on patient preferences is feasible and acceptable in IEP. Future randomised controlled trials would allow to determine if the decreased physical inactivity and increased PA levels are due to this intervention and if it may contribute to reduce the frequent metabolic complications in IEP.	motivation , Mental health , Psychotic disorder , First episode psychosis , Physical activity , Patient preferences , Trans theoretical model , Behavior change	en	24492.0
174	Quels ont été les stratégies d’influence et le discours de l’industrie agroalimentaire au cours de l’élaboration du nouveau Guide alimentaire canadien?	In Canada, the study of the agri-food industry’s behavior and its associated repercussions on the health of the populations it serves remains relatively unexplored. However, previous studies have shown that private sector stakeholders employ diverse strategies to influence the development of public policy. These strategies may compromise the nature and implementation of food and nutrition policies. The objectives of this research, based on the revision process of Canada’s Food Guide (CFG) aim to: (1) identify the corporate political activity (CPA) undertaken by the agri-food industry during the revision process of Canada’s Food Guide (CFG) from 2016 to 2019, and (2) analyze the position and discourse of key industry actors concerning the recommendations proposed by Health Canada. The sample is composed of eleven agri-food industry stakeholders having submitted a memorandum to the Standing Committee on Health in relation to the revision of CFG. A six- month data collection period, from October 2018 to March 2019, allowed us to identify CPAs undertaken by the sample over a 39-month period, from early autumn 2016 until spring of 2019. Materials analyzed include memoranda submitted to Cabinet as well as stakeholders’ official websites. To define the CPAs and classify them according to their strategies, their practices and the mechanisms employed, we relied upon a conceptual framework from the INFORMAS network. We then identified, within the CPAs and discourses, elements of citations indicating positioning in terms of the three guiding principles: A variety of nutritious foods and beverages are the foundation for healthy eating; Processed or prepared foods and beverages high in sodium, sugars or saturated fat undermine healthy eating; Knowledge and skills are needed to navigate the complex food environment and support healthy eating. A total of 366 CPAs were identified in relation to CFG. The primary strategies reported are information management (n=197) and discursive strategies (n=108). The data collected suggest that the agri-food industry is using CPAs to influence the policy making of the new CFG. Industry stakeholders have expressed an opposition to the new food guidelines. Each stakeholders’ point of view on the problems and solutions concerning the three guiding principles differ. The economic interests respective to each stakeholder shape the vision promoted by the food industry. This vision may be difficult to harmonize with multiple dimensions of the new guidelines, as well as with the most recent evidence supporting them. It is imperative to better document and regulate the agri-food industry’s CPAs which could interfere with the adoption of legislative measures and limit governmental capacity to develop healthy food and nutrition policies.

175	Accès à l’alimentation saine dans l’Est de Montréal : perspective des ménages à faible revenu et des acteurs en sécurité alimentaire	Context: Social inequalities in health related to diet are associated with a higher prevalence of chronic diseases among socioeconomically disadvantaged populations. Lack of physical and economic access to healthy and affordable food instigates these social inequalities, and could partly explain the observed gradient, as in the case of one of the poorest neighborhoods in Eastern Montréal. Objective: Understand the perspectives of low-income households (LIHs) and food security actors of the Montreal East Food Network (RAEM) on access to healthy food in the food environment of Eastern Montreal, bearing in mind the viability of local food initiatives. Methodology: This qualitative study followed an action-research approach in partnership with RAEM. Six focus groups with LIHs (n = 49) and one with RAEM members (n = 13) were carried out in 2018. Data analysis was guided by the five dimensions of food access (economic, spatio-temporal, service availability, social and personal), as described by Freedman et al. (2013). Results: LIHs perceive that limited access to affordable food of high quality in the food environment, transportation constraints, and travel distance to food stores as the main obstacles to healthy eating. Although food security actors described the economic and spatio-temporal dimensions as crucial, they also acknowledged important barriers related to the personal and social dimensions. Conclusion: The perspectives of LIHs and food security actors suggest that economic and geographic situations, as well as the personal and social preferences of LIHs are determinants in access to healthy food. Despite the divergence of perspectives, these must be taken into consideration when implementing food security strategies.

176	Étude de l’expression et des partenaires protéiques de l’ARN TERRA (TElomeric Repeat-containing RNA) dans les cellules de cancer humaines	Telomeres are nucleoprotein structures that cap the physical ends of eukaryotic chromosomes. They consist of repetitive DNA sequences 5’-TTAGGG-3’ assembled with proteins which form the shelterin complex. This complex protects the ends of chromosomes by inhibiting DNA repair pathways at telomeres and avoid their recognition as double-strand breaks. Telomeres have been identified as a transcriptionally silent zone until 2007 when a noncoding RNA called TERRA (TElomeric Repeat containing RNA) transcribed from telomeres was discovered. This RNA gave rise to many questions: How is TERRA regulated?  How is TERRA expressed? Does TERRA interact with proteins, DNA or RNA?  After several studies, we know that TERRA is frequently expressed in cancer cells and it interacts with a large proteome. Nevertheless, its specific function remains unknown.  In this thesis, we studied this RNA in human cancer cells using live-cell microscopy which allowed us to get information on TERRA’s dynamics, localization and its interactome. Moreover, we used single-molecule imaging on TERRA 15q labeled by the MS2-GFP system, which allowed the visualization of TERRA transcripts. This study resulted in the discovery of two types of TERRA population from telomere 15q: one of the population is characterized by the formation of clusters and a second population is constituted of unique molecules more dynamic in the nucleus. Finally, in order to better understand TERRA’s functions, we developed a new approach which consists on immunoprecipitating TERRA using the MS2 stem-loops as a tag to identify TERRA-interacting proteins such as the telomeric factor TRF2 or RNA-binding proteins like hnRNP -A1 or FUS.

177	Établissement d’un nouveau modèle de souris pour étudier les cellules valvulaires interstitielles : ADAMTS19-Cre-ert2	BACKGROUND: Valvular heart disease (VHD) occurs in ~2% of the general population, often resulting in reduced or disturbed blood flow. We recently identified two unrelated families with recessive inheritance patterns of progressive polyvalvular heart disease in absence of any clear syndromic phenotype. Exome sequencing revealed homozygous, rare, loss of function (LOF) alleles in both families for the gene ADAMTS19. The relation between ADAMTS19 mutation and aortic stenosis were confirm via an ADAMTS19-LacZ KO/KO mouse model. This model also shows that ADAMTS19 is specific of VICs during valve development. The ADAMTS protein family includes 19 proteases that are involved in matrix remodeling, and tissue homeostasis in development and disease. However, the role of ADAMTS19 specifically during valve development remains unknown. We aim to characterize ADAMTS19 expression using a BAC transgenic ADMTS19-CRERT2 mouse. HYPOTHESE/OBJECTIVE We hypothesize that the BAC used to make the ADMTS19-CRERT2 mouse contains all the regulatory elements to express it and also that its expression will be specific to the VICs. The objective is to establish the ADAMTS19- CREERT2 and therefore to create a new tool to study VICs in vivo. METHODS/RESULTS: In silico analysis of the human and mouse ADAMTS19 genomic regions showed a high level of conservation. Thus, to analyze ADAMTS19 expression patterns during mouse development, we obtained a BAC transgenic mouse model containing a tamoxifen inducible Cre (CreERT2) that is expressed under the influence of the human ADAMTS19 promoter and surrounding genomic region. We crossed males from several lines created in parallel with Rosa-tdTomato reporter females to generate offspring in which expression of the fluorescent tdTomato reporter is activated in ADAMTS19-expressing cells upon tamoxifen administration. Surprisingly, whole mount imaging of embryos induced at E13.5 and isolated at E16.5 revealed strong, but distinct labelling patterns in offspring from different ADAMTS19CreERT2 sublines. Whereas one line exclusively labelled VICs, consistent with ADAMTS19 in situ RNA expression data from the Eurexpress database, another line specifically labelled cells in atrial and ventricular, but not VICs. A third line seems to label only a subset of cells in the pulmonary artery. Labeling of ADAMTS19-positive VICs is consistent with ADAMTS19 affecting valve development and VHD. In addition, we observed exclusive ADAMTS19-dependent labelling in atrial and ventricular cells or in a subset of pulmonary artery cells in two different sublines. CONCLUSION: The distinct expression patterns in offspring from different ADAMTS19-Cre-ERT2 lines indicates that although regulation of ADAMTS19 is conserved between human and mouse, expression in VICs versus other cells may be dependent on mutually exclusive regulatory mechanisms.

178	La communication de la preuve civile au préalable dans les litiges commerciaux internationaux	In the current economic era, where business transactions are more than ever globalized due to the increasing use of technologies, the risks of legal conflicts being international in nature are now higher. Since businesses from Québec are now frequently making transactions with foreign partners, litigation nowadays confronts parties and their lawyers with new legal dilemmas, forcing them to interact with different judicial cultures other than Québec’s, especially during the pre-trial discovery and disclosure process. We will then analyze the many legal challenges resulting from this procedure to address the practical considerations that subject the parties of an international litigation instituted in front of Québec’s tribunals. Therefore, with the help of a hypothetical, we will study Québec’s general and specific procedures of discovery and disclosure of international civil evidence, its restrictions and the international legal frame surrounding it.  Also, we will discuss the impact of technologies on Québec’s pre-trial discovery and disclosure process focusing on the dematerialization of civil evidence, the legislative modifications of the reform of the Québec Code of Civil Procedure, and the protection of personal data.

179	La non-prolifération et le désarmement des armes nucléaires en droit international et le mécanisme de retrait des traités internationaux	Nuclear weapons, the apex of weapons of mass destruction, are unique in the facet that they have an unprecedented potential for destruction, as well as in the fact that nuclear strikes are indiscriminate. This type of weapon, which represents a real threat to humanity, must be regulated by a strong and complete international conventional regimen of non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament. Nonetheless, the latter suffers from deficiencies.  This master’s thesis focuses on the withdrawal mechanism found in this international legal field. The spotlight is more specifically directed on its cornerstone treaty, the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons of 1968 (NPT), and on the New Start Treaty of 2010, the only agreement which regulates the nuclear stockpiles of the nuclear superpowers, Russia and the United States of America. The analysis is enhanced by the study of the 2003 North-Korean withdrawal from the NPT and of the principles introduced by the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 1969.  A rather soft withdrawal mechanism, which relies largely on the discretion of the State party, is revealed, despite the threat to international peace and security a decision to withdraw represents. This deficiency, paired with inexistent follow-up measures, leaves the international community facing a highly dangerous situation.  The examination of the more substantiated withdrawal mechanism found in the European Union’s body of law, as illustrated by the Brexit, allows us to suggest possible solutions to strengthen the NPT withdrawal mechanism as well as potential follow-up measures to be implemented following the withdrawal of a State party.	nuclear weapon , nuclear non-proliferation , disarmament , international law , withdrawal mechanism , armes de destruction massive , weapons of mass destruction , Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons , European Union , Brexit , safeguards agreement	en	24448.0
180	Méta-analyse sur l'efficacité des programmes de préparation à l'autonomie pour les jeunes qui transitent à l'âge adulte à partir d'un milieu de vie substitut	Youth in out-of-home care face an uncertain future and disproportionate difficulties when aging out of care and into independent life as an adult. The difficulties these youth face have prompted governments in several countries to develop programs in order to prepare these youth for this critical period in their life. However, the effectiveness of these programs remains unknown. Objective: The main objective of the present study is to fill this gap in knowledge by measuring the effectiveness of independent living programs to prepare young people aging out of care for adulthood. Methodology: A series of meta-analysis were performed in order to measure the weighed effect sizes on three outcomes related to adulthood: employment, housing, and social support. The effect sizes were calculated using standardized mean differences or Hedge’s g. A fixed effect size model was used to perform the analyses. Results: k = 9 studies including a total of n = 7127 participants met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review and had sufficient data to conduct a meta-analysis. The results of the meta-analysis for the employment outcome (k = 5, n = 5778) and for the housing outcome (k = 5, n = 2467) show a very small effect favoring the treatment group compared to services as usual for these two outcomes, 1 to 4 years post baseline. No significant effect was found for the social support outcome (k = 5, n = 1797). Discussion: Considering the complex trajectories and needs of youth in out-of-home care, it is imperative that independent living programs better reflect today’s socioeconomic realities to better prepare youth for adulthood, and take into consideration the particular needs of these youth. It is recommended to extend the services until 25 years old and to put forward an interdependent vision of autonomy in the interventions provided to these youth.

181	Age of cannabis use onset and adult drug abuse symptoms : a prospective study of common risk factors and indirect effects	Objective: The present study examined (1) whether the associations between cannabis use (CU) age of onset and drug abuse by 28 years remain when controlling for risk factors in childhood, adolescence and early adulthood; and (2) developmental pathways from early risk factors to drug abuse problems. Method: Participants from a longitudinal sample of low SES boys (N=1030) were followed from 6 to 28 years. Self-reported CU onset between 13 and 17 years of age and drug abuse symptoms by 28 years were examined. Results: The odds of developing any drug abuse symptoms by 28 years were reduced by 31% for each year of delayed CU onset (OR = 0.69). Cannabis, alcohol and other drug frequency at 17 years mediated this association. Still, even when taking that frequency of use into account, adolescents who started using cannabis before 15 years were at higher risk of developing drug abuse symptoms by age 28. Significant indirect effects were found from early adolescent delinquency and affiliation with deviant friends to drug abuse symptoms at 28 years through CU age of onset and substance use frequency at 17 years. Conclusions: Results suggest more clearly than before that prevention programs should aim at delaying CU onset in order to prevent or reduce drug abuse in adulthood. Furthermore, prevention programs targeting delinquency and/or affiliation with deviant friends in childhood or early adolescence could indirectly reduce substance abuse in adulthood without addressing substance use specifically.

182	L’effet d’une intervention musicale sur la douleur et les affects associés lors d’une pose d’implants dentaires	Background: Patients receiving dental implants placement experience mild to moderate procedural pain during surgery, despite local anesthesia and intake of a preoperative analgesic. There are also negative affects associated with this pain. During the following days, the pain continues and is treated with analgesics. Therefore, it is important to reduce this persisting perioperative pain, the negative emotional experience that accompanies it as well as consumption of analgesics with a non-pharmacological approach. In this sense, music can reduce them in various clinical populations, but to our knowledge, its effectiveness has not been studied in the context of dental implantology. Objective: The purpose of this research project was to compare the effects of listening to music and listening to an audiobook (control group) in the context of dental implant surgery on pain during surgery and associated affects, as well as pain and analgesics consumption in the days following surgery. Methodology: Twenty-eight patients were recruited and randomly assigned to the music or control (audiobook) group. Based on their assigned group, each participant chose from seven music or audiobook options. Self-reported measures were used for pain and associated affects, before and after surgery, and during the seven postoperative days. Results: Pain experienced during surgery was significantly lower for participants who listened to music during surgery than for those who listened to an audiobook. However, there was no significant difference between the groups in either pain or analgesics use during the postoperative days. Participants who listened to music felt signicantly fewer negative affects than those who listened to audiobooks. Conclusion: Listening to music reduces procedural pain and its negative affects during dental implant placement surgery. As such, it could be used in other clinical settings as a simple, affordable, non-pharmacological analgesic approach and adjuvant to pharmacological treatments already in place.	intervention musicale , pain , music , musical intervention , dental implant placement , personalized care	en	24399.0
183	La dynamique spatio-temporelle de l'attention dans la lecture	A vast number of studies examining the cognitive and neurobiological aspects of reading have been conducted in the past decades. However, the strategy underlying expert word identification and the way visuospatial attention is deployed across time and space remains unknown. The study from Blais et al. (2009) offered a significant advance to our knowledge in this regard. The present study extends this initial investigation by using a protocol which can specify how visual information is extracted in space and time during visual word recognition in neurotypical readers.  16 students were tested using an adaptation of the « Bubbles » technique. Participants read five-letter French words exposed for 200 ms and sampled in space-time by random signal-to-noise ratio  (SNR) variations which were independent for each letter position. Participants first completed a 150-trial practice session during which the maximum allowable SNR was adjusted in order to maintain accuracy at about 51% correct. Then, four experimental blocks of 150 trials each were completed. This was followed by a 75-trial practice block to readjust the maximum allowable SNR. Finally, four additional blocks of 150 experimental trials each were conducted.  Data analyses examined how the temporally varying signal/noise determined the response accuracy of participants. Classification images in the temporal domain were constructed for each participant by subtracting the weighted sum of the temporal profiles of signal/noise ratios of incorrect trials from those associated with correct responses. We also constructed classification images in the time-frequency domain which indicate the contribution of particular frequencies as a function of time to processing effectiveness. Individual classification images were transformed into Z scores to put them on the same scale, thereby allowing the calculation of group means. Statistical significance was determined by the application of the Pixel test.  The results suggest a serial processing of letter extraction information in which the order of letters is a function of the diagnostic value of that letter for word identification. These observations are inconsistent with a parallel processing model, which is the generally accepted account for the invariant latency of expert visual word recognition as a function of word length. These would seem to indicate a serial processing of letters within which several joint letters are still possible. The absence of word length effect in the serial processing would be explained by the number of letters (and/or the number of attention attachments required) which remains constant whatever the length of the word. However, this hypothesis still need to be substantiated by testing this protocol on words of different lengths.	attention , reading , visuospatial , parallel , serial , processing , word , length , effect	en	24388.0
184	Décharges Sparks dans les liquides diélectriques : caractérisation et application à la synthèse de nanoparticules	This research project is part of the international master's program in Physics (plasma option) between Université de Montréal and Université Paul Sabatier - Toulouse (France). It concerns the synthesis of nanoparticles by pulsed electrical discharges in liquids. The objective is to develop the synthesis process while improving the knowledge of the formation conditions of nanoparticles. This involves characterizing the entire experimental system and developing its metrology on the one hand, and on the other hand obtaining the evolution of plasma parameters during synthesis. Initially, at the LAPLACE lab (UMR5213), Toulouse, it was necessary to develop a pulsed electrical supply to produce discharges in liquids. Based on an existing device that, after being improved, the discharge process is characterized from the electrical point of view (current, voltage). The application of the device in the synthesis of nanoparticles was tested under different experimental conditions, considering the energy aspect (energy balance, characteristics of the discharge, etc.). The second part was conducted at Université de Montréal, where the synthesized nanoparticles are characterized using the transmission electron microscope of Polytechnique Montreal. Also, the electrical circuit equivalent to the experimental system was determined to visualize the time evolution of the plasma parameters (Temperature and Electron Density) based on the electrical characteristics.

185	Évaluation de la corrélation inter-substitut pour le suivi de tumeurs pulmonaires indirect	The main objective of this thesis is to prepare the clinical implementation of the Clarity ultrasound system for indirect lung tumours tracking using a surrogate. It is currently used for motion management during prostate treatments and requires adaptation. Our hypothesis is that an internal marker would have a better correlation with the tumour’s position than an external surrogate. The sub-objectives are : 1) test different setups for the image acquisition on patients ; 2) explore the algorithms’ performance for motion detection as well as the image quality metrics on US and dynamic MRI images ; 3) evaluate the correlation between surrogates and a lung structure to determine which performs best. The ultrasound probe is fixed on the treatment couch for the acquisition on healthy volunteers using a mechanical arm. Low pressure on the patient’s skin results in a loss of signal due to the curvilinear shape of the probe. We observed a loss of contact between the probe and the volunteers’ skin due to ample movements causing a deterioration of the image quality. We tested three different motion detection algorithms on dynamic MRI images : normalized cross-correlation (NCC), root mean square error (RMS) and optical flow. The NCC algorithm is the most robust out of the three for 5/9 volunteers for the internal surrogate tracking (  < 0.050). In specific cases, the optical flow method performed better indicating an interest in developping a new algorithm for indirect lung tracking. Finally, the correlation between the surrogates and a lung structure were calculated using the MRI images. The internal surrogate inside the liver was proven more efficient for indirect lung tumour tracking for 8/9 volunteers. External markers give a greater prediction error. It has also been shown that the positioning of the external marker on the patient’s skin impacts the correlation. The abdominal marker is better than the thoracic one for all the volunteers.

186	Démocratie expérimentale et philosophie pour enfants	Recently in Quebec, a majority of eligible voters have expressed their discontent with the current political system. Citizens say they experience disempowerment and feel a lack of real choice in the political process. In the age of rising populism, this represents a pressing concern to ensure the vitality of our democracy.   The purpose of this thesis is to engage with the issue of civic engagement and social reform from the standpoint of Philosophy for children (P4C). The research question can be formulated as such: “How can P4C contribute to an effective response towards the unsatisfied aspirations that a majority of citizens feel toward the current political system?”  In order to answer this question, we assess P4C’s democratic value and democratic potential through a radical social and political theory. We depart from more “traditional” political philosophies and direct our attention to Democratic Experimentalism developed by Roberto Unger to show how it can offer a way to envisage P4C as a means to disrupt the mere reproduction of the structure of society and bring it closer to an activity that transforms it through experimentation and collective engagement. To do so, we examine how P4C’s practices and theoretical underpinnings can be said to be compatible with such a vision of democratic life and how nonetheless its democratic potential is limited by the lack of practicality and the absence of institutional support capable of enabling experimentation and collective engagement.

187	Kierkegaard and Bloch on Hope	Hope, that residue of Pandora’s jar (πίθος), has been the subject of ambivalent philosophical judgments. Pit against being considered a form of wishful thinking that is misleading or an attitude that contributes to moral action, the verdict concerning hope’s affiliation with the illnesses and hardships that befall humanity is still pending. The question, preceding any judgment, that continues to facilitate this trial can be formulated in no simpler way: what is hope? Søren Kierkegaard and Ernst Bloch dedicated a significant portion of their authorship to help clarify such a question. Yet, what can a comparison between a Christian existentialist and a speculative materialist deliver on the topic of hope? Far from leading to the butt of a joke, a comparison of their work reveals how hope may contribute to critique, action, and ultimately, redemption. Despite the substantial differences between their objects of hope, they share certain characterizations of hope that remain philosophically salient. Against the claim that hope is misguided, they argue that hope affords us the chance to break away from the dominant ideas of the status quo. The distance affords us a new and critical experience of the issues we face, while anticipatively pointing towards what may redeem them. Distinguished from uplifting emotions or moods like joy and naïve optimism, Kierkegaard and Bloch argue that hope must be resolute about its expectation. Hope then involves our decision to anticipate and contribute to the possibility of our redemption. Lastly, hope is argued to be redemptive in itself as a struggle for possibility–for without possibility, a person seems unable to breathe.

188	Liens entre les habiletés rythmiques et les compétences de décodage en lecture : associer les périodicités oculaires au chunking perceptif en parole lue	Numerous studies have documented links between abilities in tasks involving rhythm and some basic reading skills. For instance, significant correlations are observed between children or adolescent’s reading skills and their performance on tasks on motor synchronization to an auditory cadence or rhythmic sequence. Moreover, it is known that dyslexia is often accompanied by difficulties at the rhythmic level, and recent studies in electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) have suggested that these deficits may result from atypical patterns of activity in low-frequency neuronal oscillations of the central nervous system. How can these developmental links between rhythm and reading be explained? In some studies, phonological awareness is used to understand this association, hence proposing an indirect explanation relying on a third variable to make sense of the phenomenon. Unlike these theories, the present work proposes a more direct explanation of the link between rhythm and reading, where the emphasis is put on the intrinsic role of rhythm for the perceptual chunking of verbal information in oral or silent reading. To test this hypothesis, an experiment is presented in which 43 participants had to read sentences orally while their voice and eye-movements were recorded by an eye-tracking system. Results show that the implicit rhythm of the text is strictly followed in the participants’ oral reading, independently of a rhythmic priming that was presented before the text. In addition, probabilistic measures of eye fixations resemble the voice’s rhythmic chunks, highlighting possible rhythmic properties of visual sampling for text reading. We conclude by discussing the implications of these results for theories of reading.	chunking , oscillations , rhythm , reading , eye-tracking	en	24340.0
189	The multilevel critical node problem : theoretical intractability and a curriculum learning approach	Evaluating the vulnerability of networks is a problem which has gain momentum in recent decades. In this work, we focus on a Multilevel Programming approach to study the defense of critical infrastructures against malicious attacks. We analyze a three-stage sequential game played in a graph called the Multilevel Critical Node problem (MCN). This game sees two players competing with each other: a defender and an attacker. The defender starts by preventively interdicting nodes from being attacked during what is called a vaccination phase. Then, the attacker infects a subset of non-vaccinated nodes and, finally, the defender reacts with a protection strategy. We provide the first computational complexity results associated with MCN and its subgames. Moreover, by considering unitary, weighted, undirected and directed graphs, we clarify how the theoretical tractability or intractability of those problems vary. Our findings contribute with new NP-complete, $\Sigma_2^p$-complete and $\Sigma_3^p$-complete problems.  Motivated by the intrinsic intractability of the MCN, we then design efficient heuristics for the game by building upon the recent approaches seeking to learn heuristics for combinatorial optimization problems through graph neural networks and reinforcement learning. But contrary to previous work, we tackle situations with multiple players taking decisions sequentially. By framing them in a multi-agent reinforcement learning setting, we devise a value-based method to learn to solve multilevel budgeted combinatorial problems involving two players in a zero-sum game over a graph. Our framework is based on a simple curriculum: if an agent knows how to estimate the value of instances with budgets up to B, then solving instances with budget B+1 can be done in polynomial time regardless of the direction of the optimization by checking the value of every possible afterstate. Thus, in a bottom-up approach, we generate datasets of heuristically solved instances with increasingly larger budgets to train our agent. We report results close to optimality on graphs up to 100 nodes and a 185 x speedup on average compared to the quickest exact solver known for the MCN.

190	Le passé imparfait et la persistance de la mémoire : Flash-backs, temporalités, et remémorations dans le narratif cinématographique	This research-creation project comprises two components; the short film entitled Persistence de la mémoire, and the written document section. These two enunciated segments explore the concept of the double and the concepts of time, memory and the flashback. Developed as an autopoietic research-creation pursuant to a “practice-based research” methodology, this research-creation seeks to answer the following questions: In a film, what narrative tools are used to convey emotions, and key moments to represent time and memory? This question is divided into two sub-questions, which are: 1. How does the flashback become a way to alter or revise the past? 2. Is the flashback a subjective point of view of the protagonist or the author?  Based on my research and my creative process, I wish to bring an epistemological reflection to this question by examining the uses, particularities and modalities of narrative tools in storytelling. The concept of the double emerges as a common thread through my research and in the creation portion, as well as in the instances and uses of temporality and the flashback.

191	Imaginer l’intime à l’ère du néolibéralisme : analyse d’Une affaire de famille (2018) de Hirokazu Kore-eda et de Naissance et maternité (2006) de Naomi Kawase	This thesis aims to analyse the formatting and the representation of the intimate in Hirokazu Kore-eda's Une affaire de famille (2018) and in Naomi Kawase's Naissance et maternité (2006), two Japanese filmmakers creating during a period marked by economic crisis, the adoption of neoliberal politics, and nationalism regaining popularity. From a mainly aesthetic point of view, the goal will be to examine the ways in which these two films represent and imagine two types of intimate relationships mobilized by cinema, which are respectively the relationship between the diegesis' characters and the relationship between filmmaker and spectator. Although their films seem apolitical, as they are centred around human relationships, the question is to observe how an approach focused on the intimate brings to light political and social ramifications.	relation , sensations , japanese cinema , intimate , relationship , neoliberalism , neonationalism , democracy , haptic	en	24294.0
192	Tisser la résurgence à travers le wampum comme approche rhétorique décoloniale de certaines œuvres de Nadia Myre	Aboriginal artistic creation is inseparable from political struggles. In a colonial context, Aboriginal ways of being, acting and thinking are deeply affected. Art is a powerful weapon in this struggle for decolonization. This study will therefore focus on the transformative and decolonizing potential of Aboriginal artistic creation through the artistic practice of Algonquin artist Nadia Myre. Several of her works address the mixed identity and colonial violence suffered by Aboriginal people. Indian Act (fig.1) denounces, through a traditional and participatory beaded rewriting, a colonial law that has led to a profound epistemic injustice. To address these issues, we will focus on a specific object, the wampum. In this research, we will consider it as a vector of deep resurgence and decolonization. The essential ancient and contemporary socio-political position of wampum makes it a privileged didactic support of resurgence. Through the use of the wampum motif in Nadia Myre's artistic practice, we will be able to walk through these struggles and understand how Aboriginal artists engage them. Wampum will be presented as a discursive rhetoric, material and immaterial, a hypertext, a hyperlink (Haas 2007) between tradition and modernity, orality and writing, which will be supported by the theory of intermediality. Jacques Derrida and the Deconstruction will also be convened to examine the rewriting work done by Myre in Indian Act. It will also be a question of understanding how Nadia Myre's participatory proposal could enable an allochtonous engagement towards decolonial epistemic justice.

193	Le développement des conduites agressives chez les élèves populaires au secondaire : l'affiliation à des amis populaires et agressifs comme facteur médiateur	Teenagers’ popularity is known to be linked to an increase in aggressive behaviors through time. However, few studies have explored the mechanisms that can explain this association. This study aims to assess to which extent friends’ popularity and aggressivity can possibly play a mediating role to explain the relationship between popularity and aggressivity at the beginning of high school. The sample of this longitudinal study consists of 621 students in 7th and 8th grade from disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds who attended three public high schools in the Montreal area. The participants’ popularity and aggressivity scores were measured using a peer nominated protocol and assessed three times over a period of one year. Friends’ identity and characteristics were also measured repeatedly using the same procedure. Results show that participants’ popularity in the beginning of 7th grade promotes friendships with peers who are more and more popular and aggressive at the beginning of 8th grade. In return, friendships with aggressive peers can explain the increase in aggressive conducts at the end of 8th grade. The association between perceived popularity and aggressivity, for both boys and girls, can be explained by friends’ characteristics. The discussion focuses on the importance of the relational context when it comes to accounting for the developmental consequences associated with being perceived as popular in early adolescence.

194	Décrire, comprendre et schématiser le processus de l'évaluation du risque suicidaire selon une perspective infirmière auprès des moins de 12 ans en santé mentale	Suicide prevention is an important aspect of the work of any healthcare professional, especially for nurses working in mental healthcare settings. However, suicide risk assessment is not conducted systematically, varying from one setting to another. Furthermore, there is no information to our knowledge on this type of risk assessment process with children under 12 years old. This topic is particularly difficult to explore and to understand in a society where children are expected to grow to be healthy and happy. The aim of this study is to describe, understand and schematize nurses’ suicide risk assessment process with children under12 in a mental health setting. The background of this study is the humanistic model in nursing – UdeM. Centered on the Person, this model takes into account their significant interpersonal relationships, their subjective experience of care and its meaning. Strauss et Corbin’s (1998) approach in grounded theory was used to conduct this study. Using theoretical sampling, data was obtained through 11 semi-structed interviews with nurses working in five different administrative regions in the province of Quebec, nurses’ documents, socio-demographic questionnaires, and field notes. A constant comparative analysis of the data across triple coding allowed a better understanding and a schematization of the nurses’ suicide risk assessment process with children. The process includes two main phases relating to nurses’ actions. These two phases are: (1) Understanding the meaning of the child’s distress, and (2) Ensuring the child and their family’s safety. The different elements involved in each phase are not exclusive to one phase or the other. In fact, characteristics of nurses (temperament, beliefs and perceptions, past experiences) interact with those of the child and his or her family (suicidal ideations or behaviors, level of understanding of the concept of death, mental health state, family dynamics and attitudes, parents’ perceptions and beliefs ). This interaction can produce both positive and negative impacts. The environment (health and services organization) where this interaction occurs can also impact on the whole assessment process. Our findings reveal that for both phases of the assessment process with children, nurses have to take in account the developmental aspect of the child and must be careful to maintain their empathic posture, so they are not overwhelmed by emotions. Doing so will help lessen the level of emotional intensity for the nurse during the whole process. A better understanding of this process can help nurses and other professionals improve their interventions with children presenting a suicidal risk as well as their parents and in the long term, contribute to suicide prevention.

195	De l’intuition à la formalisation de la pensée musicale : retour sur 11 œuvres composées dans le cadre du doctorat = From intuition to formalization of musical thought : a look back at 11 works within a doctoral framework	This thesis returns to the eleven musical works that marked my compositional journey as well as my development as an artist. I divided the production of these seven years of doctoral studies into three sections, corresponding to three distinct phases of the evolution of my language. This journey is a gradual transition from an intuitive approach to musical writing to a more structured approach. Bailo, String Quartet no.1, and Con fuoco were composed in the first phase. The second phase led to two pieces in which instrumental music and electroacoustic music were juxtaposed: the Concerto pour clarinette et bande and Impressions for bassoon and tape. In order to bridge the gap between these two distinct worlds, intuition gradually gave way to a better organization of parameters through the introduction of formalization. The third phase corresponds to a more rigorous exploration of formalization through the use of models. Four models are addressed in this thesis; the sound object model, the linguistics model, the timbre model and the visual arts model. In the sound object model, used in the Nevaliashka piece, formalization is built around an object of everyday life from which a maximum of information is extracted and analyzed. Used in the operas Les bottes jaunes and The Feast of Nemesis, the linguistics model incorporates the semantics and phonetics of different languages into the compositional process. The timbre model, found in FLAW/LESS and Transition, focuses on the corporeality of traditional instruments and their acoustic potential. Instrumental writing is thought of as a sculpture of timbres and follows the methodology generally used in electroacoustic music composition. Finally, with the visual arts model, highlighted in the Galženjaki piece, I analyze the interactions between visual arts and literature and attempt to translate this dialogue into music.	composition , intuition , timbre , composition , instrumental music , electroacoustic music , mixed music , intuition , formalization , model , sound object , literature , linguistics , timbre , visual arts	en	24246.0
196	"Design and adaptation in contested urban spaces : 
the case of the Toi Market as a multi-level settlement in Nairobi, Kenya"	Nairobi has nearly 200 slums where 70% of its population live. Most slum dwellers lack tenure security and suffer the constant threat of eviction. Yet, we still know very little about how these slums form, grow, and consolidate in contested urban spaces, and how their residents adapt to uncertainty. Part of the reason lies in the gap between design and adaptation theories. Whereas design theory focuses mainly on professionals’ cognitive processes (largely ignoring adaptation mechanisms adopted by slum dwellers), spatial transformations in slums are often addressed by resilience theory, which usually overlooks design processes.  What is the role of design in adaptation processes in contested urban spaces? I answer this question by exploring the relationships between design and adaptive capacities in the Toi Market, the second largest informal market in Nairobi. I study the market’s tenure regimes and traders’ design practices through a case study that combines longitudinal and cross-section investigation. The research reasoning is abductive, made of iterative paths between conceptual frameworks and empirical results. It is largely based on a literature review on land tenure and design theory. The concepts of bounded rationality, uncertainty, and adaptive mechanisms constitute the basis of the theoretical framework used to analyse the empirical data. Methods include participant observation, 59 interviews with traders, meetings with market leaders, mapping techniques and the analysis of over 80 pertinent documents about the market. Results show that the Toi Market has three types of controversial tenure regimes and traders conduct design at three levels: development design, evolutionary design, and consolidation design.  Development design consists of collective adaptive initiatives prompted by survival mechanisms. It strengthens social capital, emerges in reaction to ordinary urban interventions, and seeks to improve functionality. Evolutionary design is conducted by community sub-groups in response to major external forces and events. It leads to social and morphological changes at the urban scale and depends on governance and control mechanisms. Consolidation design refers to individual and group-led adaptive initiatives conducted during times of relative stability. It reinforces economic development and networks and seeks to achieve land tenure security. It emerges mainly in vacant niches, as slum-dwellers take advantage of empty, underused spaces.  These three levels of design generate what I call here Multi-Level Settlements. I oppose this concept to “informal settlements” that fails to represent how slums and markets work and evolve. I thus reject the formal/informal dichotomy that persists in literature. The Multi-level concept recognises shifting alliances and multiple levels of governance as integral part of design processes. In it, design emerges as a connector of adaptive capacities. The concepts of Multi-Level Settlements, Vacant Niche and Design as a connector of adaptive capacities can help developing slum upgrading initiatives that meet the design approach naturally adopted by slum-dwellers. These initiatives can therefore acknowledge the presence of multiple alliances, which sometimes hinder—and others, foster—desired change. Community design practices can also be tailored to balance collective and individual objectives. By understanding these concepts, decision-makers can both optimize available space according to local practices and forecast how patterns will emerge in planned spaces. Finally, I encourage scholars and practitioners to further explore slum-dwellers’ design-thinking and practices to include them in mainstream design theory.

197	Passer outre la barrière culturelle : comment les Britanniques se renseignent sur les populations du Canada et de l’Inde, 1757-1774	This study compares methods of information gathering in two territories that became part of the British Empire after the Seven Years’ War. We bring these two extremely different regions into the same frame by asking: how did the British gather information about the populations of Canada and Bengal? Our study is part of several historiographical currents that offer a rereading of the history of Great Britain and its colonies, which is the subject of our first chapter. In the next chapter, we explore the post-conquest era in Canada. After the conquest of this territory (1759-1760), British authorities faced the task of administering the Canadian population. At first, they tried to implement a new governmental regime deemed suitable for the Canadian context. However, since the majority of the population they governed was of different religious denomination (Catholics) and of French origin, they had to modify the regime ten years later. In the third chapter, we look at the British presence in Bengal after the battle of Plassey in 1757. The British, through the East India Company, acquired a certain influence over local authorities, which allowed them to govern indirectly via the Mogul Empire’s governors, the nabobs. Nevertheless, cultural differences were much more significant than with the Canadian population of European origin: the Mogul Empire was a Muslim polity, with a Persian administration, and much of the population was Hindu. From our reading of the official correspondence, between the colonial administrators and the metropolitan government in the first case, and between the agents of the company and its directors in the second, we affirm that in both situations the British tried to gather more information. However, important institutional and cultural differences distinguish the types of information sought as well as the approaches to collecting information. The results of our research ultimately converge on one point: the search for information passed through a whole range of local intermediaries.   In the last chapter, after having explored the “information order” implemented or adapted by the British in each colonial context, the study considers how colonial information was received and shaped by the metropolitan authorities. To this end, the efforts of officials and parliamentarians to learn about colonial conditions during the drafting of two laws, the Quebec Act (1774) and the Regulating Act (1773) are highlighted through a reading of the Parliamentary debates. Here also, many differences are visible. To become informed about Canada, British authorities relied heavily on the help of the colonial administrators who stayed in Canada after the regime change. However, in the Indian case, they depended mostly on documentary sources, namely the books of the EIC.

198	L’accaparement du contrôle dans les propriétés collectives colombiennes : le cas de Wacoyo	Contrary to David Harvey’s hypothesis (1973), who considers that the principle of redistribution gradually replaces reciprocity before leading to the market economy, we believe that it is in the interest of the dominant economy to keep alive the underlying moral economy in order to facilitate the residual control grabbing of the resguardos, and thus to guarantee the expansion of the capital in the indigenous territories. If patronage is the form of socio-political organization necessary for the integration of indigenous populations into the market, it is the pre-capitalist moral economies which contribute to the expansion of the capitalist system. Thus, the indigenous moral economy becomes an instrument of domination which operates against this same indigenous population. Its operation remains invisible if we continue to assess indigenous rights in the context of non-indigenous law, and if we analyse the problem in the context of scientific languages hardly based on the thinking of the populations concerned. Our research tackles the question of the control grabbing from a normative point of view, by examining the issues surrounding the agreement that allowed the private sector to exploit a land of Wacoyo, a collective property located within the last Colombian agricultural frontier.

199	L’insécurité alimentaire à Montréal-Nord : un enjeu de démocratie alimentaire?	Although Montreal is located in an advanced capitalist country, certain sectors of the metropolis such as Montreal North are more vulnerable in terms of food access than other Montreal boroughs. Characterized by a large immigrant population, a high unemployment rate and a high proportion of citizens living on low income, this district is distinguished by the fact that one in three households is affected by food insecurity. Studies on the subject generally attempt to identify the most affected areas within the borough by means of quantitative approaches and spatial analyzes. This thesis propose rather propose to examine the various forms of intervention which seek to respond to the problem of hunger in this territory by developing a typology allowing them to be organized according to their degree of questioning of the food system. The current food system generates significant inequalities in terms of food access. By reinvesting it, the citizens of North Montreal are gradually developing a form of food democracy. The high level of food insecurity in Montreal-North demonstrates that the traditional approach, which generally revolves around top-down solutions to addressing the problem of hunger, is not enough to address the root of the problem. A new, more radical approach focused on bottom-up solutions must be identified in order to start thinking about the new alternatives available to the citizens of Montreal-North in order to truly tackle the structural causes of food insecurity.

200	Analyse de la réduction du chatoiement sur les images radar polarimétrique à l'aide des réseaux neuronaux à convolutions	Due to the coherent nature of the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) signal, polarimetric SAR(POLSAR) images are affected by speckle noise.  The effect of speckle can be so severe as to render the POLSAR data unusable. This is especially true for single-look data that suffer from very intense speckle. Noise filtering is necessary to improve the estimation of polarimetric parameters that can be computed from this type of data. This is an important step in the processing and analysis of POLSAR images.  Recently, a new approach has emerged in data processing aimed at solving a multi-tude of problems including filtering, image restoration, speech recognition, classification orimage segmentation.  This approach is deep learning and convolutional neural networks(CONVNET). Recent works show that CONVNET are a promising alternative for filtering SAR images. Indeed, by their ability to learn an optimal filtering model only from the data, they tend to outperform classical approaches to filtering on SAR images.  The objective of this study is to analyze and evaluate the effectiveness of CONVNET filtering on simulated POLSAR data and on RADARSAT-2, ALOS/PalSAR and GaoFen-3 satellite images acquired over the San Francisco urban area (California). Models inspired by the architecture of a CONVNET used in particular in super-resolution have been adapted for the filtering of the polarimetric coherency matrix.  The effect of different structural parameters of theCONVNET architecture on filtering were analyzed, among which are the depth of the neural network (the number of stacked layers), the width of the neural network (the number of filters per convoluted layer) and the size of the filters of the first convolution layer.  The models were learned by backpropagation of the error gradient using 3 datasets that simulate single-look polarimetry of the scatterers according to Cloude-Pottier classes. The first dataset contains only homogeneous areas. The last two datasets consist of patchwork simulations where local intensity is simulated by texture images and point target are added to the patchwork in the case of the last dataset. The performance of the different filters by CONVNET was measured by indicators including relative error on the estimation of polarimetric signatures and decomposition parameters as well as distortion measurements on the recovery of major details and on the conservation of point targets.The results show that CONVNET filtering of polarimetric data is either equivalent or significantly superior to conventional polarimetric filters. The results of the deepest models obtain the best performance for all indicators over the simulated homogeneous dataset. Inthe case of patchwork dataset, the results for detail restoration are clearly favourable to the deepest CONVNET filtering.  The application of CONVNET filtering on RADARSAT-2,  ALOS/PalSAR andGaoFen-3 satellite images shows results comparable or superior to conventional filters. The best results were obtained by the 5 hidden layers model (not counting the input and outputlayers), with 8 filters 3×3 per convolutional layer, except for the input layer where the filtersize was 9×9. On the other hand, the training data must be well adjusted to the statistical range of the real polarimetric images to obtain good results. This is especially true when modeling point targets that appear to be more difficult to restore.

201	Enjeux poétiques et énonciatifs de la narration à la première personne dans les trois premières Continuations du Conte du Graal	The Continuations of Chrétien de Troyes' Conte du Graal are a group of texts that has for long obfuscated critics of medieval French literature. The type of narrative coherence emerging from these texts is quite different from the type we associate with the texts of the master from Champagne. However, these texts are interesting because the complexity of their textual relationships can allow us to better understand issues pertaining to literary creation in the medieval era. Not exactly a cyclical type of text nor a literary genre in itself, continuation, in particular for the Continuations of the Conte du Graal, contains traces of its status as an experimental practice. The Continuations of the Conte du Graal thus occupy a moment of transition in the evolution of romance forms in the high medieval period. Each continuator shapes, with the help of the first person, the specific form he intends to give to his tale and steers the reception of his reader in a specific direction. The practice of continuation allows these authors to find a tool for experimenting with the multiple modalities of romance as a genre, which explains the strong heterogeneity, at times disconcerting, found within this group of texts. This master's thesis starts with an exploration of the genre situation of the Continuations of the Conte du Graal. It is followed by a detailed statistical analysis of the use of the first person in the narration of these texts. The final chapter proposes a general interpretative essay of the texts that makes use of the conclusions drawn from the two preliminary steps of this study.	medieval literature , French literature , Arthurian literature , narratology	en	24213.0
202	Meursault, contre-enquête de Kamel Daoud et L’Étranger de Camus : réappropriation et détournements dans le récit littéraire contemporain	Abstract A true story of parentage, Meursault, a counter-investigation is by Kamel Daoud, an Algerian columnist and writer of French expression. He prolongs and transgresses the fictional universe of Camus’s The Stranger from the point of view of the Arab. Published by Barzakh editions in Algeria, the novel receives the Goncourt Prize for the first novel in 2015. In Camus’s novel, Meursault shoots an Arab on a beach in Alger. The victim has no identity and remains anonymous; Camus’s text does not attribute any agency to it. Daoud’s novel is born from what is interpreted as an injustice by Haroun, brother of the murdered Arab and narrator of the story which will, from then on, avow a duty of commemoration and rehabilitation while being part of a reflection of contemporary Algeria. In this thesis, we examine in the first chapter the different theoretical processes, namely intertextuality, transtextuality and transfictionality which allow us to understand how Kamel Daoud stages the path that Haroun follows, on the model of the palimpsest, to say the History/the history of his family, his moods and to expose the problem of Algerian identity and its tumultuous relationship with the colonial past. In the second chapter, we see by what means Daoud extends Camus’s novel through the invention of a character and the restructuring of places and events. Finally, the last chapter looks at the ideological and political significance of Daoud’s work and what it implies as postcolonial reading and rewriting of the camusian work.

203	La Ceinture des Parques ; suivi de Neuf gouttes contre l’incendie : le ressassement textuel dans La petite fille qui aimait trop les allumettes	La Ceinture des Parques engages in a deadly dialogue with sea level rise. Focusing on the invisible and pragmatic hardships of that natural phenomenon, this post-apocalyptic fiction dives into the daily psychological suffering haunting those who live behind the dikes and wait in helplessness. Two survivors of the global submergence embody the idea that, when facing the oceanic invader, the worst is not in the storms but in what lies between them. The story then aims to turn the reader into a watcher.  It thus takes the page as a wall and the text as its flaw: every letter is a gash in the dam, a crack into which a threatening drop might seep. Through these rifts, the sea reshapes the language, erasing any rigidity in the words, imposing the rhythm of its waves that absorb the usual limits of writing to model them on the constant instability that defines coastline and tides. The more the text is developed, the more it condemns itself to be dissolved, letting the water come into the text to achieve a complete blend when the endings of the narrator, of its language and of the environment mix in a common dilution.  Neuf Gouttes is an essay exploring the hidden textual network spread by a narrator’s repetition and rumination. An enigmatic novel, La petite fille qui aimait trop les allumettes accumulates many frequent phrases throughout 200 pages. These similar words are trivial at first glance, but through them Gaétan Soucy’s text offers an alternate textual dynamic that differs according to the reader’s pragmatic cooperation level. The textual rumination stands out as the main force of the story, used by the narrator to adjust her writing speed in order to reach a safe balance between two converging endings: a material one and a psychological one. Between these two threats that get closer at each sentence, Alice Soissons must solve her family’s mystery before the writing becomes impossible, but also avoid rushing and crashing her testimony in an emotional explosion. The main goal of this essay is to analyse this paradox in which the plot uses reverses as the best way to make progress until its solving.

204	Entre historia y memoria : Días y noches de amor y de guerra y Memoria del fuego de Eduardo Galeano	This master's thesis is about two works that the Uruguayan writer Eduardo Galeano wrote with the aim of “revealing the past of Latin America as it happened” and, in this way, giving representativeness and visibility to the historical experiences of the Latin American collective. The first work, Días y noches de amor y de guerra (1978) remembers the military dictatorships of the Southern Cone of the 70s, as well as those significant experiences that he had throughout his life, including the memory of those subjects whom he interacted with. The second is, the trilogy Memoria del fuego (1982, 1984 and 1986) in which he recreates five centuries of history from experiences considered by the author as subaltern. In this study we try, through a detailed analysis of the subjects highlighted by Galeano, as well as the narrative resources used, to see how the writer approaches the historical events that he narrates, paying special attention to the use he makes of his memory as well as the archival sources consulted. We believe that his life experiences and the regional context of social unrest and dictatorships have influenced the narrative articulation of these texts, going beyond their historical character, becoming at the same time literary, political, and, above all, personal documents.

205	Les représentations sociales des acteurs judiciaires de la Chambre de la jeunesse du Québec au sujet de leurs rôles et du système de justice	Since the creation of the first youth criminal law in 1908, it has been modified several time. Canada’s vision about youth delinquents has evolved a lot between the Juvenile Delinquents Act (1908-1984), the Young Offenders Act (1984-2003) and the Youth Criminal Justice Act (2003 - present). As a result, we can observe a modification in the way the government takes the youth in charge. Seen at first as victim of their environment during most of the XX century, the minor received most of the accountability for their criminal behaviors afterwards. Nowadays, the political speeches are mainly oriented towards the protection of society and the risk management of criminals. This study wants to understand the social representations of the judicial actors about their own role in the justice system, the young criminals and the way they are supported by the system. The purpose of the thesis is also to understand the crime control paradigm present in the social representations of the judicial actors and how the changes in the law have influence or modified the social representations of the people who are in charge of applying the law. The twenty interviews done with the judges and the prosecutors allowed us to note a recurring tandem about the vision of the youth which will affect the way they will be supported. In any case, the protection of society is always the goal. Then, the concept of accountability, from the neoliberal philosophy, influences most of the discourse. Said discourse comes from the accountability of the professionals to the one of the young and their environment about the youth’s reeducation. At last, several elements influence the practice of the judicial actors, but the legislation’s modification is not the main one.

206	Les enfants victimes d'agression sexuelle : leur témoignage dans les différents types de cour et l'association entre le verdict et leur santé mentale	Victims of child sexual abuse (CSA) are likely to develop multiple psychological and social consequences in relation to their victimization. Sooner or later, many of these children may be involved in the justice system as witnesses, which can exacerbate the consequences for them. Objective. The judicial experience of children exposed to sexual abuse has rarely been documented in the scientific literature. The main objective of this Masters’ thesis is to foster a better understanding of the reality that these children who are involved in the justice system face and to contribute to inform researchers and professionals who work with CSA victims of the characteristics and needs of these children. Method. This project addresses the following three research questions: 1) What are the characteristics that distinguish CSA victims who a) did not testify in court from those who b) testified in the Criminal and Penal Chamber of the Court of Quebec or the Criminal Chamber of the Superior Court and those who c) testified in another court, either the Youth Chamber or the Family Chamber? 2) What are the characteristics that distinguish CSA victims whose cases has resulted in an acquittal or a guilty verdict? 3) Is there a link between the judge’s decision (verdict) and the psychological state of the CSA victim following psychotherapy? With the help of their parents, children who received services in a Child Advocacy Centre (Centre d’Expertise Marie-Vincent, CEMV) (n=177) filled out surveys concerning their legal implication, the support that they received and their psychological state. In order to study the type of judicial implication, we separated these children into three groups; CSA victims who testified at the Criminal and Penal Division (N=19), CSA victims who testified in court other than the Criminal and Penal Division (N=59), and CSA victims who did not testified (N=99). The participants’ ages ranged from 6 to 14 years old, 71,8% are girls (M=9,93; SD=2,060). Results. Older girls, who are victims of more severe, repetitive and intrafamilial sexual abuse, are more likely to testify in court. Also, girls who have been victims of intrafamilial sexual abuse more often testify in courts such as Youth Court (‘’ other court ‘’) and report experiencing more stress in relation to their disclosure than CSA victims who did not testify. Further, cases in which the accused are older are more likely to be processed in the Criminal and Penal Division. Finally, children for whom the accused was declared guilty were reported to experience less internalized behavior problems and anxiety symptoms than children for whom the accused was acquitted. Conclusion. The results of this study partially support the findings of past research. The finding observed in this research project as well as the methodological limitations encountered in its execution highlight the importance of continuing to conduct studies in the field in order to better guide interventions that can reduce the secondary victimization and distress of young victims of sexual abuse.	verdict , Child sexual abuse , Legal involvement , Mental health	en	24168.0
207	Au-delà de l’arc-en-ciel : parcours, trajectoires et altérités dans le Village de Montréal	This Master’s thesis explores the diversity and heterogeneity of space within Montréal’s (gay) Village. It seeks to analyze this neighborhood beyond what its ‘commercial showcase’ might reveal at first sight. The Village’s bars and clubs, as well as its shops, community organizations and sociodemographic composition, are not thought as homogeneous, but rather mosaics of multiple people, groups and communities across space. These latter, depending on their trajectories and routes, often have different perceptions and experiences of a single place or of the Village as a whole. Based on a document analysis and interviews with six (6) LGBTQ activists, this thesis reveals multiple strategies and ways to engage space, as well as the networks and spaces within Montreal’s Village where this diversity can be experienced.

208	Pour une approche dialogique de la responsabilité sociale des entreprises selon la perspective de l’approche constitutive de la communication organisationnelle (CCO)	Over the years, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has been mainly studied and enacted from a functionalist perspective on communication with the objective of ensuring a company’s good standing. More recently, this type of organizational engagement has begun to shift to a more dynamic and interactive approach. The goal is to reduce the boundaries between the company and its internal and external stakeholders in order to create a shared vision. With this approach, the company works on developing processes that are ideally compatible with the needs expressed by all actors concerned by its actions. Based on the Communicative constitution of organizations perspective (CCO), this master’s thesis reports on a study that examined how dialogical forms of communication constitutes and builds the societal and environmental commitment of two companies around a CSR initiative. Four interviews were conducted with key individuals responsible to deliver on these commitments for two Canadian companies. The analysis of these interviews shows how a set of elements and actors contribute to the processes of negotiation, implementation and improvement of strategies, policies and programs devoted to CSR initiatives.	communication constitutive des organisations , CCO , CSR , corporate social responsibility , communication constitutes organizations	en	24158.0
209	Modular construction of new porous hydrogen-bonded molecular materials	During the past few decades, designing molecular complexes with predetermined properties and predictable architectures was not possible. Although, it is possible to calculate the properties of individual molecules with confidence, the behavior of molecular assemblies remains unpredictable. Recently there has been a development of a strategy called “modular construction,” which can lead to producing well-defined and ordered materials with novel properties. This strategy uses molecular subunits that engage in non-covalent interactions such as hydrogen bonds to hold the neighboring modules in programmable positions. Since hydrogen bonds show high strength and directionality, an important objective is to devise molecular subunits that can take part in a large number of hydrogen bonds. Examples are compounds that incorporate multiple 4.6-diamino-1,3,5-triazinyl (DAT) groups. Our work has focused on introducing N(DAT)2 units, which offer the possibility of making ordered networks held together by even larger number of hydrogen bonds per molecule. We describe the structures and properties of crystalline materials of this type, in which increasing the number of hydrogen bonds gives rise to the formation of robust networks with high levels of porosity.

210	"""Es cultura de nuestras vidas"" : conserver et transmettre les savoir-faire artisanaux dans la Quebrada de Humahuaca, nord-ouest argentin"	In 2003, the Quebrada de Humahuaca, located in northwestern Argentina, was declared a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Site. Since its nomination, development of tourism in the region has intensified and there are a growing number of offers for tourists. The handicrafts of the Quebrada de Humahuaca region have become an icon of local craftsmanship that represents the ancestral culture of northwestern Argentina. Thus, the towns in the region are home to important craft ‘ferias’ and numerous souvenir shops. Although handicrafts seem to be valued in the region, the ones found there are often industrial products imported from Bolivia, or semi-industrial products produced in large quantities. In this context, the artisan producer has become a vulnerable figure, due to his independence and lack of visibility in the public arena. In the Quebrada de Humahuaca, promoting and valuing local handicrafts do not always go hand in hand. In this thesis I seek to understand what are the strategies deployed by craftsmen to enhance the value of their production, and how the local crafts are defined especially in regard to the values shared by producers. By focusing this research on the stories of some artisan producers in Quebrada de Humahuaca and on my own experience there, as a tourist and as a student in two craft courses, I will discuss the future of local crafts and how artisans organize themselves so as to conserve and transmit their know-how.

211	The Orphic Lyre : Music and Μουσική in the Rites of Orpheus	For the Greeks in Antiquity, religion was indiscernible from the rest of their daily lives – so much so that within the polis, the concept of a “separation between church and state”, in the way it is known today, did not exist. In this same realm of thought, music also functioned in a much similar way, an integral part of their religious ceremonies and, by extension, their way of life; through this, their music and religion became central to their idea of cultural identity. Many civic cults, such as the cult to Dionysus, utilized music to its fullest effect – many examples that detail the role that music played in their cult worship survive from antiquity, which vary from images found on vases and murals to hymns and other ritual texts. Orphism, or the cult which utilized writings said to have been passed down by the legendary musician Orpheus, differs from many other religious groups around Greece in that many aspects of it remain wrapped in an enigma. Not much is known about the specific cult practices outside of a few writings and inscriptions, including the Derveni papyrus, an analysis of an Orphic poem outlining a theogony similar to that of Hesiod, and the Orphic Hymns, both of which which are changing the way scholarship on these practices has been viewed through the years. This thesis will, therefore, use these sources in order to discover the role that music played in the cult rituals of Orphism during this period while also making comparisons between Orphism and the established traditions of other civic cults. Taking into account the utilization of instruments and other ritualistic conventions, this thesis hopes then to uncover Orphism’s overall role in the Greek polis.	cult music , polis religion , Greek antiquity , Orphism , musicology	en	24132.0
212	L’expérience de l’eau à travers l’artefact urbain : le cas de Montréal	Like other cities, Montreal is facing global warming and increasing urbanization. As a result, heat waves intensify to the point of becoming a serious public health issue causing discomfort and death among city dwellers. Current measures to mitigate heat islands include greening and spraying water. The latter is particularly critical in the local context: Montreal has become an impervious island gradually disconnecting from its rivers and streams, losing a valuable heritage. The design of water features—like fountains, ponds, water games—could follow policies aimed at adapting to climate change and improving pedestrian environments. However, currently offered water features do not all meet the needs of users, notably in terms of universal accessibility criteria. This study will adopt a user-centred industrial design perspective to better understand how water features can foster positive and inclusive experiences among urban dwellers. We will set our ideas of design and experience by adopting a phenomenological and constructivist approach, using concepts of aesthetic experience and habitability. We will analyze our main subject according to the concept of the Human Scale City developed by architect Jan Gehl and adopted by the city of Montreal. This theoretical corpus will help us understand the contextual, social and sensory characteristics of urban water features.  First, a literature review will reveal how the historical evolution of functions and uses related to water features influences their design and popularity nowadays. Then, we will observe and compare two modern fountains to induce which qualities foster their success. In this aim, we will analyze the results of the observations on three scales: 1) the contextual and socio-cultural environment of the neighborhood, 2) the integration to the surrounding built environment, and 3) the users and their interactions with the water feature.  Our main goal is to study the urban experience of water and demonstrate the relevance of the design approach to tackle the modern city challenges. Thus, we hope to sensitize the various actors involved in the implementation of urban water features, and more broadly contribute to the corpus on the impact of the design on the public space.	artefact urbain , industrial design , user experience , urban artefact , water feature , human scale , water , city , fountain	en	24117.0

environnementales pour l’analyse économique :
définition et enjeux"	The article proposes a presentation of the different possible normative foundations for an economic analysis of environmental inequalities. For this purpose, the article begins by putting the analysis of inequalities in a context of fairness economics. Four different forms of environmental inequality that can provide a basis for the normative consideration of environmental inequalities in economics are then presented. Finally, the different trade-offs between this normative goal of justice and those concerning other valuable aspects of a society are presented. All in all, the article provides a guide for the economic analysis of environmental inequalities from a normative perspective.

214	La fluidité graphique chez les enfants atteints du syndrome de Gilles de la Tourette et de tics persistants	Objective: Tourette syndrome (TS) and pervasive chronic tic disorder are mainly characterized by motor and/or phonic tics that can be accompanied by neuropsychological impairment and executive function deficits. Among executive functions, design fluency involves the ability to draw as many different designs as possible in a given time. Only a few studies have focused on design fluency in TS. The aim of this study was to characterize the design fluency profile of children with TS compared with neurotypical children (i.e. without TS) using the Five- Point-Test, which has been shown to be sensitive to frontal lobe dysfunction and frontostriatal lesions. The severity of tics was also considered, together with ADHD symptoms as the high prevalence of comorbid disorders is a major concern in studies on TS. Method: Seventy-six children aged between 6 and 15 years participated in the study and were divided in two groups (TS group n=43, control group n=33). Our objective was addressed by considering a wide range of performance and process measures. Total number of designs, repetitions, repetition ratio, unique designs, numerical, spatial, and total strategies were examined for the total duration of the test (performance measures) and at five equal time intervals (process measures). Results: The TS group produced significantly fewer total designs and numerical strategies. A trend towards intergroup differences was observed for all other five measures. Groups did not differ in process measures. Conclusion: Designe fluency seems a promising tool for identifying and specifying cognitive deficits that may arise in children with TS.

215	Platelets selectively regulate the release of BDNF, but not that of its precursor protein, proBDNF	Background: Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays a role in synaptic plasticity and neuroprotection. BDNF has well-established pro-survival effects, whereas its precursor protein, proBDNF, induces apoptosis. Thus, it has been suggested that the proBDNF/BDNF ratio could be an indicator of neuronal health. Access to neurons is, understandably, limited. Because of their similarities, platelets have been put forward as a non-invasive biomarker of neuronal health; indeed, they store large quantities of BDNF and can release it into circulation upon activation, similarly to neurons. However, whether platelets also express the precursor proBDNF protein remains unknown. We therefore sought to characterize proBDNF levels in human platelets and plasma.  Methods: The presence of proBDNF was assessed by immunoblotting, cell fractionation, flow cytometry, and confocal microscopy in washed platelets from 10 healthy volunteers. Platelets from 20 independent healthy volunteers were activated with several classical agonists and the release of BDNF and proBDNF into plasma was quantified by ELISA.  Results: Platelets expressed detectable levels of proBDNF (21 ± 13 fmol/250 x 106 platelets). ProBDNF expression was mainly localized in the intracellular compartment. The proBDNF to BDNF molar ratio was ~1:5 in platelets and 10:1 in plasma. In stark contrast to the release of BDNF during platelet activation, intraplatelet and plasma concentrations of proBDNF remained stable following stimulation with classical platelet agonists, consistent with non-granular expression.  Conclusions: Platelets express both the mature and the precursor form of BDNF. Whether the intraplatelet proBDNF to BDNF ratio could be used as a non-invasive biomarker of cognitive health warrants further investigation.

216	"Inconsistencies between measures of cognitive dysfunction in childhood acute lymphoblastic
leukemia survivors : description and understanding"	Objectives The frequency of cognitive difficulties in childhood cancer survivors varies according to the measurement strategy. The goal of this research is to (a) describe agreements and differences between measures of working memory and attention (b) identify contributors of these differences, such as emotional distress, affects, and fatigue.  Methods We used data available for 138 adults successfully treated for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (PETALE cohort). Working memory and attention were assessed using subtests from the WAIS‐IV and self‐reported questionnaires (BRIEF‐SR and CAARS‐S:L). Potential contributors included emotional distress, anxiety, depression (BSI‐18), affects (PANAS), and fatigue (PedsQL‐MFS). We explored measurement agreements and differences using diagnostic indices and multivariate regression models.  Results The frequencies of working memory and attention deficits were higher when using cognitive tests (15%‐21%) than with self‐reports (10%‐11%). Self‐reported questionnaires showed high specificity (median 0.87) and low sensitivity (median 0.10), suggesting they did not reliably identify positive cases on cognitive tests. We identified negative affectivity as a possible contributor to inconsistencies between self‐report and test results.  Conclusions When measuring working memory and attention in childhood ALL survivors, cognitive test results and self‐reports should not be considered equivalent. At best, self‐report may be used for screening (high specificity), but not to assess prevalence in large samples. Self‐reported difficulties are also probably influenced by the negative mood in this population.

217	Évaluation économique de l'ajustement des antihypertenseurs par le pharmacien en milieu communautaire	OBJECTIVE: Hypertension is a chronic disease for which only 68% of treated patients were controlled in Canada in 2013. Pharmacists in the province of Québec recently received legislative authority to adjust the dosage of antihypertensive drugs if there is an agreement with the prescriber of the therapeutic target. This research aims to estimate the incremental cost- utility ratio (ICUR) of this new model of care in Québec. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to extrapolate the impact of this pharmacy practice on strokes, myocardial infarctions and mortality. Framingham Risk Equations were used to derive the impact of blood pressure control on strokes and myocardial infarctions. The efficacy of the intervention was derived from the RxAction clinical trial, conducted in Alberta. Efficacy was expressed as the proportion of patients with controlled blood pressure. The model used the payer perspective and direct costs only. The main clinical outcome was expressed as the number of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. Both QALYS and costs were discounted at a 1.5% annual rate. A cohort of 1000 patients entered the model at 65 years old. The model used a 20 years time horizon, with a 1-year cycle length. RESULTS: The model yielded 0.051 QALYs per patient in the intervention group for an incremental expense of $268 per patient. The ICUR was 5,223 $/QALY. At a willingness-to- pay threshold of $50,000/QALY, the intervention is cost-effective. The results were sensitive to the comparative efficacy of the pharmacist intervention against usual care and to the utility of hypertension. CONCLUSION: Providing pharmacists the ability to adjust the dosage of antihypertensive drugs within the actual fee-for-service rational appears to be cost-effective. Obtaining data on the efficacy of this pharmacy practice from a trial conducted in Québec would provide better data to inform this economic evaluation.

218	Barrières et facilitateurs au dépistage du cancer du sein et à la mammographie auprès de femmes immigrantes	Breast cancer is the most common malignant disease among women. Since the introduction of breast cancer screening programs in the early 2000s, the mortality rate of women with breast cancer in Canada decreased significantly. Despite this decrease, recent immigrant women (who arrived in the host country less than 10 years ago) in Canada have been found to use breast cancer screening programs less frequently. The purpose of this thesis is to shed some light on the state of knowledge related to breast cancer screening among immigrant women, with emphasis on the challenges they face when accessing or using breast screening programs. We first conducted a literature review to describe the current barriers and benefits of using breast cancer screening among immigrant women. Using Lévesque’s patient-centered access to healthcare framework, the data was organized into five major categories: (1) “perception of needs and desire for screening”, (2) “breast cancer screening seeking”, (3) “breast cancer screening reaching”, (4) “breast cancer screening utilisation”, and (5) “breast cancer screening consequences”. The second study was a cross-sectional analysis of the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS, 2013/2014) to update the data regarding the use of mammography services among women aged 50 to 69 years. Several socioeconomic factors were significantly related to the low use of mammography services, including: age, marital status (divorced, widowed, or single), lower income, lower level of education, status of immigration (being an immigrant), lack of access to a family doctor, body mass index (obese class 3), and smoking status (being a smoker), etc. Finally, we present the findings of a qualitative study which was conducted to investigate the barriers and facilitators to mammography screening use among recent immigrant women from Northwest Africa (Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco) currently residing in Montreal. As in the narrative review, again based on the Lévesque et al. conceptual framework, the participants identified common barriers and facilitators to accessing screening: “perception of needs and 8 desire for screening”, “breast cancer screening seeking”, “breast cancer screening reaching”, “breast cancer screening utilisation”, and “breast cancer screening consequences”. The results of this thesis indicated that there were various barriers (e.g. sociocultural, socioeconomic, etc.) to accessing breast cancer screening and /or mammography among immigrant women. It is important to implement new interventional tools adapted to the common barriers and diverse needs of immigrant women in order to promote preventive culture and enable them to make informed choices regarding screening mammography.

219	Notes de programme : une histoire, des pratiques et de nouveaux usages numériques	Since their appearance in the mid-nineteenth century, program notes, sometimes containing detailed information on the works that are about to be performed, have continued to meet audiences needs during concerts. They respond to a wide range of needs: providing intelligible comprehension tools for laymen and laywomen, who discover the music of the past and of the present, while arousing the curiosity of well-accustomed listeners, who increase their knowledge and cultivation. This goes for program notes as well as other music appreciation tools, torn between the desire to make classical music accessible to all and, on the other hand, the rigorous approach to musicology that is expected from connoisseurs. In this thesis, we combine both theory and practice. In addition to an inquiry, conducted in October 2017 as part of three concert nights at the Orchestre symphonique de Montréal (hereafter, OSM) – an inquiry which gives us an idea of how program notes are regarded by concert audiences –, we will display a series of short open educational videos that we produced for the OSM, during the 2015-2016 season. The work necessary for these new digital tools is partly based on the analysis of a large body of former program notes from which we have identified a number of trends and specific cases. The results of the inquiry show that the OSM’s audience, far from being homogeneous, is made up of listeners who bear very different expectations. According to many, the program notes are considered appropriate for one’s concert experience. However, they may also spring critical reactions among concertgoers: either too detailed, tedious for some, or somewhat dull for others. Although audience members have different musical backgrounds and scales of knowledge, both novices and connoisseurs seem to share a common interest in the music itself, which needs to be explained through means of analysis. This interest is being fulfilled by program notes, in line with the requirements of musicological research. The question remains: how can one describe a work of music in order to meet the needs of everyone? In this thesis, we try to find appropriate answers to this matter.

220	L’histoire et la culture de Shanghai, et l’amitié et la sexualité féminines dans Le Chant des regrets éternels	This master’s thesis deals with the history and culture of Shanghai, the female friendship, the love and the sexuality, with the analysis of the literary text: The Song of Eternal Sorrow of Wang Anyi. It is divided into two chapters: the first chapter unfolds the study of the history and culture of Shanghai. “Paris of the Orient” of the past and current economic center, Shanghai occupies a special and major position in the history of China. Thus, the analysis of the history and culture of Shanghai could help us know this mythical city and the current China. It will also help us review and reflect on China’s culture in world history and globalization. The second chapter will focus on the theme of female friendship, love and sexuality in The Song of Eternal Sorrow, by analyzing the story with relevant theories. As Louise Bernikow wrote: “The lack of female intimacy in literature is, in part, the result of the male perspective.” (1980: 5). So to discuss female friendship from the point of view of comparative literature and intercultural communication is a very interesting subject. Here are some aspects of which I will speak here: the friendship between women as a form of resistance to patriarchy; female solidarity and rivalry; the elaboration of feminine subjectivity; the greatness and miseries of friendship between women; love and sexuality under the awakening of the feminist notion, etc. In conclusion, we will review the analysis with a comparison of a Chinese and Western point of view to contrast Quebec and Chinese cultures in terms of feminism.

221	Exploration de la culture alimentaire biomédicalisée québécoise : de l'alimentation « saine » à la production de corps différenciés	This PhD thesis presents, from a cultural studies perspective, a critical and situated (Haraway, 1988) exploration of Quebec’s contemporary food culture and of the various definitions of “healthy” food it produces and renders effective. More precisely, I analyse the power relationships that inform its development as well as those taking form and effectivity through the knowledge and practices constitutive of healthy food (and its multiple forms and modes of existence). Through critical analysis of the current Quebec food culture, I question the bodies, human and more-than-human ones, that are produced therein, and are differentiated by unequal power relationships. The analysis presented is the result of an embodied and dialogic ethnography following the methods of materials gathering and analysis suggested by Probyn (2016). The thesis is separated into three distinct, but interrelated, parts. The first part explores Quebec’s food culture, in which I am fully immersed. This part presents the food culture and the knowledge, practices, and events that it contributes to creating, as well as the multiplicity of healthy food definitions that emerge within it, according to their various contexts of emergence. Throughout this part, I highlight how particular kinds of knowledge are produced, articulated and legitimated, as well as how relationships involving and linking humans and more-than-humans are produced and conveyed. I demonstrate how all of these processes participate in the multiple modes of emergence of healthy food in Quebec. In the current food culture, healthy food is regularly thought and problematized in relationship to human bodies. The second part of the thesis presents my analysis of what I have called the biomedicalized food culture, attending especially to the relationships between bodies, food, and health it contributes to creating. I put at the forefront how the current food culture cannot be analysed without taking into account the contemporary “healthist” (Crawford, 1980) discourses that inform the manners by which bodies are put in relation to food, under health-oriented considerations. I mobilize the conceptual tools proposed by Clarke et al. (2010) on the biomedicalization of the social field to question how food and bodies are put in relation and problematized, in a context where health is a moral and individual objective to reach (Crawford, 1980; Lupton, 1997; Metzl et Kirkland, 2010). I criticize how the biomedicalized food culture limits the type of relationships that can take form and be considered between food and bodies, as well as the types of bodies that are produced and authorized.  The third part of the thesis is concerned with the bodies, human and more-than-human ones, that are produced within the biomedicalized food culture, as much as by the power relationships that participate in their production and differentiation. By “produce”, I mean among other things how bodies are discursively defined, framed, controlled, etc.; evaluated, characterized, discriminated, excluded, stigmatized; materially produced (their corporeal materialities, their biology, etc.). I navigate between different manners of analysing their production as much as I explore the different types of bodies that are produced, drawing on reflections (and literatures) that apprehend and question them from various epistemologies.

222	Optimization of High Field Asymmetric Waveform Ion Mobility Spectrometry to enhance the comprehensiveness of mass spectrometry-based proteomic analyses	The high complexity of biological samples can confound protein identification and compromise the depth and coverage of mass spectrometry-based proteomic analyses. Separation techniques that provide improved peak capacity and selectivity of LC-MS/MS analyses are often sought to overcome these limitations. High-field asymmetric waveform ion mobility spectrometry (FAIMS), a differential ion mobility device, has shown significant advantages by enhancing the transmission of multiple-charged peptide ions by reducing singly-charged interferences. In this context, the goal of this thesis was to explore the analytical capabilities of FAIMS to extend both the dynamic range of proteins/peptides detection and the precision of quantitative proteomic measurements by mass spectrometry. For this, we systematically integrated FAIMS in standard workflows to monitor the dynamic changes of the human proteome in response to hyperthermia. We first studied the merits of FAIMS to aid isobaric labeling quantification with tandem mass tags (TMT). This approach allows the labeling of peptide ions with different chemical groups of identical nominal masses but differing in their respective distribution of stable isotopes. TMT-labeled peptide ions produce reporter ions of distinct masses once fragmented by MS/MS. Unfortunately, the co-selection of precursor ions often leads to chimeric MS/MS spectra, and a slower MS3 centric approach is needed for precise quantification. Since FAIMS improves peak capacity by selectively transmitting ions based on their compensation voltage (CV), we obtained less peptide co-selection. FAIMS improved TMT quantification at the MS2 level and achieved 68 % more quantified peptides compared to regular LC-MS/MS, providing a deeper insight into the dynamic changes of the human proteome in response to heat stress. Further, we investigated stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) quantification. If interferences co-elute simultaneously with SILAC isotopomers, quantification becomes inaccurate and SILAC counterparts can be missassigned to interfering ions in the highly populated chromatogram, thus skewing the SILAC ratio. FAIMS post-ionization fractionation could filter out background ions that can otherwise be attributed to a SILAC pair/triplet for quantification. In this work, FAIMS was especially beneficial for low abundant species and outperformed the standard strong cation exchange (SCX) fractionation workflow. In addition, FAIMS allowed the separation of phosphoisomers that are frequently observed in complex phosphoproteome extracts. The third aim of this work explored the charge state separation and enhanced transmission of highly charged peptides with FAIMS and its application for SUMOylated peptide analysis. FAIMS could enhance the transmission of triply charged SUMOylated peptides over typical tryptic peptide that are predominantly doubly charged, by applying more negative CVs with FAIMS. This allowed for gas-phase enrichment of SUMOylated peptide ions. FAIMS is an alternate and more straightforward approach to fractionate SUMOylated peptides that reduced sample loss, avoided sample processing, while increasing peak capacity in a more automated manner and added one order of magnitude in sensitivity. The last aim of this thesis was to improve the FAIMS instrumentation by interfacing it to the latest state-of-the-art instruments. With a new FAIMS device developed by our collaborators at Thermo Fisher Scientific, we demonstrate the robustness and the improved ion transmission for the new interface. In simple shotgun proteomics, FAIMS extended the dynamic range by one order of magnitude for deeper proteome coverage compared to regular LC-MS/MS. Moreover, fewer MS2 chimeric scans were generated with FAIMS gas-phase fractionation, which garnered more identifications and better quantification. For this, we directly compared LC-FAIMS-MS/MS to LC-MS/MS/MS using synchronous precursor selection (SPS) with and without basic reverse phase fractionation. Comparable quantitative measurements were obtained for all methods, except that FAIMS provided a 2.5-fold increase in the number of quantifiable peptides compared with non-FAIMS experiments. Overall, this thesis highlights some of the advantages that FAIMS can provide for proteomics experiments by improving both peptide identification and quantification.

223	A tutorial on dealing with time‐varying eligibility for treatment: Comparing the risk of major bleeding with direct‐acting oral anticoagulants vs warfarin	In this tutorial, we focus on the problem of how to define and estimate treatment effects when some patients develop a contraindication and are thus ineligible to receive a treatment of interest during follow-up. We first describe the concept of positivity, which is the requirement that all subjects in an analysis be eligible for all treatments of interest conditional on their baseline covariates, and the extension of this concept in the longitudinal treatment setting. We demonstrate using simulated datasets and regression analysis that under violations of longitudinal positivity, typical associational estimates between treatment over time and the outcome of interest may be misleading depending on the data-generating structure. Finally, we explain how one may define “treatment strategies,” such as “treat with medication unless contraindicated,” to overcome the problems linked to time-varying eligibility. Finally, we show how contrasts between the expected potential outcomes under these strategies may be consistently estimated with inverse probability weighting methods. We provide R code for all the analyses described.

224	Have we reproduced Rat Park? Conceptual but not direct replication of the protective effects of social and environmental enrichment in addiction	The Rat Park studies are classic experiments in addiction neuroscience, yet they have not been successfully replicated directly and several serious methodological criticisms have been raised. However, the conceptual reproducibility of the Rat Park studies is supported by both contemporaneous and subsequent research. Contemporaneous research on social and environmental enrichment frequently found social isolation rendered rats less sensitive to the effects of drugs of abuse. The Rat Park studies therefore confirmed the importance of social and environmental enrichment and extended this literature to suggest that enrichment reduced opioid consumption. Subsequent studies have also demonstrated social and environmental enrichment reduces drug consumption. However, there are also several papers reporting no effects of enrichment (or ‘negative’ results) and caveats from studies that show genes, age, sex and drug of abuse are all important parameters. While the Rat Park studies did not use methods that are reliable by current standards, enrichment has been shown to reliably reduce opioid consumption and this effect can generalise to other drugs of abuse.

225	Écrire les SHS en environnement numérique : l’éditeur de texte Stylo	Scientific writing and editing in a digital context are relatively little interrogated or questioned. A few tools, which pose a number of questions and problems, are used to structure, format and produce academic documents. Faced with these often proprietary solutions, Stylo is a writing and editing tool that meets scientific requirements, and is currently used by academic journals. Experimenting with Stylo opens up the prospect of new digital writing practices while fueling theoretical reflection on the structuring of our thinking.

226	Les relations d'attachement et d'activation parent-enfant et l’anxiété chez les enfants d'âge préscolaire	Anxiety disorders are the most prevalent disorders in children and adolescents. The symptoms appear quickly in the child's development and often persist into adulthood. Many researches have been conducted on the predictors of anxiety. Several studies show that there is an association between insecure attachment and anxiety, particularly ambivalent and disorganized attachment. In recent years, a new concept has been used to evaluate the parent-child relationship, the activation relationship. This new measure is complementary to the attachment relationship because it considers the dimensions of discipline and stimulation to risk taking, while attachment is based on the dimension of comfort. Several studies have also found associations between anxiety and activation. As a result, the primary goal of this research is to determine which association is stronger with anxiety: attachment or activation. The second objective is to understand if the parent's sex is a moderator of the association between anxiety and the two relationships. The sample is composed of 38 parents and their children, aged 3 to 5 years. The measuring instruments used are the anxiety/depression scale of the CBCL questionnaire for the anxiety scores, the strange situation for attachment and for the activation relationship, the risky situation. The results show that the activation relationship is associated with anxiety, whereas this is not the case for the attachment relationship. In addition, the parent's gender is not a moderator of the associations between anxiety and attachment or activation relationships.

227	Comparaison de systèmes de traduction automatique pour la post édition des alertes météorologique d'Environnement Canada	The purpose of this paper is to determine the strategy for the automatic translation of weather warnings produced by Environment Canada, which requires the least post-editing effort by the proofreaders of the Translation Bureau. We will begin by developing a bilingual corpus of weather warnings representative of this task. Then, this data will be used to compare the performance of different approaches of machine translation, translation memory configurations and hybrid systems. We will compare the results of these models with the system WATT, the latest system provided by RALI for Environment Canada, as well as with the industry systems GoogleTranslate and DeepL. Finaly, we will study an automatic post-edition system.

228	Compression in Sequence to Sequence Learning for Natural Language Processing	In this work, we propose a near lossless method for encoding long sequences of texts as well as all of their sub-sequences into feature rich representations. We test our method on sentiment analysis and show good performance across all sub-sentence and sentence embeddings. This work also demonstrates the use of knowledge distillation and quantization to compress the original Transformer model [Vaswani et al., 2017] for the translation task. We are, to the best of our knowledge, the first to show that 8-bit quantization of the weights of the Transformer can achieve the same BLEU score as the full-precision model. Furthermore, when we combine knowledge distillation with weight quantization, we can train smaller Transformer networks and achieve up to 12.59x compression while losing only 2.51 BLEU off the baseline on the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task. Chapter 1 introduces machine learning concepts for natural language processing which are essential to understanding both papers presented in this thesis. Chapter 2 and 3 cover each paper respectively, before finally concluding with chapter 4.	compression , machine learning , deep learning , natural language processing , sequence to sequence	en	23787.0
229	Towards learning sentence representation with self-supervision	In chapter 1, we introduce the basics of feed forward neural networks and recurrent neural networks. The chapter continues with the discussion of the backpropagation algorithm to train feed forward neural networks, and the backpropagation through time algorithm to train recurrent neural networks. We also discuss three different approaches in learning representations, namely supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and a relatively new approach called self-supervised learning.  In chapter 2, we talk about the fundamentals of deep natural language processing. Specifically, we cover word representations, sentence representations, and language modelling. We focus on the evaluation and current state of the literature for these concepts. We close the chapter by discussing large scale pre-training and transfer learning in language.  In chapter 3, we investigate a set of self-supervised tasks that take advantage of noise contrastive estimation in order to learn sentence representations using unlabeled data. We train our model on a large corpora and evaluate our learned sentence representations on a set of downstream natural language tasks from the SentEval framework. Our model trained on the proposed tasks outperforms unsupervised methods on a subset of tasks from SentEval.  In chapter 4, we introduce a memory augmented model called Ordered Memory with several improvements over traditional stack-augmented recurrent neural networks. We introduce a new Stick-breaking attention mechanism inspired by Ordered Neurons [Shen et.al., 2019] to write in and erase from the memory. A new Gated Recursive Cell is also introduced to compose low level representations into higher level ones. We show that this model performs well on the logical inference task and the ListOps task, and it also shows strong generalization properties in these tasks. Finally, we evaluate our model on the SST (Stanford Sentiment Treebank) tasks (binary and fine-grained) and report results that are comparable with state-of-the-art on these tasks.

230	"Traverser le paysage : une réflexion sur l’appropriation spatio-temporelle des espaces (nature) urbains. 
Le cas du parc Frédéric-Back à Montréal"	Nature – viewed as both environment and landscape – as well as durability are becoming key concepts in how we think the urban fabric. They are increasingly used as buzzwords in social mixing and renovation debates. Around the world, old industrial sites or vacant spaces are being transformed into green public spaces. However, many scholars are beginning to question whether those strategies will be able to answer not only environmental, but above all social challenges facing our contemporary cities. Many are doubting their ability to create public space. Under the guise of social and participative urban planning, those new spaces seem more and more designed to promote the widespread understanding of key concepts like urbanity, durability and nature. In building our research around the case of Frédéric-Back Park – an old quarry redesigned as an urban park – between two peri-central Montreal districts, we hope to re-assess the ways we produce those kind of spaces. Our goal will be to pose a critical view on the power-play between actors and the power relations which gave form to the park as well as the capacity of nature, public space and durability – as concepts – to provide answers to socio-ecological challenges faced by local populations.

231	L’aventure d’une miniature en Haïti : poétique de la lodyans chez Gary Victor et Verly Dabel	"This thesis focuses on the literary genre of lodyans (""audience"" in French), through a study of short texts by two contemporary Haitian writers, Gary Victor and Verly Dabel. These popular authors, whose works shed light on the sociopolitical wrongs of their society, are living and writing in Haiti. They are inspired by a local ""oraliture"" as they renew the written tradition of lodyansè (audienciers) initiated by Justin Lhérisson at the beginning of the 20th century. Through an analysis of Victor’s and Dabel’s short works (numbering twenty collections for the first, and four for the latter), we will see that the hitherto underexamined genre of lodyans meets specific criteria already partly suggested by criticism (Anglade, Ndiaye) but also calls for further critical demonstration and refinement. Through substantial readings of Gary Victor and Verly Dabel's short stories, works which have largely been overlooked by scholarship thus far, this thesis asserts that lodyans is a dynamic genre with its own formal and thematic codes. The first part of the thesis allows readers unfamiliar with lodyans to acquaint themselves with its development and mechanics, by outlining the history of this literary genre and by proposing a definition and theorization of this art of speech as it has been adapted to written forms. The other three parts feature an interpretation of the corpus in light of the genre of lodyans. Thus, the second chapter is devoted to a mainly structural analysis, through an examination of the particular way in which lodyansè Victor and Dabel tell their stories ; the third chapter illustrates the privileged theme of the genre, the unequal face-to-face contact between powerful characters and poor people who manage to get by; and finally, the last chapter questions the ambiguous function of the supernatural (attested by the presence of fantastic and magical elements derived from voodoo and popular superstitions) in the stories – the latter proving to be generically very hybrid and less typically realistic than those of their predecessors lodyansè. This research situates lodyans as a specific type of narrative, leveraging a social criticism that is veiled with humor – a culturally emblematic ""miniature"" work situated between the tale and the short-story in the traditional scale of genres in the West – and aims to show the richness and relevance of a section of Haitian literature that has long been underexamined by scholars."

232	Le Centre des auteurs dramatiques (CEAD) : action structurante et trajectoire (1965-1980)	The influence of the Centre des auteurs dramatiques (CEAD) on the emergence and future of Quebec and French-Canadian theatre is undeniable. However, its trajectory, as well as its action, have not yet been the subject of an in-depth study. This thesis therefore proposes, based on a detailed analysis of the CEAD archives themselves, a first historical study of its first fifteen years of existence, from 1965, the year it was founded, to 1980. We first try to identify the particular context from which the organization was created in order to reveal its uniqueness and to understand how the founders, who are all playwrights, reflected on their place in the theatre community. We then propose an analysis of the trajectory of the CEAD during the short but turbulent period from 1968 to 1980, when the organization, with more corporatist than political aims, had to deal with the dazzling emergence of the committed theatre and the movement of collective creation, rejecting in particular the figure of the dramatic author. This thesis is intended as a contribution to historical research on theatre in Quebec.

233	Non responsabilité criminelle pour cause de troubles mentaux : comparaison des pratiques de supervision des Commissions d’examen aux peines prononcées dans le système pénal	Since the 1990’s, the number of individuals found not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder has increased in Canada. However, the NCRMD verdict remains controversial. While some fear that the verdict is a loophole and releases dangerous individuals in the community, others suggest that this defense could cause more control than a sentence in the criminal justice system. Some also question the ability of Review Boards to leave aside the punitive rationale in the decision-making process.  Objective: This study examines the supervison practices imposed to NCRMD accused by comparing them with those applied to offenders found guilty and responsible (GR). This comparison aims to highlight the specificities these two populations’ trajectories (length of supervision, length of detention and presence of detention in follow-up), in three Canadian provinces (Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia) between 2000 and 2008. Two datasets were used. The first comprises individuals found NCRMD (n = 1794) and comes from the National Trajectory Project of Individuals Found Not Criminally Responsible on Account of Mental Disorder in Canada. The second comprises GR offenders (n = 320,919) and comes from Statistics Canada's Criminal Court Survey. Results: The Cox and logistic regressions results show that NCRMD individuals are almost three times and four times likely to be released from legal supervision and detention respectively compared to GR offenders, and are five times more likely to be detained during follow-up. Provincial differences were also observed, theses disparities being significantly greater among NCRMD individuals.

234	La réussite criminelle des participants à la fraude financière en ligne	Carding is a criminal phenomenon which consists of compromising financial data in order to do fraudulent transactions. Several private and public parties highlighted the size of the loss caused by this new form of criminality. From the criminological angle, little research is available in the size and scope of the phenomenon, particularly on the criminal achievement of this kind of online offenders (called carders). To fill this gap, this research project is aimed at understand the criminal achievement of carders by observing the impact of their personal and social characteristics on their criminal income. Theses variables relate among others to their market activities or their sociodemographic. To do so, an online survey, hosted on Tor, was conducted. A total of 49 completed surveys were collected to do our analysis. By describing these personal and social characteristics, this work has been able to update our knowledge about carders and to address gaps about certain part of what we known about carding. Overall, the results shown that few carders can claim a good criminal achievement and that a minority of them can earn large amounts of money. Experience, speciliazed skills, the use of online forums or play the role of broker explained the criminal achievement among carders.Apart from the fact that our study brings some answers about those predictors, this project highlights the strengths and weaknesses of using an online survey to collect data from a criminal ecosystem.	carding , survey , Criminal achievement	en	23717.0
235	Exister entre deux cases : l’expérience de l'identité de genre non-binaire	"In this master thesis, we aim to understand the experience of individuals who identify with non-binary gender identity through a sociological, constructivist and interactionist perspective. We position non-binary gender identity inside the binary gender system, thus to better understand the reality of these individuals with the use of the literature. This research links the concepts of ""self-presentation"" and ""social support"" in order to reach its goal. This qualitative work mobilizes six semi-directed interviews with people who self-identify as gender non-binary. An analysis of this issue reveals five main themes useful to understand the experience of non-binary people. The results show that gender identity is constructed through an identification process inevitably affected by binary gender norms, based on informational support and the presence of social representation. This identification makes it possible to answer a questioning generally present since childhood and is constructed through an opposition between an internalization of the binary gender system and a desire to criticize it. There are also individual variations in self-presentation, in terms of language and embodiment, despite a norm of androgyny associated with gender non-binarity. A self-presentation that is pleasant to the individual is linked to a feeling of well-being and would have an impact on one's relationship to the world. It is, in fact, influenced by the degree of perceived support and has a variety of objectives, this identity always being intrinsically political. In addition, the level of perceived social support varies across social circles, thus influencing proximity and comfort in relationships. Education and awareness of gender non-binarity are ultimately described as relevant to filling a gap in the general understanding of this identity, influencing the experience of non-binary people."

236	Impact of a social skills program on children’s stress : a cluster randomized trial	Background: Most preschool children in Western industrialized countries attend child care during the day while parents work. Studies suggest that child care may be stressful to young children, perhaps because they still lack the social skills to interact daily in a group setting away from parents. This gap in social abilities may be greater for children in lower-income families, who may face more adversity at home, with fewer resources and more social isolation.  Methods: We conducted a cluster-randomized controlled trial in 2013-2014 to test whether a social skills intervention led by early childhood educators within the child care center could reduce diurnal cortisol levels to more typical patterns expected of children this age. We randomized 19 public child care centers (n = 361 children) in low-income neighborhoods of Montreal, Canada, to either: 1) the Minipally program - intervention group (n = 10 centers; 186 children), or 2) waiting list - control group (n = 9 centers; 175 children). Saliva samples for cortisol levels were collected 3 times/day, pre- and post-implementation. The Minipally puppet program consists of 2 workshops/month for 8 months for the development of social skills and self-regulation in 2-5-year-olds, with reinforcement activities between workshops. Educators received 2-days' training and 12 h' supervision in Minipally.  Results: Linear mixed models for repeated measures revealed a significant interaction between intervention status and time of day of cortisol sampling (β = -0.18, p = 0.04). The intervention group showed patterns of decreasing diurnal cortisol secretion (β = -0.32, p < 0.01), whereas the control group showed increasing slopes (β = 0.20, p < 0.01). Moreover, family income was a moderator; children in lower-income families benefited most from the intervention.  Conclusion: Results suggest that a social skills training program, when integrated into a preschool education curriculum, can foster an environment more conducive to typical childhood patterns of cortisol secretion.

237	Impact of an early childhood intervention on the home environment, and subsequent effects on child cognitive and emotional development : a secondary analysis	The objective of this study was to use secondary data from the Preparing for Life (PFL) trial to test (1) the impact of a prenatal-to-age-five intervention targeting women from a disadvantaged Irish community on the quality of the home environment; (2) whether any identified changes in the home environment explain the positive effects of the PFL program on children’s cognitive and emotional development at school entry which have been identified in previous reports of the PFL trial (ES = .72 and .50, respectively). Pregnant women were randomized into a treatment (home visits, baby massage, and parenting program, n = 115) or control (n = 118) group (trial registration: ISRCTN04631728). The home environment was assessed at 6 months, 1½, and 3 years using the Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment (responsiveness, acceptance, organization, learning material, involvement, variety). Cognitive skills were assessed at 5 years using the British Ability Scales. Emotional problems were teacher-reported at 5 years using the Short Early Development Inventory. Latent growth modeling was used to model changes in the home environment, and mediation analyses to test whether those changes explained children outcomes. Compared to controls, treatment children were exposed to more stimulating environments in terms of learning material (B = -1.62, p = 0.036) and environmental variety (B = -1.58, p = 0.009) at 6 months, but these differences faded at 3 years. Treatment families were also more likely to accept suboptimal child behaviors without using punishment (acceptance score, B = 1.49, p = 0.048) and were more organized at 3 years (B = 1.08, p = 0.033). None of the changes mediated children’s outcomes. In conclusion, we found that the program positively impacted different home environment dimensions, but these changes did not account for improvements in children’s outcomes. Exploratory analyses suggest that the impact of improvements in the home environment on child outcomes may be limited to specific groups of children. Limitations of the study include the potential lack of generalizability to other populations, the inability to assess the individual treatment components, and sample size restrictions which precluded a moderated mediation analysis.

238	Optimisation de la récupération fonctionnelle lors de l’hospitalisation aigüe suite à une lésion traumatique de la moelle épinière	Introduction and objectives: Traumatic Spinal cord injuries (TSCI) have devastating consequences. To minimise the deficits incurred, patients undertake a rehabilitation process consisting of four phases: acute care hospitalization, intensive functional rehabilitation, community reintegration and maintenance of gains. The acute care hospitalization represents an important part of the clinical pathway as many important decisions about the subsequent rehabilitation plan are taken. It also represents a unique period to minimize medical complications and optimize functional recovery early in the rehabilitation process. Thus, the clinical evolution during the acute care shouldn’t be neglected as it has been shown to influence medium to long term outcome. In particular, pressure injuries (PI) prevention is essential as the acute hospitalization represents the period with the highest PI risk and its occurrence adversely affects long-term functional recovery.Yet, the impact of multiple factors on the occurrence of PI during acute care specifically as well as the goals that must be prioritized by the acute rehabilitation team to optimize the functional outcome at discharge from acute care remain imprecise. Thus, the main objective of this work is to identify how the acute rehabilitation team may optimize functional recovery during acute care and decrease the occurrence of PI following a TSCI.  Methods and results: A prospective cohort study of sixty-one patients and the review of a prospective database of 301 patients with acute TSCI admitted to a SCI-specialized level-1 trauma center were completed. The mean total spinal cord independence measure (SCIM) score at discharge was 42.1 ±25.2 after a mean acute care length of stay (LOS) of 22.7 ±14.4 days. Hierarchical multivariate linear regression analyses showed that when controlled for the severity of the TSCI, longer LOS was significantly associated with poorer functional outcome at discharge from acute care. Hierarchical multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that when controlling for the level and severity of the TSCI, the occurrence of pneumonia (OR=2.1, CI= 1.1-4.1) was significantly associated with the occurrence of PI. Greater admission delay to our SCI-specialised level-1 trauma center, the occurrence of medical complications (PI, pneumonia and urinary tract infection) and lesser total daily therapy (physiotherapy and occupational therapy) resulted in significantly longer acute care LOS when controlled for possible non-modifiable cofounding factors.  Conclusions: In order to optimize functional outcome at discharge from acute care, the rehabilitation team must address factors that influence acute care LOS, particularly early transfer to SCI-specialized trauma centers, medical complications prevention (PI, pneumonia, urinary tract infection) and the optimization of therapy time, in order to decrease acute care length of stay and thus optimize the patient’s clinical evolution. As patients with higher and more severe TSCI, as well as those developing a pneumonia during acute care are at higher risk of developing PI, we believe they should be prioritized to receive a larger volume of therapy and more aggressive prevention protocols. Finally, functional gains during the acute care hospitalisation may be underestimated by the SCIM, which do not measure interventions during acute rehabilitation that are aimed towards ensuring strong foundations (e.g. trunk balance) to undertake efficient IFR.	spinal cord injury , traumatic , acute care , functional outcome , pressure injury , spinal cord	en	23663.0
239	Relations entre les fonctions cognitives, les paramètres d’effort et les facteurs de risque cardiovasculaire chez des sujets obèses comparés à des sujets sains	The relationship between cognitive function (CF), peak exercise parameters and cardiovascular risk factors has been poorly studied in obese subjects (OB). The goals of this study were: 1) to compare CF in higher-fitness and lower-fitness OB (HF-OB and LF-OB) vs. age-matched healthy controls (AMHC) according to their aerobic fitness level (V ̇O2peak) and 2) to find independent predictors of CF within the measured cardiovascular risk factors and peak exercise parameters. Forty nine OB and 14 AMHC were recruited. Maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test (with gas exchange analysis and impedance cardiography) was performed during an incremental ergocycle test. As well, CF was measured with a neuropsychological test battery. Obese subjects were divided into 2 groups according to the median V ̇O2peak divided by lean body mass (V ̇O2peak/LBM): the obese lower-fitness (LF-OB, n=22) and the obese higher-fitness (HF-OB, n=27). Cognitive flexibility, processing speed and short-term memory were not statistically different in HF-OB vs. AMHC and those two groups showed better performances in these domains when compared to the LF-OB group. The AMHC group performed better in tests measuring inhibition compared to the LF-OB and HF-OB groups. In summary, higher aerobic fitness in obese subjects was associated with preserved CF in every evaluated domains except for inhibition.	cognition , aerobic fitness , cardiovascular risk factors , humans , middle-aged	en	23645.0
240	The judicious judicial dispositions juggle: characteristics of police interventions involving people with a mental illness	Objective: The number of police interventions with people presenting a mental health problem has been increasing over the past 30 years and police services are becoming more aware of the human resources and skills these interventions require. Our study addresses the characteristics explaining police time used and outcomes of interventions as police officers interact with people with mental illness. Method: Using a police service administrative database from a large Canadian city, and an identification algorithm method, police interventions with people with mental illness were identified on 3 randomly selected days in the year. A content analysis of intervention logs was carried out to identify characteristics of those interventions; the call initiator, the location, and the final outcome of the intervention. Results: Interventions with people with mental illness represent a small proportion (3%; n = 272) of all police interventions (n = 8485). General linear models show that the type of outcome is the most important factor in estimating the time required by police interventions. Arrests and hospitalizations are the least time-efficient outcomes, consuming 2.0 and 3.2 times, respectively, more time than informal dispositions. A multiple correspondence analysis shows that police interventions can be depicted in 2 dimensions, representing their main roles concerning people with mental illness, namely, to ensure the public safety and to protect the most vulnerable citizens. The more these services are required, the more police time will be required.

241	Le rôle de l’expression de nétrine-1 par les cellules présentatrices d’antigènes dans la régulation immunitaire et la sclérose en plaques	Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by leukocytic infiltration and axonal demyelination. Antigen presenting cells (APCs) play a crucial role in this process by activating myelin-reactive lymphocytes in the periphery. Activated lymphocytes subsequently cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and infiltrate the CNS. These lymphocytes are reactivated in the perivascular space by APCs, following which they contribute to demyelination and axonal damage. Netrin-1 (N1) is an axonal guidance protein with considerable anti-inflammatory properties. The relevance of N1 in maintaining BBB function has been thoroughly established, but its involvement in antigen presentation and T cell activation has yet to be studied. This project investigates the hypothesis that N1 is produced by APCs to regulate neuroinflammation and aims to characterize N1 production by APCs, delineate the impact of N1 on T cell activation and clarify the role of APC-derived N1 in neuroinflammation. The results presented in this thesis demonstrate that N1 is produced by mature dendritic cells and M1 macrophages. Furthermore, N1 is shown to increase T cell proliferation, decrease TH17 cell cytokine production and decrease CD8+ T cell perforin expression. N1 does not alter T cell expression of adhesion molecules. Finally, N1 is not expressed by the CNS dendritic cells, macrophages or microglial cells of mice undergoing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, an animal model for MS. In summary, these results suggest that N1 is produced by APCs to modulate T cell function.

242	Social identities and isotopic analyses of the burials from the archaeological site of Ucanal, Petén, Guatemala	With the advances in isotopic analyses over the last two decades, scholars working in the Maya area have come to realize that Pre-Columbian people were much more mobile than previously considered, even though many were sedentary agriculturalists with large urban centers. Isotopic analysis of strontium and oxygen of human teeth enables us to identify the presence of migrants since they reflect geochemical and climatic variability of where a person lived as a child. Twelve burials from the archaeological site of Ucanal, in the Petén region of Guatemala, were analyzed for strontium and oxygen isotopes. In addition, a strontium baseline study of faunal remains was undertaken to identify typical values for the Ucanal region. Out of the twelve burials, three individuals were identified as likely foreign-born. Interestingly, they underscore two different ways in which foreigners were implicated in their newly founded homelands. Together with analyses of the human remains and burial contexts, the isotopic results highlight potentially hostile treatment in the form of human sacrifice or potentially reverential treatments in the form of a cult of the ancestors in which foreign peoples were remembered as important founding ancestors.

243	Les Matsuri : l’identité japonaise en festival	The role of Shinto has changed through the last thirty years in Japan. Since the end of World War II and the adoption of the new Constitution, Shinto has been limited to private and religious space. The Aum crisis changed the perception of religion in Japanese society, and Shinto priesthood had to adapt. More present in public space, Shinto leaders want to present Shinto beliefs as central to Japanese traditions and culture. The conception of religion in Japan is different than the one in Western countries. The word religion, shūkyō (宗教), has an interesting history affecting the way Japanese perceive all religions and Shinto in particular. In this context, it is important to analyse the connection between Shinto practices and identity. The main objective of this research is to analyze the links between Shinto and identity at two levels, local and national, with a focus on youth. To do so, this paper will focus on one type of Shinto activities: matsuri. From an anthropological point of view, the interest about these developments comes from their popularity, their intergenerational dynamics, and the place they occupy in the public domain.  The data were gathered during ethnographic research that spanned for three months in the Sapporo area. Multiple festivals were observed during this period. The focus of the observation was on social space, behavior, gender and intergenerational relations, clothing, activities, and rituals. Those elements help us understand the place of matsuri in contemporary Japanese culture, and ultimately, give information about the conception of Shinto. Shrine festivals also provide information about Japanese identity. Both local and national identity elements can be observed and analysed though these events. This paper points out those elements and puts them in relation to the actual religious context.	Religion , Shinto , Matsuri , Secularism , Identity , Japan , Nationalism	en	23610.0
244	The impact of Housing First on criminal justice outcomes among homeless people with mental illness : a  systematic review.	Objective: Housing First is increasingly put forward as an important component of a pragmatic plan to end homelessness. The literature evaluating the impact of Housing First on criminal justice involvement has not yet been systematically examined. The objective of this systematic review is to examine the impact of Housing First on criminal justice outcomes among homeless people with mental illness.  Method: Five electronic databases (PsycINFO, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science) were searched up until July 2018 for randomised and nonrandomised studies of Housing First among homeless people with a serious mental disorder.  Results: Five studies were included for a total of 7128 participants. Two studies from a randomised controlled trial found no effect of Housing First on arrests compared to treatment as usual. Other studies compared Housing First to other programs or compared configurations of HF and found reductions in criminal justice involvement among Housing First participants.  Conclusions: This systematic review suggests that Housing First, on average, has little impact on criminal justice involvement. Community services such as Housing First are potentially an important setting to put in place strategies to reduce criminal justice involvement. However, forensic mental health approaches such as risk assessment and management strategies and interventions may need to be integrated into existing services to better address potential underlying individual criminogenic risk factors. Further outcome assessment studies would be necessary.	Homeless persons , Housing , Mentally ill persons , Criminal behaviour , Justice involvement	en	23601.0
245	Parcours exploratoire et virtualités : une théorie des mondes possibles vidéoludiques	This master’s thesis mobilizes the possible worlds theoretical framework in order to develop the core notions of a videoludic possible worlds theory which would account for the medium’s artifactuality, interactivity and ludicity. The first chapter offers an overview of possible worlds theory both in the philosophical and literary traditions, thus defining the notions of alternative (or historical) worlds and fictional worlds. The second chapter is centered around the notion of videogame worlds: we will both define videoludic worlds and examine the mechanisms through which the player can interact with it. The third chapter is dedicated to these ontological states in which the main components of the videogame worlds exist, as well as on their impact on the relationship between the player and the system. We end this third chapter by defining the notion of a player’s “exploratory journey”, that is, all of the necessary, possible and virtual elements as they have manifested themselves throughout her gaming experience. The player’s exploratory journey, thus, represents a state of the videoludic world as it was actualized by a specific player.	possible worlds , video games , virtuality , philosophy of video games , agency , experience , game studies	en	23600.0
246	Les violoneux du Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean : style et répertoire des derniers de leur lignée	The Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean region is an enclave, and this fact contributed, through the years, to the isolation of the populations established there. This isolation is a factor that would have contributed to the presence of cultural distinctiveness amongst the inhabitants of the region. This cultural specificity has been observed in many fields of research, such as genetics, linguistics, culinary traditions, history and music. This thesis documents the musical element of culture in the region of Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean, through the analysis of style and repertoire of four fiddle players from the region. The classification of repertoire and the identification of different playing techniques, highlight both common and individual elements featured in the music of these four fiddlers. The research also contains a historical overview of the people who lived in or crossed the region, from the period of fur trading to industrialisation, and how they could have influenced the music in this region. Additionally, this research contains a census of over 100 fiddle players who have inhabited or passed through the region since colonisation, as well as a lexic explaining over 70 terms and expressions used by the fiddle players of Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean.

247	Le répertoire baroque interprété par les grands flûtistes de 1960 à aujourd’hui : une étude sur l’authenticité et son évolution à travers le temps	In this master’s thesis, we studied how the historically informed performance (HIP) movement has impacted the way flutists have approached Baroque repertoire since 1960. We analyzed recordings from five flute players with Sonic Visualiser. We used this software to generate graphical data to objectively support our observations on tempo, articulation, dynamics, and vibrato. By comparing recordings made on baroque and modern instruments, we found that in the past 20 years, flutists who are performing this repertoire on the modern flute started integrating performance practice from the baroque players in their own performance of early music. To contextualize the performance practices, we synthesized a few baroque sources to verify the extent to which flutists have respected these indications. Through the process of this research, we observed that the HIP movement has changed the definition of an authentic performance of early music and that it has modified the way modern flutists perform Baroque music.	baroque , Articulation , Vibrato , Tempo , Performance practice , flute , Baroque , performance style , Authenticity , performance studies	en	23592.0
248	Neonatal intraventricular hemorrhage and hospitalization in childhood	Background: Neonatal intraventricular hemorrhage is associated with neurodevelopmental sequelae, but the long-term risk of other outcomes is unknown. The association between neonatal intraventricular hemorrhage and the risk of childhood morbidity was assessed. Methods: A longitudinal cohort of 794,384 infants born between 2006 and 2016 in Quebec, Canada was analyzed. Infants were tracked over time to identify later hospitalizations with follow-up extending up to 12 years after birth. In Cox regression models adjusted for maternal and infant characteristics, the hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated for the association of intraventricular hemorrhage with future hospitalization. Results: A total of 1,322 (0.2%) infants developed grade I to IV intraventricular hemorrhage. The incidence of childhood hospitalization was higher in infants with intraventricular hemorrhage than in infants without hemorrhage (23.8 vs. 5.7 per 100 person-years). Compared with no hemorrhage, infants with intraventricular hemorrhage had 1.56 times the risk of hospitalization (95% CI 1.43-1.70). The risk was 2.81 times higher for grade III/IV hemorrhage (95% CI 2.23-3.53) compared to those born without hemorrhage. Preterm intraventricular hemorrhage was associated with 1.82 times the risk (95% CI 1.66-2.00) compared to term infants born without hemorrhage. Intraventricular hemorrhage at term was associated with 3.19 times the risk of hospitalization (95% CI 2.55-4.00) compared to those born term without hemorrhaging. Primary reasons for hospitalizations included central nervous system, ophthalmologic, musculoskeletal, and cardiovascular disorders. Conclusion: Intraventricular hemorrhage, especially of higher grades and in term neonates, is an important determinant of the future risk of child hospitalization.

249	Le suivi de l'apprentissage en famille de type unschooling : le point de vue de parents unschoolers et le droit de l'enfant à l'éducation	"Unschooling is an uncommon but continually evolving educational option in Canada and around the world. Given the development of this movement in education, issues concerning the monitoring of learning by unschooled children are gaining importance. The scarcity of published studies specifically related to the monitoring of informal learning and the risks associated with a lack of follow-up, particularly among the most vulnerable children, lead us to ask this general research question: What follow-up of family-based learning would be desirable in a context of unschooling, respecting the point of view of unschoolers parents and the right of the child to an education? To answer this question, 25 unschooled parents were divided into four groups and reflected on the type of follow-up they consider best suited to their educational reality. By choosing a qualitative methodological approach and using a thematic analysis, the data drawn from these exchanges enabled us to build a follow-up proposal consisting of three approaches: ""no interaction"", ""support offered"" and ""appreciation of the educational experience "". This follow-up proposal was then analyzed using a conceptual framework of the child's right to education composed of five conditions of respect for the child's right to education, inspired by the United Nations (1999a, 1999b). This analysis assessed the potential of each of the three approaches to protecting the right to an education for all children in an unschooling educational setting. The third approach, ""appreciation of the educational experience"", appears to be an approach that is both acceptable from the point of view of unschooling parents and from the point of view of the child's right to education."

250	L’impact du type d’assurance médicaments (privée/publique) sur le coût des médicaments et les dépenses des Québécois	In the province of Quebec, it’s mandatory to have a drug insurance either private or public. Also, drug cost in Quebec has three components: ingredient list price, wholesaler markup and dispensing fee. The first two components are regulated by the Prescription drug plan (PDP) and are the same for publicly and privately insured patients. The third component is fixed (between CAD$8.50 and CAD$9.49) and regulated by the PDP for publicly insured patients while it is determined freely by the pharmacy owner for privately insured patients. The objectives of this thesis were to estimate the average difference for both drug and out-of-pocket costs between patients covered by private drug plans and the PDP in Quebec. We used a sample of prescriptions filled between January 1st, 2015 and May 23rd , 2019 selected from reMed, a drug claims database of Quebecers. We created strata of prescriptions filled by privately insured patients based on the DIN, quantity dispensed, number of days of supply, pharmacy identifier and a date corresponding to a publication of RAMQ’s List of Medications. Then, we matched each stratum filled by privately insured patients with a stratum of prescriptions filled by publicly insured patients based on the same stratification criteria. The differences in drug cost and out-of-pocket expenses between private and public drug insurance were analyzed with linear regression models. Based on 38 896 strata of prescriptions (162 019 prescriptions in total), we observed that privately insured patients had to pay CAD$9.35 (95% CI: 5.58 ; 13.01) more on average per drug prescription than publicly insured patients (CAD$62.34 vs CAD$52.99), representing a difference of 17.6%. We also found that out-of-pocket expenses were on average CAD$1.01 (95% CI: -1.22 ; -0.80) lower per drug prescription for privately than publicly insured patients (CAD$6.94 vs CAD$7.95). This study showed that, on average, drug cost is substantially higher and out-of-pocket slightly lower for privately insured Quebecers. Knowing that adherence is affected by drug cost, these results will be useful to help public health authorities to make informed decisions about drug insurance policies.	drug insurance , drug plan , drug cost , out-of-pocket , drug cost difference , out-of-pocket difference , private drug insurance , public drug plan	en	23567.0
251	Impacts des cannabinoïdes sur la vision: étude anatomique et fonctionnelle	The endocannabinoid (eCB) system is a great therapeutic target for the treatment of many diseases, ranging from immune system modulation to pain management. This system is implicated in developmental processes as indicated by neurofunctional afflictions following developmental exposition to cannabinoids. Since eCBs are lipophilic, they are not stored in vesicles but rather synthesized and degraded on demand by specific enzymes. Thus, the expression pattern of these enzymes could help to better understand the expression of eCBs, and their role during central nervous system maturation. The CB1 receptor is strongly distributed in the nervous system, while the CB2 receptor is traditionally associated with the immune system. The recent finding of the CB2 receptor expression and function in some neurons, especially in the retina, changes the dogma associated with cannabinoids. A study from our laboratory found that deletion of the CB2 receptor in transgenic mice (cnr2-/-) enhances the a-wave amplitude in electroretinography, this wave reflecting photoreceptor activity. This report highlighted the importance of the CB2 receptor in vision, at least in the retina. Until now, no study aimed at the impact of cannabinoids on visual acuity. We characterized the retinal distribution of diacylglycerol lipase alpha (DAGLα) and monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) enzymes, responsible for the synthesis and degradation of the eCB ligand 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG) during postnatal development. The enzyme DAGLα is expressed since birth and is greatly distributed across the retina such as in photoreceptors, horizontal, amacrine and ganglion cells. The enzyme MAGL is expressed later during development and is present only in amacrine and Müller cells. Our functional results show that the visual acuity of cnr2-/- mice is enhanced in adults and during postnatal development. The repeated administration of a CB2 receptor antagonist yielded a better visual acuity, and inversely a CB2 receptor agonist decreased the visual acuity. Furthermore, the administration of a MAGL inhibitor, the enzyme in charge of 2-AG degradation, induced a strong decrease in visual acuity, similar to that obtained with a CB2 receptor agonist. Inversely, a DAGL inhibitor, the enzyme responsible for 2-AG synthesis, caused an increase in visual acuity. These results suggest that 2-AG is strongly expressed early during retinal development and could be implicated in structural and functional maturation of the retina. Furthermore, we demonstrated that cannabinoids do not only affect retinal function, but also visual acuity. These results confirm that cannabinoids modulate their visual effects exclusively via the CB2 receptor. Finally, in recent years, many countries legalized cannabis for recreational and therapeutic use. The findings from this thesis increase the understanding of cannabinoids since they highlight the great impact of cannabinoids on the visual acuity.

252	Effets d’un programme de réadaptation fondé sur les exercices neurodynamiques ciblant l’excursion du nerf médian offert à des individus atteints du syndrome du tunnel carpien	Neuromobilizations exercises are frequently advocated by physiotherapists to improve pain and function in individuals with Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS). However, the effectiveness of these exercises remains uncertain since they remain in most part based on theoretical and empirical foundations. In fact, few studies have reported the effects of neurodynamic exercises on the biological integrity and biomechanical properties of the median nerve at the wrist (peripheral adaptations) and on the structure and function of cortical motor areas (central adaptations). The main objectives of this thesis were 1) to evaluate the psychometric properties of median nerve longitudinal excursion measurements using quantitative ultrasound imaging, 2) to characterize the peripheral and central adaptations potentially linked to the performance of neuromobilization exercises and 3) to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of a neuromobilization exercise program completed by individuals with CTS. To meet these objectives, four separate projects were conducted. Project # 1: Test- retest reliability and minimal detectable change in median longitudinal nerve excursion measurements were evaluated in a group of 11 asymptomatic individuals and seven individuals with CTS. Project # 2: The concurrent validity between longitudinal excursion measurements of an artificial median nerve model obtained with quantitative ultrasound imaging and a three- dimensional motion analysis system was evaluated. Project # 3: An exploratory clinical study was conducted to evaluate the potential peripheral and central adaptations following completion of a neuromobilization exercise program in a cohort of 14 individuals with CTS. Project # 4: A pilot randomized clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the feasibility of a preoperative neuromobilization exercise program performed by 15 individuals with CTS awaiting decompression surgery and to evaluate the efficacy of this program for these same individuals to improve the biological integrity, biomechanical properties of the median nerve; reduce pain, sensorimotor deficiencies and optimize upper limb functional capacity compared to a control group of 15 individuals with CTS that does not perform any exercise program before and after carpal surgery (standard care). In summary, the results of projects # 1 and 2 demonstrate that ultrasound imaging is a reliable and valid tool for measuring the biological integrity and longitudinal excursion of the iii median nerve. The results of project # 3 suggest that the clinical changes observed following neuromobilization exercises potentiate central adaptations while they have no or little effect on peripheral adaptations, including nerve excursion. The results of project # 4 demonstrate that, although the proposed neuromobilization exercise program is feasible and relatively safe when completed by individuals awaiting decompression surgery, they do not demonstrate the superiority of the proposed program in improving sensorimotor impairments, pain and upper extremity functional abilities in individuals with CTS immediately before or one month after carpal tunnel decompression surgery compared with standard care. However, pain subscales and biological integrity outcomes demonstrated moderate to large effect sizes or trends towards the statistically significance, thus supporting the need for further research.

253	Rôle fonctionnel des canaux potassiques activés par le calcium au sein de progéniteurs cardiaques : implication en médecine régénérative	Heart failure (HF) is a progressive disease characterized by extensive pathological remodelling of the heart and myocardial damage. Regardless of the etiology, a decrease of about 30% in the number of ventricular cardiomyocytes is observed at the terminal stage of HF. Based on converging preclinical data in HF models, the innovative concept of cell therapy has generated a great deal of enthusiasm in cardiology. Although the role of cardiac stem cells in cardiac homeostasis is highly controversial, the multipotent progenitors that persist within the adult myocardium possess the ideal characteristics for cardiac regeneration, especially because of their cardiogenic committment. Plasma membrane ion channels are involved in the fundamental processes of virtually all cells that make up the human body, including stem cells. A wide range of functional ion channels was identified in ex vivo proliferated endogenous cardiac progenitor cells (eCPCs), but their function remains poorly understood. We have completed the very first characterization of the ionic profile of freshly-isolated c-Kit+ eCPCs. We found that the intermediate conductance Ca2+-activated potassium current (IKCa3.1) is the predominant conductance and contributes to the determination of membrane potential (Vmem). The hyperpolarization generated by the activation of the KCa3.1 channel (SK4; KCNN4) maintains the electrical gradient and promotes store-operated Ca2+-entry (SOCE) that activates progenitor cell proliferation. Experimental congestive heart failure (CHF) significantly decreased the expression of KCa3.1 as well as cell cycle regulatory proteins. Taken together, these findings suggest that alterations in KCa3.1 may have pathophysiological and therapeutic significance in regenerative medicine  In addition to c-Kit+ eCPCs, cardiac explants-derived cells (EDCs) represent another promising cell product for myocardial repair. EDCs are obtained as a heterogeneous mixture composed of complementary subpopulations. Interestingly, it was found that a high proportion of CD90+ cells reduce the functional benefits of EDCs therapy. Consistent with this observation, it has recently been shown that the CD90- population constitutes the active fraction in terms of therapeutic efficacy. In order to gain insight into the ionic determinants of EDCs function, the electrophysiological properties of the CD90+ and CD90- populations were studied. Considering the importance of KCa3.1 in c-Kit+ CPCs, we evaluated the presence of KCa channels in human EDCs. We have identified 2 types of KCa channels in ex vivo expanded EDCs. While KCa1.1 (BKCa; KCNMA1) channel was homogeneously expressed in both subpopulations, KCa3.1 was found exclusively in the CD90- cell fraction. Similar to our previous observations in freshly isolated c-Kit+ eCPCs, KCa3.1 was responsible for the determination of Vmem under resting conditions and during SOCE. Importantly, we demonstrated that transplantation of genetically-modified EDCs to over-express KCNN4 potentiates cardiac regeneration in a murine model of ischemic cardiomyopathy. This study provides the first evidence in the literature that modulating the activity of a single plasma membrane ion channel can truly improves the therapeutic efficacy of progenitor cells.

254	Les interactions entre l’interleukine-15, l’haplotype HLA-DQ8 et le gluten conduisent au développement de la maladie cœliaque chez la souris	Coeliac disease is a chronic inflammatory enteropathy characterized by autoimmune features. This disease occurs in genetically predisposed individuals expressing HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 haplotypes and is triggered following gluten consumption. The disease is characterized by the development of intestinal villous atrophy leading to malabsorption. The only current therapy is the adherence to a gluten-free diet, but the diet is not always effective and is heavy in concessions. Therefore, the development of alternative therapies is urgent but is a slowly evolving pipeline, mainly due to the absence of a physiologically relevant animal model. The aim of this thesis is to answer this unmet need by developing an animal model capable of recapitulating the main characteristics of the disease. Chapter 1 depicts a portrait of the disease in four points, gradually leading the reader into the details of its pathogenesis. This introduction begins with a review of the physiology and intestinal immunity and then draws a clinical portrait of the disease. Third, the reader evolves in a more detailed part of the pathogenesis helping him to discern its cellular and molecular actors. Finally, the introduction ends with a review of the literature on current animal models. Chapter 2 outlines the thesis objectives based on key data from the literature, in particular, patients present at least one copy of the HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 haplotype and more than two-thirds over-express the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-15 at the level of their intestinal mucosa. It is therefore reasonable to hypothesize that gluten, HLA haplotype and interleukin-15 together contribute to the pathogenesis. Although suspected, their roles and interactions still require the provision of tangible evidence in vivo. Chapter 3 details these interactions based on the proposed new mouse model. This model is characterized by the overexpression of interleukin-15 in the intestinal epithelium and lamina propria and by the expression of the HLA-DQ8 haplotype. This work demonstrates that the exposure of this mouse to gluten is accompanied by villous atrophy and the complete serological, cellular and transcriptional signature of the disease. We also demonstrate that simultaneous overexpression of interleukin-15 in both mucosal compartments is a prerequisite for the development of atrophy. This study also highlights the need for CD4+ T cells and interferon-gamma in the activation of intraepithelial lymphocytes and the development of villous atrophy. Finally, this research establishes the central role played by the HLA-DQ8 haplotype and the enzyme tissue transglutaminase II in the occurrence of these lesions. In general, the results from this model presented in Chapter 3 reflects the complexity of the interactions between gluten, genetics and IL-15 in the development of coeliac disease. Finally, chapter 4 concludes this work and chapter 5 discusses future directions for this powerful preclinical model that will undoubtedly contribute to a better understanding of coeliac disease and will allow the identification of new potential therapeutic targets.	gluten , HLA-DQ8 , transglutaminase-2 , autoimmunity , coeliac disease , mouse model , gluten , HLA-DQ8 , transglutaminase-2 , interleukin-15 , cytotoxic CD8+ T cells , CD4+ T cells	en	23533.0
255	Identification et caractérisation moléculaire et fonctionnelle des cellules tissulaires de l’immunité innée chez les patients atteints de maladies inflammatoires intestinales	Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), two common forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), represent a major public health problem because of their prevalence, chronicity and lack of available curative treatment. The pathophysiology of these diseases involves predisposing genetic factors, environmental triggers, and a dysfunctional immune response. Innate immune cells, including mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs) and granulocytes, are important players in the initiation and maintenance of intestinal inflammation due to their position at the interface between the external environment, epithelium and adaptive immune cells. Although widely studied in mice, their investigation in humans remains fragmentary, often with contradictory findings reported in the colon, and they are rarely studied in the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs). MNPs from the colon and MLNs of patients with CD and UC were characterized by multi-color flow cytometry, mass cytometry (CyTOF) and RNA sequencing (bulk and single cell). The function of MNPs and basophils on autologous memory CD4+ T cell responses was also assessed.  The results presented here highlight similarities and differences in the distribution of MNPs between CD and UC, and the profile of memory CD4+ T cell response in colon and MLNs. HLADR+SIRPα+CD14+CD64+CD163- MNPs, defined as inflammatory monocytes, but not HLADR+SIRPα+CD14+CD64+CD163+ macrophages, accumulated in the inflammatory mucosa of CD and UC patients, and promoted Th17 and Th17/Th1 memory responses in an IL-1β dependent manner. The frequency of this subpopulation correlated with endoscopic severity in CD. In contrast, the distribution of these two MNP populations in the MLNs differs between CD and UC. HLADR+SIRPα+CD14+CD64+ MNPs were enriched in CD163+ cells that predominantly included HLA-DRdim monocytes-like cells over HLA-DRhi macrophages in UC patients only. Among HLADR+SIRPα+CD14-CD64- dendritic cells (DCs), plasmocytoid DCs predominated in both UC and CD, with higher frequency in CD versus UC. IL-1β in CD and IL-12 in UC favor a pathogenic CD4+ T cell profile (IFN-γ, TNF-α, GM-CSF, IL-6 expression/production) in the colonic mucosa. It was also demonstrated that IL-12 and inflammatory tissue monocytes induced IL-8 production by memory CD4+ T cells in intestinal mucosa and MLNs of UC but not CD. In this study, it was also observed that basophils and not mast cells accumulated, in the colonic mucosa and MLNs of CD and UC patients, and favored Th17 and Th17/Th1, but not Th1, responses in CCR7+ memory CD4+ T cells. In conclusion, characterization of MNPs in the intestinal mucosa and MLNs of IBD patients contributes to a better understanding of IBD pathophysiology and opens avenues to optimize patient stratification, and thus, personalized treatment of IBD patients.

256	Assessment and modulation of the lymphatic function throughout the onset and progression of atherosclerosis	Atherosclerosis is the principal cause of coronary artery disease (CAD), affecting large- and medium-sized arteries. It is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by intimal plaques composed of inflammatory cells, smooth muscle cells, fibrous components and lipids. Cholesterol that accumulates within macrophages in peripheral tissues, like the arterial wall, whether from dietary or synthetic sources, promotes inflammatory responses and needs to be excreted with the help of the cholesterol acceptor high density lipoprotein (HDL). This specific process is termed macrophage reverse cholesterol transport (mRCT) and studies have demonstrated that lipid free apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) could be a key player in mRCT regulation, exuding different effects than HDL. More importantly, recently, the lymphatic system has been identified as a novel prerequisite player in the removal of cholesterol out of the atherosclerotic lesion (Martel et al., JCI 2013). It has been demonstrated that without functioning lymphatic vessels cholesterol mobilization from the plaque cannot be properly achieved and aggravates the disease.  The lymphatic network runs in parallel to the blood vasculature and is present in almost all the tissues of the body. It is a crucial player in maintaining fluid homeostasis, trafficking immune cells from the periphery to corresponding lymph nodes, as well as transporting lipids from the intestine to the circulation. The lymphatic system comprises the   initial and collecting lymphatic vessels (LVs), as well as lymph nodes, all with a specific anatomy and distinctive roles. Lymph, the clear fluid that circulates within LVs drains towards the bloodstream at the level of the subclavian vein. Platelets are responsible to regulate this blood/lymphatic vessel separation by forming a clog, upon the interaction of their C-type lectin-like receptor 2 (CLEC-2) with podoplanin, present on lymphatic endothelial cells. Platelet activity has also been shown to be required throughout life in order to maintain LV junction integrity.   Atherosclerosis is also characterized by increased cellular activation and apoptosis. Consequently, these cellular activities may result in the formation of submicron particles called extracellular vesicles (EVs) that have variable effects on the blood endothelium and subsequent plaque evolution. CAD has been associated with increased circulating EVs, and we suspect that these EVs might be involved in atherosclerosis-related lymphatic dysfunction.  Based on recent data collected during my master’s degree, there is evidence that enhancing lymphatic transport could limit atherosclerosis progression and favour plaque regression. We showed that lymphatic transport is impaired in young, atherosclerosis-prone mice, even before atherosclerosis onset. We believe it to be potentially associated with a defect in the lymphatic pumping capacity, and we suggest that enhancing VEGF-C/VEGFR-3 binding can abolish this specific defect. The global objective of this thesis was to pursue along this path and better delineate the role of the important lymphatic-specific growth factor, VEGF-C and the lipoprotein apoA-I, on collecting LVs function. Furthermore, a better understanding of lymph components, especially cellular releasants was deemed necessary. The first publication allowed us to show that when injected with VEGF-C 152s, before the administration of a pro-atherogenic regimen, Ldlr-/- mice were protected from excessive plaque formation and long-term, had a more stable plaque. The sustained contraction capacity of the collecting lymphatic vessels and the enhanced expression of VEGFR-3 and FOXC2 observed in these VEGF-C-152s treated mice contributed to the clearance of harmful components contained in peripheral tissues such as the macrophages and cholesterol.  The second publication showed that atherosclerotic Ldlr-/- mice treated with low-dose lipid-free apoA-I had enhanced lymphatic transport and abrogated collecting LV permeability possibly through modulation of platelet activity.  The third publication is the first ever to demonstrate the presence of extracellular vesicles of heterogeneous origins in the lymph of mice, and that their levels differ in atherosclerosis. Collectively, these studies confirm that lymphatic dysfunction is present before the onset of atherosclerosis, and particularly of interest, that this dysfunction is primarily associated with a defect in the collecting vessels, thereby limiting the lymph transport from peripheral tissues to the blood. Different treatments with growth factors and lipoproteins have the potential to modulate the lesion onset and progression through the enhancement of lymphatic function, while our findings regarding the presence of EVs in lymph represents their potential as biomarkers, but also a new venue to better understand lymphatic dysfunction.

257	Les apoB-lipoprotéines en tant que modulateurs de la fonction du tissu adipeux et des facteurs de risque du diabète de type 2 chez l'humain	Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is chronic disease affecting 3 million Canadians and a new case is diagnosed every 3 minutes in Canada. Long before the onset of T2D, a progressive increase in insulin resistance (IR) and insulin secretion is observed in normoglycemic subjects. A decreased white adipose tissue (WAT) function is central to the development of T2D as it promotes an increased fatty acid flux to peripheral tissues, inducing IR, hyperinsulinemia and chronic inflammation. During my MSc, we reported that low density lipoproteins (LDL) reduce the differentiation and function of adipocytes and induce the dysfunction of human WAT. Moreover, we showed that elevated plasma apolipoprotein B (apoB), indicating high numbers of circulating apoB-lipoproteins mainly in the form of LDL, is associated to IR, elevated glucose-induced insulin secretion (GIIS), delayed postprandial plasma clarance of fat and reduced WAT function in 81 non-diabetic obese subjects. To explore whether apoB also identifies obese subjects who best respond to weight loss to reduce risk factors for T2D, we tested the effect of a 6 months hypocaloric diet. We showed in the 59 completers of the hypocaloric intervention that the decrease in GIIS and increase in WAT function were significant in subjects with high plasma apoB but not in subjects with low plasma apoB. However, the mechanism underlying the negative effects apoB-lipoproteins was yet unexplored. Chronic activation of the Nucleotide-binding domain and Leucine-rich repeat Receptor containing a Pyrin domain 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and secretion of interleukin-1b (IL-1b) promote WAT dysfunction and systemic IR. However, endogenous metabolic signals that induce the activation of WAT NLRP3 inflammasome are unknown. To test if the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome/ IL-1b system is an underlying mechanism linking apoB- lipoproteins to risk factors for T2D, we examined the association and direct effect of apoB- lipoproteins on the IL-1b system. We observed in our cohort of 81 non-diabetic obese subects that subjects with high plasma apoB have higher plasma IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), which is an marker of systemic activation of the Il-1b pathway. Furthermore, the associations between high plasma apoB and IR and GIIS were statistically dependent on plasma IL-1Ra. Additionnaly, in a separate population of 32 subjects, we demonstrated that subjects with high plasma apoB have higher ex vivo WAT IL-1b secretion. The relation between plasma apoB and delayed postprandial plasma fat clearance and elevated glucose-induced C-peptide secretion were statistically dependent on WAT IL-1b secretion. Finally, native LDLs directly induce IL- 1b secretion from ex vivo WAT, acting primarily as priming signals (i.e. the first signal leading to activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome/ IL-1b system). In conclusion, the findings from this thesis suggest that native LDL, the main form of apoB-lipoproteins, upregulate human WAT NLRP3 inflammasome. This may explain WAT dysfunction, hyperinsulinemia and higher incidence of T2D in subjects with high plasma apoB. Moreover, they suggest that high apoB may serve as biomarker to identify obese subjects who best respond to a hypocaloric-intervention to reduce the risk of T2D.

258	Études structurales et fonctionnelles sur les mécanismes de régulation des interactions entre protéines SUMOs et les domaines SIMs.	Post-translational modification with the « Small Ubiquitin-Like MOdifyer (SUMO) » is a major regulatory process (commonly referred to as SUMOylation) that regulates hundreds of proteins associated with a diverse array of biological activities including several nuclear functions such as DNA repair, replication and transcription. SUMOylation of a protein can impact its function in many ways most often by providing an additional binding surface for forming protein-protein interactions with regulatory factors through short hydrophobic regions on their binding partners known as « SUMO interacting motif (SIM) ». Although SUMO-SIM interactions are well documented, there are nevertheless outstanding questions that still need to be addressed regarding their controlling mechanisms. This thesis reports functional and structural studies on the regulatory mechanisms that govern SUMO-SIM interactions. More precisely, we studied how acetylation and the amino-terminal tail of SUMO proteins affects the interaction of SUMO with model SIMs from three proteins: the « promyelocytic leukemia (PML) » tumor suppressor, the transcriptional corepressor « Death Domain Associated Protein 6 (Daxx) » and the SUMO E3 ligase « Protein Inhibitor of Activated STAT (PIAS) ».  The first study reports the role that acetylation of SUMO1 plays on its binding to the SIMs of PML and Daxx. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) experiments demonstrated that acetylation of SUMO1 at conserved residues (K39 and K46) dramatically reduces the binding to the SIMs of PML and Daxx. In contrast, SUMO1 acetylation at K37 dramatically reduced binding to the SIM of Daxx but only had minimal impact on binding to the SIM of PML. Crystal structures of the SUMO1 acetylated variants bound to the two SIMs support the ITC titrations and suggest that there is plasticity in SUMO-SIM interactions. The plasticity observed in the structures of these complexes would provide a robust mechanism for regulating SUMO-SIM interactions using a combination of signalling mechanisms that control post-translational modifications. In the second study, we identified and characterized a novel SIM at the C-terminal extremity of three of the four known variants of the PIAS-family proteins (PIAS1-2-3). We demonstrated that this SIM binds to SUMO1 and structurally show that phosphorylation of the SIM or acetylation at select lysine residues of SUMO1 alters this interaction. In addition, we determined that it plays an important role in the formation of ternary complex made of SUMO1, PIAS1 and the « UBiquitin Conjugating enzyme E2I (UBC9) » in human cells. Together, these results provide an atomic description of the interaction between the C-terminal SIM of PIAS proteins and SUMO1 as well as important insight into how posttranslational modifications selectively regulate the specificity of the SIMs found in PIAS1-2-3. Finally, our third study explores the intrinsically disordered N-terminal tail of SUMO paralogs and their ability to regulate SUMO-SIM interactions. We demonstrate that the N-terminal region of SUMO1, but not SUMO2, has an auto-inhibitory effect on the binding to SIMs and that this effect is dependent on the presence of acidic or phosphorylated residues that within the SIM. In addition, we also determined that this inhibition does not affect the interaction of SUMO1 with its E2 conjugating enzyme UBC9. Using titration calorimetry and crystallographic screening, we identified zinc as a negative regulator of this auto-inhibitory effect. The crystallographic structure of the complex between SUMO1 and the SIM of PML shows that zinc stabilises the formation of interactions with the negatively charged residues within the SIM and the N-terminal tail of SUMO1. Interestingly, zinc also appears to stabilize the formation of an α-helix within the N-terminal tail of SUMO1 which is normally intrinsically disordered.   In summary, this thesis describes the underlying atomic regulatory mechanisms of SUMO-SIM interactions by acetylation, reveals a novel SIM within the PIAS SUMO E3 ligase family and describes an unprecedented role of the N-terminal region of SUMO1 and provides important insight on how this region can define SUMO paralog specificity.

259	Children’s right to “proper education” in contemporary Iran : a critical legal essay with an ethical and empirical approach towards improving Iranian governance	"The research takes place in the current daily life of the educational sphere in Iran. It should be noted that Iran is a non-Western and Islamic state, but nonetheless adhered to the rather Western principles of the International Convention on the Rights of the Child. This research is part of a continuity of research in support of human rights. It offers a path of empowerment to Iranian groups open to democracy, but also to educational movements concerned with the fundamental rights of the person. Divided into four chapters, the hybrid questioning of the thesis leads to a critical interdisciplinary essay benefiting the three disciplines of law, philosophy and empirical study. Facing the international and Iranian legal system from a classical legal view, the philosophical chapter tends to respond to the question of “what could be considered not just the right to education, but the right to a “proper” education based in ethical and philosophical grounds in the sense that it would better suit Iranian culture and social habits than an allegedly “universal” [occidental] classical legal conception?"". The empirical chapter, then, looks for the “Iranian social representations of the children’s rights that reveal the gap between the ideal expressed concept of “proper education” and day-to-day life of children?” with an advocative approach. From a philosophical view —more precisely from virtue ethics stand point—the thesis proposes the concept of ""right to proper education"" as a critical approach to the international and internal positions of the right to education for children. ""Proper education"" is presented as a moral and legal right for children under the category of developmental rights which serves the right to an open future and the right to maximizing self-fulfillment. It is also a conception of the right to education harmonized with the current Iranian Islamic context. From an empirical standpoint, starting from a typical inductive approach of the Human Rights Advocacy approach and based on more than eighty (80) interviews with children and teachers, the gaps between the official laws and the ways in which they are experienced, mobilized, thought of or denied in the sphere of today Iranian education, are observed and analyzed. Finally, the critical legal essay suggests the Iranian governance to be open to a shift toward a modern contractual authority in educational system to be more compatible with the psycho-emotional needs of children and at the same time to apply the virtue ethics political advice to move toward a liberal form of educational policies that promotes the virtues of autonomy and toleration. These are all crucial information for wise Iranian legislative governance rooted in an Islamic pursuit of virtues as well as the happiness of children."

260	Changements comportementaux et neuro-anatomiques suite à un entrainement aérobie chez les individus atteints de la maladie de Parkinson	Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in Canada and other industrialized countries. The pathology is characterized by motor symptoms such as resting tremor, muscle rigidity, difficulty in initiating voluntary gestures and slowness in the execution of movements (i.e. bradykinesia). Non-motor symptoms, such as cognitive impairment, sleep disorders and others are commonly encountered. To date, physical activity has been an interesting complement to existing pharmacological and neurosurgical treatments to relieve the symptoms of PD. However, despite the knowledge gained so far about the impact of physical exercise in patients with the disease, it is possible to note that many questions remain unanswered or unclear. This work is part of a larger research project that aims to fill some of theses gaps. More specifically, the main objective of this thesis is to evaluate the effects of an aerobic training in a population with PD on walking parameters, upper limb mobility and anatomical brain structures. A second objective is to observe the relationships existing between these three components, and with other parameters such as the improvement of aerobic capacities, the executive functions and the learning capacities of a new motor skill. 20 healthy adults and 19 persons with PD participated in a 3-month stationary recumbent bicycle training program, with 3 sessions per week during which the duration (20 to 40 minutes) and intensity (60 to 80%) were increased gradually. Several measures such as walking pattern, upper limb function, executive functions, learning of a new motor skill, aerobic capacities (VO2 peak), motor symptoms of PD and magnetic resonance imaging were acquired before and after the exercise program. The results showed that a 3-month training on stationary bike is beneficial for people with PD. Indeed, this type of exercise can increase the cadence and walking speed. It is also possible III to reduce the antagonist force, in addition to improve the propagation of this neuromuscular signal, generally improving the mobility of the upper limb. Finally, an aerobic exercise of 3 months can also increase the volume of certain brain structures, such as globus pallidus. This research project is among the first to demonstrate the effectiveness of a stationary bicycle aerobic exercise program to improve gait parameters and upper limb function in persons with PD. This study is also the first to investigate the effects of exercise on the brain structures of these patients and to try to understand the mechanisms that underlie improvements in motor and non-motor symptoms following a moderate to high intensity exercise program. We believe that the results obtained will help physical activity specialists to provide a more tailored and varied exercise prescription for people living with Parkinson’s disease.

261	Résilience et vieillissement cognitif : une approche de modération en neuro-imagerie structurelle et fonctionnelle	"Many changes to the brain occur in normal aging, both structurally and functionally. These changes most often result in a certain deterioration of cognitive functioning, and thus affect the quality of life of the elderly. It appears, however, that some people are relatively spared and manage to maintain a comparatively high level of cognitive functioning despite advancing in age. In the presence of an acceleration of population aging, there is a striking need to understand the factors and neurobiological mechanisms that may contribute to this better resilience to the effects of aging on the brain and on cognition. Although several models have attempted to account for this phenomenon, the understanding of the mechanisms that underpin it is still relatively incomplete. The main objective of this thesis was to expose the neurobiological correlates associated with a better resilience to the effects of normal aging on the brain and cognition, through structural (MRI) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). This thesis contains four articles. The intention of the first article (Chapter II) was to synthesize knowledge about the mechanisms involved in the resilience against the degenerative effects of normal aging on cognition. In this literature review, we were interested in the two main models attempting to account for this protective phenomenon: the brain reserve and cognitive reserve. Examining the empirical literature leads to the conclusion that better resilience might be based on both structural and functional brain differences, and therefore that the two proposed models could make an independent contribution to the resilience phenomenon. In addition, we hypothesize that the correlates of resilience are very similar to the brain differences associated with cognitive training. The following three articles are empirical articles which focus on working memory, a function that declines with age but shows significant inter-individual differences. The purpose of the second article (Chapter III) was to investigate the relationship between education, a well-established reserve proxy, and the regional volume of gray matter, as well as between education and brain activation during a working memory task in cognitively healthy elderly participants. Results indicate that higher years of education are associated with lower age-related loss of volume in the frontal and parietal areas, as well as greater age-related activation in some prefrontal regions that are part of the working memory network. The third study (Chapter IV) sought to examine whether functional education-related brain differences are compatible with neuronal efficiency and/or flexibility mechanisms. It further aimed to examine the ""protective"" effect of these functional differences on working memory performance. The results suggest that the two proposed mechanisms would be associated with a better preservation of working memory in the face of the effects of age, but that their respective involvement would depend on the level of the task requirement. Finally, the objective of the fourth study (Chapter V) was to first test the relationship between engagement in a stimulating lifestyle and white matter integrity maintaining. Then, the study aimed to examine whether greater white matter integrity decreased the impact of age on working memory. The results of the study suggest that a more stimulating lifestyle would be associated with a lesser age-related white matter lesions volume, and that this smaller white matter lesions volume would in turn be associated with better working memory performance."

262	Gestionnaire parfois destructif, parfois constructif, mythe ou réalité? : étude des amalgames de leadership destructif et constructif et de leurs relations avec l’épanouissement au travail et l’habilitation comportementale	The scientific literature generally focuses on forms of destructive and constructive leadership and their consequences in isolation. Little attention has been paid to the positioning of destructive behaviors in relation to constructive behaviors. However, the examination of their combinations is an important matter considering that a leader who is perceived as a source of stress and support could be more deleterious for his employees than a leader who is more clearly perceived as a source of stress. This phenomenon, called within-domain exacerbation, suggests that a leadership profile characterized by both destructive and constructive behaviors would be more deleterious for employees’ well-being and performance than one more clearly characterized by destructive behaviors. This phenomenon is theoretically explained by perception of the leader’s behaviors uncertainty. This thesis proposes through two articles to examine how leaders combine destructive and constructive behaviors and how these combinations are related with thriving at work and behavioral empowerment, respectively indicators of well-being and performance. It also proposes to verify if these combinations are related to perceptions of the leader’s behaviors uncertainty. The first article examines combinations of petty tyranny and transformational leadership perceived by 2104 employees of a police organization. Results show that leaders of this organization do combine these behaviors and that a profile characterized by slightly below average levels of petty tyranny and transformational leadership appears to be more deleterious for employees thriving and behavioral empowerment, compared to a more clearly destructive profile and a more constructive profile. The second article considers a broader set of behaviors representative of the destructive-constructive leadership spectrum. Combinations of leadership behaviors and their vii relations with thriving, behavioral empowerment, and the leader’s behaviors uncertainty were investigated through the perception of 305 employees of an organization working in the natural resource industry. Results also show leaders of this organization do combine destructive and constructive behaviors. Some leaders present a generally constructive profile, but characterized by higher levels of destructive behaviors, compared to others who present a more clearly constructive profile. A destructive leadership profile was also observed and is related to the lowest levels of thriving and behaviors empowerment, and the highest level of uncertainty, not supporting the presence of within-domain exacerbation. However, within-domain exacerbation is observed in the presence of specific dyadic combination of leadership behaviors. This thesis contributes to improve our understanding of the leadership profiles typically presented by leaders. It also contributes to the identification of the precise conditions under which within-domain exacerbation is elicited when leadership behaviors are considered. This phenomenon is only observed on thriving at work and behavioral empowerment when leaders present a specific dyadic combination of destructive and constructive behaviors which rely on the same influence mechanism. Moreover, only one of these specific combinations is related to perception of uncertainty, suggesting more than one mechanism could underpin within-domain exacerbation.

263	Does shyness interact with peer group affiliation in predicting substance use in adolescence?	Cigarette use and binge drinking are risky behaviors emerging during adolescence. Although many beneficial factors are well documented, studies linking shyness to substance use are somehow conflicting, which may be due to the contribution of moderators. Therefore, the present study has 2 objectives: (a) to prospectively analyze the association between shyness and substance use during adolescence, and (b) to test the moderating role of peer group affiliation on the relationship between shyness and substance use. Participants are 1447 adolescents from the Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child Development, a representative cohort of single-birth children born between 1997 and 1998 in the province of Quebec, Canada. Shyness was assessed at age 12 years. Peer group affiliation, as well as past year cigarette use and binge drinking were assessed at age 15 years. Logistic regressions were used to analyze the data. All analyses were carried out using weighted data accounting for the complex multistage sample design. Results show that shyness negatively predicts the use of tobacco and the occurrence of binge drinking while controlling for confounding variables. However, shyness does not interact with peer group affiliation in predicting substance use. This is the first study that confirms the presence of a negative relationship between shyness and substance use during adolescence over a 3-year period. Results suggest that shyness could exert a beneficial effect against substance use notwithstanding the adolescent’s social context.

264	The art of living together : on political engagement and the ethics of companionship	This dissertation proposes that popular movements or uprisings can unite ethics and politics in a direct, practical manner and constitute an illuminating domain from which to advance normative theory that responds to the challenges of injustice in our world today. Any study of these movements ought to engage with a specific event and its context and renounce the position of ‘observer.’ Accordingly, I have chosen to examine the revolutions sparked in the Arab world over the past decade, particularly focusing on the account of Tahrir Square. In order to appreciate the novelty these revolutions offer, it is necessary to first dismantle the deeply entrenched epistemic grounds of Western political theory which consider revolutions only on the basis of their end results, particularly whether or not they effect regime change. These popular movements not only defy democratization studies and its prescription for change from above, they also fundamentally challenge the domain of politics and some of its basic tenets. This confrontation occurs the moment the people gain their agency and use their political power demonstrably and concretely. The domain of politics is further challenged when the people create, as they did in Tahrir Square, a public sphere that is receptive to individual desires and interests as well as collective solidarity and responsibility.  The conditions under which these movements organize their collective political action – horizontally, non-hierarchically, and unmediated by representative and leaders – resist the threat of their power being instrumentalized to obtain middling results pertaining to state power. This form of organization also reconfigures the crowd’s ethical interactions, unmistakeably on display in Tahrir Square, producing what I call “ethics of companionship.” These ethics can be reformulated and practiced in manner attuned to both self and other, and adapted to the specific needs and injustices of the world around us. An ethics of companionship is responsive and open for negotiation and persuasion, and above all, it makes an art out of our living together.

265	Enjeux postcoloniaux et nationaux dans les polémiques entre ethnohistoriens du Pays d’en Haut (1985-2016)	This thesis is an exercise in historiography that deals with the ways French, Quebec and US researchers interested in the Pays d’en haut in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, have referred, over the past 35 years, to the theme of Native agency. To represent the Native peoples as agents, as they really are, for what they do and not as bit players of a Europeo-centric narrative, this seems to be the rule of the language game ethnohistorian play.  However, when we look at the production of the specialists of these Native societies, we rapidly come to the conclusion that the national question and, more broadly, the dynamics of identity inherent to the communities of researchers, still have a considerable impact on these narratives.  In order to understand these dynamics, it is useful to develop a historiographic perspective that is rooted in the sociology of science. I will refer more specifically to the works of Bruno Latour and Pierre Bourdieu on controversies among researchers. The idea is to see how researchers, by situating themselves in relation with their peers through alliance, avoidance or opposition, structure an ethnohistorical project. A project that is devoted to knowing better the Native other, but also a project that needs to pass the postcolonial test and hence refers to an area of postcolonial studies that is itself structured through contentions.   By seeing how, through the generations, an ethnohistorical model of good practices is constructed and restructured, how collectives of researchers are built, one learns about the world of Native people, but also about the world of the researchers.  It is in this perspective that I conduct the analysis of historiographic narratives produced by renowned practitioners of studies on the Pays d’en haut, ethnohistorians who, a few years after having published their main work on the subject, take stock of the situation in regards with Native agency. The historiographic propositions of Bruce Trigger, Richard White and Gilles Havard will allow us to cover the evolution of the field of ethnohistory since 1985.

266	Analysis of 3D human gait reconstructed with a depth camera and mirrors	The problem of assessing human gaits has received a great attention in the literature since gait analysis is one of key components in healthcare. Marker-based and multi-camera systems are widely employed to deal with this problem. However, such systems usually require specific equipments with high price and/or high computational cost. In order to reduce the cost of devices, we focus on a system of gait analysis which employs only one depth sensor. The principle of our work is similar to multi-camera systems, but the collection of cameras is replaced by one depth sensor and mirrors. Each mirror in our setup plays the role of a camera which captures the scene at a different viewpoint. Since we use only one camera, the step of synchronization can thus be avoided and the cost of devices is also reduced.  Our studies can be separated into two categories: 3D reconstruction and gait analysis. The result of the former category is used as the input of the latter one. Our system for 3D reconstruction is built with a depth camera and two mirrors. Two types of depth sensor, which are distinguished based on the scheme of depth estimation, have been employed in our works. With the structured light (SL) technique integrated into the Kinect 1, we perform the 3D reconstruction based on geometrical optics. In order to increase the level of details of the 3D reconstructed model, the Kinect 2 with time-of-flight (ToF) depth measurement is used for image acquisition instead of the previous generation. However, due to multiple reflections on the mirrors, depth distortion occurs in our setup. We thus propose a simple approach for reducing such distortion before applying geometrical optics to reconstruct a point cloud of the 3D object.  For the task of gait analysis, we propose various alternative approaches focusing on the problem of gait normality/symmetry measurement. They are expected to be useful for clinical treatments such as monitoring patient's recovery after surgery. These methods consist of model-free and model-based approaches that have different cons and pros. In this dissertation, we present 3 methods that directly process point clouds reconstructed from the previous work. The first one uses cross-correlation of left and right half-bodies to assess gait symmetry while the other ones employ deep auto-encoders to measure gait normality.

267	Mille après mille : mobilité, célébrité et mémoire des artistes populaires après «l'exode»	Art history and cultural history in Quebec present many examples of “retours d’Europe” and of “French triumphs,” from the formative overseas stays of the “exotiques” in the 1910s to the stage success of Quebec “chansonniers” in Paris in the 1950s and 1960s. However, between the early 1930s and the mid-1950s, some of the most famous French-speaking artists based in Montréal preferred to go on tour in the United States. Many of them traveled New England year after year, sometimes going as far as New York City, to cheer the French-speaking public present along the way in the industrial cities of the region. Yet this episode of high mobility is almost absent from history, memory and cultural heritage in Quebec—and even more so in the United States. Beyond the impact of the Great Depression on Montréal’s cultural scene and of the Second World War on the possibility of visiting Europe, these artists have turned their eyes towards America because they participated in a transnational space, both geographical and symbolic, inherited from an era of great intracontinental migrations, then reactivated and reconfigured by the advent of sound and audiovisual media—discs, radio and cinema. By studying the history of the celebrity of Mary “La Bolduc” Travers, Rudy Vallée and Jean Grimaldi, this thesis attempts to access to the various layers of this phenomenon at the crossroads of cultural history, media history and migration history. Their intricate narratives therefore reveal the modality of mobility involved inside—and often times outside—of the French Canadian “imagined community.” By analyzing the heritagization process of these artists, it is possible to isolate some of the causes the oblivion of this transnational episode of francophone culture in North America, such as the rejection of mobility in the formation of national and ethnic identity narratives; the historical marginalization of popular arts; and the mistrust of the United States among cultural and political elites around the world at the time.	migration , identification collective , mobility , tour , migration , media , celebrity , popular art , public memory , heritagization , collective identification , 20th century , Quebec , New England	en	23431.0
268	Impact of early environment on children's mental health : lessons from DNA methylation studies with monozygotic twins	Over the past decade, epigenetic analyses have made important contributions to our understanding of healthy development and a wide variety of adverse conditions such as cancer and psychopathology. There is increasing evidence that DNA methylation is a mechanism by which environmental factors influence gene transcription and, ultimately, phenotype. However, differentiating the effects of the environment from those of genetics on DNA methylation profiles remains a significant challenge. Monozygotic (MZ) twin study designs are unique in their ability to control for genetic differences because each pair of MZ twins shares essentially the same genetic sequence with the exception of a small number of de novo mutations and copy number variations. Thus, differences within twin pairs in gene expression and phenotype, including behavior, can be attributed in the majority of cases to environmental effects rather than genetic influence. In this article, we review the literature showing how MZ twin designs can be used to study basic epigenetic principles, contributing to understanding the role of early in utero and postnatal environmental factors on the development of psychopathology. We also highlight the importance of initiating longitudinal and experimental studies with MZ twins during pregnancy. This approach is especially important to identify: (1) critical time periods during which the early environment can impact brain and mental health development, and (2) the specific mechanisms through which early environmental effects may be mediated. These studies may inform the optimum timing and design for early preventive interventions aimed at reducing risk for psychopathology.

269	L'emprisonnement avec sursis : des politiques aux pratiques	This thesis aims at understand how penalty is built, from policies to practices, through the example of conditional sentence in Canada. It proposes a transversal reading of the penalty through each level of the penal system (policies, organizations, practices). The penal system is conceptualized as a social system governed by a rationality and composed of different spaces. The spaces are autonomous but communicate with each other; practices take place inside them. Our dataset was built from a qualitative study based on political speeches analysis and a field survey conducted in 8 community-based organizations from Quebec. Results show that: 1) the normative frame of the conditional sentence has been built according to a logic of risk management; 2) organizations develop criminal and local cultures that shape representations and professional identities; 3) individual practices are the result of a combination of interactions, local culture and the normative framework.	criminal policies , criminal practices , community supervision , systems theory , risk management , professional practices , local criminal cultures	en	23409.0
270	Étude du polymère élastomère à base d’acrylonitrile, HNBR, pour son application dans les batteries Li-ion	In this thesis, we have investigated an acrylonitrile-based polymer, HNBR (Hydrogenated Nitrile Butadiene Rubber), for its application in lithium ion batteries. This work relies on a partnership with the company Hutchinson (specialized in polymers) who was interested in developing a new process for the fabrication of electrodes. This melt-based process revealed problems regarding the polymer that is used as a binder for the electrodes as it needs to be compatible with the process as well as with the application in batteries.  The aim of the thesis was therefore to find and validate a polymer meeting these requirements. Hence, HNBR was investigated. At first, we focused on the thermal treatment of HNBR, a key step of the melt-process. It was concluded that the thermal treatment leads to the cross-linking of HNBR, which is an asset because it increases the chemical stability of HNBR in the presence of the organic electrolyte. The following step was to introduce HNBR into the electrode formulation and investigate the performances of electrodes, made with the classical process and then with the melt process. It was found that HNBR is a good candidate to be introduced in an electrochemical system because it is stable over wide potential ranges and it allows interesting cycling and power performance.  Faced with these findings, the last part of the study was to focus on analyzing the system more deeply by investigating the interactions between the HNBR polar functions, nitriles, and the lithium ions from the electrolyte. The ternary system polymer-salt-solvent was analyzed to understand the impact of each of these parameters on electrochemical properties, especially the conductivity. We noticed a high acrylonitrile content was beneficial to have a higher conductivity and that the solvent, regarding its affinity with HNBR, needs also to be considered.

optimisation par l'application des concepts du design moléculaire en chimie de coordination"	In the current ecological and environmental context, Mankind needs to find alternative energy sources to replace fossil fuels, as their combustion is a major cause of the current global climate change affecting our daily life a bit more each year. Inspired by Nature and the photosynthetic process, a new area at the interface between chemistry, physics and engineering has emerged in the 70s: artificial photosynthesis. Since then, many catalytic systems have been reported but their integration at commercial scale has not yet been achieved. Several challenges remain to improve their performances, ensure efficient coupling between the different reactions and enhance the long-term stability of these devices. Within this doctoral thesis, we have focused on exploring the coordination chemistry of ruthenium and rhenium complexes, ubiquitous in the literature though their properties can still be vastly tuned by designing new ligands. In a different approach, polyoxometalates, which are inorganic compounds half-way between oxides and molecules with fascinating properties, were recruited to develop covalent dyads, a strategy enabling stabilization of the dye under photocatalytic conditions.	photocatalyse , Photosynthesis , Photocatalysis , Coordination chemistry , Polyoxometalate	en	23399.0
272	Construction d’une épistémologie critique pour la recherche interdisciplinaire à des fins d’action (intelligence artificielle et médecine personnalisée)	The rise of interdisciplinary studies at the end of the 20th century took the form of a critical movement which arose as a reaction to subspecialisation and reflects a remarkable reform in the history of thought which, despite being slow and discrete, is nevertheless still active. The principal objective of this dissertation is to argue for the construction of a critical epistemology in interdisciplinary research oriented towards action. This project is justified in the first part of the work by considering the problem which constitutes the heart of this intellectual exercise, that is, the lack of a theoretical discussion capable of articulating a fecund relationship with the “mature” discipline—a reflection capable of integrating the second epistemological revolution of the 20th century and consequently justifying, in a coherent manner, recourse to interdisciplinarity (Lemay, 2017). The first part of the dissertation, devoted to deconstructionism, explores these discursive phenomena and their current state of research (Chapters 1 and 2). It also aims to understand the diversity and scope of the epistemological debates that animated the 20th century (Chapter 3). Following the deconstructionist review, the discussion adopts a constructive character, where considerations foundational to the development of a theoretical apparatus highlight clearly the intellectual importance of the deliberations of the Frankfurt School for the field of interdisciplinary studies (Chapter 4). The second part reaches its peak in the construction of a critical epistemology for interdisciplinary research in social action, which could serve as an epistemological model for praxeology and the social sciences in general (Chapter 5). This model is based on four pillars or components, which characterize interdisciplinary thought as an original and alternative mode for the production of knowledge: the interpersonal, the transformative, the transversal, and the intercultural. Finally, in the third part, I propose two examples where interdisciplinary epistemology can be applied, one related to artificial intelligence and the other to personalized medicine; two new fields born at the crossings of many paths and whose application increasingly affects our daily lives (Chapters 6 and 7).  Three conclusions emerge from this discussion: interdisciplinary thought can be qualified as (i) an approach that is capable of handling the complexities of contemporary problems; (ii) as a resurgence of Critical Theory; and (iii) as the root and the application ground of new sciences linked to the development of Big Data and discoveries in the omic sciences.

273	Harsh parenting practices mediate the association between parent affective profiles and child adjustment outcomes : differential associations for mothers and fathers.	Children’s early emotional environment strongly influences their later behavioural development. Yet, besides maternal depression, limited knowledge exists about the effect of other emotions and the role of fathers. Using 290 triads (mother/father/child), we investigated how positive (SEEKING, CARING, PLAYFULNESS) and negative (FEAR, ANGER, SADNESS) dimensions of mothers’ and fathers’ affectivity relate to their offspring’s externalizing and internalizing behaviours directly as well as indirectly via parenting practices. Parental variables were measured when children were 4 years old and children’s behaviours were measured at 8 years of age. Latent Profile Analysis identified three parental affective profiles: low negative emotions, balanced, and high emotional. Structural equation models showed that, for boys, mothers’ low negative emotions and high emotional profiles predicted later internalizing behaviours (direct effect; β = −0.21 and β = 0.23), while fathers’ low negative emotions profile predicted externalizing behaviours indirectly (β = −0.10). For girls, mothers’ profiles (low negative emotions and high emotional) predicted both internalizing (β = −0.04 and β = 0.07) and externalizing (β = −0.05 and β = 0.09) behaviours indirectly, but no effects of fathers’ profiles were found. Mothers’ and fathers’ affective profiles contributed to the behavioural development of their offspring in different ways, according to the type of behaviour (internalizing or externalizing) and the child’s sex. These findings may help in tailoring existing parenting interventions on affective profiles, thus enhancing their efficacy.

274	Le space sharing : l'adaptation des commerçants indépendants face aux défis du commerce de détail des artères commerciales montréalaises	For a long time, Main streets were the only form of commercial organization that cities knew. The situation has changed over the past 100 years ; the commercial supply has changed and consumption patterns have diversified. The vitality of the Main streets has been undermined since the middle of the last century. In recent years, the increase in the property values of commercial buildings in Montreal's central neighborhoods has put additional pressure on the commercial activity of the Main streets. The independent retailers who occupy the vast majority of the commercial buildings of these streets face many difficulties and they must adapt. This difficult context is fertile for the emergence of new business concepts, including space sharing. Thus, this research explores the business opportunities offered by the practice of space sharing to independent retailers in Montreal's Main streets. The study was conducted with independent retailers who are in business on a commercial street in Montreal. From ten semi-structured interviews, this study reveals that space sharing is a solution adopted by independent retailers to face the challenges they face in the current context. It acts as a stepping stone, whether it is to have a storefront for the first time, to make the leap to the occupation of a commercial space alone, or to position itself strategically against the competition. Sometimes adopted as a structuring business model, other times as a transitional phase, space sharing allows the emergence of new businesses and acts on the vitality of independent retailers. Ultimately, it acts on the vitality of Montreal's commercial streets. This study opens up on a new business model that can be part of the solution for arteries that face difficulties.	space sharing , retail , main street , independant retailers	en	23367.0
275	Two-stage majoritarian choice	We propose a class of decisive collective choice rules that rely on an exogenous linear ordering to partition the majority relation into two acyclic relations. The first relation is used to obtain a shortlist of the feasible alternatives while the second is used to make a final choice. In combination with faithfulness to the underlying majority relation, rules in this class are characterized by two desirable rationality properties: Sen’s expansion consistency and a version of Manzini and Mariotti’s weak WARP. The rules also satisfy natural adaptations of Arrow’s independence of irrelevant alternatives and May’s positive responsiveness.

276	Walking into the sunset : how criminal achievement shapes the desistance process	According to the criminal career paradigm, the link between past and future criminal activities is important and the desistance process may vary for individuals whose criminal trajectories were punctuated by failure compared to those who achieved a certain level of success. This study, based on the life narratives of 27 individuals who maintained a state of non-offending for more than a year, examines how criminal achievement modulates the desistance process. The aim is to understand whether criminal achievement acts as a barrier or a facilitator in the desistance process. A short questionnaire based on the life-history calendar method was used to classify individuals according to the parameters of their criminal careers. Narrative life stories were then used to look at the obstacles and frustrations encountered during desistance. The results show the relation between criminal achievement and desistance is complex: success in criminal activities is not always hindering desistance.

277	La réhabilitation par l’intervention : trajectoire inusitée?	There has been little interest in residual trajectories of ex-offenders who have ceased their criminal activities, of former addicts who have stopped their consumption or of pedophiles who have opted for abstinence. However, there is no guarantee that the personal rehabilitation or existential identity change takes the form of a personal empowerment. This paper examine the life course of a self-taught moral entrepreneur who has found the path of social and professional recognition by finding an innovative solution (and effective) to help those who embraced different kind of deviant trajectories. The strategy used was to proceed by case study by conducting a schematization of the biography of a moral entrepreneur. The study proposes to examine the mechanisms that made possible this success.

278	La dynamique des séquences de rechute chez des joueurs excessifs et des joueurs délinquants	Few individuals who embrace deviant trajectories maintain a constant level of deviance over time. Fluctuations, changes and transitions are commonplace in deviant lifestyles. A limited number of studies have examined these changes in a dynamic perspective. Drawing from the method of life history calendars and considering inter-and intra-individual changes, this study compares relapse episodes among gamblers (N=50) and offenders (N=107) trajectories. Results highlight the generalizability of the criminal career analytical framework. In particular, our findings emphasize the importance of considering both individual attributes and life circumstances. We also discover in this study that the effect of life circumstances is often conditional of certain individual characteristics.

279	« All in or fold » : les hauts et les bas de la carrière des joueurs excessifs	o study, American as well as Canadian, has examined the dynamics of change in compulsive, pathological or excessive gambler trajectories. This seeks to improve knowledge about excessive gamblers by analyzing within and between individual changes in 100 excessive gambler trajectories. Participants were recruited in therapeutic resources surrounding the city of Montreal. Monthly variations of monetary bets are analyzed, with special attention given to episodes of abstinence. The use of hierarchical linear models (HLM) allows to consider simultaneously contextual variables (the effect of conventional and deviant life circumstances), and personal characteristics (impulsiveness, gender, etc). Results show that life circumstances have an impact on the intensity of gambling and episodes of abstinence. More specifically, they highlight the importance of deviant life circumstances (criminal earnings, loan shark, alcohol and drug consumption) to understand major changes in gambling habits.

280	Serotonin transporter promoter methylation in peripheral cells and neural responses to negative stimuli : a study of adolescent monozygotic twins	Several studies have examined associations between peripheral DNA methylation patterns of the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) promoter and symptoms of depression and anxiety. The SLC6A4 promoter methylation has also been associated with frontal-limbic brain responses to negative stimuli. However, it is unclear how much of this association is confounded by DNA sequence variations. We utilized a monozygotic-twin within-pair discordance design, to test whether DNA methylation at specific CpG sites in the SLC6A4 promoter of peripheral cells is associated with greater frontal-limbic brain responses to negative stimuli (sadness and fear), independently of DNA sequence effects. In total 48 pairs of healthy 15-year-old monozygotic twins from the Quebec Newborn Twin Study, followed regularly since birth, underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while conducting an emotion-processing task. The SLC6A4 promoter methylation level was assessed in saliva samples using pyrosequencing. Relative to the co-twins with lower SLC6A4 promoter methylation levels, twins with higher peripheral SLC6A4 methylation levels showed greater orbitofrontal cortical (OFC) activity and left amygdala-anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and left amygdala-right OFC connectivity in response to sadness as well as greater ACC-left amygdala and ACC-left insula connectivity in response to fearful stimuli. By utilising a monozygotic-twin design, we provided evidence that associations between peripheral SLC6A4 promoter methylation and frontal-limbic brain responses to negative stimuli are, in part, independent of DNA sequence variations. Although causality cannot be determined here, SLC6A4 promoter methylation may be one of the mechanisms underlying how environmental factors influence the serotonin system, potentially affecting emotional processing through frontal-limbic areas.

281	L'art dans tous ses territoires au jardin des Premières-Nations : regards sur l’immatériel dans les œuvres du Concours d’œuvre murale éphémère	From 2003 to 2017, the First Nations Garden of the Montréal Botanical Garden has exhibited each year the mural artwork of an Indigenous artist as part of the Ephemeral mural contest launched by Sylvie Paré. This memoir brings together all of this exhibition in order to highlight the general discourse and the relations that the artworks have with each other, with the Garden and with the physical and imaginary territories. Through a formal and symbolic analysis of this exposition, that integrates the ontologies, epistemology and methodologies of the First Nations, I wish to reflect on the links that unite the notions of gaze, territory, interconnection and memory. The first chapter focuses on the distance generated by the sight seen as an intermediary “objective” of human experience, and the separation (or schism) that it created between the conceptions of nature and culture. I will then look at how the First Nations Garden questions this rupture. The second chapter of this dissertation focuses more specifically on the oblique perspectives adopted by the mural artworks in that they focus on memories and cultural marks left by the indigenous nations on the territories for more than 10,000 years. Moreover, if the murals generally express an environmental concern, they do so through the eyes of different “entities” circulating fluidly and circularly in space, time and intersubjectivity. They explore the physical and imaginary traces of relationships with the territory and highlight the existence of a relationship of reciprocity with the universe in which the territory plays a dynamic role.

282	Knowledge sharing in global health research : the impact, uptake and cost of open access to scholarly literature	Background: In 1982, the Annals of Virology published a paper showing how Liberia has a highly endemic potential of Ebola warning health authorities of the risk for potential outbreaks; this journal is only available by subscription. Limiting the accessibility of such knowledge may have reduced information propagation toward public health actors who were indeed surprised by and unprepared for the 2014 epidemic. Open access (OA) publication can allow for increased access to global health research (GHR). Our study aims to assess the use, cost and impact of OA diffusion in the context of GHR. Method: A total of 3366 research articles indexed under the Medical Heading Subject Heading “Global Health” published between 2010 and 2014 were retrieved using PubMed to (1) quantify the uptake of various types of OA, (2) estimate the article processing charges (APCs) of OA, and (3) analyse the relationship between different types of OA, their scholarly impact and gross national income per capita of citing countries. Results: Most GHR publications are not available directly on the journal’s website (69%). Further, 60.8% of researchers do not self-archive their work even when it is free and in keeping with journal policy. The total amount paid for APCs was estimated at US$1.7 million for 627 papers, with authors paying on average US$2732 per publication; 94% of APCs were paid to journals owned by the ten most prominent publication houses from high-income countries. Researchers from low- and middle-income countries are generally citing less expensive types of OA, while researchers in high-income countries are citing the most expensive OA. Conclusions: Although OA may help in building global research capacity in GHR, the majority of publications remain subscription only. It is logical and cost-efficient for institutions and researchers to promote OA by selfarchiving publications of restricted access, as it not only allows research to be cited by a broader audience, it also augments citation rates. Although OA does not ensure full knowledge transfer from research to practice, limiting public access can negatively impact implementation and outcomes of health policy and reduce public understanding of health issues.

283	Modeling a century of citation distributions	The prevalence of uncited papers or of highly cited papers, with respect to the bulk of publications, provides important clues as to the dynamics of scientific research. Using 25 million papers and 600 million references from the Web of Science over the 1900–2006 period, this paper proposes a simple model based on a random selection process to explain the “uncitedness” phenomenon and its decline over the years. We show that the proportion of cited papers is a function of (1) the number of articles available (the competing papers), (2) the number of citing papers and (3) the number of references they contain. Using uncitedness as a departure point, we demonstrate the utility of the stretched-exponential function and a form of the Tsallis q-exponential function to fit complete citation distributions over the 20th century. As opposed to simple power-law fits, for instance, both these approaches are shown to be empirically well-grounded and robust enough to better understand citation dynamics at the aggregate level. On the basis of these models, we provide quantitative evidence and provisional explanations for an important shift in citation practices around 1960. We also propose a revision of the “citation classic” category as a set of articles which is clearly distinguishable from the rest of the field.

284	An ecological microsystem to treat waste oil contaminated soil: Using phytoremediation assisted by fungi and local compost, on a mixed-contaminant site, in a cold climate	As a result of anthropization and industrialization, northern remote communities face issues of soil contamination by mixtures of organic and inorganic contaminants. Soil bioremediation in cold environments is particularly challenging because of slower degradation rates, slower production of biomass for phytoextraction of trace elements (TEs), and remoteness, which can complicate logistics and inflate costs. This study evaluated a decontamination approach integrating indigenous willows, fungi and compost in a northern community. The site was a waste oil pit and its soil was initially contaminated with petroleum hydrocarbons (PHC) exceeding 200 g kg-1 and TEs including As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Pb and Zn. In under five years, 65 and 75% of PHC (C6-C50 and >C50) were degraded, compared to 27 and 13% for the untreated control soil. We found contrasting TE translocation patterns to the aboveground biomass for the willow species used (Salix planifolia and Salix alaxensis), as well as distinctive rooting strategies. Hazard quotients were calculated to assess the risk plant material could pose to local wildlife. The highest TE concentration measured was Zn in S. planifolia, which exceeded Canadian soil guidelines. Results indicate toxicity risks to animals linked to TEs in Salix spp. leaves is generally unlikely. The fungus Trametes versicolor inoculated into the soil did not fruit, however fruiting bodies of Psathyrella sp. were observed consistently (four out of five years). Biological tests indicated that in five growing seasons soil toxicity significantly decreased compared to the untreated soil used as control. This was demonstrated by vegetation cover (137 vs 11% cover), toxicity assays on earthworms (Eisenia andrei) (0 vs 33% mortality) and barley seed germination (Hordeum vulgare) (86 vs 62% germination). The proposed decontamination approach, without the use of synthetic fertilizers, is promising for the PHC remediation of mixed-contaminants on cold climate sites.

285	Mercury and selenium distribution in key tissues and early life stages of Yellow Perch (Perca flavescens)	Whereas early life stages are usually considered as particularly sensitive to both organic and inorganic contaminants, field studies assessing contaminant bioaccumulation in these stages are scarce. Selenium (Se) is thought to counteract Hg toxic effects when it is found at Se:Hg molar ratios above 1. However, the variation of this ratio in key fish tissues of different early life stages is mostly unknown. The present study therefore aimed to assess Hg and Se content in gravid female tissues (gonads, muscle, liver, gut, and brain) and different life stages (egg masses, newly hatched larvae (NHL), larvae and juvenile) of Yellow Perch (YP) in a large fluvial lake (Lake Saint-Pierre, Québec, Canada). Se:Hg molar ratios were measured for each compartment in order to fill associated knowledge gaps. Total Hg (THg) and methylmercury (MeHg) concentration varied between tissue according to the following trend: Muscle > Liver > Gut > Brain > Gonads. During YP early life stages, MeHg values increased according to an ontogenetic pattern (mg/kg dw) (mean ± SEM): Egg masses (0.01 ± 0.002) < NHL (0.015 ± 0.001) < Larvae (0.14 ± 0.01) < Juveniles (0.18 ± 0.01). Se concentrations in different YP tissues showed the following trend (mg/kg dw) (mean ± SEM): Gut (3.6 ± 0.1) > Liver (2.5 ± 0.1) > Gonads (1.92 ± 0.06) > Brain (1.26 ± 0.03) > Muscle (1.23 ± 0.06). In YP early life stages, Se concentrations were highest in NHL (3.0 ± 0.2), and then decreased as follows: Egg masses (2.8 ± 0.1) > Larvae (1.37 ± 0.04) > Juveniles (0.93 ± 0.05). Se:Hg molar ratios varied considerably and were systematically above 1. This is the first study to simultaneously report Hg and Se bioaccumulation through fish life cycle.

286	Preventing corneal calcification associated with xylazine for longitudinal optical coherence tomography in young rodents	PURPOSE. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) is widely used in clinical ophthalmology and recently gained popularity in laboratory research involving small rodents. Its noninvasive nature allows repeated measurements, thereby decreasing the number of animals required. However, when used at a conventional dosage, xylazine (an a2- adrenoceptor) can cause irreversible corneal calcification, especially among young rodents. In the present study, we test whether corneal calcification associated with xylazine is mediated by the a2-adrenoceptor. METHODS. Our study tested Sprague-Dawley rats, Long-Evans rats, and CD-1 mice (postnatal day [P]14). Retinal images were captured by SD-OCT. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was used to study gene expression, whereas receptor localization was examined by immunofluorescent staining followed by confocal microscopy. Calcium deposits were detected via von Kossa staining. RESULTS. When used at dosages appropriate for adult animals, ketamine-xylazine anesthetics led to a high rate of respiratory failure, increased apoptotic activity in the corneal epithelium, and irreversible corneal calcification in P14 rat pups. Meanwhile, OCT image quality decreased drastically as a result of corneal calcification among animals recovering from anesthesia. a2-Adrenoceptor subtypes were highly expressed on P14, in line with rodents’ age-specific sensitivity to xylazine. Clonidine, a potent a2-adrenoceptor agonist, dosedependently induced corneal calcification, which could be prevented by an a2-adrenoceptor antagonist. CONCLUSIONS. These data suggest that a2-adrenoceptors contribute to corneal calcification in young rodents. Therefore, we developed a suitable OCT imaging protocol for this cohort, including a carefully tailored ketamine-xylazine dosage (60 mg/kg and 2.5 kg/mg, respectively).

287	Les technologies d’édition numérique sont-elles des documents comme les autres ?	Digital publishing technologies are the mean of production of documents such as articles or books, these technologies are therefore original examples of born-digital object. Dynamic, modular, protean. Several recent examples of these technologies tend to question their status. Our starting point is the comparison between documents and digital publishing technologies. However, we will separate them by emphasizing the reflective dimension of these technologies. This paper presents three examples : Distill, a journal whose articles are managed as computer programs ; Quire, a publishing framework that generates multiform books ; Stylo, a semantic text editor that allows writing in a scholarly publishing context. Our methodology consists in the analysis of these three publication systems, emblematic of the digital transformations at work, based on three criteria (structure, registration and reflection). The main interest of these three initiatives is to bring together many of the specificities of born-digital objects that now surround us, whereas traditional editing technologies rely mainly on print workflow.

288	A short-term assessment of nascent HIV-1 transmission clusters among newly diagnosed individuals using envelope sequence-based phylogenetic analyses	The identification of transmission clusters (TCs) of HIV-1 using phylogenetic analyses can provide insights into viral transmission network and help improve prevention strategies. We compared the use of partial HIV-1 envelope fragment of 1,070 bp with its loop 3 (108 bp) to determine its utility in inferring HIV-1 transmission clustering. Serum samples of recently (n = 106) and chronically (n = 156) HIV-1-infected patients with status confirmed were sequenced. HIV-1 envelope nucleotide-based phylogenetic analyses were used to infer HIV-1 TCs. Those were constructed using ClusterPickerGUI_1.2.3 considering a pairwise genetic distance of £10% threshold. Logistic regression analyses were used to examine the relationship between the demographic factors that were likely associated with HIV-1 clustering. Ninety-eight distinct consensus envelope sequences were subjected to phylogenetic analyses. Using a partial envelope fragment sequence, 42 sequences were grouped into 15 distinct small TCs while the V3 loop reproduces 10 clusters. The agreement between the partial envelope and the V3 loop fragments was significantly moderate with a Cohen’s kappa (j) coefficient of 0.59, p < .00001. The mean age (<38.8 years) and HIV-1 B subtype are two factors identified that were significantly associated with HIV-1 transmission clustering in the cohort, odds ratio (OR) = 0.25, 95% confidence interval (CI, 0.04–0.66), p = .002 and OR: 0.17, 95% CI (0.10–0.61), p = .011, respectively. The present study confirms that a partial fragment of the HIV-1 envelope sequence is a better predictor of transmission clustering. However, the loop 3 segment may be useful in screening purposes and may be more amenable to integration in surveillance programs.

289	L’accès à la libération conditionnelle : mieux comprendre la prise en charge des détenus provinciaux vers la libération conditionnelle	Objective. The overall objective of this study is to understand the way Correctional Services take care of prisoners to bring them toward parole. From the main objective, we will discuss two objectives. Firstly, this study describes the main steps toward conditional release. Finally, the last objective is to identify some parameters that can modify the way to take care of the prisoners. Methodology. Based on lengthy observations and qualitative interviews, several information was collected. Four detention facilities were observed over a period ranging from 9 to 27 days. During these periods, probation officers and caseworkers were interviewed and observed. Subsequently, a vertical analysis of the data was performed to identify the characteristics of each detention centre. Finally, an analysis of the realities common and distinct from the different institutions was made possible by a horizontal analysis of the data. Results. The analysis of the data allowed the presentation of the various stages of the process towards parole, being access to information, evaluation and monitoring. By this description, different jail’s realities that modulate the way to get to parole are discussed. The role of different officers, their perception of the conditional release, their expectations toward the prisoners and the commissaires and finally, the relationship between all the actors are realities that can be identified with the data gathering. Staff turnover, limited prison space, institutional transfers, supervisory constraints, and lack of external resources all add to the complexity of offender care. In addition, some inmates appear to be more penalized due to their profile. Prisoner who are in protective custody and those living in a safe sector appear to be neglected in some stages of the process in all the detention facilities visited.

290	La reconnaissance des émotions et l'inhibition chez l'enfant avec et sans trouble du déficit de l'attention avec hyperactivité	Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most prevalent disorder among children and adolescents. Inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms that characterize this disorder can interfere with functioning in different settings (at school or at home, with peers, etc.). Indeed, many children with ADHD display social problems that jeopardize their quality of life and their well-being. These interpersonal difficulties seem to be related to inhibitory deficits. Furthermore, social cognition deficits such as affect recognition (AF) difficulties can alter social functioning. However, the mechanism underlying these social problems currently remains unclear. The present study aims to investigate the link between AF, inhibition and social functioning among a pediatric population with and without ADHD. Seventy children aged 8 to 12 participated to the study. Thirty-five children diagnosed with ADHD and showing social problems were matched on age and sex with 35 typically developing children. All took part in a cognitive assessment including different tasks measuring social cognition, executive functions, attention, as well as verbal and nonverbal reasoning. The main results indicate that the ADHD group performed worse than the control group on AF and verbal inhibition tasks. Moreover, no significant relationship was found between AF, inhibition and social functioning. Therefore, poor AF skills in ADHD may not be associated with verbal inhibition deficits. Difficulties in these two domains may also be insufficient to explain social problems among children with ADHD. Further research is needed to investigate if poor AF in ADHD is a primary deficit or if it is associated with other cognitive impairments.

291	Autophagy drives fibroblast senescence through MTORC2 regulation	Sustained macroautophagy/autophagy favors the differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts. Cellular senescence, another means of responding to long-term cellular stress, has also been linked to myofibroblast differentiation and fibrosis. Here, we evaluate the relationship between senescence and myofibroblast differentiation in the context of sustained autophagy. We analyzed markers of cell cycle arrest/senescence in fibroblasts in vitro, where autophagy was triggered by serum starvation (SS). Autophagic fibroblasts expressed the senescence biomarkers CDKN1A/p21 and CDKN2A/p16 and exhibited increased senescenceassociated GLB1/beta-galactosidase activity. Inhibition of autophagy in serum-starved fibroblasts with 3-methyladenine, LY294002, or ATG7 (autophagy related 7) silencing prevented the expression of senescence-associated markers. Similarly, suppressing MTORC2 activation using rapamycin or by silencing RICTOR also prevented senescence hallmarks. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that senescence and myofibroblast differentiation were induced in different cells, suggesting mutually exclusive activation of senescence and myofibroblast differentiation. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are known inducers of senescence and exposing fibroblasts to ROS scavengers decreased ROS production during SS, inhibited autophagy, and significantly reduced the expression of senescence and myofibroblast differentiation markers. ROS scavengers also curbed the AKT1 phosphorylation at Ser473, an MTORC2 target, establishing the importance of ROS in fuelling MTORC2 activation. Inhibition of senescence by shRNA to TP53/p53 and shRNA CDKN2A/p16 increased myofibroblast differentiation, suggesting a negative feedback loop of senescence on autophagy-induced myofibroblast differentiation.

292	Extreme metal : subculture, genre, and structure	Extreme metal is a conglomeration of numerous subgenres with shared musical and discursive tendencies. For the sake of concision, the focus throughout this thesis will mainly be on death metal and black metal – two of the most popular subgenres categorized under the umbrella of extreme metal. Each chapter is a comparative analysis of death metal and black metal from different perspectives. Thus, Chapter One is historical account of extreme metal but also includes discussions pertaining to iconography and pitch syntax. Subsequently, Chapter Two concerns itself with the conception of timbre in death metal and black metal. More specifically, timbre will be discussed in the context of sound production as well as timbre derived from performance, in particular, vocal distortion. The conception of rhythm/meter will be discussed in Chapter Three which will simultaneously allow for a discussion of the fluidity of genre boundaries between death metal and progressive metal – largely because of the importance placed on rhythm by the latter subgenre. Instead of a focus on musical practices, Chapter Four will instead take a sociological approach with the aim of answering certain issues raised in the first three chapters. Ultimately, this thesis aims to elucidate two questions: What are the different aesthetic intentions between practitioners of death metal and black metal? And, how do fans conceptualize these aesthetic differences? Sarah Thornton’s notion of subcultural capital – which is derived from Pierre Bourdieu’s notion of cultural capital – will help to answer such questions.	‘black métal’ , timbre , extreme metal , death metal , black metal , timbre , sound production , rhythm & meter , metrical dissonance , subcultural capital	en	22863.0
293	Prévalence de l’aplasie et de l’hypoplasie des glandes salivaires majeures chez les enfants atteints du syndrome de Down (trisomie 21)	Objective: The main objective of this study is to assess the prevalence of aplasia and hypoplasia of the major salivary glands (parotid and submandibular) in patients with Trisomy 21 (T21). The second objective is to identify the oral manifestations related to this developmental anomaly. Hypothesis: The prevalence of aplasia and hypoplasia of the major salivary glands in patients with T21 is significantly higher when compared with the general population. Method: Data from 46 patients with T21 and 33 patients from a control group was collected. An oral examination, a fungal culture and an ultrasound of the parotid and submandibular glands were performed. Results: The prevalence of aplasia of the parotid glands is 15,2% in patients with T21 and 3,0% in control patients. None of the patients showed aplasia of the submandibular glands. The prevalence of parotid hypoplasia was estimated at 51,8%, whereas the prevalence of the submandibular hypoplasia was 58,4% in patients with T21. These developmental anomalies influence significantly the presence of candidiasis (p<0.0001), oral erythema (p=0.005) and hyposialia (p<0.0001), but does not influence significantly the carious index (p=0.338). Conclusion: The prevalence of parotid aplasia tends to be higher in patients with T21 (p=0.13). Hypoplasia of the parotid and submandibular glands is more common in patients with T21. Oral manifestations related to this developmental abnormality are candidiasis, oral erythema and hyposialia.	Trisomy 21 , Down syndrome , Major salivary glands , Aplasia , Hypoplasia	en	22861.0
294	Le rôle de la banque dans la lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent : étude comparative entre le droit Libanais et le droit Canadien	The development of banks’ areas of expertise and the reinforcement of the banking secrecy, a system that protects personal information, have played an important role in the development of the financial sector, notably the banking sector. These systems have offered clients many advantages. However, they have also triggered the emergence of financial fraud, giving rise specifically to the act of money laundering. As a result, the international community fighting against money laundering has realised that the only way to make a change would be to integrate all the professions implicated directly in the problem of dirty money. Thus, it has decided to intrust financial middlemen and bankers with the task of integrating a number of regulations to deal with the issue. This includes the declaration of suspicious activities and the obligation to monitor clients’ activities at all times. As a result of these new regulations, each banker plays the role of the middleman and reports to the police of financial circuits. Bankers will be severely punished if they fail to achieve their duties and they will be personally held responsible for the ensuing consequences.	conventions internationales , money laundering , fight against money laundering , international conventions , banker , bank , banking secrecy , derogations of banking secrecy , obligation of discretion , client identification and verification of identity , responsibility	en	22851.0
295	Repenser la nature juridique de l'expertise dans l'instance civile	In a society dependent on scientific and technical knowledge, expert evidence is critical to the court’s process of seeking the truth. However, under the effect of the adversarial system, experts are being criticized for their lack of impartiality. Expert evidence has also been identified as one of the main causes for the increase of costs and delays of justice. For these reasons, the reform of theCode of Civil Procedure addressed the issue of expert evidence. As a guiding principle, the Code states that the expert has the mission to enlighten the court objectively, impartially and thoroughly. This mission overrides the parties’ interests. However, the other measures included in the Code as to expert evidence seem to only focus on reducing manifestations of a problem whose causes remain existent.  The purpose of this master’s thesis is to offer a renewed understanding of the legal nature of expert evidence. Expert evidence should be considered as a tool for the court rather than a means of evidence for the parties, and the expert, as an officer of the court, rather than a witness. This demonstration will be carried out through three different dimensions of the expertise, namely referential, normative and practical. Specific elements that characterize the expertise and its mission will be identified. The point of this demonstration lies in its effects, since it calls for a transformed, and sometimes more rigorous, treatment of expertise by courts, practitioners and experts, particularly as to the impartiality of the laters. The master’s thesis concludes with the formulation of simple, concrete and feasible solutions.

296	Hyperphagie homéostatique et le profil alimentaire d’individus obèses morbides candidats à la chirurgie bariatrique	INTRODUCTION: Morbid obesity rates have tripled in Canada from 1978 to 2004. Bariatric surgery is suggested to be the most effective treatment. We estimate an important proportion of this population to have eating disorders that are not well understood.  OBJECTIVE: The present study seeks to highlight the main variables of the eating profile of morbidly obese individuals.  METHODS: The study took place in a hospital center, using the medical charts to retrospectively collect data from the initial nutrition consultation. The study included a total of 83 subjects (55 women and 28 men) from 16 to 62 years old with BMI ranging from 39.5 to 82.3 kg/m2.  RESULTS: Dysfunctional eating patterns were observed, such as skipping breakfast, and often compensated by food consumption of poor quality after supper. Energy intake and food quantity measured as volume was generally greater at the end of the day. A majority of participants reported eating meals rapidly (< 15 minutes) and having difficulty identifying or responding to satiety and hunger signals. Many characteristics observed parallel those of homeostatic hyperphagia. Before bariatric surgery, the majority of subjects in the study reported not seeing a registered dietitian to address the disordered eating.  CONCLUSION: Many damaging eating characteristics have been identified in the morbidly obese population. Improved understanding of the dysfunctional eating pattern will help prevent and treat disordered eating associated to morbid obesity.

297	Les lois anticorruption brésilienne et canadienne et leurs effets sur la compliance des entreprises au Brésil	The purpose of this study is to understand the influence of Canadian and Brazilian anti-corruption laws in compliance programs in Brazil. For that, the research will be divided into three parts. The first part will analyze the corruption itself, its definitions, its history in Canada, Brazil and in the world. Understanding the history of the fight against corruption, of the national laws, and the main conventions adopted over the years to reduce its harmful effects will help us get a better idea of the current scenario in Brazil. In a second part, we will better understand the corruption in Canada and Brazil, as well as efforts to combat it in those two countries over the years. This will be done through an overview of the history and the adopted legislations. In the last part, we will look into compliance programs to better understand how this subject has evolved in Brazil in recent years, under the influence of these two national laws. This work adopts the deductive research method, and analyzes existing doctrines, articles and laws. The main question is: how have the new Brazilian and Canadian anti-corruption laws changed compliance programs in Brazil? Compliance consists on policies and procedures designed to detect, combat and correct irregularities in the business sphere, generally associated with corrupt practices, developing a culture of ethics, integrity and preventing wrongdoing. It is one of the main distractors and generators of inequality in the economy, and therefore, compliance plays a fundamental role in this work.	corruption , compliance , loi anticorruption , Brazil , law , compliance programs	en	22786.0
298	Les insuffisances des grands outils juridiques protégeant le droit à l'égalité en emploi : l'exemple de la déqualification des immigrantes et migrantes au Québec	The deskilling problem of immigrant and migrant women is observed both nationally and internationally in industrial relations studies and reports from international organizations. It  is  a  situation  of  systemic  and  intersectional  discrimination,  influenced by  the international  sexual  division  of  labor.  However,  numerous  international  conventions guarantee equal protection in employment for immigrant and migrant women. In Canada, the Canadian Charter and the Quebec Charter of Rights and Freedom protect the right to equality. In light of these findings, the main legal tools protecting employment equality will  be  studied  in  order  to  determine  what  obstacles  prevent  them  from  responding adequately to the situation of deskilling of immigrant and migrant women. In  international  law,  general  conventions  protecting  the  right  to  equality  and  specific conventions protecting rights for migrant workers will be analyzed. Some obstacles will be identified, such as the lack of denunciation of the international gender division of labor in international  law  and  the  preponderance  of  political  factors  in  immigrations  issues.  A solution will be proposed to find a way to better protect immigrant and migrant women in employment, precisely by the development of soft law mechanisms.At the national level, the guarantees of the right to equality of the Canadian and Quebec charters will be studied in order to identify the obstacles of the right to equality, namely the lack of real application of the theory of intersectionality in anti-discrimination law and the challenges for the courts to develop systemic remedies. The role of judicial branch in the search for solutions is limited because of the systemic nature of the situation of deskilling of immigrant and migrant women in Quebec. However, the judiciary can be a tool to promote recognition of the existence of this discriminatory situation  and  mobilize  the  political  world  to  develop  concrete  solutions,  particularly through the application of proactive regulations.

299	Entraide judiciaire en matière pénale : défis juridiques et administratifs liés à l’adéquation formelle et matérielle du processus de collecte de preuves à l’étranger	The quest for an answer to the underlying problems related to the prosecution of international crimes has made significant progress with the emergence of mutual legal assistance in criminal matters, which is the official legal tool through which bilateral agreements and multilateral treaties can be applied by states to gather evidence abroad. However, the effective implementation of this tool needs to be significantly improved in order to address the legal and administrative obstacles that hinder, if not prevent, the achievement of the desired result. Indeed, even when the evidence gathered is made available to the requesting state, such data are often inadequate or insufficient in the light of substantive and formal conditions laid down by each national law.  To support this, this research reviews various studies, the FATF’s Mutual Evaluation Reports on Compliance with Money Laundering Legislation, expert opinion, doctrine and jurisprudence on the priority issues that have hitherto hampered the gathering of evidence abroad through mutual legal assistance in criminal matters. After analyzing the legal framework and the reasons behind the emergence of mutual legal assistance in criminal matters, this dissertation dissects our hypothesis by analyzing the difficulties based on legal and institutional barriers. In the end, on the basis of successful examples, this study suggests practical solutions to optimize this mechanism of international legal cooperation as a means of enhancing the rapprochement between cooperating states and the effectiveness of criminal prosecution of transnational crimes through use of an information technology framework to the benefit of compliance with formal requirements, data security and mutual trust.

300	Femmes et itinérance : trajectoires biographiques et expériences de l'hébergement d'urgence	A controversial subject in the Sociology of Deviance, female homelessness is the result of a variety of factors, including substance abuse, alcoholism, mental health problems, trauma, job loss, loss of housing, divorce, death, domestic violence, etc. form an amalgam of contributing factors (Latimer et al., 2015). These factors are part of structural and individual order. From the sheltering point of view, this phenomenon is often discussed according to the problem of access to the facilities and the lack of privacy within them. These factors would have an impact on the perceptions and self-reports of the women experiencing it. This phenomenon not only cuts across different issues, but also affects a vulnerable population of women who need help tailored to their needs. Identification to the homelessness has a direct impact on individuals, but the status of ‘’homeless woman’’ seems to add a lot of additional difficulties. Second, established social welfare structures add up in the process of stigmatizing these women. The location, the mission of help and the lack of knowledge about these services push the citizens to question the representations of the users of the services. It is therefore relevant to question the existing social assistance systems (crisis center, shelter, day center, etc.) that can encourage a strong discrimination of the population. As a result, the appropriateness of the factors that can lead to homelessness, (welfare structures, control mechanisms etc.) leads to questions about their direct and indirect impacts on the female homeless population. The degradation of the image of the population or the impression of dangerousness can be concrete examples of impacts. The combination of factors leading to homelessness could encourage stigmatization of the population. As part of this masters thesis, these topics will be discussed in two central areas: the status of homeless and women’s accommodation.

301	Trauma, pleine conscience et travail social : du réductionnisme à la complexité de l’existence humaine	"The emergence of neuroscientific evidence that our experiments are shaping our brains would have led to the hypothesis in which mindfulness can be essentially considered as a ""brain training"" allowing the development of new brain behavior patterns. This ""neurocentric"" vision from cognitive neuroscience seems structurally characterized by the reductionist, positivist and individualist paradigms. However, given a vision taking into account the complexity of the human experience, it is possible to believe that mindfulness practice, as a way of being in the world, is effective in certain mental health disorders, since it is antithetical to the main symptoms related to the traumatic experience, itself being at the source of several mental disorders. In order to verify this hypothesis, the data collection strategy adopted for this research paper is essentially based on a grounded theory based having for object the scientific literature on mindfulness, trauma and their interactions. Our results have shown the importance of going beyond the predominantly individualistic aspect of the description and definition of mindfulness and trauma as a way of being in the world and of considering the interpersonal and social aspects of it."

302	L’esprit de la philosophie de Martin Buber	For some time now, political philosophy in the West has been dominated by two streams of thought: ‘‘theoretical’’ philosophy, rooted in the thinking of classical Greek theorists (Socrates, Plato and Aristotle), and ‘‘difference’’ philosophy, rooted in (Rabbinic) Jewish thought. Our thesis formulates and defends a philosophico-political reflection directed towards a potentially superior alternative, that of ‘‘practical’’ philosophy. While theoretical philosophy and difference philosophy aim for ‘‘creation,’’ practical philosophy aims for ‘‘interpretation.’’ The latter is based on the minority traditions within both Greek and Jewish thought: led by Protagoras in the former and the ancient Levite priests in the latter. Martin Heidegger (1889-1976), Hans-Georg Gadamer (1900-2002), Isaiah Berlin (1909-1997), Stuart Hampshire (1914-2004), Bernard Williams (1929-2003) and Charles Taylor (1931-) – to mention only these representative thinkers – are part of the hermeneutical tradition of practical philosophy. The purpose of the present work is to enrich the study of practical philosophers by proposing the critical analysis of a philosopher whose political thought so far is too little studied within the family of practical philosophy: Martin Buber (1878-1965). Philosopher at the crossroads of various ontological sources of Western culture – those of Jewish biblical revelation and Greek philosophical reason, among others – Buber has developed a political thought based on the interpretation of a priori (a)political symbols. Hence the difficulty of studying him as a political thinker. Generally, we tend to study political thinking as based on dialogue and listening – both receptive and reciprocal – as a response to the conflict of values in public. For the interpretations exchanged by political actors open the way to the possibility of arriving at a shared understanding and thus resolving the initial conflict. Our thesis is divided into two parts. The first identifies the structural constitution of Buber's political thought from the angle of dialogue as a response to political conflict, since his philosophy tends towards practical orientation and is, in consequence, misunderstood by theorists. The second part situates Buber's philosophy within the tradition of practical philosophy by demonstrating how his line of reasoning encourages genuine listening – as opposed to contemplation – and for this reason it tends to be misunderstood by difference philosophers. Our study shows that Buber's philosophy would have ‘‘the ear’’ replace ‘‘the eye’’: when Buber refers to the Jewish tradition, he asserts that the Jew of antiquity is more of a ‘hearing-man,’ than a ‘seeing-man’. The approach taken is also sensitive to the different elements of context and historical development of Buber’s philosophy. In the end, it becomes clear that Buber should be seen as a political thinker who can be situated within the tradition of practical philosophy.

303	Les régions rurales québécoises face à la décentralisation : une scène politique oubliée	Between urban and rural areas, disparities are increasing in Quebec and elsewhere in the West, with many rural areas even facing devitalization. Rural studies question abundantly the productive forces of the territories but fail to analyze the socio-political issues that determine them. Scholars studying federalism and decentralization focuses mostly on the allocation of state resources according to its jurisdictional components, thus obscuring several local informal dynamics. We thus find ourselves in the face of a process of decentralization that inevitably affects the development capacities of the territories, but without grasping how local authorities appropriate the political spaces liberated by this process of decentralization.  Mobilizing the theory of the commons, this exploratory research proposes an analysis of the rights governing the common resources of the territory of Charlevoix. Based on the notion of situational rationality, it is important to understand how institutionalized social norms condition the collective choices of actors and, in turn, their potential to influence institutions.  Regarding rural development, the structural constraints of collective choices would be 1) an ineffective municipal representative democracy; 2) an ambiguous division of powers resulting from an imprecise definition of local development; 3) a municipal tax system placing the territories in competition, encouraging them to practice fiscal urbanism and encouraging selfish behavior within the local community. This exploratory research fits more broadly into the discussion that seeks to go beyond the socialist / liberalism dichotomy that underlies the debate on the role of the state.	commun , rural , institution , governance , decentralization , territory , common , rural , development , resource , right , welfare state	en	22754.0
304	Du Front national au Rassemblement national : l'évolution du parti à l'aune des théories du marketing politique et du rebranding	"From frowned upon topic to increased visibility, extreme right-wing parties are gaining more and more traction in Western landscapes. In recent years, we observe a true asymmetrical rise of the aforementioned parties in the West as they became unavoidable in electoral contexts. In France, the party dubbed Rassemblement national (RN) - formerly Front National (FN) - is a strinking example. The RN indeed managed to qualify himself for the second round of voting in the 2017 presidential election. Through the lens of political marketing, we examine the evolution of the French party in light of political marketing's theories and the ""rebranding"" at various key moments : the presidential elections of 2007 and 2017, as well as during the ballot regarding the party's name change reform in June 2018. The concepts offered by Lees-Marshment (2014) about the various types of party’s orientation structure our study. Analyses conducted on ""New Labor"" by Gould (1988) and Evans and Norris (1999) also guide our study. Among the main results obtained, it appears that the FN’s rebranding as RN is similar to that of the rebranding of the British Labor Party around its new tag line: the ""New Labor Party"" (NPTB). The results thus demonstrate a repositioning of FN to RN. It indeed started off in 2002 as a product-oriented party with a reaffirmation strategy. In 2017, it shifted its focus on sales with a strategy of de-demonisation – commonly called “dédiabolisation”. In 2018, it finally turns to the market with a strategy of refoundation."

305	Disintegration methods in the optimal transport problem	The present work hopes to illustrate certain techniques that can be applied to certain classes of Optimal Transport problems. Today, the Optimal Trans- port problem has come to be a mathematical formulation of very diverse problems (meteorology, astrophysics, image processing, etc.) Thus, the per- tinence of the methods described is much larger than mathematical problems. In particular, it is shown how certain theorems that are usually approached with combinatorial tools over  nite sets can be extended by measure-theoretic tools to in nite sets. We see that this higher level of abstraction gives rise to more powerful and widely-applicable tools, in very concrete problems.

306	La réponse différentielle à la musicothérapie chez les jeunes hospitalisés en pédopsychiatrie: le rôle prédictif de la réactivité cardiaque sur le changement d'affect	"This project is part of the evaluation of a receptive music therapy intervention implemented in the child psychiatry unit hospital university center Sainte-Justine for young people hospitalized in child psychiatry. A previous study showed that this intervention was associated with a significant affect’s change. We then want to check whether cardiac reactivity is a predictor of a differential emotional response to music therapy sessions for young people hospitalized in child psychiatry. We examined whether a distinct cardiac responsiveness pattern while listening to music was associated with a greater decrease in negatives affects and situational anxiety. 20 participants attended music therapy sessions based on a relaxation technique that supports emotional regulation. The affect’s change was measured immediately before and after the sessions. Cardiac responsiveness was monitored continuously while listening to music during sessions. The results indicate a gradation in the affective response as a function of the patterns of cardiac reactivity that goes in the expected direction. The ""descendant"" profile is associated with a greater improvement of the affect, the ""stable"" profile, with less improvement and the ""upward"" profile, with an even more modest improvement. More than half of the participants showed an increase in their heart rate while listening to music. This high proportion of paradoxical cardiac responses to an intervention aimed at progressive relaxation is discussed from several angles."	music therapy , child psychiatry , emotional regulation , differential response , cardiac reactivity	en	22726.0
307	Le rôle de l'art pour l'amor fati chez Nietzsche	The purpose of this master is to study the conception of amor fati in Nietzsche’s work. The ‘’love of fate’’ is a much more important thought than it seems, it reaches nearly every aspects of Nietzsche’s philosophy, it is therefore a notion that one must understand. Nevertheless, most of the time someone discusses about amor fati, it is used to develop other meaningful ideas linked to it instead of discussing about amor fati in itself. In response to that state of affairs, this work aims to deliver and unfold the elementary notions leading to a fundamental understanding of amor fati, as well as the consequences that follow from there. There will also be an explanation of the strong links that exist between amor fati and arts in Nietzsche’s thought, considering that aesthetics may give the key to amor fati. Therefore, the first part of this work will define amor fati by exploring the basic concepts of affirmation, suffering, and necessity. Then, the second part will discuss the role of art in developing the required tools to get to amor fati.	Amor fati , Nietzsche , Art , Affirmation , Aesthetics	en	22713.0
308	Étude des effets d’un protocole de préadaptation sur la récupération de patients opérés pour une sténose lombaire	Lumbar spinal stenosis, most commonly brought on by degenerative changes affecting the spine structures, causes great disability and severe pain. Spine surgery becomes a prevalent treatment option in the presence of persisting disabling symptoms. This thesis investigates the concept of prehabilitation, defined as the process of augmenting functional capacity before a surgery with the aim to foster faster postoperative recovery. More specifically, the feasibility of conducting a preoperative intervention program aimed to improve the recovery in patients awaiting surgery for lumbar spinal stenosis was assessed. In order to do so, participants were randomly allocated to either a six-week supervised preoperative rehabilitation program or to a control group. The intervention consisted of three 30-minute supervised exercise sessions per week, aiming to improve strength, muscular endurance, and spinal stabilization with intensity and complexity of exercises being increased gradually. High rates of treatment adherence and satisfaction combined with the low rate of attrition and the absence of adverse event confirmed that implementing such an intervention or a larger scale would be feasible. Moreover, the assessment of the intervention preliminary effectiveness showed that prehabilitation can be used to improve both clinical status and physical capacities in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis. However, the significant positive changes seen preoperatively did not translate into faster short-term postoperative recovery. In addition, none of the variables measured at baseline predicted treatment outcome at six-week postoperatively whereas leg pain intensity was the only predictive factors of surgical recovery at three- and six-month postoperatively. Finally, to better reflect the participants’ need, the self-reported condition-specific Swiss Spinal Stenosis Questionnaire was translated into French-Canadian language. Assessment of its psychometric properties revealed to be satisfactory to recommend its use. This new version will help Frenchspeaking clinicians and scientists document changes in condition and treatment satisfaction in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis.

309	Chemosensory perception in blind and sighted populations	Compared to the other senses, research in the chemical senses (trigeminal and olfactory systems) have received far less attention than other modalities such as vision and audition. Even though it is an emerging field, there are still numerous questions left to answer. The main goal of the present thesis was to further our understanding of the impact of various internal factors on chemosensory perception for which the literature remains particularly inconclusive in hopes to advance our comprehension of this modality. To do so, four objectives were established. The first objective (Study 1) was to determine the impact of an internal state (expectancy) on olfactory perception using odor labeling. The second objective (Study 2) was to investigate whether there is a nostril dominance in chemosensory perception and whether it is linked with handedness. Given the importance of visual cues in chemosensory processing, we also set out to investigate the influence of blindness on chemosensory processing. Therefore, the third objective (Study 3) was to determine the impact of blindness on wine odor categorization, a task particularly complex and ecologic. The fourth and final goal of the present thesis (Study 4) was to investigate odor localization in blind individuals, a task that has not yet been explored in this population. In light of the results of our four studies, we further discuss their impacts on our current comprehension of the chemical senses. The results obtained in Study 1 showed that positively labeled odors were systematically rated as being more edible, and this was true even for odors carrying non-food labels. Positively labeled odors were also rated as being more pleasant than negatively labeled ones, which is in line with previous work. Labels also modulated intensity ratings and reaction times, although to a lesser degree. These results highlight that “top-down” mechanisms can influence olfactory perception, and that previous experiences or different interpretations of a labeled odor can alter our perception of it. The results acquired in Study 2 found partial support for the presence of a nostril dominance in right-handed individuals, yet no effect was found for left-handed individuals. The heterogeneity found in these results mirrors the one found in the literature. Methodological differences as well as influences of the nasal cycle could partially explain the heterogeneity in the results. The results from Study 3 displayed worse performance in early-blind individuals compared to sighted controls on a wine odor categorization task. Since early-blind individuals lacked visual input to make visual-olfactory associations, they could have compensated with a stronger verbal-olfactory association. However, since our results show that blind individuals have a worse performance in wine odor categorization, this suggests that they are penalized for their lack of visual input, and any verbal-olfactory compensation is not enough to match the visual-olfactory association. Put differently; it seems that blind individuals lack mental imagery abilities which are important when undertaking this type of task. Finally, in Study 4, results show that congenitally-blind individuals outperform late-blind individuals as well as sighted controls on an odor localization task. This finding provides support for the idea that congenitally-blind individuals rely more on their chemosensory perception to navigate throughout their environment, by retrieving spatial information from the surrounding odors.	olfaction , odorat , trigeminal , odors , chemosensory perception , blindness , congenitally-blind , early-blind , late-blind , odor-labelling , nostril advantage	en	22693.0
310	Cell wall mediated regulation of plant cell morphogenesis : pectin esterification and cellulose crystallinity	Cellular morphogenesis is a fundamental underpinning of development. All cells in the plant kingdom are surrounded by walls that govern shape formation. This extracellular matrix is composed mainly of polysaccharides. How these polysaccharides are modified during cellular development to regulate cell expansion, and thus cell shape, must be understood to link form with function. In plants, the mechanical aspect of cell expansion is known to be mainly influenced by cellulose, the most abundant biopolymer on Earth. Because cellulose microfibrils exhibit a strong tensile strength along their long axis, they may be used to control the expansion process by conferring mechanical properties to the cell wall material that determine the directionality and the magnitude of expansive growth at subcellular level. Another wall polymer that may influence cell expansion is homogalacturonan pectin, the most abundant type of pectin in the primary wall. The spatial distribution and esterification status of homogalacturonan pectin may affect the mechanical aspects of the wall and, therefore, the expansion pattern. I used a genetic approach combined with novel biochemical, biomechanical and imaging strategies to study the impact of the spatio-temporal dynamics of cellulose and homogalacturonan pectin during cell expansion and shape formation. I investigated cell shape formation in two differently shaped types of epidermal cells: those of the cotyledon and of the hypocotyl of Arabidopsis thaliana. I show that undulation formation in pavement cells of the cotyledon requires spatial and temporal changes of cellulose microfibrils and demethyl-esterified pectin. These changes regulate the mechanical stiffness of the periclinal wall at two different stages: lobe initiation and subsequent expansion. Lobe initiation involves an increase in the stiffness of the periclinal wall at the prospective neck region of the undulation through a local accumulation of demethyl-esterified pectin. The subsequent expansion is controlled by the degree of cellulose crystallinity and the perpendicular alignment of the microfibrils at the tangent of the neck side of the undulation at the periclinal wall. During the elongation process and the anisotropic expansion of the epidermal hypocotyl cells, cellulose and homogalacturonan pectin make distinct contributions in each developmental phase of the elongation. During the first developmental phase, reduction in the proportion of demethyl-esterified pectin decreases the wall stiffness and accelerates the elongation. A reduction in the cellulose crystallinity decreases the elongation of the hypocotyl at the second developmental phase. It may be concluded from the two cell systems that cellulose, contrary to a long-established hypothesis, may not be essential for the initiation of morphogenetic events and their function may be reassigned to the feedback-mediated augmentation of cell shaping processes. Moreover, stress-induced shape formation plays a key role during the initiating steps and it is likely to be dominated by the degree of pectin esterification.

311	Searching for dark matter with superheated liquid detectors	One of the most prominent questions in the fields of particle physics and cosmology is the nature of dark matter which comprises 85% of the total mass of the universe. The PICASSO and PICO experiments are both direct detection experiments situated at SNOLAB that use the superheated liquid or bubble chamber technique to search for dark matter. The PICASSO collaboration pioneered the use of this technique for dark matter searches, and moreover, discovered an important background suppression feature: the acoustic alpha-neutron discrimination. The last PICASSO result was published in 2017 and still holds to this day the best spin-dependent cross-section limit of 7 x 10-2 pb (90% C.L.) for weakly interacting dark matter candidates (WIMPs) with a mass of 4 GeV/c2 [1]. Since the merger of PICASSO and COUPP into PICO, PICO holds the world best limit on WIMP cross sections with the most stringent spin-dependent limit of 2.5 x 10-5 pb (90% C.L) at 25 GeV/c2 set by the recent PICO60 detector result [2]. The PICO collaboration is currently building a new detector called PICO40L with a significantly improved design which will allow to substantially decrease the neutron background by a factor of  50, and pave the way forward for the next stage, PICO500, which will contain approximately 500L of superheated liquid. The present work presents first the observational and theoretical framework of dark matter searches, i.e., its proof of existence (Chap. 2), the most probable particle candidates (Chap. 3), as well as its expected recoil spectra and count rates in typical dark matter detectors (Chap. 4). It will be followed by a description of the superheated liquid technique (Chap. 5), by the description of the PICASSO and PICO detectors (Chap. 6 & 7), of their calibrations and common backgrounds (Chap. 8). In Chap. 9 & 10, the final PICASSO result are presented together with the most recent PICO dark matter limits. A GEANT4 simulation of the PICO40L neutron background will then be described in detail (Chap. 11), along with a discussion of the physic reach of PICO within the context of the effective field theory description of dark matter (Chap. 12). Finally, this thesis concludes with the current and future research and development program of the PICO collaboration, such as the future PICO500 detector, and the exciting possibility of using C2H2F4 as an active target (Chap. 13).

312	Recherche de compagnons de type Jupiter à très grandes séparations autour d’étoiles jeunes dans le voisinage solaire	The main goal of this PhD thesis is to search for exoplanets on wide orbits around young stars using the direct-imaging technique. These exoplanets are of high interest for several reasons. Firstly, as they are far from their host star, they can be studied as if they were isolated objects without the need for sophisticated imaging and data analysis techniques. In some cases, a high resolution spectrum can be acquired to learn more about them. Also, contrary to isolated objects of similar masses, their age and distance can be easily inferred from those of their host star. It is thus interesting to probe around stars for which those characteristics are well known, as they are crucial to infer the masses of exoplanets. As a first step, the results from a search for giant planets on wide orbits are described. A sample of 177 stars member of known young associations inside 70 pc of the Sun were observed using the Canada-France-Hawaii telescope, the Gemini-Sud observatory and the space telescope Spitzer. The observations reached a good completeness down to masses as low as 2 MJup at separations between 1000 and 5000 AU. Four candidate planets were detected, but they were identified as background objects using follow-up observations. A frequency of planets per star was inferred from the survey, such that less than 3% of the stars have at least one planet with masses 1–13MJup at separations of 1000–5000 AU, with a 95% confidence level.  The next step was to combine several archival direct-imaging surveys to the study presented above. A sample of 344 unique stars all confirmed members of young associations was obtained. A Bayesian and Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis was realised to constrain the frequency of companions as well as the distribution of giant planets with masses between 1 and 20 MJup at separations 5-5000 AU. It was inferred from this analysis that 2.17+6.85−1.40%, 0.3+2.6 −0.1%, and 2.61+6.97−1.00% of stars have at least a planet of mass 1-20MJup at separations of 20–1000 AU, 1000–5000 AU and 20–5000 AU, respectively. Furthermore, assuming that the mass and orbital distribution of giant planets follows a power-law such as d2n ∝ fM^αa^βdMda, the parameters can be constrained to α = −0.08+0.75−0.63 and β = −1.41+0.22−0.24, with a 68% confidence level, with a corresponding planetary fraction per stars f = 0.12+0.11−0.06. A dependency over the mass of the host star was then added to the distribution such as d2n ∝ M^αa^β(M⋆/M⊙)^γdMda. In this case, α = −0.18+0.77−0.65, β = −1.43+0.23−0.24, γ = 0.62+0.56−0.50 and f = 0.11+0.11−0.05, with a 68% confidence level.	Brown dwarf , Exoplanet , Young star , Imaging	en	22670.0
313	On abstraction in a Carnapian system	Rudolf Carnap (1891-1970) rejects two philosophical distinctions that have been made and admitted by Gottlob Frege (1848-1925), namely the object-concept and the sense-reference distinctions. In the analytic tradition and upon these distinctions, a family of analytic systems have been constructed and developed (which we call Fregean systems), within which a number of notions have been employed including the notion of abstraction. It has been claimed (by Neo- Fregeans) that the Fregean notion of abstraction has been captured by what is commonly known as the “principle of abstraction”. The goal of this dissertation is to present the notion of Carnapian abstraction, in particular, and the Carnapian system, in general, in distinction to the Fregean counterparts. We will argue that the admission and rejection of these distinctions will entail fundamentally different analytic systems. Hence, we will show how each system undertakes a different notion of abstraction. Abstraction in a Fregean system will be characterized as a mind-independent process subject to its own rules, whereas in a Carnapian system, abstraction will be characterized as a defined process of distancing from meaning in a linguistic framework. We will conclude that the Carnapian system has advantages over the Fregean one (among which is its simplicity), and that its technical aspect is yet to be developed.

314	Route choice and traffic equilibrium modeling in multi-modal and activity-based networks	Traveling is an essential part of daily life, whether to attend work, perform social activities, or go shopping among others. We benefit from an increasing range of available transportation services to choose from, which supports economic growth and contributes to our quality of life. Yet the growing demand for travel, combined with urban sprawl and increasing vehicle ownership rates, is also responsible for major local and global externalities, such as degradation of the environment, congestion and noise. In order to mitigate the negative impacts of traveling while weighting benefits to users, transportation planners seek to design policies and improve infrastructure with the best possible outcome for society as a whole. Taking effective actions requires to evaluate the impact of various measures, which necessitates first to understand and predict travel behavior, i.e., how, when and by which route individuals decide to travel.   With this background in mind, this thesis has the objective of developing and applying models to predict flows of persons and/or vehicles in multi-modal transportation networks. It is desirable that such models be data-driven, produce accurate predictions, and be applicable to real networks. In practice, the problem of flow prediction is addressed in two separate steps, and this thesis is concerned with both. The first, route choice analysis, is the problem of identifying the path a traveler would take in a network. This is achieved by estimating from data a parametrized cost function representing travelers' behavior. The second step, namely traffic assignment, aims at distributing all travelers on the network's paths in order to find an equilibrium state, such that no traveler has an interest in changing itinerary. The challenge lies in taking into account the effect of generated congestion, which depends on travelers' route choices while simultaneously impacting their cost of traveling.  This thesis is composed of four articles submitted to international journals and an additional chapter. In all the articles of the thesis, we model an individual's choice of path as a sequence of link choices, using so-called recursive route choice models. This methodology is a state-of-the-art framework which is known to possess the advantage of unbiased parameter estimates and fast assignment procedures, by avoiding to generate choice sets of paths. However, it poses the additional challenge of requiring one to solve embedded dynamic programming problems, and is hence not widely used in the transportation community. This thesis addresses practical and theoretical challenges related to applying this methodological framework to real multi-modal networks. The strength of this thesis consists in large-scale applications which bear computational challenges, as well as some methodological contributions to this modeling framework.   The first article in this thesis is a tutorial on predicting and analyzing path choice behavior using recursive route choice models. The contribution of this article is to familiarize researchers with this methodology, to give intuition on the model properties, to illustrate its advantages through examples, and finally to position this modeling framework within a broader context, by establishing links with recently published work in the inverse optimization and machine learning fields.   Two articles and an additional chapter can be categorized as applications of the methodology to estimate parameters of travel demand models in several large, real, and/or multi-dimensional networks. These applications go beyond previous studies on small physical road networks. First, we estimate recursive models for the route choice of cyclists and we demonstrate some advantages of the recursive models in the context of prediction. We also provide an application to a time-expanded public transportation networks with several modes. Then, we consider a broader travel demand problem, in which decisions regarding daily trips and participation in activities are made jointly. The latter is also modeled with recursive route choice models by considering sequences of activity, destination and mode choices as paths in a so-called supernetwork.   Finally, the subject of the last article in this thesis is traffic assignment. More precisely, we address the problem of computing a traffic equilibrium in networks with strictly limited link capacities, such as public transport networks. This article provides important methodological contributions. We propose a strategic Markovian traffic equilibrium model which assigns flows to networks without exceeding link capacities while realistically modeling how the risk of not being able to access an arc affects route choice behavior.

315	Feature extraction on faces : from landmark localization to depth estimation	This thesis focuses on learning algorithms that extract important features from faces. The features of main interest are landmarks; the two dimensional (2D) or three dimensional (3D) locations of important facial features such as eye centers, nose tip, and mouth corners. Landmarks are used to solve complex tasks that cannot be solved directly or require guidance for enhanced performance, such as pose or gesture recognition, tracking, or face verification. The application of the models presented in this thesis is on facial images; however, the algorithms proposed are more general and can be applied to the landmarks of other forms of objects, such as hands, full body or man-made objects. This thesis is written by article and explores different techniques to solve various aspects of landmark localization.   In the first article, we disentangle identity and expression of a given face to learn a prior distribution over the joint set of landmarks. This prior is then merged with a discriminative classifier that learns an independent probability distribution per landmark. The merged model is capable of explaining differences in expressions for the same identity representation.  In the second article, we propose an architecture that aims at uncovering image features to do tasks that require high pixel-level accuracy, such as landmark localization or image segmentation.  The proposed architecture gradually extracts coarser features in its encoding steps to get more global information over the image and then it expands the coarse features back to the image resolution by recombining the features of the encoding path. The model, termed Recombinator Networks, obtained state-of-the-art on several datasets, while also speeding up training.  In the third article, we aim at improving landmark localization when only a few images with labelled landmarks are available. In particular, we leverage a weaker form of data labels that are easier to acquire or more abundantly available such as emotion or head pose. To do so, we propose an architecture to backpropagate gradients of the weaker labels through landmarks, effectively training the landmark localization network. We also propose an unsupervised loss component which makes equivariant landmark predictions with respect to transformations applied to the image without having ground truth landmark labels. These techniques improved performance considerably when we have a low percentage of labelled images with landmarks.  Finally, in the last article, we propose a learning algorithm to estimate the depth of the landmarks without any depth supervision. We do so by matching landmarks of two faces through transforming one to another. This transformation requires estimation of depth on one face and an affine transformation that maps the first face to the second one. Our formulation, which only requires depth estimation and affine parameters, can be estimated as a closed form solution of the 2D landmarks and the estimated depth. Even without direct depth supervision, the proposed technique extracts reasonable depth values that differ from the ground truth depth values by a scale and a shift. We demonstrate applications of the estimated depth in face rotation and face replacement tasks.

316	Médiation procréative et maternités assistées : vers une approche relationnelle et pragmatique de la gestation pour autrui et du don d’ovules au Canada	CONTEXT. Although the different components of maternity and motherhood coincide and are embodied in one woman in the vast majority of cases, surrogacy and egg donation disrupt this unified vision of “the” mother, calling for up to three women in an unprecedented birthing triad: an intended mother, a surrogate and an egg donor. The thesis aims to better understand how these women relate to maternity, in a context where their voice is hidden from the debate surrounding the regulation of these practices. Three objectives guide the research process: 1) to understand how women perceive their respective contributions in the parental project; 2) to identify the strategies deployed by these women to appropriate or distance themselves from maternity, as well as the personal, social and normative factors that promote or inhibit their emergence and 3) to highlight the relational dynamics of the birthing process.  CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK. The three components of assisted maternity (intention, genetics and gestation) constitute the base of a conceptual framework built to feed the analysis, to which are added three axes of social structuring. The first component refers to the formulation of the parental project of origin and the care of the child after birth, the second refers to the gamete and the transmission of genes, while the third symbolizes pregnancy and childbirth. The kinship norms of western culture and the pressures exerted by the institution of motherhood influence the definition and management of relationships by raising several concerns, including the quest for the “real” mother as a unique and exclusive figure, and the idealized image of the “good” mother with valued female qualities. Reproductive stratification reveals the power relations that are based on the hierarchy of social positions occupied by the women concerned.  METHODS. Constructivist grounded theory methodology has been retained for the research. Qualitative data were collected in two waves of recruitment with a theoretical sampling aim, in order to favor the emergence of conceptual categories through abductive reasoning. Forty-five individual and semi-structured interviews were conducted in Canada with thirty-eight participants (n = 38), including thirteen intended mothers, fifteen surrogates, and ten egg donors. The interviews were transcribed and coded according to a continuous process of theorization.  RESULTS. The birthing process is a relationship that is built through four movements: engaging, negotiating, putting into practice, and telling. The first movement (engaging) evokes the trajectories of the women who converge toward a common project. The trajectory of sterile or infertile women is motivated by the desire to access maternity or to allow their spouse to become a father, while that of surrogates and egg donors is derived from a mosaic of motives. Their depictions of what “makes” or “doesn’t make” a mother influence the discursive logic of women and subsequently guide their behavior and practices.    The second movement (negotiating) represents the meeting point between the intended mothers and third-party reproducers in one of the three channels of access to assisted human reproduction: family and friends, private intermediaries or social media networks. Women navigate through the normative frameworks of law, medicine and the state, each generating regulations that taint the outcome of negotiations and inhibit their ability to make informed decisions.  The third movement (putting into practice) correspond to the practice of surrogacy and egg donation. On the one hand, the women involved ritualize pregnancy and childbirth to cope with the current legal uncertainty regarding surrogacy. On the other hand, the egg donation corresponds to a “relay” body experience which causes the permutation of the female gamete into embodied maternity: the preparation and the extraction of the eggs from the donor’s body, then the implantation of the embryo and gestation of the fetus in that of the recipient.  The fourth movement (telling) testifies the narrative of the origins, where each protagonist finds its place in the history of the family’s genesis. This narrative construction is rooted in three conceptions of assisted maternities (exclusive maternity, sequential maternities, and honorary maternity), which guide the announcement to the child of the circumstances surrounding his/her conception, as well as the type of bonds established between all the individuals involved, including life partners, children and grandparents.  IMPACTS. Bringing together the four movements of the birthing process into an integrative model, “reproductive mediation” is a measure that rests on four theoretical foundations. First, it involves a division into sequences, which structure the birthing process over time and events. Secondly, it corresponds to a proximity approach, since the process takes place in Canada and is characterized by similarity, not distance and difference. This particularity allows women to create a relational framework that consolidates the assisted reproduction agreement. Nevertheless, between the contractualization of relations and the medicalization of childbirth, reproductive mediation is at a crossroads of regulations that hinders one’s ability to consent. Finally, the plurality of women’s experiences shows tensions between their desire to conform to family and gender norms to escape stigmatization, but also their willingness to resist and change these same norms, thus making their marginalized paths a part of an acknowledged and respected family diversity.

317	Education as a moderator of the relationship between episodic memory and amyloid load in normal aging	The current study explored whether education, a proxy of cognitive reserve, modifies the association between episodic memory (EM) performance and βeta-amyloid load (Aβ), a biomarker of Alzheimer’s disease, in a cohort of cognitively normal older adults. One hundred and four participants (mean age 73.3 years) evenly spread out in three bands of education were recruited. Participants underwent neuropsychological assessment, structural MRI as well as PET imaging to quantify Aβ load. Moderation analyses and the Johnson–Neyman technique were carried out to examine the interaction of education with Aβ load to predict EM performance. Linear regressions were then performed within each group of education to better illustrate the interaction effect (all analyses were controlled for age and sex). The interaction between education and Aβ load was significant (p < .05) for years of education, reaching a cutoff point of 13.5 years, above which the relationship between Aβ load and EM was no longer significant. Similarly, significant associations were found between Aβ and EM among participants with secondary (p < .01) and preuniversity education (p < .01), but not with a university degree (p = .253). EM performance is associated with Aβ load in cognitively normal older individuals, and this relationship is moderated by educational attainment.

318	Dégénérescence locale et réparation anormale de la jonction neuromusculaire dans un modèle de la sclérose latérale amyotrophique	Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an aggressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by the loss of upper and lower motor neurons, and of their connections to muscle cells, the neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). In the last century, a plethora of novel genetic causes of ALS were identified and were associated with numerous mechanisms of cellular toxicity. Notably, it is now well appreciated that motor neurons do not degenerate by themselves and that glial cells contribute to numerous aspects of ALS pathogenesis. Nevertheless, no consensus has been reached on the origin of the selective degeneration of these neurons.  Multiple recent studies identified local alterations at the level of NMJs, including notably a dysfunction of the glial cells at this synapse, the perisynaptic Schwann cells (PSCs). These alterations suggest that an early destabilization of NMJs could contribute to ALS. Nevertheless, the sequence of events leading to NMJ loss in ALS is ill-defined. Notably, whether the loss of NMJs is caused by the selective degeneration of a subpopulation of motor neurons or by the local degeneration of individual axonal branches remains a controversial question. This distinction is of great importance as the mechanisms underlying these two events potentially differ greatly. Furthermore, the extent and efficiency of compensatory events remain uncertain, even though ample elements suggesting that some motor neurons attempt to compensate for the loss of NMJs.  Hence, the goal of this thesis was first to characterize the degenerative and compensatory events taking place within the axonal arborization of individual motor neurons during disease progression in a classical model of ALS, the SOD1G37R mice. Through the repeated in vivo imaging of individual axonal arborization, we show that some axonal branches progressively retract from their NMJs while others are maintained for several weeks before global axonal degeneration. This asynchronous dismantlement of axon terminals is accompanied by the formation new axonal branches, reestablishing synaptic connections with NMJs which were not initially innervated by this motor neuron. Interestingly, we show that these compensatory events were much more frequent in females, but were associated with a slightly faster disease progression, suggesting that excessive compensation could be deleterious. Moreover, we show that, despite the presence of some types of compensatory events (axonal sprouting), other types of compensatory events seemed absent or inefficient (terminal sprouting), suggesting that mechanisms regulating NMJ repair are altered in ALS. Hence, we next wanted to investigate one of the mechanisms which could contribute to NMJ instability and repair abnormalities, namely the dysfunction of PSCs. Specifically, we evaluated if the alteration of PSC properties affected their capacity to promote NMJ repair and contributed to the deficits observed in vivo. We identified that PSCs failed to adapt their phenotype upon the dismantling of NMJs. Notably, we show that PSCs did not upregulate their expression of Galectin-3, a factor associated with glial phagocytosis of axonal debris. Importantly, this incapacity of PSCs to promote reinnervation reflected the selective vulnerability of different types of NMJs in ALS, suggesting that PSCs could be one of the factors contributing to this vulnerability gradient.  Altogether, these studies show that the inital loss of NMJs in SOD1 mice is caused by the local dismantlement of individual axonal branches. This phenomenon is accompanied by a maladapted response of PSCs which potentially contributes to NMJ repair deficits in ALS. These evidence strongly suggest that local mechanisms, at the level of axon terminals and their neighboring cells, lead to NMJ loss in ALS. Therapies aimed at stabilizing NMJs could thus benefit ALS patients by improving their motor function.

319	LOX and LOX-Like Proteins as Potential Therapeutic Target for Atrial Fibrillation	Lysyl oxidase (LOX) and LOX-like (LOXL-1, 2, 3 and 4) proteins have a crucial role in extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling in several types of heart disease, such as heart failure (HF) and fibrosis. The main objective of this thesis was to address the matrix-dependent and matrix-independent functions of LOX and LOXL proteins in signal transduction, leading to atrial fibrosis and atrial fibrillation (AF). We noted upregulation of LOX and LOXL-1 in tissues, LOX and LOXL-2 in fibroblasts and LOX, LOXL-1, LOXL-3 and LOXL-4 in myocytes of the canine left atrium (LA) in congestive heart failure (CHF). Based on these findings, we studied the roles of LOX isoforms as upstream targets in the signaling pathways of LA fibrosis and AF in a rat model following myocardial infarction (MI). Additionally, we explored the physiological roles of LOX and LOXL proteins in matrix-dependent and matrix-independent functions of cardiac fibroblasts and myocytes through angiotensin II (Ang II) treatment and siRNA-mediated knockdown of LOX isoforms in canine and neonatal rat cells. Upregulation of the mRNA expression of LOX and LOXL was accompanied by an increase in mRNA expression of COL 1A1, FN 1, TGF-β1, CTGF, periostin, α-SMA and MMP-2 in the infarcted area of the left ventricle (LV). mRNA expression of LOXL-1, LOXL-3, COL 1A1, TGF-β1 and periostin were significantly increased in the LA post-MI. Administration of β-aminopropionitrile (BAPN) post-MI significantly reduced the mRNA expression of LOXL-1, LOXL-2 and LOXL-3 along with a decrease in the mRNA expression of several profibrotic markers in the LA without significant changes to those in the LV. Moreover, the administration of BAPN post-MI reduced LA fibrosis and the collagen cross-linking ratio without significantly changing those in the LV. BAPN administration post-MI reduced the adverse structural and functional remodeling of LA without significantly changing those in the LV. Furthermore, MI caused an increase in the P-wave duration, AF duration and AF inducibility, while the values of those parameters were significantly reduced upon BAPN administration post-MI. The protein expression of secreted LOX and LOXL-2 were increased in cultured neonatal rat ventricular fibroblasts and myocytes along with an increase in the collagen cross-linking ratio in fibroblasts upon treatment with Ang II. The secretion of LOX and LOXL-2 from cardiac fibroblasts and myocytes may contribute to ECM remodeling. Moreover, the contractility of canine LA myocytes was enhanced upon knockdown of LOX or LOXL-1 along with slight changes in Ca2+ transients. Upon knockdown of LOXL-3 in fibroblasts, LOXL-2, LOXL-3 and LOXL-4 mRNA expression levels were reduced along with reduced proliferation and mRNA expression of COL 1A1, COL 3A1 and CCNE 2. The results showed that LOXL-2, LOXL-3 and LOXL-4 may promote fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis. LOXL-4 knockdown increased the mRNA expression of the BAX/BCL-2 ratio, suggesting that LOXL-4 may protect against apoptosis in cardiac fibroblasts and myocytes. In conclusion, LOX and LOXL proteins are prominent mediators of LA fibrosis and AF post-MI. Additionally, these findings suggested that LOX and LOXL proteins are implicated in the regulation of various aspects of cardiac fibroblast and myocyte functions.

320	The role of ThPOK and T cell receptor signaling in CD4+ versus CD8+ T-cell lineage fate	T lymphocytes are at the core of the adaptive immune system and their dysfunction is associated with several disorders and pathologies, which are at times fatal. The two main types of T-cells in mice and man are: the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class-II-restricted CD4+ helper T-cells, and the MHC-I-restricted CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells. Developmental stages of the two types of T-cells occurs in the thymus in multiple sequential maturation stages that are identified by cell-surface CD4+/CD8+ co-receptor expression. Differentiation of the two types of T-cells in the thymus from a common precursor is influenced by the intensity and duration of signals derived from the T-cell receptor (TCR) and cytokines secreted by the thymic stromal cells. These signals lead to the activation of ThPOK or Runx/CBF transcription factors, which control the transcriptional network regulating CD4+ and CD8+ lineage fate, respectively. Studies have demonstrated that ThPOK is both necessary and sufficient for CD4+ T-cell development as gain- and loss-of-ThPOK function redirects positively selected MHC-I- and MHC-II-restricted thymocytes into CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell lineage fate, respectively. However, the role of TCR signaling and the extent to which ThPOK expression influences CD4+ lineage choice remains to be investigated. My thesis aims to elucidate the fundamental basis the CD4+/CD8+ lineage choice by exploring the molecular mechanism of action of ThPOK and TCR signaling in CD4+ lineage fate of MHC-I- and MHC-II-specific thymocytes. In this study, we have characterized gain-of-function of ThPOK in three independent transgenic mouse lines expressing varying amounts of ThPOK. Extensive analysis of the three ThPOK transgenic lines expressing MHC-I- and MHC-II-specific monoclonal TCR indicated that MHC-I-restricted, compared to MHC-II-restricted, thymocytes required significantly more ThPOK for efficient differentiation into the CD4+ lineage. Interestingly, the founder line with the lowest transgene expression, despite expressing significantly higher amounts of ThPOK compared to the endogenous levels in WT CD4+ T cells, induced a partial CD8+ to CD4+ redirection of MHC-I-restricted cells, leading to the generation of mature CD4+, DN and CD8+ T-cells in the same mouse. Lineage specific gene expression analysis, specifically in DN mature T cells from ThPOK transgenic mice expressing MHC-I-specific TCR, showed that, compared to induction of helper program, suppression of cytotoxic program required lower amount of ThPOK. Further investigation showed that TCR signal strength and MHC specificity of 4 developing thymocytes played a critical role in determining ThPOK-induced CD4+ lineage fate. While increase in TCR signal strength augmented the efficiency of ThPOK-induced CD4+ lineage choice of MHC-I-restricted thymocytes in part via endogenous ThPOK induction, it appeared to have ThPOK independent function as well as judged by significantly different CD4+ T-cell frequencies in OTI mice expressing the same amount of ThPOK but transduced quantitatively different TCR signal. Importantly, the efficiency of CD4+ lineage choice of MHC-I-specific thymocytes with augmented TCR signal strength was still significantly lower compared to the efficiency of CD4+ lineage choice of MHC-II-restricted thymocytes expressing only the transgene-encoded ThPOK suggesting a qualitative role for TCR signaling as well in CD4+ lineage choice. We then evaluated CD4+ lineage fate decision in the absence of ThPOK induction in physiologically relevant alteration in TCR signaling versus loss of ThPOK function. While we observed CD4+ to CD8+ lineage redirection of MHC-II-specific thymocytes due to Thpok-deficiency as well as lack of ThPOK induction due to disruption of TCR signaling, the two modes of lineage redirection appeared to be due to different mechanisms. Our investigation demonstrates that TCR signaling in MHC-II-restricted thymocytes induces the expression of select genes in loss-of-function of ThPOK model suggesting potential role for these genes in establishing the CD4+ helper program. These results also suggest that the contribution of MHC-II-specific TCR signaling in driving CD4+ lineage choice is not limited to Thpok induction. Interestingly, only a limited synergistic effect was observed when both Gata3, which is also induced in MHC-II-signaled thymocytes, and ThPOK were overexpressed in MHC-I-restricted thymocytes suggesting a limited functional overlap between the two transcription factors. Collectively, these data indicate that ThPOK and TCR signaling work synergistically to promote the development of CD4+ T-cells with some ThPOK independent function for TCR signaling.

321	Un modèle du processus de préparation à la perte d’un conjoint : une théorisation ancrée constructiviste auprès de conjointes de personnes vivant avec un cancer	Over the course of a disease, many changes are experienced by an ill person and their family. More specifically, between the end of curative treatments and the eventual death of a patient, relatives are confronted with the inevitable reality of the loss of their loved one. This experience prior to death consists of individual and social dimensions, such as gender and the relationship to the ill person. This study was interested in the preparation process of women whose spouses live with cancer. The purpose of this study was to propose a model of the process of preparation for the loss of a spouse living with cancer, focusing on the period between the diagnosis and death. A radical constructivism epistemology and a constructivist approach to grounded theory guided this study. In addition, a modelization process was added to the analysis steps to meet the purpose of the research. In total, 11 in-depth interviews were conducted with women who self-identified as the spouse of a patient living with cancer. These spouses were approached by the healthcare professionals from ten (10) organizations in the Montréal metropolitan area and then invited to participate in the research by the student-researcher. Intentional and theoretical sampling strategies were used to construct the research sample and to refine the student-researcher’s interpretation. In addition to the interview, a sociodemographic questionnaire and a logbook were used to collect relevant data for the creation of a detailed description of the participants, as well as of the research process. The present study was both developed and carried out taking into account several ethical considerations in order to ensure the respect of traditional ethical principles (consent and confidentiality), but also to ensure the well-being of the participants during the interview and in the next days. The proposed model represents the preparation for the loss of a spouse as a dynamic process of redefinition of the individual identity of the women in the interval between the diagnosis and the death of the partner. More specifically, the process of preparation for the loss is directed by the changes experienced and observed in the partner’s illness and end-of-life trajectory. Every change, such as increased pain or changes to the relationship with the partner, is meaningful to the spouse. Indeed, these changes represent the deterioration of the partner’s health as well as the imminence of his death, which call into question the individual identity of the spouse. This questioning engages the spouses in a process of identity redefinition including social role negotiation processes and processes of redefinition of the meaning of their identity. Social role negotiation processes led spouses to develop strategies, such as lifestyle changes, to account for changes in their caregiving and conjugal roles in the context of the deterioration of their partner’s health. The processes of redefining the meaning of their identity include the creation of mental scenarios, axiological questions, and identity reflections that together enable the spouse to make a judgment about the meaning of life, death and their own identity. The model of the process of preparation for the loss of a spouse therefore represents how, with each change in the illness and end-of-life trajectory, the spouses engage, recursively, in processes leading them to redefine their individual identity.  The model proposed as part of this doctoral research project provides a better understanding of the complex, dynamic, and situated process of preparation for the loss of a spouse that could be lived by a spouse during the period leading up to the death of a partner, by highlighting the relational and identity dimensions of this preparation. Further research will be required in order to ensure the model’s viability in other contexts as well as with different populations which were not included in this study. For example, it would be interesting to see whether the model is viable with women who care for their spouse at the same time as for their children. Nonetheless, the thesis concludes with a set of recommendations in the areas of policy, organization and management of health care and social services, clinical practice, professional training, and research, based on the results of the study as well as the recognition of the spouses’ experience.

322	La fabrique de l’évaluation à l’aune d’une perspective resocialisante : une négociation entre enseignants et étudiants au premier cycle universitaire	In recent decades, universities are influenced in their operation by several phenomena, including standardization and rationalization of higher education, driving respectively a new conception of the relationship between students and academic teachers (Trow, 2011), and a management of universities including evaluation as a centerpiece in their regulation (Lessard, 2014). At the same time, research on the problem of evaluations in the University context highlighted the conflictual dimension of assessment, recognized as an object of issues and multiple tensions (ADMEE, 2014). My central hypothesis argues that, on various plans, the assessment shapes the relationship between students and university teachers, including the negotiation of work activities; Hence the need to link this evaluation to the interests, projects and networks in which they participate (Morrissette, 2009). Leaning in an interactionist perspective that apprehends in its procedural dimensions and transactional evaluation among stakeholders, this thesis highlights how these crosscutting evaluations at activities negotiated continuous (Strauss, 1992) shape the relations between students and university teachers in undergraduate. For this do, 11 observations in four classes, 14 interviews with 4 teachers and 6 students, and 3 focus groups with students were taken in a Faculty of education of a Montreal University. The data collected are analyzed according to the method of reasoning from case (Becker, 2016). Taking as angle of analysis the point of view of the actors, I first show how the compromises they negotiate around these activities are built from a look focused on the anticipated consequences of an unnamed object, the assessment. This light is then used to interrogate the « making of evaluation », as it is produced by agreements negotiated and reinterpreted that support students and university teachers.

323	Physical activity levels in individuals after stroke	The increase of physical activity levels, defined as any voluntary bodily movement that requires energy expenditure, might improve function and health in individuals after stroke. The general objective of this thesis was to analyze the current level of evidence about interventions to increase physical activity level after stroke and to develop an experimental study that could provide evidence that could help clinical practice. The first study had the objective to describe a protocol for the development of a systematic review (PROSPERO 2016: CRD42016037750) about the effects of interventions on physical activity levels after stroke. The objective of second study was to develop a systematic review of randomized controlled trials that examined which interventions have been employed for increasing physical activity levels after stroke. Eighteen studies were included (good PEDro and very low GRADE-scores). In seven studies, the experimental groups (aerobics, resistance, and home-based training; counseling, aerobics, resistance, and home-based training; electrical stimulation; functional-task training; robot-assisted therapy; accelerometer-based feedback, and physical activity encouragement) showed significant increases in physical activity. However, the small number of studies and the heterogeneity in the interventions, outcome measures, and results limit the conclusions. The third study had the objective to describe the protocol of a randomized controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02798237) aimed to investigate if aerobic training is effective on improving physical activity levels and time spent in low-energy expenditure activities after stroke. The fourth study, a randomized controlled trial, aimed to investigate if aerobic training would improve physical activity levels and time spent in low-energy expenditure activities (primary outcomes), and cardiorespiratory fitness, depression, endurance, mobility, participation and quality of life (secondary outcomes) after stroke. Twenty-two community-dwelling adults with chronic stroke were randomized in two groups. The experimental group performed aerobic treadmill training at 60-80% of their heart rate reserve. The control group performed overground walking below 40% of heart rate reserve. Both groups received 40 minutes of intervention three days per week over 12-weeks. There were no significant changes on physical activity levels and time spent in low-energy expenditure activities. Compared to the controls, the experimental group showed increased quality of life (13 points; 95%CI: 3.5 to 23 points). Both groups improved depression (2.2 points; 95%CI: 0.01 to 4.3 points), endurance (31-55 m; 95%CI: 3.8 to 107 m), and mobility (0.12 m/s; 95%CI: 0.02 to 0.2 m/s). There were no other significant changes. The results of this thesis showed that the limited evidence currently available is insufficient to make a recommendation about interventions to increase physical activity levels of individuals after stroke. Further studies are needed to clarify the benefits of aerobic training on physical activity and time spent in low-energy expenditure activities.

324	Développement de seuils toxicologiques et prédiction de doses internes pour l’exposition professionnelle aux substances organiques à partir de leurs structures moléculaires	Occupational Exposure Limits (OELs) are valuable tools for workers’ health risk characterization and protection. However, in workplace, many substances do not have OELs. The main objective of this research project was to develop tools and predictive pharmacokinetic models, using molecular structure information, for occupational risk assessment and characterization of data-poor organic chemicals. Thus, three specific objectives were pursued as follows: i) derive occupational thresholds of toxicological concern (OTTCs) based on absorbed dose; ii) develop a quantitative property-property relationship (QPPR)-based human physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling framework for high-throughput predictions of inhalation toxicokinetics, including the internal dose (ID), of organic chemicals; and finally, iii) derive ID-based OTTCs as well as quantitative models for predicting screening-level limit values for occupational exposure in data-poor situations. First, a dataset of 280 organic chemicals consisting of data on OEL as well as physicochemical and toxicologic parameters (i.e., partition coefficients (P), Cramer class of toxicity [low (class I), intermediate (class II) and high (class III)]) was compiled. Second, the dose absorbed in workers was predicted for each chemical in the dataset from consideration of the bioavailability (as per the QPPR-derived Pblood:air). Subsequently, distributional analyses of these absorbed doses were performed to identify the OTTCs. Third, for ID estimations (in ‘batch’ mode), a QPPR-based human PBPK modeling framework was parameterized with QPPR-derived values of Pblood:air, Ptissu:air, and hepatic clearance. Three ID metrics were identified for investigation: (i) the daily area under the venous blood concentration versus time curve (AUC24), (ii) the daily rate of the amount of parent chemical metabolized (RMET24) and (iii) the maximum venous blood concentration after an 8-h work shift. Using AUC24, the resulting model’s reliability was evaluated based on joint sensitivity and uncertainty analyses. Fourth, distributional analyses of the predicted ID were further performed to derive ID-based OTTCs; and simple linear regression analyses performed to study and quantify the relationship between the ID metrics and OEL. Based on the absorbed dose, the derived OTTCs were 0.15, 0.0085, and 0.006 mmol/day at the 10th percentile level for Cramer classes I-III respectively, while these values were 1.5, 0.09 and 0.03 mmol/day at the 25th percentile level. The reliability analysis indicated that the AUC24 values predicted with the proposed PBPK modeling framework were moderate to highly reliable for 55% of the chemicals, with 46% exhibiting highly reliable values. High and significant correlations were observed between the OEL and the ID metrics predicted with the modeling framework, specifically RMET24 (r2 = 0.81; n = 276). Based on RMET24, the proposed ID-based OTTCs were 5.61×10-2 and 9×10-4 mmol/day at the 10th percentile level for classes I and III, respectively, while they were 4.55×10-1 and 8.50×10-3 mmol/day at the 25th percentile level. Overall, for the first time, this research has developed thresholds of toxicological concern based on molecular structure of chemicals, to enable screening-level occupational risk assessment and prioritization in data poor situations.

325	MCMC adaptatifs à essais multiples	This memoir aims at introducing adaptation within the Multiple-Try Metropolis (MTM) algorithms which are a special case of the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. The MCMC methods, along with their adaptive and multiple-try extensions, are thoroughly explored (both in their possible variations and in their theoretical properties) in order to firmly anchor  the study of the proposed adaptive Multiple-Try Metropolis (aMTM) algorithm. Moreover, some existing results on the properties of MTM algorithms are generalized to enable more general results about the aMTM algorithm. The ergodicity of the algorithm is then established using well known results of Roberts and Rosenthal (2007), Andrieu and Moulines (2006) and Craiu et al. (2015) and its empirical performance is studied through a series of simulation experiments. The aMTM algorithm achieves notably better performance than simpler samplers (non-adaptive or single-try) when applied to distributions that are multimodal or that exhibit complex geometry. Finally, many variations of the algorithm are proposed and compared to identify settings that are particularly more efficient. An implementation of the algorithm is provided in a R package called aMTM available at https://github.com/fontaine618/aMTM.

326	Comparaison d'estimateurs de la variance du TMLE	In the context of causal inference where we seek to estimate the average causal effect of a binary exposure on an outcome variable, the TMLE of M. Van der Laan and D. Rubin is a technique which applies to an initial estimate of the conditional expectation of the outcome a modification whose purpose is to reduce bias in the corresponding estimation of the average causal effect. The gold standard for estimation of the variance of the TMLE is a sandwich-type estimator. Various alternative estimators are identified and compared to the gold standard when the sample size is small, when the propensity scores are high or low and when the initial estimate of the propensity score or of the conditional expectation of the outcome is bad. for each of the variance estimator, a confidence interval for the TMLE is constructed. We find that the Jackknife estimator yields coverage rates equivalent or better than all the other estimators in all these situations.

327	Structure-fonction des transporteurs transmembranaires de la famille MmpL3 de Mycobacterium tuberculosis	The emergence of resistance to a multitude of antimicrobial agents in pathogenic bacteria is considered a major threat to public health (2). These strains are recognized as multidrug resistant organisms (MDR) (4). Research is progressing in Gram positive, Gram positive high GC and Gram negative bacteria, and given the scale of the public health threat, these MDR have become potential targets for this research. The objectives of the present study consist of the structural and functional characterization of various transmembrane transporters of the still enigmatic RND (Resistance-Nodulation-Division) family, namely: MmpL3 in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) via the study of its ortholog CmpL1 in Corynebacterium glutamicum (Cgl) and TriAxBC in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa).  The first component of this project, presented in Chapter 2, studies the structure of the transporter MmpL3 Mtb (a TMM mycolic acid transporter essential for the viability of Mtb (5) and that of its CmpL1 Cgl orthologue, which have been predicted via the I- Tasser Pack (6-8). These structures were subsequently validated by comparing to the electronic map generated for CmpL1 (18 Å) by negative staining transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Characterization of the purified CmpL1 transporter by size exclusion chromatography confirmed the trimeric complex size around 315 KDa (including the detergent crown) corroborated by SDS-PAGE gel analyses. Collaborative genetic and biochemical studies have also identified residues involved in the transport of TMM in MmpL3 as well as those residues conferring antibiotic resistance. This data highlighted the location of the essential residues of transport and resistance in the central channel of the trimeric Mmpl3 model. The MmpL3 region activating proto-motor transport has been located at a central cavity, which is an intrinsic feature of the RND family. The low-resolution electronic maps obtained for the protein CmpL1 may serve as the foundation of future studies.     In Chapter 3 we explore the therapeutic potential of the targeting of the transmembrane transporter MmpL3 in different Mycobacterium strains. Our collaborators studied the therapeutic effect of the most promising inhibitors of the MmpL3 Mtb transporter on certain multi-resistant mycobacterial non-tuberculous (NTB) strains. Based on our comparative structural modeling obtained by I-TASSER (6-8), we supplemented the biochemical data by highlighting the structural similarities and differences between the TB and NTB strains as well as their functional impacts. This chapter highlights the interest of direct or indirect targeting of MmpL3 in NTB species. Indeed, the efficacy of certain selected MmpL3 Mtb inhibitors on the treatment of NTB pulmonary infection have potential as generalizable treatment options for other NTB multi-resistant strains, or even to help address the problem of resistance to antibiotics and simplify current combination approaches.                                                                                Other collaborative studies undertaking the same structural approaches were carried out for TriAxBC tripartite carriers (P. aeruginosa), efflux pumps belonging to the RND family. The purpose of Chapter 4 was to generate a structure of the complex and decipher its mode of assembly and expulsion of antibiotics from the intracellular environment. A quaternary structure model of TriAxBC was predicted by I-TASSER (6-8) and validated against its 4.3 Å electronic map generated by Cryo-EM. The TriAxBC complex was also characterized by gel filtration confirming an approximate size of 620 KDa and its trimer composition by SDS-PAGE.  In conclusion, this study is combining different biochemical, genetic and structural approaches to highlight the need for a multidisciplinary approach to characterizing the structure function of RND transporters. The latter remain enigmatic; however, our contribution and the progress of others will allow the generation of new specific drugs targeting multiresistant strains.

328	Rôle de la CTNNB1 et de ses nouveaux partenaires dans la régulation de l'immunité antivirale innée et de la voie WNT	The host innate response to viral infection relies on the presence of pattern recognition receptors (PRR) that specifically recognize pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and then initiate signaling pathways and activate key transcription factors such as IRF3 and NF-қB, which lead to the synthesis of type I interferon (IFN-α/β). In a research program aimed at the discovery of regulators of innate immunity, we performed the first genome-wide silencing screen in response to Sendai virus (SeV) infection. The RNAi screen identified WNT2B and WNT9B as negative regulators of RLR-mediated antiviral response. We next showed that WNT2B and WNT9B are secreted upon viral infection and negatively regulate expression of representative inducible genes IFNB1, IFIT1 and TNF. We further investigated a canonical-like WNT pathway that culminates in CTNNB1 accumulation. Coherently, we found that viral infection induces the accumulation of a stabilized form of CTNNB1 and that CTNNB1 gene silencing increases SeV-induced IFNB1, IFIT1 and TNF expression. Conversely, CTNNB1 stabilization using GSK3 inhibitors resulted in a drastic reduction of virus-induced IFNB1 transcription and IFIT1 expression, but this decrease is restored in CTNNB1 knockdown cells. To uncover mechanistically how CTNNB1 regulated the antiviral immunity, we used quantitative mass-spectrometry to identify CTNNB1 interactome upon SeV infection or GSK3 inhibition. We identified DNA damage-binding protein 1 (DDB1) as an interactor of CTNNB1 that is reduced of CTNNB1 upon SeV or WNT3A stimulations. We showed that DDB1 negatively regulates CTNNB1 transcriptional activity by promoting its ubiquitination and reducing protein half-life following WNT3A stimulation. Strikingly, CTNNB1 ubiquitination is inhibited in SeV-infected cells and restored upon DDB1 depletion, consistent with a distinct role of DDB1 in preventing CTNNB1 degradation and inhibiting the antiviral innate response. We also identified the transcriptional repressor NKRF (NF-қB repressing factor) as a CTNNB1 interactor upon viral infection that negatively regulates IFNB1 production of SeV-infected cells without modulating the canonical pathway with WNT3A. We showed that NKRF KD, CTNNB1 KD and combination increase IFNB1, IFIT1 and TNF transcription to similar fold induction of mRNA levels. The data highly support the recruitment of CTNNB1-NKRF containing protein complexes to turn off IFNB1, TNF and IFIT1 transcription by epigenetic and/or transcriptional repression mechanisms, and control innate immune gene expression after virus recognition signals have resolved. Overall, our findings identify a novel regulation of antiviral innate immunity by CTNNB1 and its regulators, paving the way for novel avenues for broad-spectrum antiviral targets and preventing immune-mediated diseases upon viral infection.

329	Applications of complex numbers to deep neural networks	"In the past decade, a convergence of hardware, software and theory have allowed artificial intelligence to experience a renewal: a ""spring"" that, unlike previous times, seems to have led not to a burst hype bubble and a new ""AI winter"", but to a lasting ""summer"", anchored by tangible advances in the field.  One of the key such advances is truly ``deep'' learning. In many applications, the architects of neural networks have had great success by deepening them, and there is now little doubt about the value of deep, composable, hierarchical, automatically-learned-from-examples representations.  But there exist other, less-well-explored avenues for research, such as alternatives to the real-valued number system most commonly used: low-precision, complex, quaternions. In 2017, myself and one of my primary collaborators discussed the seeming lack of interest given to purely complex-valued processing of digital signals, either directly available in complex form or convertible to such using e.g. the Fourier Transform (1D, 2D, short-time or not). Since this area seemed under-explored, we threw ourselves into it and, after a year spent dealing with the challenges of neural networks with purely complex-valued internal representations, we obtained good results in computer vision and music spectrum prediction. We also expose the pitfalls of naively initializing and normalizing such complex-valued networks and solve them with custom formulations adapted for the use of complex numbers."

330	« L’empêchement moteur » : les fonctions des procédés métatextuels dans l’œuvre d’Hervé Bouchard	The work of Hervé Bouchard embraces a self-reflective aesthetic and, at the same time, a mimetic link with reality. This approach of illusion and artificiality is perpetual and produces distancing effects that take part in the awareness of the context of enunciation and largely of an ongoing reflection on the act of writing. In this thesis, we show different relationships between the metatextual processes, distancing effects and the characters’ impediment to express themselves, thematized in Bouchard’s work. The metatextual processes, in their function of exposure, can refer to the themes explored by the author, like shame, mourning and childhood taboos ; in addition they attest to his aesthetic choices, that question the limits of all types of representation, including theater and language. Our first chapter is dedicated to the theatricality and how it is used as a metatextual process, expressed by a dramaturgic formatting, a mise en abyme of theater as a space and the metaphorical use of theater as a prescriptive framework. From those generic and referential ruptures, our second chapter takes on the repercussions of the characters’ impediment to express themselves on the texts’ syntax and structure. The analysis of the repetitive patterns, ellipses and digressions allows us to establish a sample of the various processes used by the author. With a more poetic perspective, our third chapter shows the links between the interruptions and the digressions. They are the start of brief stories, which can be perceived as fragments of a larger narrative. The analysis of the effects of continuity created by intratextual references, the language, the place and the forms of the author, call for a legendary horizon in which these stories would be connected. In the same way, the coherence of Bouchard’s work is strongly and willingly emphasised.

331	Profils d’adolescentes : liens entre les traits d’insensibilité émotionnelle, l’historique de victimisation et la santé mentale	Callous-unemotional traits, such as a lack of consideration and empathy for others, are important to consider in identifying subgroups of youth at risk of serious and persistent antisocial behavior (Frick & Dickens, 2006; Frick & White, 2008). Two variants (primary and secondary) of youth who manifest callous-unemotional traits have been identified. Specifically, adolescents with secondary callous-unemotional traits have been found to differ from those associated with the primary variant by their higher levels of anxiety and depression (Fanti et al., 2013; Kahn et al., 2013) as well as their history of adversity (Meehan et al., 2017) and self-destructive behaviors, such as substances use (Cecil et al., 2018). Studies that focused on the differences between the profiles of youth were mainly based on male samples who are notably more likely than females to display conduct problems combined with callous-unemotional traits (Fontaine et al., 2011). Based on a sample of adolescent females, the first aim of this study was to identify youth profiles based on callous-unemotional traits (CU), conduct problems (CP) and internalized symptoms (i.e. anxiety and depression). The second aim was to identify the differences in youth profiles in terms of their self-destructive behaviors, such as alcohol and drug use (Baumeister & Scher, 1988) and eating disorders (Van der Kolk & Herman, 1991), as well as their history of family and social victimization, such as abuse, neglect and bullying by peers. A sample of 200 adolescent girls was recruited from high schools located in Montreal and from the Institute for Youth in difficulty (n = 200; M = 15.10 years old; S-D = 1.62). Latent profile analyses performed using Mplus 8 software provided an optimal four-class solution: normative, anxious, conduct problems (CP), conduct problems–callous unemotional traits (CP–CUT). In addition to reporting more anxiety and depression than the normative group, girls with the highest rates of iv callous-unemotional traits and conduct problems (CP-CUT) also reported the highest levels of exposure to family and social victimization and self-destructive behaviors, such as substances abuse. This profile shows several features associated with the secondary variant of callous-unemotional traits. Thus, the results of this study confirm the importance of considering the heterogeneity of behaviors as well as the history of victimization among groups of high-risk girls. In particular, the identification of these adolescent profiles is important to prevent other adjustment difficulties and to tailor interventions to the individual characteristics and experiences of victimization.

332	Normativités et usages judiciaires des technologies : l’exemple controversé de la neuroimagerie en France et au Canada	Neuroimaging allows the observation of the nervous system, of both its metabolism and some of its structures. An important literature in “neurolaw” conveys illusions and fantaisies about the judicial possibilities that imaging technologies would contain. Whether it is about lies detection, cerebral identifications of dangerous individuals through their neurobiology or predictions of criminal behaviors, neuroimaging, in the current state of technologies, can not be seriously conceived as being able to offer such applications. Judicial uses of neuroimaging through expertise are a reality nonetheless, in Canadian courts as in French law. This thesis emphasizes that the conceptions of imaging technologies integrated in the two legal systems studied are incomplete, which creates an important amount of risks. It discusses the conditions for the use of an extra-legal normativity, the international technical standardization, which could be elaborated in this particular and controversial context, and outlines several features of an increased dialogue between legal and technological norms	Neurosciences , Expertise , Neuroimaging , Internormativity , Standardization	en	22457.0
333	Accompagnement d’enseignants par le conseiller pédagogique dans le contexte de l’école : interrelation entre d’une part son processus d’accompagnement et d’autre part ses caractéristiques individuelles et les caractéristiques du contexte de l’école	"To ensure quality education for students, several teaching systems, including the Quebec system, promote the professional development of teachers. For example, the Public Education Act requires teachers ""to take appropriate measures that enable [them] to achieve and maintain a high degree of professional competence"" (Éditeur officiel du Québec, 2018, août, art. 22.6). The professionals who can coach teachers in this process are the coaches who replace the inspectors since the abolition of these positions in 1964 (Lessard & Des Ruisseaux, 2004). However, during the coaching of teachers by the coaches in a school, the coaching process, which is related to the individual characteristics of the coach and the characteristics of the school context, is difficult to achieve in certain cases (Boutet & Villemain, 2014; Cartier & Bélanger, 2012; CSÉ, 2014; LeBlanc, Dumoulin, Garant & Larouche, 2013; Mané & Lessard, 2007). This problem manifests itself, inter alia, through the implementation of intuitive coaching practices (Mané & Lessard, 2007) and its extent can be justified by the low rate of teachers who benefit from coaching (CSÉ, 2006). Among the factors that can influence the emergence of this problem, there is the lack of definition of the role of the coach, their limited number in school boards and the lack of training recognized for them (CSÉ, 2014). From this problematic, a question arose: during the coaching in a school, how the process of teacher’s coaching by the coach is related to its individual characteristics and to the characteristics of the school context? To address this issue, a conceptual framework based on theoretical models and empirical researches in the field has been developed. It presents the coaching as a complex and dynamic process of thoughts and practices oriented towards the achievement of specific goals, favouring the agency of teachers and related to the individual characteristics of the coach and to the characteristics of the school context. Examination of literature in the field shows that little knowledge exists on this interrelation that can lead to better understand how coaching works in its context. Based on the conceptual framework of the study, the research goals were: during a coaching in a school, 1) describe the coach’s coaching process; 2) describe the interrelation between the coaching process and the individual characteristics of the coach; 3) describe the interrelation between the coaching process and the characteristics of the school context. To that end, an embedded multiple case study (Yin, 2003) was conducted with two coaches who each coached a team of female teachers in a school. Data collected through interviews, observations, and literature were analyzed using the mixed coding method (Miles & Huberman, 1994; 2003, Van Der Maren, 1996). The results of the first goal, which aims to describe the process of teachers’ coaching by the coach, documented its aspects: complex, dynamic, oriented, precise and agentive. For example, the complexity was found mainly in supporting the learning process of teachers, their teaching process and their characteristics. The orientation was found in the presence of goals consistent with the problem identified and coaching practices aligned with these goals. The results in the second goal, which focused on the description of the interrelationship between the coach’s coaching process and his individual characteristics, showed an interrelation between the coaching process carried out and, above all, the conceptions of the coaches and their perceptions of the school context. For example, their control of the results obtained is consistent with their perception of the practices of the teachers. Finally, the results in the third goal, which focused on the description of the interrelation between the coaching process and the characteristics of the school context, showed the role played by the school principal in the coaching process. For example, the school principals communicated their goals to the coach and the latter adopted them and proceeded to plan, enact and control practices in order to reach them. Otherwise, this study presents contributions, among others, at the theoretical and empirical level. Indeed, it allowed to conceptualize teachers’ coaching by the coach in the school context by considering its three central concepts: the coaching process, the individual characteristics of the coach and the characteristics of school context. Empirically, she documented the complexity, dynamism, focus, precision and agency of the coaching process and its interrelation with the coach’s individual characteristics and the characteristics of school context. These aspects are not very present in the research since most of them mainly consider enacting of coaching practices."

334	Entrée au secondaire d’élèves ayant des difficultés d’apprentissage intégrés en classe ordinaire: expérience vécue particulièrement dans une situation d’apprentissage par la lecture	At the entry to secondary school, a moment of the school transition, significant changes occur in the school environment at the procedural, academic and social levels (Desbiens & Vandenbossche-Makombo, 2013). Several studies have reported on the effects associated with this period of school life, notably the drop in school results (Poncelet & Lafontaine, 2011) and the decrease in motivation (Kelly & Price, 2014). In secondary school, learning through reading is omnipresent and essential to develop the skills targeted by the Quebec Education Program (MELS, 2006) and to succeed in all disciplines (Cartier, 2007). In this context, the challenges of the entry to secondary school and learning through reading are difficult for some students. This is especially true for students with learning difficulties who are integrated into ordinary classes. Given their school delays, these students are more likely than their peers to experience school failure when they enter secondary school (Poncelet & Lafontaine, 2011). On the other hand, they are more likely to have difficulty learning through reading (Cartier, 2007; Contant, 2009). The interventions to facilitate the entry to secondary school (Hughes, Banks & Terras, 2013) and to promote learning through reading to these students (Cartier, Bélanger, Boutin & Martel, 2018) seem to be little known. The purpose of this study was to answer the following question: in the context of the entry to secondary school, particularly when learning through reading, what is the experience of students with learning difficulties integrated into ordinary classroom? In response to this question, with reference to Tilleczek and Ferguson's (2007) approach, Cartier's and Butler's (2016) model and the literature review, the objectives were: 1) to describe the context of entry into secondary school and the experience in this context of students with learning difficulties integrated into ordinary classroom; and 2) to describe the context of learning through reading at the entry to secondary school and the experience in this context of students with learning difficulties integrated into ordinary classroom. In order to achieve the objectives of the research, a unique embedded case study (Yin, 2014) was conducted in a natural French class context. The participants were three high school girls identified as having learning difficulties, and their French teacher from a secondary school in the greater Montreal area. The research process took place in four stages between April and May 2017. The data collection tools of the study were, for the teacher, two semi-structured interview guides, a non-participant observation grid of her interventions and the collection of educational documents related to the learning through reading activity. For the students, the tools used were two semi-structured interview guides, a non-participant observation grid and the collection of their traces in the learning through reading tasks. Qualitative content analyses were performed. The results to the first objective showed that a number of practices were implemented in the secondary school to facilitate the entry to secondary school for students with learning difficulties integrated into ordinary classroom, such as communication between secondary and elementary teachers and the availability of material resources (computer, Word Q and Lexibook) and human resources (resource teachers in support groups). This context allowed the three teenagers to have rather a positive experience when they entered the secondary school. For example, they found that reading and understanding texts were easier at the secondary than at the elementary level, and that it was easy to make friends when they entered the secondary school. In response to the second objective of the study, the results first revealed that the learning through reading activity met a number of quality criteria (relevance, complexity and motivation). In addition, the support provided by the teacher in this activity focused on several aspects of the student learning through reading process. For example, the teacher supported the use of the highlighting strategy to help students better interpret the task. The experience of the three students in this activity, with the support of the teacher, allowed them to have a more or less positive experience. For example, the three girls adequately interpreted the task, organized their learning in a structured manner, and managed their difficulties by asking questions. The three students with learning difficulties successfully completed the task of writing descriptive text with justification and passed their first year of secondary school. These results show the importance of considering the interaction between the individual and his context as proposed by Cartier and Butler (2016). This study is important because it suggests that the practices implemented in the secondary school have made it easier for all three students with learning difficulties integrated into ordinary classroom to enter secondary school. It is also important because it highlights that the teacher's actions focused on the learning through reading process of the three students allow them to really engage in the quality activity proposed.

335	Supervisión de practicantes universitarios para desarrollar su compromiso social desde la perspectiva de ciudadanía	This research focuses on supervision for the development of social engagement of trainees in Mexico. Thus, the general objective was to know and understand supervision to develop social engagement among trainees from the perspective of citizenship education. It is an interpretive descriptive research that provides access to participants’ experience to understand how the trainees supervision is carried out. The main research tool was the focus group and we also used the thematic interview. The research context was Mexico, the research had 43 participants: 32 supervisors and 11 professors. All met the selection criteria, for example, having a minimum of three years experience at the university, or for the professors to be involved in designing the university's social mission or the professional application project (PAP) guidelines, and for the supervisors to have received the prize of the social formation “Premio Pedro Arrupe SJ”. This research respected the ethical rules related to research with human subjects according to the process established by the ethics committee of the Université de Montréal. For data analysis, we followed the thematic coding steps: thematic analysis, descriptive analysis, and explanatory analysis or modeling. The data were interpreted according to the objectives of the research and were presented in five sections, each section containing subthemes of the data sub-categories. 1) Notions of student education as citizens and social commitment. The notions of the student as a citizen are classified as responsible, participatory, justice-oriented and apathetic. The social commitment was interpreted by the participants, according to the institutional position of the university and in a personal way, paying particular attention to the formation of the social commitment and its difficulties. 2) Attributes of the socially engaged student. Five attributes have been identified, such as traits that the student manifests when socially engaged: informed; competent and creative; socially sensitive; responsible and motivated; active, questioner and critic. 3) Features of the PAP that promote social engagement. Participants highlighted the context of confrontation, the frames of reference and responsible freedom as features vi of the PAP that encourage social engagement, and supervisors also emphasized the role of the supervisor as a model of social engagement. 4) Approach to supervision for the development of social engagement. The following five facets are presented: situate, feel, customize; understand and connect socially. 5) Supervision strategies for the development of social engagement. The six strategies described are questioning, professional and relational modeling, framing, interaccompaniment, affective conviviality, and the review of the literature. It concludes that the research has met the objectives and considers the contribution of the study in the approach and the strategies of supervision for the development of social engagement of the trainees as citizens from the point of view of the education to the citizenship	Recherche qualitative , Supervision approaches of internships , Citizenship education , Servicelearning method , Transformational learning , Qualitative research	en	22444.0
336	Estudio de la influencia del proceso de formación docente sobre el sistema de creencias hacia el trabajo matemático del concepto de área, en estudiantes de pedagogía en matemáticas	This research is conducted in the educational context of the Universidad Católica de la Santísima Concepción of Chile and focuses on the process of training secondary school pedagogy students in mathematics. By the time the student begins school, he or she already has his or her own belief system about mathematical work, including how mathematics was taught in the school system. This belief system is likely to change as a result of interventions in his initial training as a mathematics teacher. Then, he must practice his pedagogical practice in an educational institution where he will have to teach a mathematical concept implementing his own belief system. In this thesis, changes in the student's belief system are explained when he/she teaches the concept of quadrilateral area from the time he/she arrives in the training program until he/she begins his/her professional practice. In this study three scenarios are observed: initial scenario, before beginning; simulated scenario at university, and real scenario, at school. The Theory of Didactic Situations and Mathematical Workspace Theory are the theoretical references from which the influence of the training program on the teaching belief system is analyzed in relation to the concept of area. The results we obtained show that students are changing their belief systems towards mathematical work, moving from a practice that we call traditional with mainly definitions and examples of content, to one in which material support, real-world situations, the use of tools and devolution are integrated to establish definitions and properties in relation to the concept of area.

337	Sleep and wake disturbances following traumatic brain injury	Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major health concern in industrialised countries. Sleep and wake disturbances are among the most persistent and disabling sequelae after TBI. Yet, despite the widespread complaints of post-TBI sleep and wake disturbances, studies on their etiology, pathophysiology, and treatments remain inconclusive. This narrative review aims to summarise the current state of knowledge regarding the nature of sleep and wake disturbances following TBI, both subjective and objective, spanning all levels of severity and phases postinjury. A second goal is to outline the various causes of post-TBI sleep-wake disturbances. Globally, although sleep-wake complaints are reported in all studies and across all levels of severity, consensus regarding the objective nature of these disturbances is not unanimous and varies widely across studies. In order to optimize recovery in TBI survivors, further studies are required to shed light on the complexity and heterogeneity of post-TBI sleep and wake disturbances, and to fully grasp the best timing and approach for intervention.

338	L’usage de cannabis et ses répercussions sur l’état nutritionnel et les habitudes alimentaires	Introduction : Canada has recently legalized cannabis. This has resulted in a raise of the prevalence of cannabis users. Health professionals such as dietitians are expected to get more questions about cannabis use. Although cannabis’ effects on energy homeostasis are well known, its impact on nutritional status and eating habits are not very well documented. Methods : A literature review on cannabis use and nutritional status has been done. For the effects of cannabis use on eating habits, a socioecological analysis has been carried out using a model. Results : Cannabis’ effects on nutritional status and eating habits are mediated by the interaction of phytocannabinoids with the endocannabinoid system. Cannabis appears to be associated to nutritional status, especially to anthropometric measures, caloric intake and alcohol intake. Cannabis also seems to have an impact on eating habits. Most factors of influence identified are individual and result from the physiological effects of cannabis. Altered hunger signals, gastrointestinal symptoms, increased palatability and hedonic value of some foods are examples of these factors. Other social, environmental and cultural factors have been identified but are less documented. More studies are needed to provide a more systemic approach to the effects of cannabis on eating habits. Conclusion : Cannabis use appears to be related to some nutritional status parameters such as anthropometric measures, caloric and alcohol intake. Most of these associations need to be clarified. Eating habits of cannabis users have many factors of influence most of which are the result of the physiological processes.

340	L'accountability ou le principe de responsabilité en matière de protection des renseignements personnels	Between anglophone word and transversal concept, accountability ask about the responsability and the enforcement of its principle in privacy laws. Result of a social and legislative path, the imputabilité, who came throught the concept, shows privacy laws as a collaborative and individual regulation process, serving the responsability and the risks that cames with the information technologies and the achievement of the corporate social responsability. In the same time seeing as a goal, a mechanism and an instrument of an effective and efficient privacy, the accountability principle is a legal and a management principle, used by companies as an intern management technic. The realisation of the accountability project take place with the acknoledgement of the principle by the OECD, who highlight the accountability as an essential standard, a necessary mecanism and a moralization requirement according the risks that came throught social and technological evolutions on the right to privacy and its laws.

341	Haven't we seen this already? Duplicate records in weekly Ovid autoalerts	Introduction: The primary objective of this study is to present data on records identified via Ovid's AutoAlert (SDI) feature. AutoAlert is one of several strategies healthcare professionals can use to keep up-to-date with the literature and thus maintain their clinical competence. It allows users to be notified via email when any new citations matching their search specifications are created in Ovid databases. Methods: We performed searches in Medline and Embase via Ovid on two topics and created weekly alerts for each search. Over a period of one year, each 'new' result was analyzed to determine whether it was previously retrieved by the initial search or in subsequent alerts. If the result had been retrieved previously, the nature of the revision to the initial record (the reason it was identified as 'new') was noted. Results: Extracted data was analysed in Excel. The investigators presented descriptive statistics on the frequency and nature of duplicate records generated via AutoAlert. Discussion: Given the increasing rate of publication in the medical literature (813,598 citations were added to Medline in 2017), email alerts in bibliographic databases can be useful tools to help healthcare professionals keep abreast of their topics of interest. Unfortunately, our study found that the AutoAlert feature consistently included edited or revised records in addition to newly created citations, and was therefore of limited value.

342	Effet de l’assouplissement du contrôle des armes à feu sur les homicides au Canada entre 1974 et 2016	In 2012, the Canadian government withdrew the Long-Gun Registry, thereby abolishing the obligation under Bill C-68 to register long guns. This is the first gun control easing policy in Canada and one of the first policies of its kind in the world. So far, there has been almost no study of the effect of reducing gun control on violence. While overcoming the potential biases found in previous evaluations, the purpose of this paper is to assess the effect of the removal of the long-gun registry on homicides in Quebec, Ontario and Alberta between 1974 and 2016. Another aim of this study is to update knowledge on the effect of Bill C-68. To do so, the effects of the withdrawal and of the Bill C-68 is evaluated with an interrupted time series design. According to our findings, the removal of the Long-Gun Registry and Bill C-68 had no effect on long-gun homicides. In addition, Bill C-68 had an immediate and gradual effect on homicides committed by handguns and other prohibited weapons in Quebec. Bill C-68 also had an immediate and decaying effect on homicides committed with handguns and other prohibited weapons in Alberta. No effect of Bill C-68 was observed in Ontario. The results suggest that tightening or loosening controls on long guns has no effect on long-gun homicides.

343	Établissement et persistance du réservoir du VIH chez des individus traités très tôt en phase aigüe de l’infection (cohorte RV254)	Antiretroviral therapies (ART) have largely increased the life expectancy of the HIV infected individuals who have access to it. Nonetheless, these therapies can’t eradicate the virus that persist in a latent state in long-lived CD4+ T cells. These infected cells form a viral reservoir that remains the main obstacle to a cure.  Several studies have shown that initiation of ART during the acute infection can lead to a delay in the viral rebound or in some cases to viremia control after a treatment interruption. However, the timing and location of the establishment and persistence of the viral reservoir during acute infection remain unclear. Using, blood and lymphoid tissues samples from acutely infected participants, we observed that the virus is firstly integrated in lymph nodes and colon cells and reaches a maximum frequency of infected cells at the Fiebig stage II, i.e. before seroconversion in the tissues. Moreover, we saw that a very early initiation of ART results in a drastic decrease of the number of infected cells in all compartments. Nonetheless a few infected cells persist under ART in the lymph nodes.   Our results suggest that a large number of cells are infected early in tissues before moving into the blood during the acute infection. Nonetheless, these infected cells form a labile HIV reservoir which is rapidly, but incompletely, eliminated by an early initiation of ART.

344	Étude des déterminants de l’induction et de la sensibilité à l’interféron chez le réovirus de mammifères	"Mammalian reovirus is currently under study as an oncolytic virus that can preferentially kill cancer cells. Although the viral and cellular determinants responsible are poorly understood, the interferon-related signaling pathways are probably involved. Two viral isolates differing in their sensitivity to interferon were previously obtained and their nucleotide sequence was determined. In order to establish the importance of the differences between these two viruses (T3DK and VeroAV) and the wild-type virus (T3DS), the plasmids carrying each of the corresponding viral genes were mutated. Viruses carrying different combinations of T3DK or VeroAV genes in a T3DS genetic background were then recovered by transfection of cells using the ""reverse genetics"" technique. T3DK virus is not only more sensitive to interferon than T3DS, but it also induces much more interferon production. We were able to show that the sensitivity phenotype is solely due to the presence of the T3DK μ2 and λ2 proteins, whereas its ability to induce the interferon-related pathways is rather associated with the combination of its μ2 and λ1 proteins. On the other hand, the VeroAV virus is also more sensitive to interferon than the T3DS virus, without however inducing more interferon. The sensitivity phenotype is, in this case, due to a single point mutation in the virus S1 gene. This mutation modifies both the σ1 and σ1s protein of VeroAV, but it seems that it is its impact on the non-structural protein σ1s that is responsible for the observed sensitivity phenotype. The results thus demonstrated that phenotypes of induction and sensitivity to interferon are partially genetically dissociable properties and that they may be dependent on multiple viral determinants. The selection of interferon-sensitive mutants followed by their characterization with the reverse genetics approach will certainly contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in the mammalian reovirus oncotropism."

345	Le carcinome intracanalaire de la prostate : indication potentielle pour la radiothérapie adjuvante	Background: Intraductal carcinoma of the prostate (IDC-P) is a variant of prostate cancer (PC) that can be found amongst usual forms. Studies observed that IDC-P has a different biology and response pattern to treatments usually offered to patients with advanced disease. Treatment response for localised PC with IDC-P has never been studied. Objective: To test the impact of adjuvant radiotherapy (ART) in patients with localized PC and IDC-P. Methods: We performed a retrospective study of men with localized PC treated by radical prostatectomy (RP) with or without ART, from two centers (1993–2015). Exclusion criteria were the use of another type of treatment prior to BCR, and detectable PSA following RP or ART. Primary outcome was BCR. Patients were grouped by treatment (RPonly/RP+ART), IDC-P status, and presence of high-risk features (HRF: Grade Groups 4–5, positive margins, pT3 stage). Results: We reviewed 293 RP specimens (median follow-up 99 months, 63 BCR). Forty-eight patients (16.4%) were treated by RP+ART. Multivariate Cox regression for BCR indicated that IDC-P had the strongest impact compared to other HRF (HR=2.39, 95%CI:1.44-3.97), while ART reduced the risk of BCR (HR=0.38, 95%CI: 0.17-0.85). The protective effect of ART was superior in IDC-P[+] patients, when compared to IDC-P[–] patients. IDC-P[+] patients who did not receive ART had the worst BCR-free survival (log-rank P=0.023). Furthermore, IDC-P had the same impact on BCR-free survival as ≥1 HRF (log-rank P=0.955). Conclusion: Men with IDC-P who did not receive ART had the highest BCR rates, and IDC-P had the same impact as ≥1 HRF, which are often used as ART indications. Once validated, ART should be considered in patients with IDC-P.	Adjuvant radiotherapy , Biochemical recurrence , Intraductal carcinoma of the prostate , Radical prostatectomy	en	22322.0
346	Sainte-Justine du futur : des patients et des parents parlent aux soignants	Context The Chairman and CEO of the University Hospital Sainte-Justine offered a young physician and researcher to form a group to reflect on the future ef the institution. The mean chosen to do so was to ask the people receiving these services, both the patients and their relatives. Objective This research project is aimed at giving a voice to the people who benefit from the care and services at CHU Sainte-Justine. This is a chance for staff at CHUSJ to know how patients and their families would like to relive their experience if they returned to CHU Sainte-Justine within a few years.  Methods There were 13 focus groups, as well as 3 individual interviews for a total of 59 people met, consisting of 19 patients and 40 relatives. Since it is an exploratory project, the working hypotheses is to collect as many ideas as possible from participants. The research method chosen is an exploratory and descriptive analysis (Miles et Huberman, 2003). Results We have demonstrated that they wish to have a relationship of partners with the caregivers, and that they ask that all the people they meet at CHU Sainte-Justine consider themselves as caregivers, being as each of them has an important role in their experience at the CHUSJ. The general observation following the analysis of the proposals is that the aims of the patient-family-caregivers partnership are centered on what patients and relatives say they need. The results show the complexity of their reality of life with a disease, the need to recognize this complexity, the need not only to be understood, but considered as well as supported to better cope with the illness and the transformations of life that it entails.  Conclusion Patients and their families want the people working at CHU /CHU Sainte-Justine as an organization to reinvent themselves to meet the needs and requests expressed by the focus group participants. These desired changes can be divided into two main areas: that of clinical ethics, in the patient-family-caregivers relationship, and that of organizational ethics, or in the organizational evolution needed to support clinical ethics in the field. The transformation of CHU Sainte-Justine in each of these two areas raises challenges of its own. At the clinical level, the challenge is human; to dare to make changes in the relationship beyond the level of current care and services offered. At the organizational level, the challenge is political; namely the organizational transformation of CHU Sainte-Justine.	parole aux patients , Clinical ehtics , Organizational ethics , Organizational transformation , Patient voice , Clinical relationship , Recognition , Partnership , Everyone a caregiver	en	22315.0
347	Évaluation de la fidélité intra- et interobservateur pour l’évaluation du vasospasme post-hémorragie sous-arachnoïdienne en angiotomodensitométrie	Objective: To review the literature on and assess the intra- and inter-observer reliability of computed tomography angiography (CTA) in the screening or diagnosis of cerebral vasospasm (CV) following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Methods: Articles reporting the reliability of CTA up to May 2018 were systematically searched and evaluated. Eleven raters independently graded 17 arterial segments in each of 50 SAH patients for the presence of vasospasm using a 4-category scale. Furthermore, readers were asked: to judge the presence or absence of any moderate/severe vasospasm (≥ 50 % narrowing); whether findings would justify augmentation of medical treatment; and/or DSA with/without angioplasty. Four raters reassessed the same patients in different order at least 4 weeks later. Results: The systematic review revealed that the reliability of CTA had not previously been rigorously assessed. The intra-rater reliability reached a substantial level (k > 0.600) in 3/4 readers for the detection of moderate-severe vasospasm, but inter-rater reliability remained below substantial even when results were stratified according to specialty and experience. There was less than substantial agreement for imaging-based recommendations (medical management or indications to proceed with DSA/angioplasty). Dichotomized per segment results (presence or absence of >50% narrowing) allowed reaching substantial agreement only among senior readers evaluating M1 segments. Excluding cases in which segments were obscured by metal artifacts did not allow additional arterial segments to reach the threshold for substantial agreement. Conclusion: CTA was not sufficiently repeatable among observers diagnosing CV to support a general use in guiding decisions in the clinical management of SAH patients.

348	Impact du statut nutritionnel sur la qualité de vie des patients atteints de carcinomes épidermoïdes de la tête et du cou	Background: Head and neck cancer and the side effects related to its treatment predispose patients to malnutrition, which is an important cause of morbidity and mortality. However, uncertainties persist as to its impact on quality of life. Objective: The objective of this study is to evaluate the nutritional status of patients treated for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and its impact on their quality of life at four months and one year after diagnosis. Methods: Data regarding nutritional status, as measured with BMI, weight loss, albumin and prealbumin, was collected before the beginning of treatment. Quality of life was evaluated prospectively, using the University of Washington Quality of Life Questionnaire, on three occasions: before the beginning of treatment, four months after diagnosis and one year later. A total of 155 patients treated for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma were reviewed from this prospective databank. Multiple linear regression was used for statistical analysis. Results: With adjustment for age, sex, cancer stage, type of treatment, comorbidities and pretreatment quality of life, a lower BMI is associated with a poorer overall quality of life at one year post-diagnosis (p=0,03). No association was demonstrated between the nutritional markers and quality of life at four months after diagnostic. Conclusion: Evaluation of nutritional status is an essential component in the care of head and neck cancer patients, as malnutrition is correlated with poorer long-term quality of life.	nutritional status , quality of life , head and neck cancer , squamous cell carcinoma	en	22304.0
349	Ce que « Savoir cuisiner » signifie pour des adolescents québécois	Context: The loss of cooking skills by young people is a hot topic these days and includes elaborate concepts that allow us to explore the theme of cooking in all of it’s complexity (Vidgen, 2016). Although the current scientific data does not allow us to say with complete certainty that there is a loss of cooking skills in the young people of Quebec, we know that they have less occasions to acquire these competencies in their school and home environments (Chenhall, 2010). The program « Brigades Culinaires » that is deployed as an extracurricular activity by the « Tablée des chefs » is one of Quebec’s initiatives to address this problem.  Objectives: This study explores the meaning given to the act of cooking by the participants of the « Brigades Culinaires » and follows their evolution throughout the course of a school year.  Methodology The teenagers who participated in the « Brigades Culinaires »’s 2017-2018 workshops were invited to answer a self-administrated questionnaire before and after the workshops, at the beginning and the end of the school year. This questionnaire included the open question «What does it mean for you to know how to cook? » and included 11 quantitative statements based on Vidgen and Gallegos’ theoretical model (2014). This model implies that food literacy is based on four competencies linked to the planning, selection, preparation and consumption of food.  The multiple choice answers proposed were «capable», «more or less capable» and «incapable». Sociodemographic questions were also included. A coding grid specific to Quebec teenagers exposed to the « Brigades Culinaires » was used to analyze the qualitative data. Frequency tables were generated and chi-square tests were conducted to raise significant differences between some variables.  Results: The majority of respondents were girls and the mean age was 13.4 years old (ET :1.5). Before the start of the workshops, 1437 answers to the question on the act of cooking were analyzed. After the workshops, 840 answers were obtained (13.8 ET :1.5). In order of importance, the teenagers associated the expression knowing how to cook to the preparation of food, 65% before the workshops and 57% after. The preparation of food refers to the applied aspect of the act of cooking: the use of equipment and culinary techniques. Also, 32% of the answers referring to the consumption of food before the workshops and 40% of the answers after the workshops included the comprehension of wholesome nutrition and underlined the importance of autonomy. Very few answers were associated with the planning and the selection of food. Quantitatively, in both answers pre and post workshops, the preparation seemed to be an activity that was well mastered by the teenagers whereas the statements related to the planning and the selection showed lower scores to the «capable» answer choice. Conclusion: Even though preparation is an essential skill to develop for healthy eating, it must be supported by a whole other set of competencies and knowledge in nutrition. Therefore, in a continuous improvement perspective, we must focus on teaching the provenance of food, the functioning of the food system, the keeping of a food budget and time management. These are avenues of skill development to retain so that the meaning of the word cooking is richer and the competencies necessary for healthy eating are retained for a lifetime. This global vision of the act of cooking will permit us to refine culinary programs which will allow children to develop a maximum of autonomy in the kitchen and distance themselves from ultra-processed products.

350	Contrôle génétique de l’épissage alternatif dans le contexte de la réponse immunitaire innée	When triggered, the innate immune response initiates molecular changes in the cells that allow an appropriate defense to the detected threat. These changes will affect the transcription of immune related genes while other genes are turned off to efficiently let the organism fight the pathogen. Alternative splicing plays a major role in the fine-tuning of messenger RNA expression. Recent researches have shown that there were major shifts of RNA splicing following infection by two bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella typhimurium). This study aims to better define the role of inter-individual genetic variation on alternative splicing in the context of bacterial infection. We first defined a list of annotated alternative splicing events for which we could recover the proportion of exclusion and inclusion form (PSI-value). We used this phenotype as a proxy for isoform usage. Unlike researches focusing on the proportion of annotated transcripts, we could isolate certain types of events and analyze the processing of exon separately. A multiple linear regression approach was then used to map the psi-value on the genotyping data. We identified 1948 unique events significantly correlated to genotype (rpQTL) and hundreds that were specific to infected macrophages. In total, this set of events spanned 1 162 genes. These results show that the inclusion of certain exons is genetically controlled in macrophages and that some of this control only occurs in infected macrophages. We also showed that alternative-first-exon (AFE) seem to be the least affected by genotype while alternative-last-exon (ALE) and TandemUTR are the most affected.

351	Caractérisation fonctionnelle de nouveaux gènes mitochondriaux chez les espèces à DUI : étude du gène f-orf chez la moule marine Mytilus edulis	In animal cells, mitochondria are organelles responsible for energy production. They carry their own genome, which is distinct from the nuclear genome but is normally passed on to progeny in a strictly maternal fashion. Interestingly, many species of bivalve mollusks instead pass on their mitochondrial genome through a process known as doubly uniparental inheritance, or DUI. This system implies that male and female individuals each possess their own unique mitochondrial transfer pathway and have a mitochondrial genome which differs greatly from its opposite-sex counterpart. Recently, new genes were discovered within male (m-orf) and female (f-orf) mitochondrial genomes of DUI bivalve species. However, these genes have no homologues in sequence databases, meaning the functions of these genes have not been clearly established. Because these genes demonstrate a high level of sexual dimorphism, they are suspected to be involved in processes pertaining to DUI function, persistence of gonochorism throughout generations or sex determination. Here we have attempted to characterize the protein encoded by the f-orf gene in the blue mussel Mytilus edulis by preparing an antibody against a 20 amino acid sequence motif in the predicted protein. The antibody reacted with a protein of 60 kDa on Western blots, instead of the expected 25 kDa, but a signal was found in all tissues as anticipated. The subcellular distribution of the antigen recognised by the antibody, as determined by immunohistochemistry, was found to be uniquely mitochondrial. Immunoprecipitation of the 60 kDa band, followed by LC-MS/MS sequencing of the band excised from an SDS gel, did not identify any peptides expected for the F-ORF. Although a complete functional analysis of the protein could not be realized, the experiments described here represent a coherent and complete experimental protocol for this purpose.	bivalve , ORFans , f-orf , Mytilus edulis , Mitochondria	en	22250.0
352	Inuit Ethnobotany in the North American Subarctic and Arctic: Celebrating a Rich History and Expanding Research into New Areas Using Biocultural Diversity	Historically, plant usage by the Inuit was considered minimal. Our recent understanding of Inuit plant usage has been informed by concepts such as biocultural diversity and keystone species, and these new ideas began to dispel myths about a lack of importance of plants in Inuit culture. Chapter 1 is a review and synthesis of literature concerning Inuit plant usage from across the four Inuit regions including Alaska, Canadian Western Arctic, Canadian Eastern Arctic and Subarctic, and Greenland. In total, there were 311 taxa reported across the four regions, corresponding to 73 families. There were similar levels of plant diversity in all four regions. Only 16 Families and 25 taxa were common to all regions, but 50%-70% of taxa and 75%-90% of Families were reported in at least two of the four regions, and neighbouring regions generally had higher overlap than regions farther apart. Similarly, all four regions showed edible, medicine, fire, and design as their top usage categories, as well as common, clear differentiation concerning what taxa are used for what purpose. Regarding medicinal uses, Ericaceae was the top medicinal Family in all regions, and dermal ailments were the most common treated illness in all regions. There also appeared to be pan-Inuit applications for Ericaceae for gastrointestinal and viral illnesses, and Salicaceae and Pinaceae for dermal treatments. Results of the review suggest that common patterns of plant knowledge and plant use exist across the entirety of the Inuit territory. Chapter 2 uses biocultural diversity to describe plant usage in Nunatsiavut (Labrador), a self-governing Inuit region within Canada, part of the Eastern Canadian Inuit region. Biocultural diversity is a concept that links biological and cultural diversities. The current body of work around biocultural diversity is extremely biased towards low latitudes, with much less information available at higher ones. To expand this framework into a Subarctic context, this paper seeks to understand how plant diversity supports intra-cultural diversity within the Nunatsiavut region, including communities of Postville, Hopedale, and Rigolet, via interviews with community members. In total, 66 taxa were identified among the three communities. Approximately 75% of taxa were common to at least two communities, corresponding to 95% of all responses. Edible plants were the most common reported usage, with particular emphasis on berry producing taxa. Plants and culture were highly linked via (i) supporting cultural activities; (ii) marking for historical events; (iii) highlighting intergenerational exchange and valuing of plant knowledge; (iv) expressing the deep awareness that people have for their local environment; and (v) a medium for the expression of traditional values. The similarities in the plant responses among the communities suggest a common body of plant knowledge among Postville, Hopedale, and Rigolet. It is clear that plants support a rich diversity of cultural activities, local memory and history, and traditional values. This study supports the inclusion of a biocultural perspective in a northern context and brings attention to the cultural importance of plants in northern communities. We hope that readers will finish reading this thesis with a profound appreciation for the value of plants in Inuit culture. From northern Alaska to eastern Greenland, both historically and presently, plants are undeniable pillars of Inuit culture.

353	Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal communities of 31 durum wheat cultivars (Triticum turgidum var. durum) under field conditions in Eastern Canadian province of Quebec	Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi can provide ecosystem services such as growth and nutrition enhancement, protection against pests and diseases, mitigation of abiotic stress, as well as stabilization of the soil. In the agriculture sector, symbiotic relationships between crops and AM fungi are being explored to help reduce agriculture’s ecological footprint and enhance its sustainability by decreasing demand for fertilisers, pesticides and other chemicals. However, information available to date indicates that wheat may sometimes show poor response to AM symbiosis (growth depressions and lower yields), and the relationship has in some cases been labeled parasitic. We tested the hypothesis that genetic variation among durum wheat cultivars (Triticum turgidum var. durum) might lead to shifts in fungal community structure. We tested 31 durum wheat cultivars released at different times in the history of durum wheat selection in Canada in a field experiment under phosphorus limiting conditions. Based on the 18S ribosomal subunit sequences of DNA extracted from roots, rhizosphere and soil, we found that AM community in durum wheat roots is dominated by Rhizophagus irregularis and R. intraradices. Meanwhile the community in the rhizosphere and soil have more Glomus spp., Claroideoglomus spp. or Rhizophagus spp. The mycorrhizal community associated with wheat roots is not significantly different between genotypes (p-value > 0.05). Mean colonization levels in the roots of the different cultivars varied between 57.8% (Arnautka) and 84.0% (AC Navigator). However, these differences were not statistically significant (p-value > 0.05). Despite that durum wheat roots could select a subset of taxa from the soil community to colonize their tissues, results suggest that all cultivars select similar communities. The genetic variation in durum wheat seems insufficient to allow the use of traditional plant breeding methods to produce genotypes associating with highly effective arbuscular mycorrhizal taxa.

354	Analyse comparative de la description du suspect lors d’entrevues d’enquête policière avec des enfants victimes d’agressions sexuelles	Two elements may influence the number of details revealed by a child about his or her sexual abuse: The type of question asked by the investigator and the age of the child. The aim of this study is to determine whether the nature of the words, the description used by children and as the quantity of new detail provided in describing the alleged perpetrator are moderate by the child’s age and the type of questions posed by authorities (invitation or directive). A total of 75 police investigations interviewing children (50 girls and 25 boys) aged from 3 to 12-years-old (M = 7,21; É.T. = 2,75) were analyzed when age was divided into 3 groups (3 to 5-years-old, 6 to 8-years-old and 9 to 12-years-old). A one factor one-way ANOVA analysis and follow-up post-hoc test revealed significant differences between the three groups across all categories. Indeed, children aged from 9 to 12-years-old provide significantly more details than those aged from 3 to 5 years-old. A content analysis of children’s verbatim shows that the accuracy of the description of the suspect improves as a function of the age of children. Finally, the study’s results do not demonstrate an interaction effect of the type of question and child age on the nature of words chosen by the children. However, a main effect of the question type is obtained for the pronouns/noun category. Also, a main effect of child age groups are identified in almost all categories. This is the first study to look closely at content revealed by children, which will inform to adjust to children’s varying developmental capacities.	guide NICHD , investigative interview , NICHD protocol , sexual abuse , child	en	22232.0
355	À deux, c’est mieux : étude pilote portant sur la faisabilité, l’acceptabilité et l’impact potentiel d’une intervention de groupe sur les relations amoureuses pour jeunes hommes ayant un trouble psychotique	Aim: To assess the feasibility, acceptability and potential impact of a cognitive behavioral group intervention occurring over 12 sessions and focusing on romantic relationships for single men with early psychosis. Methods: An A-B-A within-subjects design (n=7) where each participant act as his own control. Within-subjects repeated measures ANOVAs were conducted to compare factors that might lead to difficulties initiating and maintaining intimate relationships (better social functioning, romantic relationship functioning, self-esteem, theory of mind, and less self-stigma) across time (six timepoints). Results: Feasibility and acceptability were established. As for the potential impact of the intervention, significant time differences were found for the social functioning (‘behaviors’ subscale), the romantic relationship functioning, and theory of mind (‘mentalizing’ subscale). No significant time differences were found for the social functioning (‘beliefs’ subscale), self-esteem, self-stigma, and theory of mind (‘reasoning’ subscale) factors. Conclusions: Similar and large-scale studies with control groups should be conducted to further help men with early psychosis in their social and romantic development.	cognitive behavioral therapy , early psychosis , intimacy , recovery , romantic relationships	en	22231.0
356	Évaluation de la mise en oeuvre et des effets perçus du programme Vestiaire des pères	Recently, father involvement has been redefine. Fathers now play numerous roles with their children. Many community organisations assist fathers so that they can manage this new reality. Unfortunately, government services stand behind, partly because of the rigidity of their organizational structure adapted to mothers’ needs. Vestiaire des pères is a program who follows from an innovative collaboration between Coopère Rosemont, a community service provider, and the Centre jeunesse de Montréal – Institut universitaire, a government agency. Vestiaire des pères suits every father who wants to share his experience of fatherhood. Many goals are aimed; reaching out so that they are not isolated, socialize and help each other. This qualitative study aims to describe both the logic model of the program and the implementation process of Vestiaire des pères and to identify the perceived effects on fathers. The sample includes six fathers and four educators that took part of the program. Different sources of information were collected and analyse to reveal Vdp’s implementation process and logic model. Results suggest that fathers from many different backgrounds were part of the program, even fathers in vulnerable situations. Overall, educator’s attitude towards father’s background, profile, strengths and weaknesses is the most appealing setting that helps create a mutual-aid environment. The results also showed that inconsistency in Vdp’s elaboration process led to difficulties during implementation process. Finally, many suggestions are propose to improve this innovative program.	engagement paternel , Social program , Activation relationship theory , Father’s involvement , Mutual-aid groups , Implementation evaluation , Psychoeducation	en	22216.0
357	Agency, participation, and self-determination for indigenous peoples in Canada : foundational, structural, and epistemic injustices	In this paper, I discuss accounts of agency, participation, and self-determination by David Crocker and Stacy Kosko because they acknowledge that relationships of power can determine who gets to participate and when. Kosko usefully applies the concept of agency vulnerability to the case of the self-determination of indigenous peoples. I examine the specific context of Canada’s history as a settler nation, a history that reflects attempts to denigrate, dismiss and erase Indigenous laws, practices, languages, and traditions. I argue that this history displays epistemic injustice in that the dominant collective interpretative resources of non-Indigenous Canadians have allowed the dismissal of the collective interpretative resources of Canada’s Indigenous peoples. This gap in collective interpretative resources can explain that Canada’s constitution, institutions, laws, and structures reflect the dominant collective interpretative resources of a colonizing nation, ones that have delineated and restricted the agency, participation, and self-determination of Indigenous Canadians. One important outcome of Canada’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission and of its National Inquiry into Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women and Girls is bringing the rich history of Indigenous collective interpretative resources and the networks of relationships shaped by them to light. By discussing examples from these reports, I give substance to the argument that foundational and structural injustices in settler nations are at bottom epistemic injustices, ones that have implications for accounts of agency, participation, and self-determination.

358	La philosophie avec les enfants : un outil à l’éducation à la tolérance au Québec	"In Québec, the topic of education to tolerance is subject not only to debate but also, in the eyes of some, to controversy. As cultural diversity becomes a distinct feature of Québec’s society and culture, the relevance and feasibility of teaching young individuals critical thinking which is aimed at fostering an attitude of tolerance towards their peers remains a subject which is highly studied and discussed within realms of education. The purpose of this masters’ thesis is to examine the question of education to tolerance in Québec as well as to evaluate the present and possible forms said education may take. The research question can thus be formulated as such : ""Is it reasonable to attempt to teach tolerance in Québec schools and, if so, what form should these teachings take? "" To answer this question, we will examine the Ethics and Religious Culture (ERC) course, a program which withholds the objective to provide children and teenagers with the critical references necessary for tolerance. In addition, this text will present the method of philosophy with children as well as the role it may play in education for tolerance specifically, and education with young individuals in general."

359	Logique du vague : survol des principales théories	In this dissertation, I am interested in vagueness, generally characterized as a propension of vague terms to create sorites paradoxes. I begin by defining vagueness and I try to find a neutral definition that fits for all theories. Then, I turn my attention to the principal theories that describe this phenomenon and I use Keefe’s good theory criteria, presented in her 2000 book Theories of Vagueness, to analyze them. Three accounts of vagueness are analyzed: supervaluationism, subvaluationism and Williamson’s epistemicism. For every theory, I describe the semantics and the logic and I present the major objections or problems that it has to face. I conclude that epistemicism has to be rejected because of its counter-intuitive semantics. Subvaluationism is, at this point, a better theory than supervaluationism because it can consistently accommodate higher-order vagueness and D operator.

360	Domination éternelle dans les graphes	In this thesis, we study the eternal domination problem in graphs. We consider three different models of the problem, namely the one-guard moves model, the all-guards move model and the fractional model. First of all, we study some fundamental questions related to the relation between the independence number, the eternal domination number and the clique cover number of a graph in the one-guard moves model. Second, we propose a strategy which gives an upper bound of mi/7 + O(m+n) on the eternal domination number of the strong grid Pm ⊠ Pn in the all-guards move model. In the end, inspired by the fundamental results in fractional graph theory, we introduce a fractional analogue of the eternal domination problem.

362	Three-Dimensional Model of the Release and Diffusion of Paclitaxel in the Stent-Polymer-Wall-Lumen System of a Blood Vessel	Stents are used in interventional cardiology in order to keep a diseased vessel open. New stents are coated with a medicinal agent that prevents the early reclosing caused by the proliferation of smooth muscle cells (SMC). In order to obtain the desired release kinetics for the SMC-controlling drug during the required therapeutic period, the current strategy focuses on biphasic or possibly polyphasic release from blends of degradable polymers. BlanchetDelfour-Garon [7] introduced an ordinary differential equation with two parameters and Garon-Delfour [42] a partial differential equation with two parameters to model the release kinetics. The parameters are all obtained from experimental release curves of Lao et al. [60] for pure polymers and polymer blends under infinite sink conditions. They are practical tools to numerically and theoretically simulate the 3D drug release from a thin coating of polymer to the aggregated wall and lumen of the blood vessel in order to facilitate the design and evaluation of the coating. The primary objective of this research was to pass from the thin, flat midsurface coating to the thin coating of a realistic 3D stent with curved and complex surface. To begin, the linearly diffusive model (and the results) of Delfour-Garon-Longo [31] that were obtained for a vessel with flat surface were extended to the case of a vessel with curved surface by finding the appropriate boundary conditions. The resulting model was then analysed from the point of view of the dose and the normalised concentration. Secondly, the resulting boundary condition from the 3D partial differential equation of Garon-Delfour was introduced into the model. This second nonlinear model was then used to study the normalised concentration as a function of the thickness of the polymer and the diffusion constant of the surrounding medium	Paclitaxel , drug release kinetics , biodegradable polymers , Riccati equation , time- space partial differential equation , numerical simulation	en	22159.0
363	Étude de la relation entre les oligomères amyloïde-bêta et la protéine d'adhésion synaptique Neuroligine-1	Synaptic loss and neurodegeneration, partly induced by amyloid-beta oligomers (Aßo), are the best predictors of memory deficits in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). An actual priority in the field is to identify a novel biomarker affected early by Aßo. The post-synaptic protein Neuroligin-1 (NL-1) could be a good candidate due to its roles in synaptic plasticity and memory. The first hypothesis of this study is that the synaptic dysfunctions caused by Aβo could rapidly and gradually affect the level of NL1. NL-1 expression was measured in chronic hippocampal Aβo1-42 injections, in primary hippocampal neuronal cultures exposed to Aβo1-42, and in 3xTg mice. Using 5 sets of probes assessing Nl-1 transcripts, an increase in mRNA levels after 2 days of Aβo1-42 injections was detected for 2 sets of probes, and a decrease in 3 sets of probes expression were measured after 4 days of injections. However, no change in protein level was observed. In vitro, the level of NL-1 decreases after 72 hours of exposure to Aβo1-42, following the decrease in neuron viability. Finally, female 3xTg mice show a decrease in NL-1 at 4 months. In addition, the second hypothesis that the absence of NL-1 will lead to increased toxicity has been confirmed. Aβo1-42 injected NL-1 KO mice performed poorly in spatial object recognition and in the Morris water maze, and had greater neuronal loss than all the other groups tested. This study therefore confirms the close relationship between NL-1 and Aβo1-42, possibly providing a new therapeutic target or biomarker for the development of therapies in the early stages of AD.

364	Comparaison de la force musculaire des membres inférieurs, de l’équilibre, de la mobilité et de la fonction chez les femmes âgées avec incontinence urinaire d’urgence ou mixte et les femmes âgées sans incontinence	Context : After the age of 65, the prevalence of urinary incontinence (UI) is one in two women. A positive correlation between falls and urgency UI (UUI) or mixed UI (MUI) has been identified. However, lower-extremity impairments in older women with UUI/MUI have not been thoroughly investigated. The primary goal of this study was to compare lower limb strength, balance, mobility and function in older women with and without UUI/MUI. The secondary goal was to evaluate the association between these measurements and UI severity.  Methods : Forty older women with and without UUI/MUI completed standardized tests to gather data on UI symptoms (ICIQ-UI SF questionnaire) lower limb strength (knee flexor/extensor dynamometry, 30-Second Sit-to-Stand Test), balance (Single Leg Stance Test, Four Square Step Test, Activities-Specific-Balance-Confidence questionnaire), mobility (10-Meter Walk Test, 6-Minute Walk Test) and function (Human Activity Profile questionnaire, SF-12 questionnaire).  Results : Significant differences in balance and mobility were observed between groups.  Women with UI had shorter single leg stance times both on the dominant (p˂0.001) and non-dominant (p˂0.005) sides, lower balance confidence scores (p=0.01) and slower gait speeds (p=0.01). Women with UI also reported a significantly lower self-perceived health (p=0.01). No significant differences were observed in knee flexor/extensor strength and in function. No significant correlations were found between the severity of the UI symptoms reported by women with UI in the ICIQ-UI-SF and the measurements of lower limb muscle strength, balance, mobility or function  Conclusion : The results from this pilot study suggest balance and mobility impairments in high-functioning older women with UUI/MUI. More studies are needed to confirm these results. By reporting power calculation for sample size, this pilot study provides a useful basis to design and conduct larger studies.

365	Brief report : impact of challenging behavior on parenting stress in mothers and fathers of children with autism spectrum disorders	Challenging behaviors are a known predictor of high parenting stress in families of children with autism spectrum disorders. However, few studies have evaluated the effect of reducing challenging behaviors on parenting stress. The purpose of our study was to (a) examine the impact of reducing the frequency and severity of challenging behaviors on parenting stress and (b) compare the effects of family-centered support and parent education on changes in parenting stress. Both high severity of autistic symptoms and of challenging behaviors were predictors of parenting stress. Furthermore, receiving family-centered support were associated with larger reductions in parenting stress. Overall, our results suggest that reducing challenging behaviors with family-centered support may be preferable to produce collateral reductions in parenting stress.

366	Latent variable language models	There has been a renewed interest in generative modeling/unsupervised learning for language for downstream natural language understanding tasks. In this thesis, we explore the augmentation of standard language models with latent variables. In the first chapter, we provide a brief introduction of language models, the classical n-gram treatment and the more common Neural Language Models in use today. We also briefly introduce variational autoencoders and the recent work improving upon them. In Chapter 2, we review work that explores the space where latent variable models and language models intersect. We then empirically analyse the effectiveness of a couple of these methods. In particular, we re-implement the models from Bowman et al. (2015) and Yang et al. (2017), and benchmark them against the Penn Treebank dataset with some experiments of our own. In Chapter 3, we discuss an ICML submission: Generating Contradictions, Entailments and Neutral Sentences. In this work, we encode source sentences to a latent distribution space and attempt to manipulate it from there to generate sentences corresponding to the given logical entailment. While our efforts are unsuccessful, we believe that enabling controllable latent variable distributions is an interesting direction to pursue. In Chapter 4, we conclude with a review of the content covered in the thesis, and a higher-level discussion of what possible avenues of future work could resemble.	language models , probabilistic models , deep learning , neural networks , latent variables	en	22131.0
367	Étude de l’impact des collectionneurs sur la préservation et la conservation du jeu vidéo	This thesis proposes an incursion into the world of video games and the struggle against its unavoidable deterioration. It aims to determine the extent of this coming challenge and recommends possible ways to assure the lasting qualities of video games. The final objective resides within the proposition that communities of collectors can influence the preservation of the medium and try to determine if this influence is positive or negative. The study first addresses classic collecting to better understand what makes a collector and what motivates its behaviour. Afterward, we explore the problematic of video game preservation, looking at the coming difficulties while exploring possible solutions to counter the damages to the video game heritage. Finally, the thesis links these two themes while defining the video game collector with all of their idiosyncrasies and questioning its outlook toward the preservation of the medium. With the help of a questionnaire distributed into these communities, we then try to answer our guiding question looking at the impacts of collectors on the preservation of the video game medium.	conservation , ROM , Video game , Collector , Emulator , Gameplay , Serialization	en	22064.0
368	Répétition et musicalité dans l’univers « underground » américain : interférences entre le cinéma structurel et la musique répétitive	This master thesis, entitled “Repetition and Musicality in the American Underground universe: Interference between Structural Film and Repetitive Music,” develops the idea of a musicality specific to “structural” film (Sitney 1979) by establishing certain correspondences between this type of “experimental” cinema and the so-called “repetitive” music – which take place, at the turn of the 1960s, in the heart of the same underground universe in New York, in the same institutions (universities, museums, art galleries) and in the same “parallel circuits” (Desjardins 1999, p. 223). Structural filmmakers (Snow, Frampton, Landow, etc.) keep meeting repetitive composers (Glass, Reich, and Riley). In an interview from the Millennium Film Journal, Philip Glass recalls the program of a session given jointly with Michael Snow: “In fact, there was a period in which I’d show a film of Michael’s in the first half of the concert and I’d play in the second half. We showed either Wavelength or Back and Forth. What linked us together was the preoccupation with process (Glass cité dans Simon 1983-1984, p. 137).” The identifiable connections between these musical and cinematographic tendencies (see Noguez 1985; Desjardins 1999; and Sitney 2008) attest to a common objective for filmmakers and musicians: to deepen the relationship between the formal components of the medium. This deepening goes through various processes: (1) rejection of any teleology by an emphasis on the process and the work in layers; (2) questioning the primacy of the narrative structure by a repetition creating textures and spaces; (3) reflections on the technique and the medium used (camera, film, magnetic tape recorder) by the practice of the loop; (4) interrogations on the bases of the cinematographic and musical languages by experiments on the temporal organization of the work. Thus, for example, comparing the singularity of the repetitive musical regime of Steve Reich's piece It's Gonna Rain (1965), and the singularity of the repetitive audio-visual regime of Hollis Frampton's film Critical Mass (1971), we discover in the cyclical and mechanical configuration of this film a structural musicality.

369	Imaginaires basques et cinéma : trois explorations filmiques	This research-creation project explores Basque imaginary and its expression in cinema. For this purpose, three films will be studied in order to uncover the various facets of this imaginary and its evolutions. The first chapter will focus on a television mini-series directed by Orson Welles, Around the World with Orson Welles (1955), more specifically the first two episodes, shot in the Basque Country. We will observe how Welles utilizes his persona and his knowledge of ‘mise en scène’ in order to mythologize the Basque people and share their culture across the world at a time when said culture is strongly censored in Spain by Franco’s regime. The second chapter proposes a study of Ama Lur (1968) directed by Nestor Basterretxea and Fernando Larruquert, a film whose style represents an attempt to transcribe the Basque language in visual form and was the first Basque feature film produced under the dictatorship. Finally, the last chapter will analyze Julio Medem’s Vacas (1992). It will focus on how Medem employs recurring elements of the Basque imaginary and hijacks them so as to deconstruct them critically.  To conclude, we’ll take a succinct look at the film Euskara ez dut mintzatzen, the creative endeavor accompanying this thesis. We’ll briefly discuss the creative process behind this documentary essay as well as the influence the written, theoretical portion ultimately had on the making of the movie.	basque , mythe , histoire , culture , cinema , Basque , imaginary , myth , history , culture , nationalism , identity	en	22036.0
370	Du pont du baleinier aux laboratoires du Muséum : circulation des objets et savoirs marins à la fin du XVIIIe siècle en France	Examining a specific publication, l’Histoire naturelle des Cétacées (1804), this study seeks to determine how Lacépède managed to compose his classic work of cetology without having seen a single whale in his entire life. The operating hypothesis is that, while referencing numerous well-read naturalists’ and other authors’ works, Lacépède was in fact exploiting the knowledge held by the persons that were the most familiar with the species: the whalers. Since this vernacular maritime knowledge does not appear clearly in the book, we will investigate the naturalist’s methods, sources and relationships with other fellow natural philosophers of the Museum d’histoire naturelle to try to understand the role seamen could have played in this work. To help us examine the complex mechanisms of the circulation of natural knowledge, we will benefit from a bibliography mostly composed with research on the Atlantic world, highly comprehensive on these topics. We will carefully take into consideration the political, scientific and cultural context of early nineteenth century France.

371	« Au service d’un autre roi » : les troupes étrangères allemandes au service du royaume de France (1740-1763)	The memory of the French Revolution often refers to the victory of the Nation. The Revolution created the nation state, but also the standing army of citizen-soldiers, thus rejecting mercenary enterprise and the use of foreign troops. However, the reality is quite different, since the armies of the Revolution and of the many French Republic all had foreign contingents, the most famous being the French Foreign Legion. Even today, the use of private enterprise in warfare is again booming. During the warring period from 1740 to 1763, which saw two great European wars —the Austrian Succession (1740-1748) and the Seven Years (1756-1763) wars—become world wars, the use of foreign troops increased in the kingdom of France. It was not solely the case in the armies of the Rois Très-Chrétiens: foreigners served in all European armies, notably in those of England, Spain, Prussia, Austria and Russia. They were not only used to inflate the ranks of the armies, but also to seek expertise in military knowledge. In the middle of the 18th century, the Prussian model was in fashion and was introduced to France by the German standing foreign regiments. This phenomenon has been neglected by the literature and by the military history (except regarding Swiss and Irish troops). This research seeks to fill this gap. Using social and cultural history, as well as the history of representations, it aims at understanding who these foreign soldiers were, where they came from, and what were their motivations to serve for France. Ultimately, this thesis examines the German and the French military cultures in the 18th century and highlights the role of German foreign regiments in cultural and warfare transfers.

372	Les chartes de donations en Île-de-France au XIIe siècle : les exemples de l'abbaye Saint-Pierre-de-Montmartre et du prieuré Saint-Martin-des-Champs	This thesis studies the charters of donations of two monastic establishments of the Ile-de-France in the twelfth century: the priory Saint-Martin-des-Champs and the abbey Saint-Pierre-de-Montmartre. This research concerning 160 ecclesiastical charters is based on the analysis of the social and religious relations that follows from the gifts offered by French royalty and aristocracy to these two monasteries. The overall objective is to highlight that the practice of donation plays a central role during medieval society and that it has engendered, perpetuated and consolidated religious and social interactions in linking them to the ideological framework of the ecclesia. The first stage of this research examines the anthropological and medieval historiographies of the gift and on the practice of donation in the Middle Ages. Then, we establish the historical context on the Île-de-France region during the reign of Louis VI, Louis VII and Philippe II, so between 1108 and 1223. The last step analyzes the practice of donating to The Middle Ages from a social point of view, among others the relations that are established by repeated donations between aristocratic families and the two monasteries under study. We also investigate the religious ideology surrounding the gift as a means of apprehending the salvation of the soul for the actors who, by this practice, are running the salutary spiritual mechanisms for their redemption. Finally, we address the global implications that affect the whole of medieval society, including public ceremonies and donation confirmations by the aristocratic and religious elite.

Une lecture synchronique d’inspiration narrative de Ga 5,1-17 
(et, en partie, de Ga 2,19-21; 5,18-6,10 et 6,15)"	What is « Biblical » self-love? Is it an absolute or a utopia, or is it narcissism, even a sin of selfishness ...? Is it a concept that evolved during the « progression » of the people of God, from alliance (s) to alliance? Can one speak of self-love when we analyze, in its context, the following statement: « [...] love your neighbor as yourself (Lv 19,18) »? This statement is often repeated at the center of several New Testament writings, particularly in the Synoptic Gospels (Mt 19,19 and 22,39; Mk 12,31; Lk 10,27), Paul's letters (Rom 13,9 and Ga 5,14) and the letter of James (2,8). This research is essentially limited to a synchronic reading of verses 5, 1–6, 10 of Galatians. This reading is inspired by a modified Culpepper model, on communication in a narrative, that excludes the real author and the real reader. This reading begins with the conclusion at the end of Galatians: «For what is important, is neither circumcision nor uncircumcision, it is a new creature» (Gal 6,15). The key to interpreting this reading is this            « new creature», a fundamental concept within the whole of the « narrato-preaching ». Paul, an implicit author and a « narrato-preacher », presents many stories (Paul, Jesus, Galatians, Israel ...), often in disorder, to the implicit readers and the « narrato-preached ». The main story exposed is that of the Galatians who, in the initial situation of the quinary plan, seem to be diverted from the one good gospel (1,6) and the truth (5,7) and who, in the final situation, are lead to become a new creature filled with a love of the neighbor and of oneself, thus seeking the good of both (ἀλλήλων: 5,13.15.26 and 6,2). This final situation is characterized by a love in action that the narrato-preacher compares metaphorically to a walk (5,16.25) in the freedom of the Spirit of Jesus Christ and, ideally, to a race without relent (2,2 and 5,7.9). For this final situation to be feasible, a prior denouement must take place. Indeed, the Galatian must, a priori, choose individually what is good for him and, consequently, take advantage of Christ (5,2) by standing up (5,1). Thus, by persuasion (5,8), faith (5,6) and grace (5,4), the former « self » of Galatians must die (2:20) and (re) become a « living » new creature (2.19-20, 5.6.25) filled with the love of Christ, a self-giving love. The denouement and the final situation in Galatians, using concentrism and / or chiasm, presents an obedience to the good gospel in the form of a race in love (in a collectivity, of ourselves and others) preceded by a walk (6,1-10) which is possible after the choice to become a new living « self » (standing-self-giving love), obedient (5, 7) to the truth and diverted from circumcision, law, flesh ...

374	Aging and language : maintenance of morphological representations in older adults	Studies employing primed lexical decision tasks have revealed morphological facilitation effects in children and young adults. It is unknown if this effect is preserved or diminished in older adults. In fact, only few studies have investigated age-related changes in morphological processing and results are inconsistent across studies. To address this issue, we investigated inflection morphology compared to orthographic and semantic processing in young and older adults. Twenty-six adults aged 60–85 and 22 younger adults aged 19–28 participated. We probed verb recognition using a sandwich-masked primed lexical decision paradigm. We investigated lexical decision using different prime presentation times (PPTs) (33, 66, and 150 ms), and prime types with priming conditions involving orthographic (e.g., cassis—CASSE ‘blackcurrant—break’), regular inflection morphological (cassait—CASSE ‘broke—break’), and semantic primes (brise—CASSE ‘break—break’) and their controls, while measuring response accuracy and reaction times. Response accuracy analyses revealed that older participants performed at ceiling on the lexical decision task, and that accuracy levels were higher compared to young adults. Reaction-time data revealed effects of age group, priming condition, and an interaction of age group and morphological priming, but no PPT effects. Both young and older adults presented a significant facilitation effect (reduced reaction times) in the orthographic and morphological priming conditions. No semantic effects were observed in either group. Younger adults also showed a significantly stronger morphological priming effect, while older adults showed no difference between orthographic and morphological priming when comparing priming magnitudes. These findings suggest (1) that regular inflectional morphological processing benefits lexical access in younger French adults, confirming studies in other languages, and (2) that this advantage is reduced at older ages.

375	Rule violation errors are associated with right lateral prefrontal cortex atrophy in neurodegenerative disease	Good cognitive performance requires adherence to rules specific to the task at hand. Patients with neurological disease often make rule violation errors, but the anatomical basis for rule violation during cognitive testing remains debated. The current study examined the neuroanatomical correlates of rule violation (RV) errors made on tests of executive functioning in 166 subjects diagnosed with neurodegenerative disease or as neurologically healthy. Specifically, RV errors were voxel-wisely correlated with gray matter volume derived from high-definition MR images using voxel-based morphometry implemented in SPM2. Latent variable analysis showed that rule violation errors tapped a unitary construct separate from repetition errors. This analysis was used to generate factor scores to represent what is common among rule violation errors across tests. The extracted rule violation factor scores correlated with tissue loss in the lateral middle and inferior frontal gyri and the caudate nucleus bilaterally. When a more stringent control for global cognitive functioning was applied using Mini Mental State Exam scores, only the correlations with the right lateral prefrontal cortex remained significant. These data underscore the importance of right lateral prefrontal cortex in behavioral monitoring and highlight the potential of rule violation error assessment for identifying patients with damage to this region.

376	La science dans l’œuvre d'Ernest Hello, source d’une poétique symbolique : anéantissement et correspondance	Whenever  the  critique  studies  the  work  of  Ernest  Hello,  it  is  generally  in  order  to consider him an obscure mystic, isolated by and from his century. Adopting the épistémocritique approach, this essay proposes to upend this perspective by drawing particular attention to the different issues, debates and polemics that abound in an atmosphere  of  scientific  and  technological  upheaval  without  precedent  characterizing  the  Second Empire, in order to explain certain esthetical extravagances found in Hello’s work. Based  primarily  on  the  intuition  that  Hello  was  profoundly  convinced  that  his apologetics could find in the science of his century an important ally, the analysis of this essay focuses  on  the  adaptation  of  scientific  knowledge  in  his  writing.  This  adaptation,  which  is, moreover,  a  dynamic  one,  can  only  seem  surprising,  not  only  because  in  that  period  science becomes, according to numerous doctrines, an argument against metaphysics, but also because Hello is considered, at first glance, as a spiritual author. Yet,  scientific  knowledge  imparts  the  semantical  richness  of  his  writing  and  offers additional arguments in favor of his eccentricity, his axiomatic yielding to a mystical form of deixis that borrows from a myriad of scientific knowledge, the frontiers of which are shattered  by the crisis of the 19th century, and which often participates in the creation of the elements of mystical cognition and symbolical illustration particular to Hello. The  analysis  considers  several  articles,  where  it is  possible  to  grasp  through  which particular  prisms  Hello  anticipates  the  symbolic  scope  of  the  inventions  of  his  century,  and several fragments, where it is possible to perceive the mechanisms of a cognition of mystical  annihilation that ties theoretical assertions with a deixis based upon heteroclite knowledge and that create impressive poetical structures serving a discourse on the ineffable.	épistémocritique , correspondance , science , technique , Symbolism , Mystical Annihilation , Correspondence , Ether , Infinitesimal Calculus , Technology , Catholicism , Philosophy , Theology , 19th Century Crisis	en	21995.0
377	Gestion des attentes et cadrage chez les entraîneurs de la LNH : la saison 2016-2017 des Canadiens de Montréal	This thesis examines expectation management as performed by the two different head coaches of the Montreal Canadiens during the 2016-2017 season along with the frames used to this end. Knowing that 1) failure to meet expectations is a key factor in head coach dismissals (Humphreys et al., 2016) and that 2) the NHL has the highest turnover rate in North America for that profession (Zinser, 2008), the work environment of the fabled Montreal Canadiens appeared to provide fertile ground to address questions linked to those phenomena. Nearly all media interviews given by Michel Therrien and Claude Julien over a full season were studied through discourse analysis, using the concepts of expectation management and framing. Specifically, this thesis investigates whether coaches try to manage expectations and if certain modus operandi or tendencies can be extracted while compiling an inventory of frames used in this context. It was found that both head coaches displayed adroitness and idiosyncratic traits in expectation management and in framing reality. Claude Julien, for instance, was more self-contained than his predecessor in using the Stanley Cup frame. Frames that pertained to preparation, efforts and contingencies were most frequently used. Certain forms of denialism also appeared during successful spells while zones of tolerance proved to be quite useful in difficult times. This thesis should be viewed as an exploration of public expectation management in sports rather than a comprehensive picture as it explores a single season while drawing on no other research, non-existent it seems in this peculiar niche.	disconfirmation , framing , expectation management , NHL , discourse analysis , Montreal Canadiens , media , head coach	en	21961.0
378	From early relationships to preacademic knowledge : a socio-cognitive developmental cascade to school readiness	This study aimed to test a four-wave sequential mediation model linking mother–child attachment to children’s school readiness through child executive functioning (EF) and prosociality in toddlerhood and the preschool years. Mother–child attachment security was assessed when children (N = 255) were aged 15 months and 2 years, child EF at age 2, prosocial behavior at age 4, and finally cognitive school readiness in kindergarten (age 6). The results revealed three indirect pathways linking attachment to school readiness: one through EF only, one through prosocial behavior only, and a last pathway involving both EF and prosocial behavior serially. These findings suggest that secure attachment may equip children with both cognitive and social skills that are instrumental to their preparedness for school.

379	Sleep and aggressive behavior among toddlers: investigating directionality of associations	This study examined the reciprocal associations between sleep (duration and quality) and aggressive behavior in toddlers. The sample consisted of 82 children (43 boys and 39 girls) and their parents who completed two assessments, when children were 2 and 3 years old. At both time points, children wore an actigraph for 3 consecutive days to assess their sleep patterns, and both their parents reported on their child’s aggressive behavior. The results indicated negative associations between sleep quality at age 2 and both parents’ evaluations of aggressive behavior at age 3; in contrast, the relations between aggression at age 2 and sleep (duration or quality) at age 3 were small and nonsignificant. In line with studies of older children and adolescents, these results suggest that sleep difficulties are more likely to favor the emergence of aggressive behavior among young children than the converse.

380	Economic evaluations of a pharmacogenomics test for Statin-induced myopathy in secondary cardiovascular prevention	Statins are the mainstay of treatment for dyslipidemia. Statin-induced myopathies are thought to be a major cause of patients discontinuing statin treatment. Myopathy diagnoses are based on creatine kinase (CK) elevation, which is compared to age-gender specific CK upper limit of normal values. Studies have shown, however, reference CK values are not representative of all population subgroups. Thus, CK tests have limited diagnostic capacity due to poor internal validity and limited external validity. A pharmacogenomics (PGx) test for statin-induced myopathies is in development for patients who have initiated statin therapy and who have mild to moderate CK elevation. We conducted economic evaluations of this hypothetical PGx test using two modelling techniques: a Markov health state model and a discrete event simulation (DES) model. We evaluated the economic models with a lifetime horizon from the Canadian payer perspective for high cardiovascular (CV) risk patients initiating a statin in secondary prevention. We found that even more important than the choice of modelling technique when evaluating the economic value of diagnostic tools, was the assessment of the diagnostic test false-positive and false-negative results. In this thesis, we have proposed an approach for interpreting diagnostic test results broadly such that physician and patient behaviours are akin to test errors. This definition addresses the clinical utility of the test in influencing physician prescribing recommendations and, importantly, patient decisions to adhere to therapy. This point is especially true for preventive medications, such as statins where the long-term benefits of therapy depend on patient adherence. Articles I and II present the model results from the Markov health state model and the DES model. We found that, although the Markov and DES model results differed slightly, the qualitative model results were in agreement. A PGx test for statin-induced myopathy was cost-effective at a relatively low willingness-to-pay (WTP). In the probabilistic sensitivity analyses, the Markov and DES strategies were favoured in at least 90% of the model simulations with a payer WTP as low as $6,150 and $12,000 per quality-adjusted life year, respectively. Article III was a reflection on the implications of model results presented in Articles I and II. Articles I and II highlighted that a totally inaccurate PGx test (i.e., false-positive rate [FPR] = false-negative rate [FNR] = 100%) would yield a positive incremental net monetary benefit for the payers. This result is explained by the risk imbalance between the benefit in reduction of CV events for patients suffering from mild to moderate myopathy compared to the extremely low risk of rhabdomyolysis. Although the totally inaccurate test result helped us understand the consequences of test errors, we recognize that a PGx test that is completely inaccurate, is not a plausible solution. The PGx test must be clinically valid and account for long-term physician and patient behavioural responses to the test results. As we have argued, the economic value of the PGx test for statin-induced myopathy in high CV risk patients depends on its ability to influence lifetime adherence to statin therapy.  Overall, this thesis highlights the importance of assessing the economic consequences of test errors. The assessment of test errors should not be limited to an a priori supposition of test performance parameters. The complete range of FPR and FNR test values should be investigated to fully understand the economic consequences of diagnostic tests. This is even more important when the diagnostic test is used to prescribe a long-term preventive medication.

381	Mécanisme(s) d'action de l'insuline dans la prévention de l'hypertension et la progression de la tubulopathie dans le diabète : rôle de hnRNP F, Nrf2 et Bmf	Diabetes mellitus is a complex metabolic disorder characterized by abnormal glucose homeostasis, resulting in higher plasma glucose due to an absolute or relative deficit in insulin production or action. People with diabetes have an increased risk of developing complications including diabetic nephropathy (DN), which is the major cause of developing end stage renal disease (ESRD) and is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Although, type I and type II diabetes (T1D and T2D) are developed by different mechanisms, there is no major pathophysiological difference between nephropathy progression and ESRD in both diabetes.  Tubulopathy including tubular apoptosis/atrophy and tubule-interstitial fibrosis is known to be final marker for DN progression. Hyperglycemia and oxidative stress are associated with hypertension and tubular injury; their precise molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Intensive insulin treatment for T1D patients, including daily insulin injections is the most effective therapy but is associated with drawbacks such as hypoglycemia. The aim of this thesis is to identify downstream target genes or molecules of insulin action as potential therapeutic targets to counter DN progression. Firstly, we investigated whether insulin affects renal Nrf2 expression in T1D and studied its underlying mechanism and reported that insulin treatment normalized hyperglycemia, hypertension, oxidative stress, and renal injury; inhibited renal Nrf2 and Agt gene expression; and upregulated heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein F and K (hnRNP F/K) expression in Akita mice. In vitro, insulin suppressed Nrf2 and Agt but stimulated hnRNP F/K gene transcription in HG via p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p44/42 MAPK) signalling in RPTCs. Inhibition with siRNAs of p44/42 MAPK, hnRNP F, or hnRNP K, reversed insulin inhibition of Nrf2 gene transcription. We further identified an insulin-responsive element (IRE) in rat Nrf2 promoter that binds to hnRNP F/K. In hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies, renal Nrf2 and Agt expression were downregulated, whereas hnRNP F/K expression was upregulated, indicating insulin-mediated effects on Nrf2 and Agt expression largely occur independently of its glucose-lowering effect.  Secondly, the underlying mechanism of insulin action on preventing RPTC apoptosis was studied. In the present study, a Tg mouse overexpressing human Bcl2-modifying factor (Bmf) in RPTs was created and characterized. Furthermore, the molecular mechanism(s) of insulin action on preventing Bmf-induced RPTC apoptosis and loss in diabetic mice were investigated. To study the effect of insulin on Bmf expression, Akita mice implanted with insulin, specifically those overexpressing hnRNP F in their RPTCs, were used. Bmf-Tg mice exhibited higher systolic blood pressure (SBP), urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR), RPTC apoptosis and more urinary RPTCs than non-Tg mice. Insulin treatment and hnRNP F-overexpression in Akita mice suppressed RPTC Bmf expression and apoptosis. In vitro, insulin inhibited HG-induced Bmf gene expression in RPTCs via p44/42 MAPK signaling. Transfection of hnRNP F siRNA prevented insulin inhibition of Bmf transcription. HnRNP F inhibited Bmf transcription via hnRNP F-responsive element in the Bmf promoter.  In summary, this thesis demonstrated that chronic Nrf2 activation by hyperglycemia aggravates renal dysfunction via enhanced intrarenal Agt expression and RAS activation in diabetes. It was demonstrated that insulin inhibits Agt, Nrf2, and Bmf expression in RPTCs via hnRNP F and hnRNP K expression and, subsequently, attenuates hypertension and kidney injury in Akita mice. This study identifies renal hnRNP F/K, Nrf2 and Bmf as potential targets for the treatment of hypertension and kidney injury in diabetes.

382	Rôle du métabolisme du glucose dans le phénotype tumoral hépatocytaire	"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a morphologically and functionally heterogeneous cancer. For several decades, the involvement of glucose metabolism in tumor cells has been widely studied and several key features have been observed including increased glucose consumption, increased lactate production, or a ""metabolic switch"" more commonly known as the Warburg effect. The adaptability of cancer cells in a nutrient-restricted microenvironment becomes evident since they can easily modify their metabolic phenotype under different conditions. On the other hand, the intense metabolic activity displayed by the liver complicates the detection of primary tumor foci by clinical imaging especially by positron emission tomography (PET). This medical imaging technique, based on the substantial ability of neoplastic cells to consume large amounts of glucose, does not efficiently allow to differentiate between healthy and HCC tumor cells. Therefore, studies closely related to the metabolism of HCC cells are of great interest not only to understand their glucose dependence but also their capacity to adapt to a harsh microenvironment. The main objective of this project was to functionally characterize HCC cells by comparing their metabolism to that of non-tumor cells. In this context, we first studied primary cultures of normal hepatocytes as control cells: we demonstrated that major metabolic alterations occurred immediately after hepatocytes are removed from the liver and that these changes could persist or increase during culture. Indeed, a drastic decrease in metabolites related to antioxidative stress, Krebs cycle activity (TCA) and energy production was noted, accompanied by a significant reduced respiratory capacity when compared to liver cells in situ. The study of HCC Dt81Hepa1-6 cells, a derivative of Hepa1-6 cells, demonstrated enhanced tumorigenicity in vivo when compared to their parental cell line. Furthermore, we showed that the tumorigenic potential of these Dt81Hepa1-6 cells was partly based on their capacity to uptake surrounding glucose but also on their ability to use their stored fatty acids under glucose-restricted conditions. Targeting HCC Dt81Hepa1-6 cell metabolic reprogramming by sodium oxamate, a known inhibitor of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), not only confirmed their greater metabolic plasticity with decreased tumorigenicity but also increased mortality when combined with cisplatinium (CP). Moreover, the association of glycolytic gene overexpression with increased tumorigenicity and mortality in patients with HCC led us to consider the possibility of targeting the metabolic processes used by highly tumorigenic HCC cells to potentiate the effectiveness of current chemotherapeutic drugs. Metabolomic analysis also allowed us to note that besides the intrinsic ability of Dt81Hepa1-6 cells to efficiently adapt to their microenvironment, HCC cells rapidly display a metabolic strategy by preferentially activating some specific metabolic pathways that favors their tumorigenicity both in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, we have been able to identify a metabolic signature associated with increased tumorigenicity in HCC that heralds glycolytic and hypoxia pathways as being critical."

383	Expérimentation de la cartographie conceptuelle comme dispositif de collecte de données en vue de l’évaluation des apprentissages	Concept map is a very versatile and multipurpose knowledge representation tool in education (Cañas et al., 2003, Cañas and Novak, 2008; Marchand and d'Ivernois, 2004). In the domain of assessment, many have recognized its potential to assess dimensions of learning that are not captured using traditional instruments (Edmondson, 2005; Novak and Cañas, 2008, Ruiz-Primo, Schultz, Li and Shavelson, 2001). Nevertheless, scientific knowledge about it is still scattered and incomplete, despite the long tradition of this tool in education, spread over a few decades. Through three articles, this dissertation aims to deepen knowledge about the modalities of production, grading and scoring of concept maps. The first article focuses on the differences between response processes when the map is produced in a traditional way on paper with a pencil or using a computer with a dedicated software. To do this, eight Secondary IV students in science and technology completed a concept mapping task while verbalizing their thoughts aloud. In addition to underscore some sequences of actions and strategies inherent to each modality, the analyses of this study highlight difficulties encountered by the participants during the performance of the task. These observations are a reminder of the importance of prior training in concept mapping. The second article describes the development of a software to assist humans during the generation of a concept map using texts, this map can ideally serve as a reference map for grading maps produced by students. The software was tested by considering the themes of the two tasks submitted to students in the other two parts of this research and its performance was evaluated by comparing the maps extracted with the software and the maps extracted manually from the same texts. Although, overall, the results of this test are quite encouraging, it still seems premature to use these maps for the use initially targeted by the software. The article, however, identifies other potential and less restrictive uses of the software and lists some areas for improvement. The third and final article explores the modelling of scores from concept maps of 84 Secondary IV students in science and technology using the partial credit model (Masters, 1982). By evaluating the psychometric properties of a concept mapping task in science and technology, especially by examining the assumption of local independence and the assumption of unidimensionality that characterizes the measurement models from the family of Rasch models, this study highlights some peculiarities in the internal structure of scores and challenges some of the conventional approaches to note concept maps. Each of these three articles provides additional insights into the use of concept map as a data collection tool and contributes to the validation process of this tool for the assessment of learning.

384	Implication des récepteurs de la mélatonine dans les troubles neurologiques et le diabète de type 2 et identification de régions clés du récepteur MT1 responsables de sa sélectivité fonctionnelle	Melatonin is a neurohormone mainly released from the pineal gland in a circadian manner acting through two G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) called MT1 and MT2. Melatonin regulates many important physiological functions. Regulation of dopamine (DA) and glucose levels are two of them but how they do this is not clear. Extracellular DA levels are mainly regulated by its transporter (DAT) which mediates DA reuptake into presynaptic nerve termini to prevent DA receptor hyperactivation in the presynaptic cleft. Consequently, we verified the role of DAT in the regulation of the DA system by melatonin. We showed that MT1 and MT2, by interacting with the immature non-glycosylated form of DAT retain DAT in the endoplasmic reticulum thus regulating DAT cell surface expression and DA reuptake. Consistently, mice with targeted deletion of MT1 and MT2 show markedly enhanced DA uptake in striatal synaptosomes and decreased amphetamine-induced locomotor activity. Collectively, we revealed here a molecular link between the melatonin and DA systems, which is based on the formation of a molecular complex between melatonin receptors and DAT. To better understand the role of melatonin on the regulation of glucose levels, we studied the involvement of genetic variants of MT2 in the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Previous studies showed that natural loss-of-function variants of MT2 associate with T2D risk. To determine more precisely the defective properties linked to T2D risk we monitored spontaneous and melatonin-induced activation of different signaling pathways by 40 MT2 variants. We show that defects in melatonin-induced Gαi and Gαz activation and spontaneous βarrestin-2 recruitment are most significantly associated to T2D risk. Experimental results correlated well with those predicted by evolutionary lineage analysis. This work will help to propose personalized treatments for MT2 variant carriers to recover their defective responses. Sequencing of MT1 gene of 9393 individuals resulted in the identification of 32 natural MT1 variants. MT1 wild-type and variants were functionally characterized in bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) assays. We showed that MT1 activates Gαi/o, Gα12 and Gα15 proteins and recruits βarrestin-2. Analyzes of results by non-linear matrix factorization revealed the existence of 5 clusters characterized by different signaling profiles. Computational homology modeling of the 3D model of MT1 helped to determine the impact of each variant on receptor activation and interaction with G proteins and βarrestin-2. Collectively, our data illustrate that natural variants are powerful tools to understand the molecular basis of GPCR function. Overall, this work contributes to our understanding of the function of melatonin receptors and highlights their importance in the regulation of the DA system and glucose homeostasis. Our results will open new, personalized therapeutic options for patient suffering from a defective DA system or T2D.

385	Se représenter dominant et victime : sociographie de la doxa coloniale israélienne	In a predominantly postcolonial world, Israel sets itself apart as its domination of another people, the Palestinian Arabs, is still ongoing. While a growing number of scholars, including Jews, address the Israeli-Palestinian issue as settler colonialism rather than an ethnic conflict between national groups, the question arises: how is such domination still possible in this mass media era? More specifically, why are there so few Israelis challenging this rule from within, especially considering that it contradicts the public discourse of their state’s manifold attempts to be acknowledged as democratic and enlightened? To answer this question, this thesis proceeds to analyze Israeli common sense knowledge in order to detect the mode of knowledge, embedded in social relations, used to comprehend ethnonational relationships, but also how this doxa legitimizes the domination over the Palestinians. Empirically, this sociology of knowledge is based on a corpus of eight autobiographies written in English by Jewish Israeli politicians and activists, some Zionist (Chaim Herzog, Michael Oren, Shimon Peres and Lea Rabin) and some anti-Zionist (Susan Nathan, Ilan Pappé, Miko Peled and Nissim Rejwan), and published over the last twenty years. Their analysis highlights the mainstream definition of Israeliness—which stresses Palestine as an exclusive Jewish property, the Nazi genocide as a recurrent threat that justifies any military response, and affiliation to the West as a guarantee of moral superiority—and how it fosters a relationship to the world centered on intra-Jewish ethnic solidarity that excludes any identification with Arabness. Moreover, a careful look at the hegemonic relationship to otherness, as reproduced or challenged by these autobiographies, reveals a twofold dynamic of colonial dispossession aimed at discrediting and erasing the relationship to space, time and culture of both the Palestinian Arabs and the Jews who do not abide by a Zionist definition of Judaism.	autobiographies , Sociology of knowledge , Settler colonialism , Zionism , National identity , Social memory , Structural discourse analysis	en	21786.0
386	Overrepresentation and disparity of Black children reported under the child protection system : the need for effective cross-system collaborations	This three-paper dissertation examines the overrepresentation of Black children reported to  child protection services in Canada. The first and second papers examine rates of service disparities using clinical-administrative data provided by a child protection agency for a sample of Black, White, and other visible minority children residing in Montreal, Quebec. Findings from the first paper reveal that compared to White children, Black children’s protection reports were five times more likely to be screened in, substantiated, and brought to court. Black children were also five times more likely than White children to enter out-of-home placement. Findings from the second paper demonstrate disparity in exits from the child protection system through comparison of Black, White and other visible minority children on time spent in out of home placement and likelihood of family reunification. Of these three groups, Black children spent the longest time in out-of-home placement and had a lower proportion of children experiencing family reunification. This decreased likelihood of reunification was statistically associated with three variables: placement instability, age of the child and type of maltreatment.  The accessibility of support services within a child’s community to help moderate exposure to risk conditions has been offered as a possible solution in addressing the overrepresentation of Black children.  The third paper in this dissertation uses qualitative inquiry employing a thematic approach to highlight some of the challenges faced by a collaboration between a child protection agency and community organization. The creation of the partnership sought to reduce overrepresentation of Black children receiving services from the child protection system.  It aimed to improve socioeconomic conditions faced by Black families by providing access to support services to address their needs in a culturally adapted manner.  In depth-interviews from members of the stakeholder committee composed of management staff from both the child protection agency and community organization cited challenges pertaining to the child protection agency’s organizational context, level of socio-political support and organizational culture as obstacles to an effective partnership.   Together, these three papers document the nature and potential causes of overrepresentation and disparity faced by Black Canadian children.  It suggests that the disproportionate need faced by Black families is an important factor explaining their differential treatment within child protection systems. This study also highlights some of the potential barriers in implementing solutions.

387	Essays in empirical asset pricing	This thesis has three chapters in which I develop tools for comparisons and dynamic analysis of linear asset pricing models.  In the first chapter, I introduce the notion of dynamically useless factors: factors that may be useless (uncorrelated with the assets returns) at some periods of time, while relevant at other periods of time. This notion bridges the literature on classical empirical asset pricing and the literature on useless factors, where both assume that the relevance of a factor remains constant through time. In this new framework, I propose a modified Fama-Macbeth procedure to estimate the time-varying risk premia from conditional linear asset pricing models. At each date, my estimator consistently estimates the conditional risk premium for every useful factor and is robust to the presence of the dynamically useless ones. I apply this methodology to the Fama-French five-factor model and find that, with the exception of the market, all the factors of this model are dynamically useless, although they remain useful 90 percent of the time.  In the second chapter, I infer the time-varying parameters of a potentially misspecified stochastic discount factor (SDF) model. I extend the model of Gospodinov et al. (2014) to the framework of conditional SDF models, as the coefficients and the covariances are allowed to vary over time. The proposed misspecification-robust inference is able to eliminate the negative effects of potential useless factors, while maintaining the relevance of the useful ones. Empirically, I analyze the dynamical relevance of each factor in seven common asset pricing models from 1963 to 2016. The Fama-French’s three-factor model (FF3) and five factor model (FF5) have been the overall best SDFs in the last 50 years. However, since 2000, the best SDF is CARH (FF3 + momentum factor), followed by FF5 as the second best. Apart from traded factors, the results bring a nuance on non-traded factors. We analyze the relevance, for linear pricing, of a human capital model inspired by Lettau & Ludvigson (2001) and Gospodinov et al. (2014).  The third chapter proposes a method for ranking Fama-French linear factor models according to investors’ preference for higher-order moments. I show that adding a new Fama- French factor to a prior Fama-French model systematically leads to a better model, only when the preference for higher-order moments is moderate (in absolute value). When the preference for higher-order moments is important or extreme, the four-factor model of Carhart (1997) has a better pricing ability than all the Fama-French models. An analysis of models with non-traded factors confirms the relevance, for linear pricing, of the human capital model analyzed in the second chapter. However, I show that this relevance is effective only for investors with null or very low preferences for higher-order moments.

388	The distributive effects of trade unionism : a look at income inequality and redistribution in Canada’s provinces	"In a context of declining distributive justice, this thesis sets out to answer a fundamental ques- tion: Do trade unions shape more equal societies? It aims to investigate whether, despite an in- creasingly hostile environment, trade unions still act as a countervailing power to the forces of capital, promoting equality and solidarity in the distribution of economic resources. Answers are provided through an assessment of the relationship between various dimensions of trade union power, market income inequality, and income redistribution in Canada’s provinces over the last few decades. The thesis also examines whether various patterns of membership composition con- dition the distributive impacts of trade unions. The investigation is set in an original framework combining theories from many perspectives. Power resources theory, which posits that distributive outcomes reflect the balance of power be- tween labour and capital, acts as the main frame of reference. This main frame is complemented by theoretical extensions relative to endogenous sources of union power, the conceptualization of capital power resources, and the income composition trade union members. The membership composition argument – suggesting that the egalitarian effect of trade unions is moderated by the income profile of members – is the most extensive addition to the dominant theory and is built from an integration of economic theory and rational-choice theories of preferences for redistribution. The research design consists of a quantitative analysis of provincial macro-level data from Canada’s provinces over different periods ranging from the early 1980s to the early 2010s. The subnational design, beyond providing a rare laboratory for the study of comparative trade unionism and capitalism, offers a sample in which key relationships can be arguably more easily isolated and studied. Drawing from recent methodological advancements, the bulk of the analytical strategy relies on multilevel analyses of time-series-cross-sectional data using random effect models. This strategy allows for the simultaneous analysis of predictors expected to affect distributive outcomes differently over time. It also opens up possibilities for a substantive evaluation of slow moving trade union and political variables. Despite great changes to the political economy of the provinces over the period analyzed, re- search results suggest that the distributive impact of trade unionism over the last few decades should be understood as egalitarian, but moderate. The effect is moderate as trade unions appear to reduce inequality and favour redistribution only within the middle and upper income segments of the distribution. This targeted impact was found to have much to do with the income profile of unionized individuals. Unpacking the income composition of membership shows that members are disproportionally located in those income segments where the egalitarian impact of unions is significant, suggesting that union solidarity is bounded within the income limits of the unionized population. The results also show that traditional measures of trade union power derived from a “power-in-numbers"" perspective offer an incomplete assessment of union influence. When the evaluation of union power is limited to density levels, much of trade unionism’s distributive impact goes unnoticed."

389	Être l’artisan de son propre mieux-être au travail : le remodèlement d’emploi, ses antécédents et ses résultantes	As the job market is becoming increasingly uncertain and precarious, it is crucial to identify ways in which employees can take proactive initiatives at work to anticipate and to adapt to change (Grant and Parker, 2009). One of the concepts that has identified some of these initiatives is job crafting, that is to say the changes that employees can bring to the limits of their job (Wrzesniewski and Dutton, 2001). However, several models of job crafting have been put forward in recent years, and as such, the operationalization of the concept has several shortcomings. The first objective of this thesis is to propose an integrative model of job crafting, integrating several previously postulated dimensions in a coherent and parsimonious whole. Furthermore, as job crafting has been linked to several positive outcomes for employees and organizations, the second objective of the thesis is to clarify the contribution of its dimensions to the various repercussions experienced by workers. Finally, job crafting being a self-initiated behavior, a third objective of the thesis is to determine if certain work characteristics can help foster job crafting, beyond the personal characteristics of the employees. To answer the first objective, the first article compares the two most prominent models of job crafting in the literature (Wrzesniewski and Dutton, 2001, Tims, Bakker and Derks, 2012) and as exploratory factorial analyses demonstrate that the two models are mostly complementary, the second article presents an integrative, seven dimensional job crafting model. This model is based on a conceptual recension of all job crafting models (n = 10, including theses). At the end of this recension, seven dimensions emerged: five expansion dimensions of job crafting; task, relational, cognitive, developmental and environmental crafting, and two contraction dimensions of job crafting; task and relational crafting. A series of exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses confirm the theoretically proposed structure of seven dimensions. In order to answer the second objective, job crafting dimensions were correlated with several outcomes: psychological health at work, meaning at work, person-job fit and performance. In the first article, job crafting was related to most of the outcomes six months later, and in the second article, a transversal study, expansion dimensions were positively associated with positive dimensions of psychological health at work, while contraction dimensions were positively related to its’ negative dimensions. In addition, some types of expansion job crafting, more specifically cognitive, development and task crafting, were more strongly related to the various outcomes. Finally, to answer the third objective, the third article compares the individual and organizational determinants and measures the relative contribution of proactive personality, approach / avoidance temperaments, and Karasek’s (1998) work characteristics on job crafting. Hierarchical linear regressions indicate that while controlling for personal characteristics, the organizational predictor that explained the most job crafting variance is employee decision latitude.	job crafting , Job crafting , Well-being at work , Meaning at work , Work performance	en	21767.0
390	De la théorie marxiste de l’exploitation capitaliste à l’idée de justice	"The principal objective of this thesis is to propose a complementary analysis on under-development. Our point of view is that: There are many causes of the extreme poverty. Therefore, capitalist exploitation is one of the causes meanwhile it has been neglected or ignored in many theories in the world. To better defend that position, we are going to examine some of those theories, especially those in which the question of under-development is developed, focusing on the philosophical discourse and based on the justification of existence. That discourse is on lack of coherence. In effect, authors like Peter Singer or John Rawls profess it and do not care about it or only care little about putting a nice etiological diagnostic of poverty.   In the contrary to other ideas defended in Marxist theory of the capitalist exploitation, we are going to make use of some central themes of that theory to show that either in local or global level, capitalism exploitation in which result poverty are two aspects of the same reality. Despite the pertinence of some Marxism critics, necessary that might be coming back to that theory, it is good because it help according to us to better understand the “underlying reality” or to better understand the «etiological cause"" of poverty in other to fight against that flail. That is why at the end of the analysis; we pay attention on the question of the opportunities of development.   To end up, we have to understand that, going back to the sources of Marxist thought or especially, going back to sources of Marxist theory of capitalist exploitation imposes itself as soon as you want to give a concrete, specific and brief answer to the following questions: Why poverty and what are the causes and consequences? How can we fight against it? The fact of going back to sources of Marxist thought aims to a reappropriation of ideal communist and revolutionary that a redefine norms and roles being Henceforth controlling commercials and international relations. The effect of the normalisation of those relations will be to eliminate the various forms of exploitations identified and so to prevent that some notions should be poor until   being forced to resort or to count on the help or to count on the international help for its development.  That type of normalisation will be possible if we accept a restructuration of capitalism in other to fill the deficit of the social and economic justice that it is suffering for. Our dissidence toward Marxist orthodox has consideration but on our voluntary of rethinking from an etymological analysis of poverty, the conditions of the possibility of good economy and generally for the very righteous world, very free and very equalized, without revolutionary perspective."

391	Les récits en réseaux : manifestations sociotechniques du phénomène choral et l’émergence intermédiatique d’un nouveau type de spectateur	The hyperlink film became popular in the 1990s, part of a particular sociotechnical context that greatly changes the way we think and perceive the world. This thesis argues that the exponential presence of hyperlink films on international screens from the 1990s is one of the symptoms of the appearance of a new type of spectator, whom showcases new habits and reading skills, which encourage multitasking and activate more his working memory. This spectator was able to emerge under a precise conjuncture of elements that revolves around the central and paradoxical notion of network. Moreover, the Internet is a reflection and incarnation of that notion that is both problematic and fascinating. We discuss the role that the Internet play in the changes we propose from the 1990s onward by reconciling its dynamics with a form of narrativity. Beyond the hyperlink form in cinema and hypermedia, we explore the structure of certain television series that became more complex at the same period. This new type of spectator is better able to engage in complex, fragmented and multi-narrative works in the information era of the network society. In the end, this thesis establishes a dialogue between the structure of the hypermedia, TV seriality and the network society and draws the outlines of a new spectatorial model, based on an interdisciplinary approach.	internet , Network , Ensemble films , Network narratives , Spectator , Interactivity , Complexity	en	21733.0
392	The ambivalence of people who offend and of their prosocial relatives	Criminologists have long looked at the relatives of people who offend to understand their conduct, notably to understand how they eventually desist from crime. Though no consensus has been reached concerning the mechanisms of social influence, they have agreed that those who love and care for offenders have the power to restrain offending, to the extent that they endorse a prosocial orientation (Cullen, 1994; Giordano, Cernkovich, Rudolph, 2002; Hirschi, 1969; Sampson & Laub, 1993; Sutherland, 1947). Research has given support to many of their propositions, and relatives are now routinely integrated into theories of crime and desistance. However, to date, these works have had little to say about these influential actors. What are the consequences of being in a relationship with someone who acts unlawfully? How is one’s personal experience affected by this conduct? As a matter of fact, a small but burgeoning literature about offenders’ relatives suggests that their experiences are also shaped in significant ways as they maintain relationships with someone who breaks the law (Condry, 2007; Christian & Kennedy, 2011). As opposed to the premise upon which desistance research rests, however, it is the antisocial orientation of those who offend that affects them.  Combining insights from these two scholarships, this thesis argues that both offenders and their prosocial relatives are influenced by their relationship to one another, and that this influence specifically occurs at the confluence of the prosocial and the antisocial. It is further proposed that because it is simultaneously tainted by offending of one of its members—a conduct that breaches well-known moral norms—and by the prosocial orientation of the other, this social bond is likely to generate ambivalence.  This thesis is dedicated to individuals who navigate this antithetical universe where conventions and law-breaking commingle. Specifically, it seeks to examine the ambivalence hypothesis among both offenders and the prosocial individuals who care for them. Empirically, this endeavour is carried out through a multiple methods design composed of two independent, yet connected, studies. The qualitative component first examines ambivalence among prosocial relatives through data from semi-directed interviews conducted with 18 individuals who support someone who has offended. Second, the quantitative piece relies on a quantitative dataset containing information on 1,318 individuals who have received a sentence in the province of Québec, Canada in order to analyze ambivalence among those who break the law.  Findings from qualitative analyses suggest that being related to someone who offends is an experience that often generates ambivalence. In order to decrease that tense state, participants employ a series of strategies, which, when effective, allow them to maintain their relationship with the person who had acted unlawfully. Quantitative analyses, for their part, suggest that ambivalence among those who offend emerges from heterogeneous social environments that exist somewhere between the prosocial and the antisocial. The implications of these findings are explored.	Ambivalence , Attitudes , Offenders , Relatives , Ambivalence , Attitudes , Tolerance , Social bonds , Social influence	en	21704.0
393	Makkoto umai zeyo, this is truly delicious : the social construction of taste in the region of Kōchi, Japan	The food of Kōchi is more than mere sustenance to the inhabitants of the region as it is both a way to divide the social world and an economic asset. Based on fieldwork in this region of rural Japan, this research examines how incorporated beliefs and pragmatic considerations participate in the social construction of taste for emblematic foods in Kōchi. On one hand, this research seeks to uncover how incorporated beliefs, values that are learnt, embodied, performed and transmitted, structure taste in the region. Habitus, culture and identity are some of the tools at our disposal to analyze how standards of taste are incorporated into people’s daily lives. Literally speaking, we taste the social world through the food we eat. On the other hand, this research investigates how pragmatic considerations and immediate concerns brought on by material conditions help fashion taste in Kōchi. In one of the poorest prefectures of Japan, the urgent need for revitalization makes the cuisine of the region a valuable resource for the residents of the region. Economic opportunities, government strategic planning and the forces of capitalism fuel the creation of new dishes and the promotion of traditional flavors. Thus, embedded representations that give meaning to food and regimes of values that ascribe worth to food shape residents palates. Finally, such an analysis needs to recognize that both taste preferences (i.e. the choices we make) and taste perceptions (i.e. how we experience flavor) are closely bound together. The social construction of taste is part of an integrated system that frames culinary choices as well as the sense of taste. A comprehensive model that combines complementary facets of what constitutes taste can further contribute to a better understanding of the contextual nature of deliciousness.

394	L’art de bâtir à Río Bec (Campeche, Mexique)	Since their discovery, at the end of the 19th century, the architectural remains of the Río Bec region (Campeche, Mexico) have been repeatedly observed, described and interpreted. However, despite all the attention they have received, little research has been done and published concerning their construction. Archaeological reports and publications sometimes devote a few lines to this topic, but almost all of these have focused primarily on formal and decorative features, with the main objective of defining stylistically and chronologically the architectural tradition to which they belong. The present study aims to approach the Rio Bec architecture in a different way by exploring its technological dimension. Through the analysis of the quarries found at the eponymous site, the thorough examination of the architectural remains situated in their surroundings, and the petrographic characterization of the surviving building materials, this study attempts to reconstruct the chaîne opératoire employed by the builders. It offers a presentation of the means and methods used in each stage of this chain, from the selection and acquisition of the raw materials to the completion and inauguration of the buildings, including the processing and shaping of the materials, as well as the conception, execution and evolution of each component of the buildings. Such an approach provides fresh insights not only into this unique architecture, but also into the organization of construction activities and labor in this part of the Maya lowlands.

395	Brain white matter damage and its association with neuronal synchrony during sleep	The restorative function of sleep partly relies on its ability to deeply synchronize cerebral networks to create large slow oscillations observable with EEG. However, whether a brain can properly synchronize and produce a restorative sleep when it undergoes massive and widespread white matter damage is unknown. Here, we answer this question by testing 23 patients with various levels of white matter damage secondary to moderate to severe traumatic brain injuries (ages 18–56; 17 males, six females, 11–39 months post-injury) and compared them to 27 healthy subjects of similar age and sex. We used MRI and diffusion tensor imaging metrics (e.g. fractional anisotropy as well as mean, axial and radial diffusivities) to characterize voxel-wise white matter damage. We measured the following slow wave characteristics for all slow waves detected in N2 and N3 sleep stages: peak-to-peak amplitude, negative-to-positive slope, negative and positive phase durations, oscillation frequency, and slow wave density. Correlation analyses were performed in traumatic brain injury and control participants separately, with age as a covariate. Contrary to our hypotheses, we found that greater white matter damage mainly over the frontal and temporal brain regions was strongly correlated with a pattern of higher neuronal synchrony characterized by slow waves of larger amplitudes and steeper negative-to-positive slopes during non-rapid eye movement sleep. The same pattern of associations with white matter damage was also observed with markers of high homeostatic sleep pressure. More specifically, higher white matter damage was associated with higher slow-wave activity power, as well as with more severe complaints of cognitive fatigue. These associations between white matter damage and sleep were found only in our traumatic brain injured participants, with no such correlation in controls. Our results suggest that, contrary to previous observations in healthy controls, white matter damage does not prevent the expected high cerebral synchrony during sleep. Moreover, our observations challenge the current line of hypotheses that white matter microstructure deterioration reduces cerebral synchrony during sleep. Our results showed that the relationship between white matter and the brain’s ability to synchronize during sleep is neither linear nor simple.

396	A longitudinal investigation of sleep and daytime wakefulness in children and youth with concussion	A high proportion of adults who sustain a concussion identify changes in their sleep during the acute stage, typically reporting an increased need for sleep or nonrestful sleep. Our understanding of sleep following concussion is less well understood within a pediatric population. In this study, we investigated the trajectory of sleep and daytime sleepiness in a prospective cohort of 40 children and youth (6–18 years old) with concussion, 40 age-and sex-matched healthy children and youth, and 40 with upper-extremity orthopedic injury. Evaluations occurred during the acute stage (<2 weeks) and at 3-, 6-, and 12-month postinjury using the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children and the Postconcussion Symptom Scale. There were no significant differences within- or between-group differences in sleep across all four time points with analysis of the groups as a whole. When groups were divided by age (6–11 and 12– < 18 years), there was a significant difference in the ability to initiate sleep for the younger concussed group during the acute stage, compared with healthy controls, as well as significantly greater daytime nap duration that decreased over time. Significant correlations were also found between the frequency and duration of daytime naps and Postconcussion Symptom Scale total score and subscores (cognitive, physical/migraine, mood, and sleep) in the concussed group during the acute stage. Our results suggest that in a group with noncomplicated concussion, children and youth have transient alterations in daytime sleepiness that are related to concussion symptoms. Younger children may be more vulnerable to disturbances in sleep and daytime wakefulness.	Concussion , Sleep , Daytime wakefulness , Longitudinal , Children , Youth	en	21626.0
397	Association of patient to nurse ratio and hand washing stations and infection-related hospitalizations in hemodialysis patients	Background and Objectives: Infection is the second most common cause of death in the hemodialysis population after cardiovascular disease. However, infection rates tend to vary depending on the dialysis facility. The facility-level variables responsible for this variation are unknown. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted with a cohort of 6,124 adult chronic hemodialysis patients in 21 participating dialysis facilities using linked data from two administrative databases (RAMQ and Med-Echo). Patients were followed from January 1, 2007 to March 31, 2013. Kidney transplant recipients, peritoneal dialysis patients and home hemodialysis patients were excluded. Facility-level variables were obtained by direct measurement or by interviewing the staff at participating facilities. Facility-level variables measured in this study include: patient to nurse ratio, mean distance of dialysis station to hand-washing station or alcohol-based rub dispenser (ABHRD), hand-washing station ratio and ABHRD ratio. The association between these facility-level variables and infection-related hospitalizations (IRH) was estimated using mixed effects Cox models and Kaplan-Meier curves. Results: A patient to nurse ratio of ≥4 (HR = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.55-0.95) and an ABHRD ratio of ≥1.5 (HR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.60-0.95) were associated with a significantly reduced risk of IRH. A mean distance from the dialysis station to the nearest washing station of <4.75 m (HR = 1.30, 95% CI = 1.03-1.64) and a hand-washing station ratio of <3.15 (HR = 1.38, 95% CI = 1.08-1.76) were associated with a significantly increased risk of IRH. There was no association between mean distance of dialysis station to ABHRD and risk of IRH. However, these associations disappeared depending on the sensitivity analysis done.    Conclusion: The association between IRH and the facility-level variables analyzed in this study is unclear.

398	Accumulation et translocation de cinq éléments traces dans la biomasse aérienne de végétaux d’intérêt  dans un contexte de phytoremédiation	Ecological services provided by nature has led to the flourishment of greening initiatives in urban areas as a means to sustainable development and for the reclamation of devalued polluted sectors in terms of environmental, social and economic perspectives.  One impediment associated with such greening initiatives on polluted sites is the resulting contamination of aboveground plant material by trace elements.  My research project consisted of a trial of fifteen species selected for their urban predominance, ecological relevance, edibility, prospective commercial use and phytoremediation potential. Species were grown for 15 weeks in a tunnel greenhouse, in pots filled with contaminated technosol containing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons as well as Cu, Zn, Se and Ag. The soil was also spiked with Cd as a model of highly hazardous and mobile trace elements. The prime objective was to quantify the accumulation of trace elements in the aboveground biomass in terms of relative concentration as well as true extracted quantities (phytoextraction). The second objective of the project was to determine translocation patterns within aboveground tissues: stem, leave and reproductive organs (flowers or fruits).  Within the trial, some species were selected for their potential hyperaccumulation of Se (mustard) and Cd (wonder-berry and common yarrow). Our results indicated that accumulation and translocation patterns differed greatly according to species and trace elements. The potential hyperaccumulator species morel and yarrow as well as mustard stood out from other by their potential to accumulate Cd and Se respectively. Exclusion mechanisms were observed for Cd translocation within reproductive organs for all species that produced fruits or flowers, however all edible parts were above standard recommendations in terms of Cd concentration. Regarding these results, soil characterization and contamination should be an essential preliminary step before any greening initiative can take place, in order to select the appropriate species.	translocation , technosol , zinc , greening , phytoremediation , trace element , copper , zinc , silver	en	21607.0
399	Évaluation de l’implantation du Rond-point, un Centre d’expertise périnatal et familial de toxicomanie : fondements de l’action et expériences des familles	The objective of this thesis was to evaluate the implantation of the Rond-point, a perinatal and familial expertise Centre of drug addiction. The center provides integrated services for parents and their children under the age of five. This psychosocial innovation has been implemented since the fall of 2013 in Montreal. The case study uses a qualitative approach for this thesis. To collect the research data, various sources were used. For example, semi-structured individual and group interviews, documentary sources and a socio-demographic fact sheet were used to collect data for the evaluation. These data were collected from various respondents, including promoters, managers and stakeholders involved in the Rond-Point as well as families receiving services. Thematic analyzes of content and triangulations of data are carried out. The first chapter describes the problem for which the intervention was designed and applied, its scope, its consequences, the various interventions and the methodological aspects. The second chapter describes the participatory approach that led to the logic modeling of the Rond-point. Thus, the organizations involved in the Center, the clientele served, the provision of services and the intervention approaches are presented. Moreover, the realization of the logic model is described as well as the elements requiring a clarification. Among these, there are partnerships, human resources, the intervention approach, clientele and offer of services. As for the third chapter, the experience of the first families who have received services from the Center are described in general terms, but also in relation to three profiles that emerge according to the perceived effects of their participation. These profiles are: either the families for whom the Rond-point brings transformation, others for whom it is a holder, but not irreplaceable and finally others for whom it constitutes a gateway to other services. Overall, all families appreciate the Rond-point, although they would like more services, offered on a more regular basis and better structured. At last, the fourth and final chapter discusses the main findings, their implications for both research and clinical practice, and the strengths and limitations of this thesis. In general, the two studies presented are complementary. The main findings indicate that families have support needs related to parenting. In addition, the intensity of the service offer is questioned as well as the plausibility of the links between the activities and the expected effects. Recommendations are proposed to improve the Rond-point.	Substance-abuse parents , evaluation of implementation , integrated addiction services , logic model	en	21600.0
400	Du jugement éthique et esthétique dans «Les misérables de M. V. Hugo» de Barbey d'Aurevilly	As a Catholic writer vehemently opposed to progress, social or otherwise, Barbey d’Aurevilly maintains a paradoxical rapport with literary criticism, which he exercised with exceptional productiveness from 1832 to 1887, albeit often reluctantly. His vigorous expression, cruel epithets and shocking ideas gave him the reputation, not without reason, of being a particularly vicious critic. Amongst all the judgments Barbey has pronounced against great authors, those on Victor Hugo are surely some of his most controversial : his series of six articles on Les Misérables, published in Le Pays from April 19 to July 30, 1862, immediately caused an enormous scandal. Since then, literary commentators have shed light on the rhetorical violence of these articles, sometimes at the expense of their more subtle passages. Our own analysis will focus squarely on Barbey’s critique of Les Misérables. We aim to show that these articles crystallize the broad tendencies as well as the implicit contradictions of Barbey’s literary criticism, which is at once dogmatic and instinctive, and which conjugates the ethical and the aesthetical, occasionally to the point of muddling them. Finally, we intend to develop the idea that the conflict between Barbey and Hugo is, above all, of an ideological nature.

401	Régulation de l’activité de Dicer par TRBP dans la biogénèse des micro-ARN	Micro-RNAs (miRNA) are small non-coding RNAs that act as post-transcriptional gene regulators. They are part of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) where they serve as guides to target mRNAs by sequence complementarity and inhibit their translation. Together, miRNAs can regulate the translation of virtually every protein in the cell. This confers miRNAs a central role in various cellular processes such as the development of organisms.  To be functional, miRNA must undergo maturation through a highly regulated pathway where they are first transcribed, then cleaved in two steps by endonucleases Drosha and Dicer and, finally, loaded onto the Argonaute protein (AGO) to form the RISC complex. This thesis focuses on the Dicer cleavage step and its regulation by the TRBP cofactor, which is a protein that can simultaneously bind Dicer and its pre-miRNA substrate. The first objective of the thesis is to develop a new protocol for the expression and purification of human Dicer with the intent to improve the yields of existing methods and facilitate its in vitro characterization. We optimized Dicer expression in a human cell expression system that uses an engineered HEK93-6E cell line grown in suspension. Then, we developed a 3-step purification protocol allowing for Dicer purification in a single day. Moreover, these steps were carefully optimized to minimize losses and maximize Dicer stability. The purified Dicer was then analyzed using SEC-MALS and negative-stain EM to confirm that it was a well-folded monomer. Finally, we biochemically characterized Dicer by measuring its binding to a pre-miRNA substrate by EMSA and steady-state kinetic studies. Through these experiments, we calculated new values of kcat and KM that are consistent with a mechanism that involves a conformational change of the Dicer-substrate complex prior to the cleavage step.  The second objective was to characterize the effect of TRBP on Dicer activity. To do this, we first tested different pre-miRNA substrates with Dicer in presence of TRBP and showed that TRBP was both an activator and inhibitor of Dicer. Indeed, TRBP is an activator at low substrate concentration and an inhibitor at higher concentration. Next, we characterized the detailed mechanism of the effect of TRBP by a using a combination of binding and steady-state kinetic experiments. Our final model shows that low TRBP concentration is necessary for activation of Dicer activity at low substrate concentration. Our model suggests that TRBP exerts its activation function without reducing Dicer’s specificity for its substrate. These new results suggest that TRBP evolved to efficiently activate Dicer without modifying the specificity of the reaction.	Dicer , miRNA , TRBP , regulation , purification , kinetics	en	21576.0
402	Un éclairage sur l’influence des évaluations mutuelles entre enseignants et étudiants en contexte universitaire : vers une conception resocialisante	This article draws on a doctoral thesis problem in which a portrait of research on evaluation in the university context has been achieved. It questions the role played by mutual assessments in relations between university teachers/students in the context of the emergence of modes of governance which give assessment an important regulatory role. Most research, centered on accounting data evaluations, seem to neglect what is negotiated in the interaction between those actors, through their mutual evaluations. We propose a resocializing perspective on assessment to examine particular issues at the heart of their dynamic.

403	"Automated external defibrillator geolocalization with a mobile application, verbal assistance or no assistance : a pilot randomized
simulation (AED G-MAP)"	Background: Shockable rythms are common among victims of witnessed public out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), but bystander defibrillation with a public automated external defibrillator (PAED) is rare. Instructions from the emergency medical dispatcher and mobile applications were developed to expedite the localization of PAEDs, but their effectiveness has not been compared. Methods: Participants were enrolled in a three-armed randomized simulation where they witnessed a simulated OHCA on a university campus, were instructed to locate a PAED and provide defibrillation. Participants were stratified and randomized to: (1) no assistance in finding the PAED, (2) assistance from a geolocalization mobile application (AED-Quebec), or (3) verbal assistance. Data collectors tracked each participant’s time elapsed and distance traveled to shock. Results: Of the 52 volunteers participating in the study (46% male, mean age 37), 17 were randomized to the no assistance group, 18 to the mobile application group and 17 to the verbal group. Median (IQR) time to shock was respectively 10:00 min (7:49-10:00), 9:44 (6:30-10:00), and 5:23 (4:11-9:08), with statistically significant differences between the verbal group and the other groups (p≤0.01). The success rate for defibrillation in <10 minutes was 35%, 56% and 76%. Multivariate regression of all participants pooled showed that knowledge of campus geography was the strongest predictor of shock in < 10 minutes (aOR = 14.3, 95% CI: 1.85-99.9). Among participants without prior geographical knowledge, verbal assistance provided a trend towards decreased time to shock, but the differences over no assistance (7:28 vs 10:00, p=0.10) and over the mobile app (7:28 vs 10:00, p=0.11) were not statistically significant. Conclusion: In a simulated environment, verbally providing OHCA bystanders with the nearest public AED’s location appeared to be effective in reducing the time to defibrillation in comparison to no assistance and to an AED geolocalizing mobile app, but further research is required to confirm this hypothesis, ascertain the external validity of these results and evaluate the real-life implications of these strategies.

404	Der Phänomenologiebegriff bei Kant und Reinhold	In this paper I study the sources of Reinhold’s concept of phenomenology introduced in his Beyträge zur leichteren Übersicht des Zustandes der Philosophie… of 1802. Kant renounces to take up Lambert’s definition of phenomenology, which amounts to a theory of illusion (Schein). At the time of the Dissertation (1770) as well as in the Metaphysische Anfangsgründe der Naturwissenschaft (1786) he prefers to define phenomenology as a doctrine of appearances (Erscheinungen). Reinhold for his part integrates both definitions in his conception of phenomenology and assigns to it the task of tracing how illusion operates through the world appearances.

405	Validation d’une pratique avancée en ergothérapie pour la thérapie de la main	Advanced practice development in the management of hand injuries presents a significant challenge because of hand problem frequency, consequences for the affected person and society. The objectives of this study were to validate the competencies required for occupational therapy advanced practice for people with hand injuries as well as validate an advanced practice where occupational therapists would be involved in the early management of hand therapy patients. In a first study, a questionnaire on advanced competencies in occupational therapy in hand therapy was completed by 24 experts working in hand clinics in Quebec. In a second study, 91 people with hand problems were evaluated independently by a surgeon and an occupational therapist with advanced competencies to determine the consistency of their decisions regarding confirmation of diagnosis, treatment options and recommendations. Participants then completed a satisfaction questionnaire following the consultation with each professional. The results of the first study show that occupational therapists value advanced competencies and agree with upstream surgical management for certain diagnoses such as tendinitis and sprains. In the second study, high concordance was observed between the occupational therapist and the surgeon for confirmation of diagnosis, treatment options and recommendations. Satisfaction was equivalent for both professionals. The findings of this thesis provide useful avenues for reflection to guide the training and competencies development for such practice in this area. They also provide evidence on the validity of this model of care organization where the occupational therapist in advanced practice is involved in triage and patients orientation.

406	Self-referentiality in Kant's transcendental philosophy	Inspired by the thesis of Rüdiger Bubner according to which Kant’s argumentation in the Transcendental Deduction is self-referential, I propose to extend the scope of this thesis to the transcendental Analytic as a whole. The question at stake is: What are the rules that guide transcendental critique if it is not to transgress the finiteness of its standpoint? I suggest that they are to be found in the dynamic Principles of the Analytic since these are also valid, mutatis mutandis, for the transcendental critique that describes them. In other words: these Principles are self-referential. For instance Kant claims that they are necessary for experience in general, but that their application is “contingent” (A 160/B 199). They are not necessary in themselves, no more than a necessary cause within experience is in itself necessary, but rather contingent, i.e.: dependent on another cause, as the principle of causality specifies. Now the dynamic principles are themselves contingent in their implementation, that is: dependent on the material conditions of experience in general. The transcendental conditions here are conditioned by the empirical conditions.	Kant , Bubner , Self-referentiality , Dynamic principles , Contingency , Transcendental	en	21452.0
407	Les trajectoires de vie de femmes judiciarisées ayant eu des comportements violents et résidant en maison de transition	Seeing as women commit fewer offenses than man, they were invisible for a long period of time in criminological studies. In particular, there is only a small literature about violent women because they were originally only seen as victims. However, this population presents a profile with sexospecific needs. In order to help them better, it is important to get back to the theoretical basis of the women's violent behavior. In other words, it means to identify, empirically, the characteristics, the behaviors and the needs of these women. During an internship at a halfway house, it has been possible to interact with some of these women. Consequently, the main objective of this project has become to document and analyze the life paths of women who use or have used violence and that have lived in a halfway house. Thereby, biographical semi-directed interviews have been made with three residents of the Maison Thérèse Casgrain in Montréal. The three main subjects are the living conditions, the socialization and the violence.Three factors have been identified by the participants that could explain the origin of violent behavior: social learning, traumas and drugs or alcohol addiction. Different kinds of thoughts overrun the participants mind when they committed violent behavior. These could be divided in five categories : (a) violence can get me what I want, (b) it is the victim's fault, (c) it isn't that bad, (d) I have to be scary to get people esteem or respect and (e) violence helps me defend or protect others. Positive or negative emotions were mentioned after the use of violence like feeling great and strong, stress, fear and feeling miserable. In conclusion, recommendations are made about future intervention practices to recommend and about possible future researches with women expressing violent behavior.

408	Fichte's debate with Reinhold in 1793 : the doctrine of drives and the problem of freedom	This article focuses on Fichte’s essay on Revelation (2nd ed.) and on his review of Creuzer’s book on the freedom of the will. These texts contain a critique of the theory of freedom exposed by K. L. Reinhold in the Letters on the Kantian Philosophy (1792). I argue 1) that Fichte does not find convincing Reinhold’s argument according to which the reality of freedom is accessible through an empirical “fact of consciousness”, 2) that the Reinholdian strict separation between the autonomy of reason and the freedom of the will is not acceptable for Fichte, and 3) that Fichte sees the necessity of introducing a mediation between the two Reinholdian “drives” (sensible and ethical), namely the Kantian feeling of “respect,” since morality for the finite human being has to extend its motivational force to sensibility.

409	"Kant et les conditions ""conditionnées"" de la possibilité de l’expérience"	The aim of this paper is to set out some features of Kant’s conception of transcendental philosophy. I would like to argue that this philosophy, although it is situated at a higher level of discourse than common knowledge, does not essentially transcend the limits that it sets to this knowledge. In order to achieve this, I stress the fact that Kant regards experience as a mere “possibility.” Now, the Critique of Pure Reason explains that the human understanding cannot conceive of an absolute possibility, but only a relative one, namely a possibility that is tied to conditions. And possible experience as a whole is no exception here. Hence the expression “conditions of the possibility of experience” which designates the topic of the Transcendental Analytic. This also means that experience is “contingent” (A 737/B 765). It is not in itself necessary; rather, it is dependent upon certain conditions. But then we learn that the most important transcendental conditions for this experience, i.e., the dynamic principles, are themselves “contingent” (A 160/B 199). Consequently, these transcendental conditions are not unconditioned; they in turn depend on empirical conditions, over which they have no control.

410	La collaboration interprofessionnelle lors de la prise en charge d'un polytraumatisé à l'urgence	Trauma is the leading cause of death among young adults in Quebec. Thus, the management of polytrauma in the emergency room is absolutely crucial to optimize care and prevent premature death. Unfortunately, several studies have highlighted important gaps in collaboration between the various professionals on the trauma team, creating a major challenge to the quality of care provided. This descriptive qualitative exploratory study aims to explore the experience of interprofessional collaboration (IPC), according to the point of view of health professionals, when treating a polytraumatic patient in the emergency room. More specifically, this study aims to determine the description that health professionals make of the concept of IPC in traumatology, as well as the identification of factors facilitating and limiting this collaboration. The conceptual framework to understand the interprofessional collaboration of Reeves, Lewin, Espin and Zwarenstein (2010) has served as a theoretical and structured basis for each step of this study. Individual interviews and a focus group were conducted among seven health professionals involved in the management of a polytrauma patient in the emergency room. In addition, two structured observations of the management of a polytraumatized patient were performed. Following a thematic analysis, the results show that for the participants of this study, the IPC describes itself as being the set of seven essential elements, including communication and having a common goal (the patient). The factors influencing IPC are multiple and fall into five broad categories: individual, relational, procedural, organizational and contextual. Individual factors, a category that is not part of the conceptual framework of Reeves and al. (2010), have emerged as being a major part of the IPC. In addition, the results of this study should provide a better understanding of the reality experienced by different health professionals when dealing with a polytrauma patient and appear to be the basis for future research on the development of an intervention aiming to consolidate the collaborative practices of health professionals working in this specific care context.

411	The Role of Cardiotrophin-Like Cytokine Factor 1 on the Development of Atherosclerosis	Metabolic syndrome represents a major global health problem. Its rate is constantly increasing. Cardiovascular diseases emerging from dyslipidemia conditions are a worldwide leading cause of death and morbidity, despite extensive medical research and wide range of drugs targeting atherosclerosis, obesity, diabetes etc.  Recent findings suggest the existence and persistence of low-grade inflammation in pathogenesis atherosclerosis and obesity. The “symbiosis” between metabolic and immune system is substantial and any perturbation contribute to the development of altered metabolic conditions that ultimately culminate in such disorders as obesity and atherosclerosis. The overall goal of my Master internship was to characterise the effect of cardiotrophin-like cytokine factor 1 on development of atherosclerosis and validate a long half-life derivative of cardiotrophin-like cytokine factor 1 coupled with Fc fragment of immunolglobulin G. Cardiotrophin-like cytokine factor 1 is a cytokine of the immune system with immunoregulatory activity. Cardiotrophin-like cytokine factor 1 belongs to the interleukin 6 family of monomeric cytokines. Cardiotrophin-like cytokine factor 1 is efficiently secreted in the presence of cytokine receptor like factor 1, a soluble cytokine receptor. Cardiotrophin-like cytokine 1 possesses neurotrophic activities mediated through the receptor of ciliary neurotrophic factor. Cardiotrophin-like cytokine factor 1 is a high affinity ligand for sortilin. Genome-wide association studies indicated that plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and cardiovascular disease are associated with single nucleotide polymorphisms variants regulating sortilin expression. It was observed that cardiotrophin-like cytokine factor 1 binds and activates transfectants co-expressing sortilin and receptor of leukemia inhibitory factor. Both receptors are expressed by myeloid cells and leukemia inhibitory factor is a potent inducer of anti-inflammatory M2 macrophage differentiation.  The overall objective was to investigate if the interaction of cardiotrophin-like cytokine factor 1 or cardiotrophin-like cytokine factor 1 coupled with Fc fragment of immunoglobulin G with atherosclerotic plaque macrophages will reduce the foam cell formation and development of plaque. Our work shows that cardiotrophin-like cytokine 1 expression in mice on LDLR-/- atherosclerosis model does not decrease the development of plaque. However, some results revealed a significant contribution of cardiotrophin-like cytokine factor 1 in gain of body mass without changes in food intake.

412	L’association entre la fonction diaphragmatique préopératoire et le développement de complications respiratoires de la chirurgie cardiaque	Postoperative pulmonary complications increase mortality, length and cost of hospitalization. A multifactorial reduction of respiratory system compliance occurs after cardiac surgery. The strength of the diaphragm may help patients face this increased work of breathing postoperatively. We therefore sought to determine if a low preoperative diaphragm thickening fraction (TFdi) determined by ultrasonography was associated with an increased incidence of pulmonary complications after cardiac surgery. We conducted a single center prospective cohort study from November 2015 to April 2016, including adults undergoing elective cardiac surgery. Before the operation, we measured the TFdi as well as indicators of frailty, sarcopenia and pulmonary function. We repeated TFdi measurements following extubation to characterize its evolution. The primary composite outcome of this study was the occurrence of postoperative pulmonary complications, defined as pneumonia or clinically significant atelectasis or prolonged mechanical ventilation (PMV) (>24 h). Of the 115 patients included, 34 (29.6%) developed PPCs, including 2 pneumonias, 4 PMVs and 32 clinically significant atelectasis. In multiple logistic regression, a TFdi < 40% was associated with significant and independent increase in the risk of postoperative pulmonary complications (OR 2.84 [1.14-7.07]; p=0.02). A relative preoperative diaphragm weakness is thus associated with an increased incidence of pulmonary complications after cardiac surgery. TFdi is an easily accessible marker of diaphragm weakness could therefore help identify vulnerable patients who would benefit the most from preventive strategies such as preoperative inspiratory muscle training.

413	La médiation obligatoire en droit civil comme outil pour favoriser l'accès à la justice	How far are we willing to go to encourage litigants to settle their disputes amicably? This thesis focuses on the phenomenon of mandatory mediation as a tool to promote access to justice. Through a comparative study of the various mandatory schemes in place, notably in Canada, Australia, Italy and the United Kingdom, the author seeks to debunk certain myths regarding mandatory mediation. Responding to criticisim that is often made of this phenomenon, this thesis studies the effect of the coercion to integrate the process on the benefits traditionally associated with mediation. It also addresses the dangers of this obligation, including the balance of power between the parties. Moreover, it questions the economic benefits of mandatory mediation and the effects that such an obligation may have on judicial delays. Finally, inspired by the various programs already in place, it identifies the conditions for success of a mandatory mediation scheme, particularly with regard to the choice of model, the possibilities to be exempted of it, the payment of the mediator's fees, the lawyers place in the mediation process and the cultural elements that can influence the success of a mandatory mediation program.

414	Within-subject comparison of two- versus three-implant-assisted mandibular overdenture : patient-based outcomes	ABSTRACT  Objectives: This study aims to assess the impact of an additional midline implant to support an existing mandibular two-implant overdenture, on patient-based outcomes (patients’ satisfaction and expectations). Methods: This study was nested within a previous clinical trial conducted at the Université de Montréal. Seventeen edentulous individuals (mean age: 61.9 ± 6.6 years) received three threaded implants in the interforaminal mandibular area and a mandibular overdenture using two Locator® attachments. The midline implant was left unloaded over a two-year period. At the two-year follow-up, using a standard protocol, the third implant received a Locator® attachment and the overdenture was converted to a three-implant-assisted overdenture. The clinical and perceived anterior–posterior movements of mandibular prostheses were measured before and after the conversion. Patients’ expectation and satisfaction in regard to mandibular prosthesis as well as their willingness to pay the cost for the conversion were evaluated by using validated self-administered questionnaires. Data collection was conducted at baseline and after six weeks of wearing the converted mandibular prosthesis. Socio-demographic data were also collected. Descriptive statistics and non-paramteric tests were used for statistical analysis. Results: Data analysis revealed a statistically significant decrease in the anterior–posterior movement (p = 0.005) of overdenture as evaluated by clinicians. Study participants reported an increase in perceived stability of the overdenture (p = 0.005), and in their ability to speak (p = 0.011) and to chew hard food (p = 0.012). The addition of a third implant met the expectations of 94% of patients in regard to lower denture stability, 100% for retention, and 82.4% for comfort. The 3-implant-assisted mandibular overdenture increased patients’ general satisfaction over a short period of time, but this improvement was not statistically significant. About 80% of patients would recommend this type of prosthesis to their peers but only 47% of them would agree to pay a large increase in the cost of treatment compared to 2-implant overdenture. Conclusions: The addition of a midline third implant to an existing 2-mandibular-implant overdenture will lead to better patient-based outcomes. However, the additional cost of the treatment may influence patient preferences.	Clinical trial , Dental implants , Overdentures , Mandibular prosthesis , Patient satisfaction	en	21349.0
415	Analyse et comparaison de l’effet cornéen du traitement d’orthokératologie	Myopia is a growing visual problem everywhere on a world stage. High myopia is considered as a public health problem in some region of the world. To counter this trend, many strategies were developed to slow the myopia progression, including orthokeratology. Orthokeratology is a non-chirurgical method that mold the cornea to reshape it by flattening the central region and steepening the peripheral region in order to correct the distance vision and to create an image align or in front the peripheral retina. A retrospective analysis of the orthokeratology corneal optical effect was done on 64 comparative corneal topography for the two study groups (4 curves lens (Group A) and 5 curves (Group B) orthokeratology lenses). The addition power created in mid-peripheral corneal zone was similar between the two lens designs while the central distance zone diameter was different.  A strong correlation was found between the central distance zone diameter and the addition power created for the A lens. It provides evidence that the orthokeratology lens design difference created different central distance zone diameters which can affect clinical lens choice in the case of refractive correction and myopia control purposes.	vision sciences , myopia , corneal optics , topography , orthokeratology	en	21327.0
416	Kantian Enlightenment as a critique of culture	It is puzzling to notice that in his 1784 essay on Enlightenment, Kant addresses every human being with his watchword « Have the courage to use your own understanding! », while at the same time he seems to restrict the access to the public discussion of matters of common interest to the learned persons (Gelehrte). This begs the question: Is the participation in the public debate part and parcel of Kant’s conception of Aufklärung? A positive answer to this question is given by Katerina Deligiorgi in her Kant and the Culture of Enlightenment. A critical assessment of this book will lead us however to consider that Kant has a differentiated approach to enlightenment depending on whether someone is educated or uneducated. Following Rousseau, Kant has come to recognize as a matter of fact this inequality toward the products of culture. Now the two-level conception of enlightenment entailed by this inequality becomes explicit in the 1790s, especially in the very last work Kant has published: The Conflict of the Faculties (1798).

417	Contribution of the subthalamic nucleus to visually guided locomotion	The Basal ganglia (BG) plays an important role in locomotor control. This is emphasized by the impaired walking of patients with neurodegenerative disorders that affect the BG such as Parkinson’s disease. One important structure in the BG is the subthalamic nucleus (STN), which acts as an input structure for the BG and projects to its output structures. Although the STN has been shown to display movement-related activity during reaching, the nature of its contribution to the control of locomotion, together with the characteristics of its neural activity during locomotion, is poorly known. In order to better understand this contribution, we examined the properties of the neural activity in the STN during unobstructed and visually guided locomotion. To do so, we recorded single neurons in an intact cat trained to walk steadily on a treadmill and to step over obstacles attached to the treadmill belt and moving at the same speed. We recorded 40 neurons which activity was related to the movement of the forelimb during the task. We found that during unobstructed locomotion, many of these cells (30/40) showed phasic step-by-step modulation of their activity pattern, mostly during the swing phase. Most of these swing-related cells discharged throughout the swing phase with no relationship to changes in the pattern of different muscle groups. During voluntary modifications of gait, 37/40 cells, including both cells that were and were not modulated during unobstructed locomotion, changed their firing rate in relationship to the step over the obstacle. The changes observed were mostly increases of activity, but a few cells showed decreases of activity and some showed a decrease followed by an increase of activity. These changes occurred either before the modified step and were classified as step-advanced activity, or they occurred during the modified step and were classified as step-related activity. Step advanced cells mostly showed limb-independent activity, while step related cells showed limb-specific activity. This is the first detailed account of the contribution of the STN to the control of locomotion and our results indicate that the STN is involved in the control of both unobstructed and visually guided locomotion. The results suggest that during unobstructed locomotion, the STN contributes to the general control of the limb trajectory and to both the planning and execution of voluntary changes of gait.

418	Le lien prédictif entre le sentiment d’efficacité des enseignants, l’engagement cognitif et les buts d’accomplissement des élèves de la 4e à la 6e année du primaire	Scholarly engagement is an important predictor of achievement and a protective factor against drop-out. Students’ cognitive engagement combined with mastery goals, instead of performance goals, represent a self-regulated learning that allows a better comprehension of the subject and higher aspirations in school. Many factors can favor self-regulated learning including teachers’ self-efficacy. This potential influence could be explained by the mastery classroom goal structure that the teacher sets. In this study, measures from 373 students and 38 teachers of 5 primary schools in poor neighbourhoods of Montreal were studied longitudinally with path analysis. The results show that a high teacher’s self-efficacy predicts students’ adhesion to mastery goals. It also predicts the mastery classroom goal structure that reduces students’ performance goals. Those results are, however, marginally significant and no link was observed between teachers’ self-efficacy and students’ cognitive engagement in this study.	self-efficacy , cognitive engagement , mastery goals , performance goals , classroom goal structure	en	21305.0

420	Détection des utilisations à risque d’API : approche basée sur le système immunitaire	APIs are essential ingredients for developing complex software systems. However, they are difficult to learn and use. As a result, developers can misuse them, resulting in different types of issues. Misuse of a programming interface can lead to errors that are very difficult to detect and can have consequences. Detecting these misuses is not easy. We have thus developed an approach based on the immune system, a mechanism that allows to detect known and unknown anomaly types. Here the cells of the organism will be the good uses of the API and the bad ones will be the foreign cells of the organism. The immune system has the particularity of being a decentralized system that functions thanks to detectors, T lymphocytes, whose role is to detect foreign cells. With APImmune we will therefore generate detectors that have the ability to detect risky uses of APIs. Our approach was evaluated on two sets of data and more specifically MUBench. The results show that our approach complements previous works in this area of research. In addition, the detectors can be generated from source code by abstracting the API usages and by generating artificial deviations from these usages. Moreover, for the detection purpose, only the artificial detectors are necessary, and the code used to generate them is not disclosed. Finally, the detectors can be produced for different versions of the programming interface, that brings modularity in the detection.

421	L’indépendance à tout prix : la Belgique face à la France durant l’Entre-deux-guerres	The main focus of this study is the dynamic between France and Belgium during the Interwar period. The goal is to verify if Belgium was ever a satellite of French diplomacy under the 1920 French-Belgium military alliance. Using the diplomatic archives of the Belgian Foreign Office, the study shows that, whilst maintaining the harmony between the main members of the former Allies (French, Great-Britain and Belgium), Belgium always acted in its most basic national interest. As the major events of the Interwar period unveil: (especially, the Ruhr Occupation, the Locarno Treaty, the Rhineland demilitarisation and Hitler’s election) Belgium demonstrates that she is both independent and a major player in the evolution of European politics. The breaking of the 1920 French-Belgian military alliance in 1936 is often falsely seen as a rupture of a political relationship, whereas it only represented Belgium’s way to not be involved in another war without her consent. This study clarifies the Franco-Belgian relationship during the Interwar period and demonstrates that it was not one of submission by Belgium to France.

422	Les créatifs culturels : regard sur un nouveau profil de chercheur spirituel à l’ère de l’ultramodernité	"This work revolves around the non-religious spirituality of cultural creatives and its influence in the emergence of a transmodern society, that is, humanely and ecologically sustainable. In the 1980s Western societies entered the axial turn of ultramodernity, entry caused by the global awareness of the environmental emergency caused by human activities (era of the Anthropocene). Cultural creatives who hold postmaterialist values and seem to represent according to sociologists Paul Ray and Sherry Anderson one third of Western population, are driven by an ethical and responsible vision of how we inhabit the Earth. While spirituality and personal improvement are central in their approach, I will present a portrait of this group as an ideal-type of today's spirituality, characterized by an ecosophical consciousness, which aims first at “changing oneself” to then ""change the world"", in an ethical, social and political project. This portrait would indeed distinguish itself fundamentally from the spiritual researcher ""consumer"" of beliefs. Based on a rich conceptual framework and a qualitative survey of 19 French-speaking cultural creatives, this research seeks to broaden knowledge about non-religious spirituality but also ""reclaim"" beliefs behind an alternative discourse that is likely to be important in our Western societies."

423	Par-delà tous les genres : queering Victor-Lévy Beaulieu, suivi de Querelle de Roberval (roman)	"The critical perspectives of Queering propose to study literary works that do not seem to lend themselves to it a priori in the light of gender studies. The essay Beyond all Genders : Queering Victor-Levy Beaulieu proposes a ""queering"" approach revised by the reader-response theory as well as by the deconstruction of Jacques Derrida, a methodological framework from which it is possible to produce an ""actualizing reading"" (Citton) of the novel Satan Belhumeur, published in 1981 by Victor-Lévy Beaulieu. A careful analysis of the construction of gender in fiction allows an original interpretation of the political dimension of the work, making it possible to argue that the final scene of the novel aims at ""resigning from the nation and the gender"" (Preciado). Querelle de Roberval is a process of queering in the form of a novel. Exploring the current legacy of revolutionary syndicalism, this ""labor union fiction"" relates the strike between the employees of a small sawmill and their boss. The character of Querelle, borrowed from the work of Jean Genet, constitutes an element of rout in the story. From a narrative and stylistic point of view, Querelle sows chaos. His sexual desire brings to light the constitution of the sexist and heteronormal gender that underlies the social imaginary of labor as well as the contemporary political discourses. Querelle de Roberval, by queering the territory and the ""quarrel"" of workers, begins a deconstruction of the authoritarian quest of a master in politics and literature."

424	Bien se souvenir : représentation de la violence politique et de la mort dans La Constellation du Lynx, de Louis Hamelin, suivi de La vingt-troisième nuit, roman	The October crisis has built itself, in the popular imagination, out of discourses, reappropriations, rewritings and reactions coming from a variety of perspectives on what happened. Louis Hamelin's novel La Constellation du Lynx takes part in the reappropriation process by using historical fiction. It refutes the official version and uses fiction to point out its incoherences. Our essay interrogates the novel's representations of political violence. And, by examining the historical reasoning deployed in the novel, and by pointing out usages of narrative shiftings and world duplications, as well as the elaboration of a non-narrative form of story, we analyse how the novel treats Pierre Laporte's death (Paul Lavoie, in the novel) as an insoluble enigma. The objective is to show how the novel states the impossibility to know the truth. La vingt-troisième nuit tells the story of a student that barely makes it through the police trap that resulted in 512 arrests in Montréal, 2012, May 23th. The action of Twenty-third night asks itself what would've happened if someone died during a demonstration. Readers follow Laurent, who has reasons to believe that his friend Maxime, who accompagnied him during the demonstration, died while running from the police. He searches for his friend all night. Retrospective episodes intersperses the novel, episodes when Laurent questions how he pertains with the student movement, how he shares his friends' point of view on the events, and what to believe on the social medias. Strongly aware that he stands in a critic position in the historical events, until the end, he measures his role in the crisis, as well as the forces that could influence the movement and the legitimacy of the student revolt, if his friend's death is confirmed.	1970 , Louis Hamelin , manifestations , October crisis , political violence , death , non-narrative story , conspiracy theory , truth , historical fiction , novel , 2012 student strike , demonstrations	en	21258.0
425	Le design comme levier d’optimisation de l’économie circulaire : le cas des PME œuvrant en agriculture urbaine	The development of a global vision for the circular economy, entrepreneurship and design spheres of activity involves a dynamic and complex approach. At the intersection of these three spheres lies an opportunity for understanding the operationalization of a closed-circuit economy within today’s enterprises. The latter are essential players in the transition towards this new economic model. In order to improve the implementation of circular economy (CE), the main focus is on issues related to its operationalization. The goal is to document the path taken by Quebec small and medium enterprises cognizant towards sustainable development issues, particularly working in urban agriculture, a field currently in full transformation. The question that this research proposes to answer is the following: what are the brakes and levers related to the operationalization of the circular economy among SMEs? With the growth of planetary issues due to overproduction / overconsumption as a premise, this research is building its framework on environmental sciences (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, EDDEC Institute) and entrepreneurial (Harvard Business Review) theories. With the main objective being to shed light on levers and weaknesses related to the operationalization of a CE within SMEs, the methodological approach chosen for this research is phenomenological. It aims primarily at observing, through semi-structured interviews, the journey of four different companies who are already cognizant towards sustainable development issues. The strategic design approach (Madge, Plouffe and De Coninck) will allow to conclude this research project with a proposition for solution paths in operationalization.

426	Circularité des textiles «mal-aimés», une caractérisation  du gisement postconsommation	"Currently 80% of clothing, accessories and linens sold in Canada are imported. Though not manufactured here, these textile products are collected by local organizations that sort them. However, since their main market is in reselling for export, several categories of unwanteds do not find takers and must be eliminated. In order to get a better grasp of the various forces at work, the research first explores the inner workings of production and consumption seen through the lens of Victor Papanek's durability of goods and Kate Fletcher's consumerism of fashion. It then addresses the environmental crisis, the measures introduced to reduce environmental impacts (ISO, EPR and 3RV), and tools such as eco-design and LCA. Finally, the research is concerned with the circular economy approach popularized by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation (EMF) to seize the opportunities it can offer within the textile sector. To support a transition to the circularity of textiles, the first step is to determine what are the characteristics of the clothes, accessories and linens present in the well of unwanteds post-consumer textiles which can be highlighted in new products. To discover potential outlets for these products, the textile materials available need to be quantify in order to list the physicochemical properties associated with them. The second objective is to identify the post-consumer unwanteds characteristics that can hinder or augment their recycling. The methodological approach inscribes itself into a logic of inductive research. The chosen approach is quantitative and descriptive. The goal being to obtain empirical data later transposed into statistics. During the data collection, more than 10,250 items were analyzed. The results show that the entire post-consumer textile well is composed by 47% of cellulosic fibers, dominated by cotton (39%), 42% of synthetic fibers, dominated by polyester (20%) and acrylic (17%), and 11% of animal fibers. In total, 49% of the garments are made of mixed fibers, 47% have contaminants that must be removed to collect only the fibers and 11% include liners made from another fabric. An in-depth analysis of the data has led to the development of a classification key to regroup manually the blended fibers. This new taxonomy makes it possible to obtain six new categories (NC) whose profile is unique. Supported by the science of textiles, areas of application for each NC are proposed in order to take advantage of the resulting properties. Furthermore, the analysis lead to the formulation of eco-design recommendations to facilitate their recycling. This research, conducted both at ""meta"" and ""micro"" level, lays the foundation for the deployment of a circular model for the textile industry in Québec."

427	Facebook comme outil de renseignement policier : analyse d'un réseau de motards criminels	Facing the failure of the mega-trial SharQc in 2015, which led to the release without charge of the majority of the bikers arrested during the police operation of the same name held in 2009, police organizations would benefit of reevaluating their strategies in their fight againts biker gangs. The purpose of this study was to determine the contribution of Facebook’s virtual data for police intelligence on criminal biker gangs by using a comparative approach. To do so, two networks of the members composing the targeted criminal biker gang were built, the first from police data, and the second from Facebook data. The analysis is twofold : the first section compares the centrality measures of the two networks of the members of the targeted criminal biker gang (police and Facebook network), while the second section investigates the evolution of the two networks over time. The results show that Facebook data was contemporary, dynamic and of high quality, thus constituting a considerable contribution for police intelligence. Police organizations would maximize its utility by using Facebook alongside police data.	Facebook , Criminal biker gang , Social network analysis , Police data , Social media sites	en	21216.0
428	L’éducation inclusive comme perspective pour comprendre la mobilisation d’écoles primaires montréalaises qui conjuguent défavorisation et défis relatifs à la diversité ethnoculturelle	Each year, thousands of newcomers settle in Canada. Over time, successive migratory flows have transformed the face of the country. Newcomers tend to get established in major urban areas across the country. Like many other cities in Canada, Montreal is characterized by an unprecedented social, ethnic, linguistic and religious heterogeneity, a reality which raises various issues. This diversity is reflected, amongst others, in the education system, where the school population is more diversified than ever. In multi-ethnic and disadvantaged environments, the addition of educational and social vulnerabilities often impacts students’ socio-academic experience. In order to offer to all children a fair chance to succeed, it is essential that schools concerned by these issues adapt to diversity, and mobilize themselves to meet the needs of the students they host.  This doctoral research focuses on characteristics of two Montreal elementary schools (leadership, professional practices and attitudes, relational/partnership dynamics) that deal with multi-ethnicity and socioeconomic disadvantage on a daily basis. They have been selected for this study because of their reputation for always trying to adapt to diversity on a systemic basis. In this research, the theoretical framework of inclusive education has been chosen to describe the operation of such schools. Traditionally, the concept of inclusion was mainly used to refer to the integration of students into ordinary schools and classes, which used to be segregated. Several authors now propose this perspective to rethink how schools can adapt to diversity, beyond situations of physical disabilities and/or learning difficulties.  Our ethnographic approach allowed us to integrate ourselves in the two participating schools in order to capture a complete picture of them and to identify inclusive characteristics they integrate as a daily practice. During several months, we attended a variety of school events and conducted individual and group interviews with various stakeholders (principals, teachers, professionals, parents, community actors, etc.). Our data is categorized around four main themes: leadership of the school’s principal, teaching and non-teaching staff members’ attitudes toward diversity, school-family collaborations and partnership with the community. On a daily basis, the principals of the schools implement a transformative and participative leadership. The other actors we met, teaching and non-teaching staff members, share positive attitudes related to diversity and are mobilized to meet the needs of students by collaborating. We also observed that participating schools deploy various strategies to adapt to the reality of parents and work with them to support their children’s socio-academic experience. Furthermore, the two schools nurture partnerships with various actors of the community in order to better address the needs of the students. The data analysis highlights the adaptation of these schools to diversity, an adaptation that goes beyond acknowledging and valorizing otherness. Our thesis contributes to the operationalization of a perspective such as inclusive education and to the questioning of its potential as a unifying paradigm of diverse perspectives on how to better adapt to diversity in today’s context.

429	Co-analyse de la reconstruction du savoir-évaluer d’enseignants formés à l’étranger en situation d’intégration socioprofessionnelle au Québec : une recherche collaborative	The schools in Quebec have more and more internationally educated teachers (MELS, 2014), seen as inspiring models for immigrant students (Wang, 2003) and mediators between school and families immigrants (Cruickshank, 2004). One of the greatest challenges of their socioprofessional integration concerns the adjustment of their assessment skills to the norms and values which are aimed ensure success of the largest number of students in Quebec. This is so because they have evolved in a context where evaluation serves to sanction and select the best. An analysis of recent literature review shows that the question of adjusting learning assessment practices of migrant teachers has been neglected so far (Morrissette et al., 2014, Niyubahwe et al., 2013). Thus, this thesis aims to highlight how migrant teachers reconstruct their assessment skills in Quebec schools. In this perspective, it bases on Schön's work (1983) on the (re)construction of the practitioner's repertoire of actions as well as on a socioconstructivist perspective that leads us to consider that this transformation of the repertoire takes place in the center of the interactions in working situation. This thesis is part of a research that focuses more broadly on the socio-professional integration of teachers trained outside of Quebec, who work in Montreal schools (Morrissette & Demazière, CRSH 2015-2017) and from which data collected through biographical interviews and group analysis with 5 immigrant teachers and members of their professional ecology. The analysis follows the strategy of case-based reasoning (Becker, 2016), leading to the description of two adaptive processes of reconstruction of the assessment skills: the abandonment of the non-operative ways of evaluating and the adjustment of the transversal ways of evaluating in two contexts. The second register of analysis mobilizes the perspective of the interactionist sociology of Abbott's professional groups (1988, 2003). This new theoretical perspective leads to highlighting the labor code in the area of assessment of learning, which is the object of ongoing negotiations among all the actors of the schools in Montreal.

430	Compétences d’infirmiers nouvellement diplômés d’un programme de baccalauréat basé sur l’approche par compétences : une ethnographie ciblée d’un milieu de soins aigus	In the last 15 years, two important reports (Frenk et al., 2010; Institute of Medicine, 2003) have supported the need for reform in nursing education and other health sciences curricula to build on competency-based education (CBE). This change was intended to prepare new graduates for the reality of health systems and future challenges. Few studies have focused on how newly graduated nurses (NGNs) from these reformed programs use the competencies they have developed. The purpose of this study was twofold: first, to describe the deployment of competencies of NGNs from a competency-based undergraduate nursing program in a Quebec faculty of nursing, as perceived by various actors in acute care settings and second, to examine the influence of the culture of acute care settings on competency deployment by NGNs. To guide this study, a theoretical framework integrating Benner’s professional advancement model (1982) to Tardif’s work on competency-based education and competency development (2006) was built. A focused ethnography was conducted on three acute care units of an academic hospital. Convenience and snowball sampling strategies were used to recruit 19 key actors: NGNs (n = 4), nurse preceptors (n = 2), clinical nurse specialists (n = 9) and other professionals (n = 4). Data were collected through individual interviews, focus groups and observation, and analyzed according to Roper and Shapira (2000) ethnographic nursing analysis framework. Three themes were identified to describe the deployment of competencies of NGNs. The first theme concerns the professional beginnings of NGNs, the appropriation of their new role, the fragmentation of their practice into tasks and the development of their practice. The second theme relates to the collaboration of NGNs in the interprofessional team, their difficulty in the management of the intraprofessional team with licensed practical nurses and their ability to maintain a relationship with patients and families. The last theme concerns the scientific practice of NGNs, their increased scientific curiosity and their use of scientific and credible sources that must be encouraged. The elements described in these three themes were analyzed in the light of the competency framework to conclude that the NGNs deploy seven of the eight competencies developed during their training. Organizational and individual factors were identified as influencing the deployment of competencies of NGNs. Organizational factors are orientation, stability, workload, as well as the scientific culture of the unit. Personal factors have been linked to groups of professionals: for NGNs, personality and clinical placements during their initial training; for nurses working with NGNs, to be role models, to promote integration and to denounce bullying; and for other health professionals, to recognize nursing expertise. The knowledge gained from this study provides a better understanding of the competencies of NGNs and the elements influencing the beginning of their practice. These results have implications for the various fields of nursing practice and will help improve initial training programs and ease the transition period between the academic environment and the clinical setting.

431	Application d’un modèle motivationnel à l’école primaire en milieu défavorisé : effets différentiels selon les caractéristiques des élèves	Students from disadvantaged backgrounds are more at risk of academic failure and dropping out of school. As a result, school workers are now searching for effective ways to enhance these students’ engagement in school in order to favor their academic success. The motivational model of Connell and Wellborn (1991) identifies specific teaching practices and self-perceptions that lead to higher student engagement. However, no studies have determined whether the theoretical links proposed in this model also apply to students from disadvantaged backgrounds. In addition, some student characteristics, such as their anxiety, academic performance, and immigration status, have been identified as influencing their academic success. Yet, few of them have been studied as factors influencing the associations proposed in Connell and Wellborn’s model. Consequently, this thesis aims to test the associations proposed in the Connell and Wellborn model in a sample of disadvantaged elementary school students and to examine whether these links differ as a function of student anxiety, academic achievement, or immigration status. In order to meet these objectives, we used different samples taken from a large longitudinal study in five elementary schools where grades 1 to 6 students and their teachers were surveyed. The first study of this thesis concerns 424 pupils from 3rd to 5th grade and their 45 teachers. The second study is based on a sample of 256 students from grades 3 to 5. All students and teachers answered questionnaires at the beginning and end of two consecutive school years. The first study examined the associations between teachers’ structure, autonomy support, and involvement, and elementary school pupils’ perceptions of competence, autonomy, and affiliation. This study also investigated whether the links between these teaching practices and student self-perceptions varied according to students’ anxiety and academic achievement. The results of this study first demonstrated that most students from disadvantaged backgrounds felt competent and affiliated with their teachers when the latter structured students’ behaviors and maintained warm relationships with the whole class. Moreover, results showed that low- achieving anxious students benefited the most from their teacher’s structuring practices. iii The second article of this thesis examined the links between student self-perceptions and their behavioral, cognitive and affective engagement. This study also examined how students’ anxiety and immigration status changed these associations. The results of this article highlighted the importance of perceiving oneself as autonomous and affiliated in class for the majority of students. They also identified specific self-perceptions as more important for the engagement of immigrant anxious students. In fact, these students benefited more than other students from perceiving themselves as autonomous and competent in the classroom. In conclusion, the two studies of this thesis lend partial support to the model of Connell and Wellborn. In addition, they have identified the most important teaching practices and self- perceptions for engaging students with varying levels of anxiety, academic achievement, and different migratory status. The improvement of these practices and perceptions could be targeted in interventions in order to promote the engagement and academic success of these students, especially the most vulnerable ones.

432	"«Falling stars and the Golden Age of Hollywood» : étude de la figure de la star vieillissante dans le cinéma hollywoodien des années 30 aux années 60 :
étude de cas : le méta-personnage de Bette Davis, origines et influences"	This dissertation traces the evolution of aging female stars in Hollywood’s film industry during its Golden Age, from the 1930s until the 1960s. My overarching goal is to explore the capacity of cinema to inform our memory and our self-consciousness of aging. The first chapter examines the star’s mythology, her coming of age, her her rise and fall, in films from the 1930s and 1940s, focusing particularly on the career and agency of Bette Davis. The second chapter discusses Hollywood films of the 1950s as a medium for memory (as in All About Eve, Sunset Boulevard, and The Star). Relying on the philosophical reflections of Cavell, Deleuze, Bergson, and Schefer, I examine how, and the extent to which a film can retain the past, recall it, or foreshadow the disappearance of a period of cinema’s history. In the third and final chapter, I focus on the performances of aging Hollywood stars in the 1950s and 1960s, such as Vivien Leigh, Judy Garland, Natalie Wood, and Kim Novak. In this period, Hollywood capitalizes on the aging of female stars to arouse a particular nostalgic, cinephilic affect. Female aging is presented as a grandiose performance, a tragicomic masquerade, inducing us to regard age and gender as cultural constructions, staged shows in which aging women are willingly costumed, made up, and accessorized. Whereas in the 1930s aging stars appeared surreptitiously, in the 1950s aging stars begin to fill theaters, seemingly guarding a disappearing culture and its memory, and proudly displaying their outmoded manners and tastes. They are eminent representatives of a declining Golden Age. In the 1960s, Hollywood cruelly exposes these aging stars, using an aesthetic ranging from the gory to the burlesque, in what critics called “hagsploitation,” “hag horror,” or “Grande Dame Guignol.” The figure thus put forward guides viewers through a ritual that engages with memory and recounts the passage of a period of cinema’s history. In its attempt to shape our worldview and our sense of history in this way, Hollywood’s storytelling promises to revitalize the interrogation of some of the defining problems of traditional metaphysics and critique.

433	Estudio semiótico del personaje de Jimena en el teatro : de “Las mocedades del Cid” de Guillén de Castro a “Anillos para una dama” de Antonio Gala	The objective of this thesis is to study the portrayal and characterisation of Jimena in some of the fundamental works of Cidian literature, so as to demonstrate how her diverging and converging traits build a polyhedral image, of some psychological depth, which evolved through time, adapting itself to various historic and cultural contexts. The corpus studied consists of seven works. Two theatre plays, Las mocedades del Cid by Guillén de Castro (1618) and Anillos para una dama by Antonio Gala (1973), constitute the pillars of the comparative analysis. They engage a dialogue with the two foundational poetic works establishing the Cid’s legend, the Cantar de Mio Cid (siglo XIII) and the Historia y romancero del Cid (1605). To serve as transition between Spain’s Golden Age and the twentieth century, the legend’s internationalisation process is explored in three works belonging to the same transmission chain, with clear filiation links: the drama Le Cid by Pierre Corneille (1637), the opera Le Cid by Jules Massenet (1884-85) and the movie El Cid by Anthony Mann (1961). The methodologic tools used to carry out the analysis of the theatre plays are those laid out by theatre semiotics. Making use of different contributions to semiotics by French (Ubersfeld, Ryngaert, Pruner) and Spanish (Bobes Naves, García Barrientos) authorities, the approach developed focuses on the character of Jimena, in relation with other analysis categories: action, space, time and dialogue. Specific attention is also paid to the study of all the signs included in the verbal dramatic text which facilitate the staging and making of the show and provide a character’s attributes, such as apparel, gestures and movements, or light and sound effects. In conclusion, the analysis determines that the corpus studied depicts a Jimena who, beyond her mere role as the Medieval hero’s wife, is represented in her multiple faces (in various stages of her life, as daughter, wife, mother and widow; and in the private and public aspects of her life, as a simple woman and as a great Medieval lady). Jimena’s characterisation presents differences from one work to another, but an analysis of the whole corpus can identify common traits which point out the character’s intertextual coherence, in a portrayal which reveals attractive psychological depths, humanising her and connecting her to the public. The analysis also showcases the fundamental role of Las mocedades del Cid in the legend’s transmission chain and in the evolution of Jimena’s representation through time, with the introduction of a key change in her personality that would come to define her image as a sentimental and romantic heroine.

434	Synthèse et étude d’architectures complexes à base de poly(lactide) et de poly(2-isopropyl-2-oxazoline) pour des applications biomédicales	Treatment of cancer is one of the biggest challenges in modern medicinal chemistry. The vast majority of treatments are based on chemotherapy, involving the use of cytotoxic bioactive molecules. Although effective, most of these bioactive molecules have notorious drawbacks, such as the lack of cellular specificity and limited solubility in aqueous media. A way to address these problems is to dissolve these bioactive compounds into polymer matrices. There are different types of matrices, including liposomes, micelles, nanospheres, nanocapsules, dendrimers (and star-polymers), and conjugate and linear polymers. In this thesis, we explored two different prospective polymers that can be used as matrices. Both are composed of biocompatible materials: polylactide and poly(2-isopropyl-2-oxazoline). The first part of the thesis is dedicated to the investigation of polyester-co-ether with functionalizable pendant groups. First, we developed the polyester-co-ether by copolymerization of lactones (lactide or caprolactone) with different ratios of glycidyl propargyl ether (GPE) in the bulk at 120°C in the presence of Sn(Oct)2. The efficiency of the copolymerization was evidenced by FTIR, 1H and COSY NMR analyses. However, GPC analyses displayed a decrease of molecular weights and a broadening of the molecular weight dispersity with increasing of the epoxide molar ratio in the feed. 1H NMR analyses showed that the propargyl content from the epoxide does not exceed 50%. The feasibility of post-polymerization functionalization was evaluated by coupling anthracene to the poly(ester-co-ether)s through copper-catalyzed alkyne-azide cycloaddition (CuAAC). The polyester chain was found to support this reaction. Toxicity studies showed that the poly(ester-co-ether) was non-toxic. Spherical nanoparticles were prepared from these polymers. They can be suitable nanospheres for drug delivery. The copolymerization of lactone with glycidyl ether is an interesting approach to functionalize the PLA (or poly(ester)) main chain. It is also a powerful and straightforward strategy to synthesize a large array of functionalized polymers for biomedical applications. In order to improve the synthesis of the polyester-co-ether, we investigated the copolymerization mechanism of the chain transfer reactions leading to the chain reductions and we suggested a mechanistic explanation.  In the second part of this thesis, we focused on developing star-polymers from the thermosensitive (2-isopropyl-2-oxazoline) polymer. In order to prepare a well-defined set of star-poly(2-isopropyl-2oxazoline) S-PIPOZs, we explored two different synthetic approaches: the “coupling-onto” and the “core-first” approach. Two sets of S-PIPOZs were prepared by these approaches. For the “core-first” approach, a set of S-PIPOZ was prepared by direct cationic ring opening polymerization (CROP) from a tetra tosylate-functionnalized pentaerythrityl core. For the “coupling-onto approach”, the S-PIPOZs were prepared by ligation between L-PIPOZ-N3 and a 4-arm core with an alkyne group via CuAAC. The prepared polymers were analysed by 1H NMR, IR, Multi Angles Laser Light Scattering - Gel Permeation Chromatography (MALLS-GPC), UV absorption spectroscopy and High Sensitive Differential Scanning Microcalorimetry (HS-DSC). Polymers obtained by the “core-first” approach shows ill-defined microstructure compared to those obtained by the “coupling-onto” approach. In light of these encouraging results, the “coupling-onto” method was pursued for preparing S-PIPOZ. An explanation on the ill-defined structure will be provided within this thesis. Moreover, we developed a purification method for the fast and efficient removal of free PIPOZs, which otherwise contaminate the star-PIPOZ samples that are prepared by the coupling-onto approach. This method is applicable to other thermosensitive polymers within a certain range of temperature. In the third part, we focused on the effect of the architecture and composition of the S-PIPOZs on the phase transition temperature of the polymer. For this, we synthesized a hetero-star block copolymer composed of PIPOZ and poly(ethylene glycol) PEG. This study was carried out by examining the aqueous polymer solution (the linear precursors, S-PIPOZs, S-PIPOZ-b-PEG) upon heating via UV spectroscopy, HS-DSC and light scattering. We also assessed the temperature-induced crystallinity of the Star-PIPOZs by Transmission (TEM) and Scanning (SEM) Electron Microscopy, WAXS. This is important for biomedical nanodevices. We also provided a straightforward method, based on aminative reduction, to functionalize the S-PIPOZ with different macromolecules. This thesis discusses the advantages and the drawbacks related to the synthesis, functionalization, structures of PLA-co-GPE and the star-PIPOZs. Overall, this represents a pioneering study for improving the design of prospective nanodevices.

435	Substrats neurophysiologiques du traitement émotionnel de l'information visuelle chez les adultes vieillissants	Background. Although empathy is an essential tool throughout life, its study in normal aging remains limited and largely supported by subjective measures. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a new avenue for studying empathy through mu rhythm. The purpose of this study was to explore the evolution of empathy trough time and between sex by focusing on the neurophysiological response (mu rhythm) resulting from the observation of emotional facial expressions (EFE) and from the score obtained on an empathy questionnaire. Methods. A total of 65 participants, including 33 young adults and 32 seniors, took part in this study. They were exposed to short video clips of dynamic facial expressions of joy, fear and neutral during which they had to try to feel each exposed emotion while electroencephalography (EEG) responses were recorded. They also completed the Empathy Quotient (EQ). Results. Young adults reacted more strongly to emotional EFEs. Seniors perceived themselves as less empathetic and had an equivalent neurophysiological response between stimuli. Senior women were even more responsive to neutral EFEs than younger women. A sex effect in favor of women has been observed in the modulation of mu rhythm and higher empathy capacities have been associated with a higher mu rhythm in the latter. Conclusion. Mu rhythm appears to be an age and sex sensitive neurophysiological marker in empathic treatment and could therefore serve as an objective measure for this purpose.

436	"Lubrication and wear protection of micro-structured hydrogels using
bioinspired fluids"	We report the fabrication and the use of a bioinspired synovial fluid acting as a lubricant fluid and anti-wear agent at soft and porous chitosan hydrogel tribopairs. This synthetic synovial fluid is composed of sodium hyaluronate (HA) and a bottle-brush polymer (BB) having a polycationic attachment group and polyzwitterionic pendant chains. 2.5 %w/w chitosan hydrogel plugs are organized in a bilayered structure exposing a thin and dense superficial zone (SZ), covering a porous deep zone (DZ) and exhibiting microchannels perpendicularly aligned to the SZ. Using a low-load tribometer, the addition of HA lubricating solution at the hydrogel-hydrogel rubbing contact drastically decreased the coefficient of friction (CoF) from μ = 0.20 ± 0.01 to μ = 0.04 ± 0.01 on the DZ configuration and from μ = 0.31 ± 0.01 to μ = 0.08 ± 0.01 on the SZ surface when increasing HA concentration from 0 to 1000 μg/mL and its molecular mass from 10 to 1500 kDa, similar to what was found when using BB polymer alone. When combining the BB polymer and the 1500 kDa HA, the CoF remained stable at μ = 0.04 ± 0.01 for both studied contact configurations, highlighting the synergistic interaction of the two macromolecules. Hydrogel wear was characterized by assessing the final gel surface roughness by the means of an interferometer. Increasing HA concentration and molecular weight plus the addition of BB polymer lead to a dramatic surface wear protection with a final gel surface roughness of the hydrogels similar to the untested gels. In brief, BB polymer in combination with high molecular weight HA is a potential lubricating fluid as well as a wear resistant agent for soft materials lubrication and wear protection.

437	Biomimetic bottle-brush polymer coatings for fabrication of ultra-low fouling surfaces	The increasing demand for long lasting antifouling surfaces has steered the development of accessible, novel, biocompatible and environmentally-friendly materials. Inspired by lubricin (LUB), a component of mammalian synovial fluid with excellent antifouling properties, we designed three block polymers with bottle-brush structures and outstanding stability, efficacy, and ease of use. By a simple drop casting or online exposure, the polymers strongly adsorbed on silica surfaces in less than 10 min and were found to be stable in extremely high-salinity solutions and under an unprecedented wide range of pH. The polymers antifouling properties against proteins and bacteria were evaluated using different techniques, demonstrating ultralow fouling properties. With serum albumin and lysozyme adsorption < 0.2 ng/cm2, the polymers were found to be 50 and 25 times more effective than LUB and the known ultralow fouling coatings. The antifouling properties were also successfully tested under MPa compression pressures by direct force measurements using the surface forces apparatus (SFA). The findings of this study suggest that these polymers are amongst the most robust and efficient antifouling agents known today.

438	Métrologie de la douleur animale sur modèles expérimentaux : développement et validation de biomarqueurs neuroprotéomiques	Pain is a complex and dynamic phenomenon including a primary and sensory process, nociception, to which are added psychophysiological defense and alarm reactions. This leads to the development of a true memory of pain, individual and modulated (neuronal plasticity) by previous experiences of pain, including nociceptive sensitivity. Animal models mimicking human pathologies are crucial to understand the mechanisms of central sensitization. We proposed a series of translational experimental approaches by developing experimental models of bovine, canine and murine pain in order to characterize spinal proteome modifications according to the level of pain perceived by the animal and consequently, to identify the biomarkers (s) potentially modulated by nociceptive sensitization.  By using a neuroproteomic method, in a bovine model of visceral pain, the transthyretin (TTR) protein was identified and down-regulated in the spinal proteome in the presence of pain, and this was verified in a canine model of chronic pain related to surgical osteoarthritis (OA) induction. These findings suggest the possibility of considering TTR as a potential biomarker of chronic pain. Our discovery of the relationship between spinal levels of TTR by neuroproteomic and pain hypersensitivity in bovine and canine models supports the involvement of inflammatory, nociceptive and immune components. Subsequently, procedures for metrological validation of acclimatization protocols and environmental conditions of manipulation have identified the most reliable and sensitive methods of pain assessment. The chemical model (intraarticular injection of monosodium iodoacetate) of chronic pain induction related to OA in rats also allowed us to demonstrate that an increase in the temporal expression of excitatory spinal neuropeptides such as substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide, bradykinin and the anti-nociceptive somatostatin, is associated with central sensitization phenomenon in this model, as also supported by functional evaluations. The differences observed on functional results between the analgesic drugs were supported by different influences on spinal neuropeptide concentrations, thus increasing the validity and psychometric sensitivity of quantitative sensory testing and biomechanical pain assessment methods. In the aim to elaborate an experimental model of chronic pain related to OA reproducing more closely post-traumatic progression, the development of a surgical model in rodent has shown the possibility of inducing changes compatible with chronic pathological pain. The surgical model of OA pain induction generated quantifiable neurophysiological changes associated with central sensitization. These changes in functional alterations were concomitant with the release of spinal neuropeptides. The comparison with the chemical model showed more persistent and less aggressive modifications which would be potentially useful for the evaluation of therapeutic modalities in OA. The use of objective proteomic methods combined with subjective evaluation to quantify pain could lead to a completely new management of pain and animal welfare.	neuropeptide , validation , biomarker , neuroproteomic , central sensitization , pain , animal model , neuropeptide , pain metrology , validation	en	21067.0
439	Capacités de réserve et entraînement cognitif dans le vieillissement : similarité des effets protecteurs sur la cognition et le cerveau = Reserve capacity and cognitive training in aging : the similarity of the protective effects on cognition and brain	The reserve concept was proposed to account for difference observed in some individuals between the degree of their brain damage and its expression at the cognitive level. Reserve was found to be modulated by environmental factors such as the level of education and practice of cognitively stimulating activities during life. An important issue is to understand the neurobiological mechanisms underlying reserve capacities in order to promote interventions that would strengthen these capacities. Results from studies on the neurobiological mechanisms involved in different types of cognitive training and those of reserve lead us to hypothesize that reserve can be built later in life using targeted intervention procedure. We will discuss the advantage of having a high level of reserve and the opportunity to build one at a later time, during the phase of aging.

440	Clinical importance of thrombocytopenia in patients with acute coronary syndromes : a systematic review and meta-analysis	Thrombocytopenia (TP) is common in hospitalized patients. In the context of acute coronary syndromes (ACS), TP has been linked to adverse clinical outcomes. We present a systematic review and meta-analysis of the evidence on the clinical importance of pre-existing and in-hospital acquired TP in the context of ACS.  Specifically, we address (a) the prevalence and associated factors with TP in the context of ACS; and (b) the association between TP and all-cause mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and major bleeding. We conducted systematic literature searches in MEDLINE and Web of Science. For the meta-analysis, we fit linear mixed models with a random study-specific intercept for the aggregate outcomes. A total of 16 studies and 190,915 patients were included in this study. Of these patients, 8.8% ± 1.2% presented with pre-existing TP while 5.8% ± 1.0% developed TP after hospital admission. Pre-existing TP was not statistically significantly associated with adverse outcomes. Acquired TP was associated with greater risk of all-cause mortality (risk difference (RD): 4.3%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2% - 6%; p=0.04), MACE (RD: 8.5%; 95% CI: 1% -16.0%; p=0.037) and major bleeding (RD: 11.9%; 95% CI: 5% - 19%; p=0.005). In conclusion, TP is a prevalent condition in patients admitted for an ACS and identifies a high-risk patient population more likely to experience ischemic and bleeding complications, as well as higher mortality.

442	Dietary intake at 9 years and subsequent body mass index in adolescent boys and girls: a study of monozygotic twin pairs	There is a lack of evidence pointing to specific dietary elements related to weight gain and obesity prevention in childhood and adulthood. Dietary intake and obesity are both inherited and culturally transmitted, but most prospective studies on the association between diet and weight status do not take genetics into consideration. The objective of this study was to document the association between dietary intake at 9 years and subsequent Body Mass Index (BMI) in adolescent monozygotic boy and girl twin pairs. This research used data from 152 twin pairs. Dietary data were collected from two 24-hour-recall interviews with a parent and the child aged 9 years. Height and weight were obtained when the twins were aged 9, 12, 13, and 14 years. Intrapair variability analysis was performed to identify dietary elements related to BMI changes in subsequent years. BMI-discordant monozygotic twin pairs were also identified to analyze the dietary constituents that may have generated the discordance. After eliminating potential confounding genetic factors, pre-adolescent boys who ate fewer grain products and fruit and consumed more high-fat meat and milk had higher BMIs during adolescence; pre-adolescent girls who consumed more grain products and high-fat meat and milk had higher BMIs during adolescence. Energy intake (EI) at 9 years was not related to BMI in subsequent years. Our study suggests that messages and interventions directed at obesity prevention could take advantage of sex-specific designs and‚ eventually‚ genetic information.

443	Functional neuroimaging predictors of self-reported psychotic symptoms in adolescents	OBJECTIVE:  This study investigated the neural correlates of psychotic-like experiences in youths during tasks involving inhibitory control, reward anticipation, and emotion processing. A secondary aim was to test whether these neurofunctional correlates of risk were predictive of psychotic symptoms 2 years later. METHOD:  Functional imaging responses to three paradigms-the stop-signal, monetary incentive delay, and faces tasks-were collected in youths at age 14, as part of the IMAGEN study. At baseline, youths from London and Dublin sites were assessed on psychotic-like experiences, and those reporting significant experiences were compared with matched control subjects. Significant brain activity differences between the groups were used to predict, with cross-validation, the presence of psychotic symptoms in the context of mood fluctuation at age 16, assessed in the full sample. These prediction analyses were conducted with the London-Dublin subsample (N=246) and the full sample (N=1,196). RESULTS:  Relative to control subjects, youths reporting psychotic-like experiences showed increased hippocampus/amygdala activity during processing of neutral faces and reduced dorsolateral prefrontal activity during failed inhibition. The most prominent regional difference for classifying 16-year-olds with mood fluctuation and psychotic symptoms relative to the control groups (those with mood fluctuations but no psychotic symptoms and those with no mood symptoms) was hyperactivation of the hippocampus/amygdala, when controlling for baseline psychotic-like experiences and cannabis use. CONCLUSIONS:  The results stress the importance of the limbic network's increased response to neutral facial stimuli as a marker of the extended psychosis phenotype. These findings might help to guide early intervention strategies for at-risk youths.	Adolescents , Brain imaging techniques , Mood disorders-bipolar , Psychosis	en	20951.0
444	Incomplete hippocampalInversion : a comprehensive MRI study of over 2000 subjects	The incomplete-hippocampal-inversion (IHI), also known as malrotation, is an atypical anatomical pattern of the hippocampus, which has been reported in healthy subjects in different studies. However, extensive characterization of IHI in a large sample has not yet been performed. Furthermore, it is unclear whether IHI are restricted to the medial-temporal lobe or are associated with more extensive anatomical changes. Here, we studied the characteristics of IHI in a community-based sample of 2008 subjects of the IMAGEN database and their association with extra-hippocampal anatomical variations. The presence of IHI was assessed on T1-weighted anatomical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using visual criteria. We assessed the association of IHI with other anatomical changes throughout the brain using automatic morphometry of cortical sulci. We found that IHI were much more frequent in the left hippocampus (left: 17%, right: 6%, χ2−test, p < 10−28). Compared to subjects without IHI, subjects with IHI displayed morphological changes in several sulci located mainly in the limbic lobe. Our results demonstrate that IHI are a common left-sided phenomenon in normal subjects and that they are associated with morphological changes outside the medial temporal lobe.

445	A longitudinal twin study of callous-unemotional traits during childhood	Previous research indicates that genetic factors largely account for the stability of callous-unemotional (CU) traits in adolescence. However, the genetic-environmental etiology of the development of CU traits has not been extensively investigated in childhood, despite work showing the reliable measurement and stability of CU traits from a young age. The aim of this study was to investigate the temporal pattern of genetic and environmental etiology of CU traits across primary school, from school entry (7 years) to middle (9 and 10 years) and late childhood (12 years). Data were collected in a population sample of twins composed of 662 twin pairs (Quebec Newborn Twin Study). CU traits were reported by teachers and analyzed using a biometric latent growth curve model and a Cholesky decomposition model. Latent growth curve analyses revealed that genetic factors explain most of the variance in the intercept of CU traits. Individual differences in change over time were not significant. The Cholesky model revealed that genetic factors at 7 years had enduring contributions to CU traits at 9, 10, and 12 years. New, modest genetic contributions appeared at 9 and 10 years. Nonshared environmental contributions were generally age-specific. No shared environmental contributions were detected. In sum, both modeling approaches showed that genetic factors underlie CU traits during childhood. Initial and new genetic contributions arise during this period. Environments have substantial contributions, over and above genetic factors. Future research should investigate the source of genetic risk associated with CU traits.

446	The interactive effects of parental knowledge with impulsivity and sensation seeking in adolescent substance use	This study examined whether interactions of parental knowledge of adolescent’s whereabouts with impulsivity and sensation seeking in the prediction of adolescent substance use supported the diathesis–stress or differential susceptibility model in 230 15-year old adolescents (53% girls). Interactions between impulsivity and parental knowledge supported the diathesis–stress model with high impulsivity as a vulnerability factor: when impulsivity was higher, low levels of parental knowledge were associated with higher levels of substance use. Interactions between sensation seeking and parental knowledge supported differential susceptibility with low sensation seeking as a susceptibility factor; low parental knowledge was associated with higher substance use and high parental knowledge with lower substance use when sensation seeking was lower. Our results show that impulsivity and sensation seeking should be considered independently. Results support previous research suggesting that impulsivity in adolescence may act as a vulnerability factor and suggests that low sensation seeking may be a susceptibility factor.

447	Intimate partner violence and new-onset depression : a longitudinal study of women's childhood and adult histories of abuse	Background—Studies indicate that women victims of intimate partner violence are at increased risk for poor mental health. This research disentangled the effect of partner violence on new-onset depression and psychosis spectrum symptoms from effects of child maltreatment and other confounding factors, including substance abuse and antisocial personality. Methods—Participants were 1,052 mothers involved in the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study, a nationally representative cohort of families followed prospectively. To test the directionality of associations between partner violence and depression, only women without a history of depression at the beginning of the study were considered (n = 978). Partner violence and mental health were assessed during face-to-face interviews with women across three time points. Results—Four of 10 women reported being the victim of violence from their partner in a 10-year period. They represent 33% of our cohort and they account for 51% of new-onset depression. These women had a twofold increase in their risk of suffering from new-onset depression once the effect of childhood maltreatment, socioeconomic deprivation, antisocial personality, and young motherhood were controlled. Women who were abused both in childhood and adulthood were four to seven times more likely to suffer from depression than never-abused women. We observed similar associations with psychosis spectrum symptoms. Conclusions—Women victims of partner violence account for more than their share of depression. Findings strengthen existing evidence that partner violence independently contributes to women’s poor mental health. Psychological difficulties among a considerable number of women could be reduced by stopping partner violence.

448	Associations between daily mood states and brain gray matter volume, resting-state functional connectivity and task-based activity in healthy adults	Numerous studies have shown differences in the functioning in the areas of the frontal-limbic circuitry between depressed patients and controls. However, current knowledge on frontal-limbic neural substrates of individual differences in mood states in everyday life in healthy individuals is scarce. The present study investigates anatomical, resting-state, and functional neural correlates of daily mood states in healthy individuals. We expected to observe associations between mood and the frontal-limbic circuitry and the default-mode network (DMN). A total of 42 healthy adults (19 men, 23 women; 34 ± 1.2 years) regularly followed for behavior and psychosocial functioning since age of 6, underwent a functional magnetic resonance imaging scan, and completed a daily diary of mood states and related cognitions for 5 consecutive days. Results showed that individuals with smaller left hippocampal gray matter volumes experienced more negative mood and rumination in their daily life. Greater resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) within the DMN, namely between posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and medial prefrontal cortex regions as well as between PCC and precuneus, was associated with both greater negative and positive mood states in daily life. These rsFC results could be indicative of the role of the DMN regional functioning in emotional arousal, irrespective of valence. Lastly, greater daily positive mood was associated with greater activation in response to negative emotional stimuli in the precentral gyri, previously linked to emotional interference on cognitive control. Altogether, present findings might reflect neural mechanisms underlying daily affect and cognition among healthy individuals.

449	Does cortisol moderate the environmental association between peer victimization and depression symptoms? a genetically informed twin study	Many youths who are victimized by peers suffer from depression symptoms. However, not all bullying victims become depressed and individuals’ biological sensitivity may play an important moderating role in this regard. In line with this notion, peer victimization has been associated with increased depressive symptoms in youth with higher basal cortisol secretion. It is unclear, however, whether this moderating effect of cortisol really concerns the environmental effect of peer victimization on depression. Indeed, genetic factors can also influence individuals’ environmental experiences, including peer victimization, and part of these genetic factors may be those associated with depression. Using a genetically informed design based on 159 monozygotic and 120 dizygotic twin pairs (52% girls) assessed at age 14 years, this study examined whether cortisol secretion moderates the environmental or the genetic association between peer victimization and depression symptoms. Salivary cortisol at awakening was obtained with buccal swabs during four school week days. Peer victimization and depression were assessed via self-reports. Cholesky modeling revealed that peer victimization was associated with depression symptoms via both genetic and environmental pathways. Moreover, the environmental association between peer victimization and depression symptoms steadily increased with increasing levels of morning cortisol. The genetic association between peer victimization and depression symptoms also varied, albeit less, as a function of individuals’ cortisol secretion. These findings support the hypothesis that peer victimization increases internalizing psychopathology mainly in youth with heightened biological reactivity to environmental conditions.

450	Environmental influence of problematic social relationships on adolescents' daily cortisol secretion : a monozygotic twin-difference study	BACKGROUND:   This study investigated the potential environmental effects of peer victimization and the quality of relationships with parents and friends on diurnal cortisol secretion in mid-adolescence.  METHOD:   This study used the monozygotic (MZ) twin-difference design to control for genetic effects and thus estimate the unique environmental influences on diurnal cortisol. Participants were 136 MZ twin pairs (74 female pairs) for whom cortisol was assessed four times per day over four collection days grouped in a 2-week period in grade 8 (mean age = 14.07 years). Participants also provided self-reports of peer victimization from grade 4 to grade 8 and of the relationship quality with the mother, father and best friend in grade 8.  RESULTS:   The expected pattern of diurnal cortisol secretion was observed, with high levels at awakening followed by an increase 30 min later and a progressive decrease subsequently. Controlling for a host of confounders, only within-twin pair differences in peer victimization and a problematic relationship with the mother were significantly linked to twin differences in diurnal cortisol secretion. Specifically, whereas a more problematic mother-child relationship was associated with morning cortisol secretion, peer victimization was linked to cortisol secretion later in the day (diurnal slope).  CONCLUSIONS:   Controlling for genetic influences and other confounders, stressful relationships with peers and the mother exert unique and time-specific environmental influences on the pattern of diurnal cortisol secretion in mid-adolescence.

451	Validation of an adapted procedure to collect hair for cortisol determination in adolescents	Introduction  In the last decades, cortisol has been extensively studied in association to early exposure to adversity as well as in the etiology of a number of physical and mental problems. While saliva and blood samples allow the measurement of acute changes in cortisol secretion, hair samples are thought to provide a valid retrospective measure of chronic cortisol secretion over an extended period of time. Nevertheless, the existing protocol for hair collection involves considerable financial and logistical challenges when performed in large epidemiological studies.   Objective  This study aimed to validate an adapted collection protocol asking participants to sample their hair at home and to send it back to our laboratory by regular mail.   Methods  Participants were 34 teenagers between 17 and 18 years of age. They participated in two hair collections: (a) at home, with the help of someone they know, and (b) in our laboratory, with a trained research assistant.   Results  We noted a strong correlation between cortisol ascertained from hair collected at home and at the laboratory. No mean difference in cortisol levels could be detected between the two protocols. Moreover, we showed that a wide range of hair-related, sociodemographic, lifestyle factors that may be associated with hair cortisol levels did not affect the association between cortisol measures derived from each protocol.   Conclusion  Our study provides initial support that reliable measures of chronic cortisol secretion could be obtained by asking adolescents to collect a sample of their hair at home and send them to the laboratory by regular mail. This adapted protocol has considerable financial and logistical advantages in large epidemiological studies.

452	3D Cohort Study : The Integrated Research Network in Perinatology of Quebec and Eastern Ontario	Background: The 3D Cohort Study (Design, Develop, Discover) was established to help bridge knowledge gaps about the links between various adverse exposures during pregnancy with birth outcomes and later health outcomes in children. Methods: Pregnant women and their partners were recruited during the first trimester from nine sites in Quebec and followed along with their children through to 2 years of age. Questionnaires were administered during pregnancy and post-delivery to collect information on demographics, mental health and life style, medical history, psychosocial measures, diet, infant growth, and neurodevelopment. Information on the delivery and newborn outcomes were abstracted from medical charts. Biological specimens were collected from mothers during each trimester, fathers (once during the pregnancy), and infants (at delivery and 2 years of age) for storage in a biological specimen bank. Results: Of the 9864 women screened, 6348 met the eligibility criteria and 2366 women participated in the study (37% of eligible women). Among women in the 3D cohort, 1721 of their partners (1704 biological fathers) agreed to participate (73%). Two thousand two hundred and nineteen participants had a live singleton birth (94%). Prenatal blood and urine samples as well as vaginal secretions were collected for ≥98% of participants, cord blood for 81% of livebirths, and placental tissue for 89% of livebirths. Conclusions: The 3D Cohort Study combines a rich bank of multiple biological specimens with extensive clinical, life style, and psychosocial data. This data set is a valuable resource for studying the developmental etiology of birth and early childhood neurodevelopmental outcomes.

453	A 12-week open-label, multicenter study evaluating the safety and patient-reported efficacy of sodium oxybate in patients with narcolepsy and cataplexy	Objective: This study aimed to evaluate safety and efficacy of sodium oxybate (SXB) titrated to effect. Methods: SXB-naive patients who had participated in a randomized SXB clinical trial and had not been titrated to adequate clinical effect were initiated on open-label SXB at 4.5 g/night and titrated in 1.5-g increments to 6, 7.5, or 9 g/night or down to 3 g/night, based on individual clinical response. Treatment was 12 weeks; safety was the primary outcome. Efficacy was evaluated using the Narcolepsy Symptom Assessment Questionnaire (NSAQ), a five-point scale (“much improved” to “much worse”) that assessed changes from baseline in specific symptoms. Response was defined as “much improved” or “somewhat improved” overall at weeks 6 and 12. Results: Of 202 patients, 171 (85%) completed treatment; final doses were 3 g (n = 5), 4.5 g (n = 29), 6 g (n = 80), 7.5 g (n = 66), and 9 g (n = 22). Adverse events (AEs) were reported in 114 patients (56%), serious AEs in five (2%). The most common AEs were nausea (10%), headache (7%), and dizziness (5%). Response rate was 92% at week 6 and 90% at week 12; most patients reported improvements in all individual symptoms. Overall, 60% of patients rated their symptoms at 12weeks as “much improved,” and this improvement was dose dependent. Conclusions: The SXB safety profile was consistent with parent trials. Ninety percent of patients reported improvements as measured by the NSAQ.

454	Evaluation of qualityof-life in patients with narcolepsy treated with sodium oxybate : use of the 36-item short-form health survey in a clinical trial	Introduction The present post hoc analysis was designed to evaluate health-related quality of life (HRQoL) using the 36-item Short Form Health Status Survey (SF-36) during an 8-week trial of sodium oxybate (SXB). Methods SF-36 was assessed in a phase 3 placebo-controlled trial in patients with narcolepsy (N = 228) randomized to placebo or SXB in doses of 4.5, 6, or 9 g nightly for 8 weeks. Changes from baseline in SF-36 (last observation carried forward) were compared between SXB and placebo, and effect sizes (ES) were estimated. Results Baseline SF-36 values were lower than normative values for the US general population. After 8 weeks of treatment, mean (±standard deviation) improvement from baseline on the Physical Component Summary (PCS) was significantly greater with SXB 9 g/night than placebo (6.3 ± 9.1 vs. 1.5 ± 6.2; p = 0.005), with moderate ES; no significant difference was found between the SXB and placebo groups on the Mental Component Summary. SXB 9 g/night resulted in significantly (p < 0.05) greater improvements than placebo in Physical Functioning (4.4 ± 9.2 vs. 1.0 ± 8.0), General Health (GH; 3.1 ± 7.0 vs. 0.4 ± 6.8), and Social Functioning (6.8 ± 16.8 vs. 1.1 ± 9.6). All SXB doses resulted in significant improvement (p < 0.05) relative to placebo for Vitality, with moderate ES. No significant differences versus placebo were observed for Role–Physical, Role–Emotional, or Mental Health domains. Conclusion Treatment with SXB was associated with a dose-dependent improvement in HRQoL, with the 9-g nightly dose demonstrating a positive impact on PCS and individual SF-36 domains of Vitality, GH, and Physical and Social Functioning.

455	"Functional changes in the cortical
semantic network in amnestic mild cognitive impairment"	Semantic memory impairment has been documented in older individuals with amnestic Mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), who are at risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease (AD), yet little is known about the neural basis of this breakdown. The main objective of this study was to investigate the brain mechanisms associated with semantic performance in patients with aMCI. Method: A group of aMCI patients and a group of healthy older controls carried out a semantic categorization task while their brain activity was recorded using magnetoencephalography (MEG). During the task, participants were shown famous faces and had to determine whether each famous person matched a given occupation. The main hypotheses were that: (i) semantic processing should be compromised for aMCI patients, and (ii) these deficits should be associated with cortical dysfunctions within specific areas of the semantic network. Results: Behavioural results showed that aMCI participants were significantly slower and less accurate than control participants at the semantic task, corroborating previous reports. Additionally, relative to controls, a significant pattern of hyperactivation was found in the aMCI group within specific regions of the semantic network, including the right anterior temporal lobe and inferior prefrontal cortex. Conclusions: Abnormal functional activation within key areas of the semantic network suggests that it is compromised early in the disease process. Moreover, this pattern of increased activation in aMCI was positively associated with grey matter integrity in specific areas, but was not associated with any specific pattern of atrophy, suggesting that functional hyperactivation may precede atrophy of the semantic network in aMCI.

456	Étude biomécanique comparative de la propulsion en fauteuil roulant manuel à celle sur un dynamomètre motorisé	"Objectives: To compare propulsion biomechanics on a newly developed wheelchair  simulator to overground natural propulsion.  Design: A repeated cross-sectional research design  Participants: Seventeen individuals (15 men and 2 women) with spinal cord injury  between T4 and T12 who used their manual wheelchair as their primary mean of mobility.  Methods: Participants completed two 20-meter propulsion trials on a tiled surface and two  1-minute propulsion sessions on the simulator at a self-selected natural velocity.  Participants and simulator wheelchair was equipped with instrumented wheels to record  handrim kinetics The main outcome measures were perceived exertion, heart rate, spatiotemporal  and pushrim kinetic propulsion parameters during the push phase. T-test and  Pearson correlation were generated for the main outcome measures.  Results: Perceived exertion, heart rate, tangential force and energy output were found to  be similar (p<0.05) between overground and simulator settings at their self-selected  natural velocity; whereas velocity, contact angle, total force and power were found to be  greater (p<0.05) at overground propulsion when compared to the simulator propulsion  setting. Correlation between settings were found to be ""very good"" for the total force  (r=0.89), tangential force (r=0.91) and power (r=0.90), and ""good"" for the mechanical  effective force (r=0.76). The propulsion total and tangential forces, MEF and power  intensities were found to be symmetrical without any preferential side regardless of the  settings.  Conclusion: The propulsion biomechanics on the simulator can be compared to those  overground in terms of mechanical propulsion profiles, but that the simulator does not  perfectly emulate overground propulsion in terms of spatio-temporal parameters and total  force intensity."	propulsion , biomechanics , paraplegia , rehabilitation , wheelchair , spinal cord injury	en	20816.0
457	Revue systématique de l’évaluation de la qualité et du contenu scientifique des guides de pratique	Background: Clinical practice guidelines (CPG) are statements that include recommendations for optimizing patient care based on a thorough review of evidence that should be explicitly and consistently linked to the content of the recommendations. Many practice guides suffer from a lack of rigor in their development and their quality is suboptimal. In addition, there may be some discrepancy between the content of the guide's recommendations and the data from the primary studies on which they are based so that some recommendations may be inappropriate. The challenge, therefore, is to determine the level of quality of a practice guide, not only how the practice guide was developed, but also the value of the content or validity of the recommendations it contains.   Objective: The objective is to characterize the tools available to assess the quality of practice guidelines and in particular the validity of the content of the recommendations and potentially propose an improvement in this respect. Methods: A first systematic review was undertaken in order to identify existing reviews that have already reviewed practice guidelines assessment instruments. Pubmed and Embase databases were consulted from January 1990 to December 2015. Then, this review was supplemented by a second systematic review which only covered primary studies, i.e. instruments that had been developed since the most recent review.   Pubmed, Embase and Evidence Based Medecine databases were consulted from January 2011 to December 2015. A scientific watch using the same research strategy was maintained until December 2017.  Results: The first systematic review identified 3 systematic reviews counting 47 assessment instruments. The second systematic review added 5 more instruments. It appears that the AGREEII instrument is somehow considered as the gold standard for evaluation tools. It is complete without being excessive and allows a specific evaluation by domain as well as a global evaluation in addition to having been validated. Reflecting on situations where inappropriate scientific content may go unnoticed has led to the suggestion of specifically assess for each of the key recommendations: • Whether there is an explicit link between the recommendation and the supporting evidence; • Whether the evidence used is still up to date; • Whether the evidence used still applies to current patients.  Conclusion: The suggested addition to the AGREEII tool is likely to enhance the ability to gain insight into the value of the scientific content of practice guideline CGP recommendations.

458	Effet des épandages de lisier de porc et du travail du sol sur la présence de gènes de résistance aux antimicrobiens dans le sol et l’eau de drainage en grandes cultures	Agricultural practices represent potential pathways for the propagation of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) in the environment. Hog manure applications introduce antimicrobial resistant microorganisms to the soil. This study evaluated the impact of hog manure spreading and tillage practices on the presence of ARGs in soil and drainage water in field crops. Escherichia coli and enterococci bacteria were counted. After DNA extraction, tet(T), sul1 and blaCTX-M-1 resistance genes were quantified by qPCR. The detection of mcr-1 and mcr-2 genes was performed by conventional PCR. The results showed that high-dose manure application (45 m3/ha) had a long-term impact on tet(T) and sul1 genes abundance in soil. A dose of 20 m3/ha had a short-term impact. Gene abundance in drainage water decreased significantly 15 days after manure application for sul1 and 169 days for tet(T). Tillage practices did not have an impact on the presence and abundance of ARGs in samples. The blaCTX-M-1 genes were detected in hog manure and in 7 water samples, but no link was established with the treatments. The mcr-1 and mcr-2 genes were not detected. This study demonstrated that tetracycline and sulfonamide resistance genes reservoir in soil can be increased after repeated high doses swine manure applications.

459	Effet de TDP-43 sur l’épissage alternatif et l’agrégation d’hnRNP A1 dans la sclérose latérale amyotrophique	RNA binding proteins such as TDP-43 and hnRNP A1 are mutated in ALS cases and are often mislocalized into cytoplasmic aggregates within motor neurons of affected patients. In the case of TDP-43, cytoplasmic inclusions, which are observed in most ALS cases and nearly half of FTD cases, are accompanied by a depletion of nuclear TDP-43. We report here that TDP-43 binds HNRNPA1 pre-mRNA and modulates its splicing. Depletion of nuclear TDP-43 results in increased inclusion of a cassette exon in the HNRNPA1 transcript and consequent elevated protein levels of an isoform containing an elongated prion-like domain, referred to as hnRNP A1B. Using both in vivo and in vitro approaches, we demonstrate that this isoform has greater fibrillization propensity, drives protein aggregation, and negatively impacts cell survival. Finally, accumulation of hnRNP A1B is observed in sporadic ALS patients with documented TDP-43 pathology. Our data indicate that TDP-43 mislocalization may contribute to neuronal vulnerability and loss via alterations in hnRNP A1 pre-mRNA splicing and function. Given that TDP-43 and hnRNP A1 each bind, and thus modulate, a third of the transcriptome, these data suggest a much broader disruption in RNA metabolism than previously considered.

460	Structure et dynamique temporelle des communautés hydrothermales inféodées à la dorsale Juan de Fuca : utilisation d’une approche observatoire fond de mer	Hydrothermal vents are distributed along mid-ocean ridges and back-arc basins. These ecosystems harbour a specialized fauna supported by a local chemosynthetic microbial production, made possible through the oxidation of reduced elements present in the hydrothermal fluid. While the relationships between faunal assemblages and habitats have been relatively well described around the globe, our knowledge on the temporal dynamics of these environments is still limited, particularly at time scale relevant to organisms (from few minutes to several years). Based on hydrothermal vent communities occurring on the Juan de Fuca Ridge, located in the northeast Pacific Ocean, this thesis aims at understanding the functioning and temporal dynamics of macrofaunal communities associated with the Siboglinidae Ridgeia piscesae tubeworm assemblages through the coupling of sampling and seafloor observatory approach.  This study first allowed the quantitative description (composition, diversity and biomass) of six siboglinid species assemblages on the Grotto hydrothermal edifice (Main Endeavour, Juan de Fuca Ridge) and the assessment of the trophic structure of these communities using stable isotopes (carbon 13C and nitrogen 15N). The results enabled the identification of 36 taxa. An elevated polychaete diversities and high densities of gastropods characterized all assemblages. The most developed R. piscesae assemblages (i.e. longer tube lengths) exhibited greater diversity and more complex food webs. The species coexistence within the biogenic structures created by R. piscesae could be explained by a strong partitioning of ecological niches and nutritional resources.  The analysis of video images gathered by the ecological observatory module TEMPO-mini, deployed on the Grotto edifice on the cabled observatory Ocean Networks Canada, provided information on the temporal dynamics of the assemblage. The abundance variations of four macrofaunal species were tracked at a daily frequency during one year and every 4 hours during one summer and two winter months. Our results highlighted a significant influence of the semi-diurnal tidal cycle and winter surface storms on the distribution of two mobile and non-symbiotic taxa (Sericosura sp. pycnogonids and Polynoidae polychaetes). The local ocean dynamics seemed to periodically affect the mixing between hydrothermal fluid inputs and surrounding seawater, therefore modifying environmental conditions in vent habitats. This study suggests that hydrothermal species respond to these habitat modifications by adjusting their behaviour.  Finally, considering the increased importance of observational and imagery approaches in the study of deep-sea ecosystems, this thesis proposes a guideline and methodology in order to optimise video imagery methods both for the extraction of ecological data and the search of natural cycles. Overall, these results bring novel and valuable information to help understand the functioning and dynamics of deep-sea hydrothermal communities and opens new research avenues for deep-sea ecology in general.

461	The role of metacognitive profiles in social functioning and social network evolution in schizophrenia	An individual’s capacity to develop adequate metacognitive theories plays an important role in social interactions and social functioning. Through metacognition, a person is able to read several aspects of a social situation and respond appropriately. Accordingly, research on social functioning, social networks, and metacognition consistently show impairments in individuals with schizophrenia. Although research has traditionally focused on the influence of individual skills, metacognitive abilities can be considered individually, or globally. However, different aspects of metacognition may not be predictive of every individual domain of social functioning, evolution of a satisfying and supportive social network, and social aspects of substance use. Therefore, the overall goal of this project was to contribute to the knowledge of the influence of metacognitive profiles on social functioning and the social context of individuals with schizophrenia, with a special interest in the implications of substance misuse. The first study investigated whether distinct metacognitive profiles exist within a population of individuals with a first psychotic episode, and to determine how such profiles influence individual domains of social functioning and perceived social support. Cluster analysis revealed three distinct metacognitive profiles: (1) overall better abilities; (2) poor abilities on thinking of one’s own and other’s mind, but better Mastery; and (3) overall poorer abilities. Analyses showed significant differences between profiles only for self-reported intimacy and independent living abilities, with the second profile showing better abilities than the third. Profiles did not simply represent consistently higher or lower functioning across subscales. Although mastery was predictive of social functioning, the ability to think in an increasingly complex manner of one’s self and others did not seem to improve functioning in individuals with a first episode of psychosis. Early interactions in particular are thought to influence the development of this ability. Interactions with others continue to be important to personal reflection and the further development of metacognitive skills. Therefore, given the influence of metacognition on social interactions, the second study explored whether metacognitive abilities played a role in the evolution of social networks in persons who develop schizophrenia and comorbid substance misuse. Social networks were charted from childhood to the present and were anchored to general (elementary, school, high school, first hospitalization, etc) and personal milestones (moving to a new city, changing school, onset of substance misuse, hardships, etc). Qualitative aspects were also investigated. Two distinct social network evolution profiles were identified. Profiles were stable over time in their reactions to life transition and differed on metacognitive abilities. Profile 1 was associated with better metacognitive abilities. It varied on the onset, conclusion, and the diversity of relationships. Profile 2 was associated with poorer metacognitive abilities. Networks completely changed at transitions but remained static and homogeneous between transitions. The presence of long-term, mutually supportive relationships, and the pursuit of personal interests contributing to friendship formation was present in the first but not the second profile, which evolved towards a network of substance users in adolescence, and isolation following the onset of illness.

462	Anomalies du tube neural : mieux comprendre les causes génétiques de cette pathologie complexe	Neural tube defects (NTD) are congenital malformations affecting 1 :1000 births and are caused by incomplete neural tube closure resulting in spinal cord and brain malformations. The most frequent presentations include Anencephaly and Spina Bifida which result from failure of closure of the cranial and spinal regions respectively. The etiology of the disease is complex and include genetic and environmental factors. To this day, ~250 causative genes have been identified in the mouse model and demonstrated the role of the planar cell polarity pathway in the NTD’ etiology. Linkage studies and candidate gene studies of folic acid genes had limited success and a large portion of the genetic etiology of the human pathology remain unknown suggesting the need for novel approaches. Whole exome sequencing combined with de novo variant and massive resequencing methods offer a powerful tool that may lead to a better understanding of the genetic etiology of NTD. Investigation of de novo variants in 43 trios identified 42 coding variants including 6 truncating ones. Of these, 2 truncating variants (p.Tyr392X et p.Leu948fs) were found in the SHROOM3 gene which had previously been associated to NTD in mouse. Statistical enrichment of truncating variants in this gene suggest an association to the human pathology. The high number of truncating variants identified in this cohort also suggest that de novo variants are one of the mechanisms that maintain the high prevalence of this lethal disease in the population. Investigation of transmitted variants using a candidate gene approach in 6 NTD affected family identified a homozygous truncating variant p.Asp16Aspfs*10 in the GRHL3 gene in two NTD affected sisters. GRHL3 is a strong candidate gene previously associated to NTD in mouse. Massive parallel resequencing of 192 sporadic patients and the analysis of the 43 previous trios identified 7 variants with a high pathogenic potential. Statistical analysis of these variants demonstrated a significant enrichment suggesting an association of GRHL3 with human NTD. Functional studies supported these findings through the identification of two loss of function variants (p.Arg391Cys et p.Ala529Val) and a variant affecting RNA splicing (p.Ala318Glyfs*26). The genetic etiology of NTD remain largely unknown. These new genes are essential to identification of new potential pathogenic processes of this disease. These results will help better understand the disease and offer better genetic counseling for the affected families.

463	Les mauvais traitements psychologiques chez les jeunes issus des groupes ethnoculturels soumis à la loi sur la protection de la jeunesse (LPJ)	This study is part of a broader project by the CJM dealing with psychological ill-treatment towards children. It aims to understand whether certain ethnic groups are overrepresented or underrepresented among young people reported and taken in care for psychological ill-treatment at the CJM-IU and CJ Batshaw. More specifically, within the framework of this study, we used existing statistical data from the CJM and attempted to draw a portrait of the young people reported for psychological ill-treatment from 2007 to 2010 in the Montreal region. The aim of this study was to better understand the reasons for the possible over-representation of certain ethnocultural groups among young people reported for psychological ill-treatment. We also analyzed the ethnocultural characteristics of the families involved in this form of ill-treatment. Indeed, we wanted to understand the representations of psychological ill-treatment according to cultural norms, with an interest in the normal development of children and in parental behaviour. We first used descriptive statistical analysis to summarize the information obtained from the CJM-IU databases and to see if a group was over-represented. For our study, we considered only MTP cases from the CJM-IU databases and the Batshaw Youth and Family Centers, ie, 9499 first reports. Subsequently, in order to answer the second objective, we carried out a literature search on the parental practices and the representations of the TPMs in the culture identified as overrepresented. The results showed that, in general, young people from ethno-cultural backgrounds were not more likely to be more represented among the children reported for TPM than youth who did not come from immigration. On the other hand, this difference is considerable for young people from the Caribbean. Unfortunately, no documentation has been found in the literature on this representation because we only had access to information about youth protection systems in Jamaica and Haiti.

464	L’exploration des liens entre le soutien social et la qualité de sommeil chez les consommateurs âgés de benzodiazépines	Abstract Several older benzodiazepine (BZD) users are affected by severe sleep problems. Various factors may be associated with these sleeping difficulties, such as old age, side effects of medication or presence of anxiety or depression. Although social support is another variable that could contribute to quality of sleep in this population, research has yet to address this issue. The objective of this study was to explore how social support is associated with quality of sleep in older BZD users. More specifically, we aimed to: 1) verify if there is a link between overall quality of sleep and the quantity of people on which a person can rely in case of need (first dimension of social support, related to ‘availability’); 2) investigate if there is an association between overall quality of sleep and satisfaction related to the perceived availability of social support (second dimension of social support), and 3) explore relations between these two dimensions of social support and specific subdimensions of sleep (e.g. presence of sleep disorders, sleep onset latency). To this end, we used data from the pretest (T1) of the ‘Programme d’Aide de Succès à un Sevrage (PASSE-60+)’ study which was initiated in January 2015 at the Institut universitaire de gériatrie de Montréal (CRIUGM). In total, this study included 66 participants aged between 60 and 85 years old who wanted to taper or stop their use of BZD. Quality of sleep was measured with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), while social support was assessed with the Social Support Questionnaire (SSQ-6), since it addressed the two dimensions of social support that were targeted in the present study (availability and satisfaction related to social support). Spearman correlations were used to investigate associations between aforementioned iv variables. Additional curve-estimation analyses were carried out to explore nonlinear associations between variables related to social support and dimensions of sleep. All hypotheses were tested with an alpha significance level of 0.05. Our analyses demonstrated the following points: 1) Overall sleep quality showed a quadratic association with satisfaction stemming from social support; 2) the less individuals appeared satisfied with their social support, the more they showed diurnal dysfunctions related to poor sleep quality; 3) overall quality of sleep was not significantly associated with the availability of support. Our results thus suggest that sleep quality in older BZD users is more closely associated with satisfaction due to the support received than with the number of people available for assistance. Since tapering of this medication is distressing for dependent users, as they experience various withdrawal symptoms and rebound insomnia or anxiety, social support becomes all the more valuable during this difficult experience. Results of the present study may prove useful for the adjustment of therapeutic interventions aiming to support tapering. As a matter of fact, it would be relevant to take into account satisfaction related to social support in therapy sessions in order to facilitate successful BZD tapering in older people with severe sleep problems.

465	Exploration de l'adaptation du modèle psychoéducatif au Nunavik : étude de cas d'un projet communautaire	Communities of Nunavik and their leaders are currently creating important forms of mobilization in an effort to develop local and culturally appropriate approaches to support the wellbeing of children and their families. In this context, the Inuit leaders reached out to a research group to help document and support this movement. As a psychoeducation student involved in this research project, my goal is to explore the adaptive qualities of psychoeducation in the context of the project under development. This thesis is based on the particular case study of a 'family center', Tasiurvik, first community-based center for families. We documented the activities of the family center through eight semi-structured interviews conducted with people involved in the local project, field notes taken during stays in the community at five different occasions and the activity reports written by volunteers responsible for activities in the center. Our analysis is driven by two specific questions : What can we learn about the realities and challenges of creating a program from the ground up ? What can we learn about our own psychoeducational frame of reference with regards to its adaptability and relevance in a different cultural context ? We take on an intercultural approach for our data analysis, positioning ourselves as 'outsiders' (Lockhart,1982), observers bearing our own cultural biases. We then categorize the data according to the components in Gendreau's overall structure model (2001). After researching the similarities, variances and differences between Gendreau's suggested model to plan activities and Tasiurvik's own ways, we identified certain similarities, such as the pivotal role of volunteers as facilitators, the importance of connections and of a recognition system. However, certain key aspects of the data could not easily be related to any of the components of the traditional psychoeducational model from Gendreau. Moreover, some of the data pertaining to specific components revealed information that somewhat challenged or complemented Gendreau's definitions of said components. Such variations were noted in the establishment of codes and procedures or responsibilities. Other significant differences came to light with regards to the central axis, where the objective component are of little importance, iii whereas the means to create connection, which is normally a peripheral component, becomes more of a central one. The results brought us to conclude that some adjustment would be required to make the model more comprehensive. We propose the addition of two new components, namely the language and constraint components, and we reflect upon spaces of mutual exchange in different sources of knowledge.	adaptation culturelle , Inuit , Psychoeducational model , culturale adaptation , psychoeducation , communitary initiative , qualitative research	en	20709.0
466	La dialectique négative de Theodor W. Adorno : méthode d'émancipation et d'éducation	Rich and focusing on the issues of our time, Theodor W. Adorno's critical theory through negative dialectics remains marginalized in philosophical studies at the same time that the philosophical community would gain in actualizing it, especially in an educational perspective. This is the main concern of this paper. In the first chapter, we describe the social problem noted by Adorno which is structural non-freedom. We present precisely what roles play the reification phenomena and the identity and exchange principles in relation to the lived impossibility of achieving some human progresses in the administrated world. We also present here what he sees as the necessity of a new categorical imperative in this form of barbary. The next chapter presents his thoughts on freedom itself. This brings us to explain his philosophical position as following, but also breaking through the systems of Hegel, Marx, Kant and liberalism, targeting to show the interest of a freedom conceptualized as liberation from different forms of determinism, this through a critical individuation process which reacts to the social negativity lived by any subject. Then, we present in the last chapter Adorno's thoughts on the proper education to this kind of freedom, judging it by the demands of negative dialectics as a method. After presenting his thinking scheme on the possibility of mankind progress in a cultural meaning, we discuss the possibility of a praxis of dialectical education in culture, at school and in the teacher’s practice.

467	Femmes journalistes et sujets « féminins » : analyser Le Devoir au prisme du genre (1965-1975)	This M.A. thesis focuses on the regulation of the access of women journalists to the daily newspaper Le Devoir between the years 1965 and 1975, and on the latter's role in the dissemination of women's demands during a sociohistorical context which was marked by feminist challenges. This period is targeted in order to analyze the impact of the abolition of the women’s page, which takes place in February 1971, on the organization of the newspaper, especially through the study of how women's and feminist themes are brought forward in the newspaper. This research posits the hypothesis that gender strongly influences the organization of Le Devoir through the consideration of it being a gendered space which is rife with sexualised power relations; the main forum for women at this time until its abolition, namely the women’s page, is a convincing demonstration of these dynamics. Based on a quantitative analysis, this research argues that Le Devoir displays a gendered organizational structure as to its content, and thus, articles on women’s and feminist themes are virtually unheard of during the period analyzed. In addition, women who write outside of the women’s page write mostly about social issues such as education or health. This quantitative perspective also allows us to note a significant drop in the space provided for the discussion of women's issues as a result of the abolition of the women's page; topics which will not be picked up by the general section of the daily. Following with a qualitative analysis of women's discourses and the representation of women in the newspaper, this M.A. thesis makes it possible to establish that, despite a constrained gender-based structure, certain women journalists were able to diffuse multiple claims by presenting not only the reality of Quebec women, but also of those of women from the four corners of the world. The diversity of topics addressed by women and the representations of women contradicts several studies which claim that women's pages would only contribute to the diffusion of a reductive vision of women and thus participate in their oppression, leading us to nuance the purely positive vision of the abolition of the women’s page. While it certainly contributed to the confinement of women's point of view to a dedicated space in the newspaper, it also allowed for the diffusion of women's concerns. In conclusion, this research ultimately pursues the objective of lifting the veil on the contribution of women who brought to the public space issues that challenged them, and their attempts to deconstruct the rigid structure of the media that limited their agency.

468	Luttes politiques et références contradictoires à la Révolution durant la Restauration en France, 1814-1820	"In 1814, an ending that no one could have anticipated brought back a dynasty swept by the winds of history twenty-five years ago. Returning to France, Louis XVIII restores their titles to the old nobility of the Ancien Régime, but ""grants"" a Charter which was intended to guarantee the liberal principles inherited from the Revolution. The « Restoration », the name given to the reestablishment on the throne of France of the former Bourbon dynasty, nevertheless raised many questions. What would happen to this new France that had emerged with the Revolution since 1789?  Between 1814 and 1820, a period during which a liberal political program was established, the Royalists invoked the Revolution and the threats it put on the monarchy in order to fight it. The Liberals, on the other hand, saw in their royalist adversaries an old and embittered nobility, emerging once more from a distant past, and who badly conceals its secret desire to abolish the Charter and claim her former rights.  This master’s thesis will discuss the divide that existed between two elites competing for political and social dominance. In the light of the debates of the time, we will see how Royalists and Liberals, the two major political groups of the period, articulated their speech. One theme appears particularly prominent: the Revolution. After two decades, it divides again. Worse, it was still relevant and its memory never ceased to occupy the political space."

469	La théologie de la prospérité	This master’s thesis deals with prosperity theology. The thesis is divided up into three sections. The first section is a general presentation of the movement called « prosperity theology ». The movement, its origins, its prominent figures, its major characteristics and its critics are presented to familiarize the reader with the subject at hand. The second section is an exposition of certain theological concepts found in prosperity theology literature. They are the concepts of God, theodicy, human being, expiation, healing and prosperity. The third section is a critical evaluation of prosperity theology by evangelical theologians. Problems of interpretation are raised. Indeed, the epistemology, the hermeneutics and the exegesis are critiqued. The question of the origins of the movement is debated. The theology of prosperity theologians is critiqued: their conception of God, of theodicy, of human being, of salvation, of expiation, of faith, of healing and prosperity are contested. The impact of the prosperity theology on the believer’s theology is considered. The question of orthodoxy and heresy is raised and a defense of the movement is offered by an evangelical theologian.

470	Corridas en textes et en images : pour une esthétique de la blessure chez Michel Leiris et Ernest Hemingway	During the inter-war period, Michel Leiris and Ernest Hemingway were part of circles composed of painters, photographers and drawers invested in various collaborative projects. Michel Leiris and Ernest Hemingway represent both sides of the cult of bullfighting, to which a whole generation of artists and intellectuals have joined since the early 1920’s. In their works, the imagination of bullfighting is translated through a profusion of images, in praesentia or in absentia. Although criticism has sometimes focused on the influence of painting or on the bullfighting theme in the works of Leiris and Hemingway, a silence surrounds the entanglement yet essential between images, texts and bullfights.   When reading their literary work, a certain number of questions arises: in what way is the view indispensable to the advent of bullfighting? How are the text/picture arrangements thought? To what extent is bullfighting conceived as an art, or rather as a place where all the different arts enter into dialogue? In the course of this work, the chosen direction lies at the crossroads between the thematic criticism as conceived by Michel Collot and the intermedial approach (more precisely his study of the text/image relationship). I will report on the different types of images that punctuate the works of the corpus, essential relays of an aesthetic of the wound. In the novel L'Âge d'homme and the collection Miroir de la tauromachie by Michel Leiris, as well as in the novel Mort dans l'après-midi and the short story « L'Invincible » by Ernest Hemingway, I will discuss the singular aesthetic that binds to the bullfighting theme, expressed by the arrangement of visible wounds.

dissociation and distress among victims of violent crimes"	Background. Peritraumatic dissociation and distress are strong predictors of Acute Stress Disorder (ASD) and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) development. However, there is limited data concerning gender differences in these relations, particularly among victims of violent crimes (VVC). Objective. Examine whether peritraumatic dissociation and distress predict the number of ASD symptoms differently for men and women VVC. Methods. 162 adults (97 women, Mage = 39.6 yrs.), 63% of whom experienced physical assaults, completed the Acute Stress Disorder Interview, the Peritraumatic Dissociative Experience Questionnaire, and the Peritraumatic Distress Inventory. Analyses included t-tests and multiple hierarchical regressions models controlling for known PTSD risk factors. Results. The regression model showed dissociation and distress to be significant predictors of ASD for both men and women (β = .349 and β =.312 respectively; all p<.001). A significant 3-way interaction was also observed between peritraumatic distress (PDI), past potentially traumatic experiences and gender. In simple slopes analyses, the combination of high levels of PDI and of a high number of past potentially traumatic events were associated with greater risk of ASD in men only (b=3.78, p<.001). However, women experienced greater PDI (t (157) = 5.844, p = .005) than men, and elevated distress was associated with more ASD symptoms independently of past traumatic events. Major implications. Gender differences were revealed as a function of past potentially traumatic experiences. There is a cumulative impact of past potential traumas and current distress that predicts ASD in men, while in women; it contributes to ASD via increased distress.

472	Expliquer les écarts de santé mentale entre les hommes et les femmes en emploi : l’effet du genre	This doctoral thesis aims to explain the psychological distress gap between working men and women. Drawing on Pearlin’s “Stress Process” theory, Karasek’s demands-control-support model, Siegrist’s effort-reward model, Marchand’s theory on the multilevel determinants of workers’ mental health, and the gender-relational approach, the thesis verifies three hypotheses. The first is the exposure hypothesis, which posits that women exhibit greater psychological distress because they are not exposed to the same stressors and do not have access to the same resources as men. The second is the vulnerability hypothesis, according to which women and men are not affected by the same stressors. The third is the expression hypothesis, which suggests that a given stressor may prompt distinct responses in women and in men, with women tending more strongly to express their emotional suffering through psychological distress and men being more inclined to at-risk alcohol use. These hypotheses will be explored using a model that (1) incorporates a series of stressors relating to work, family life, and work-family conflict, as well as psychosocial resources that may play a role in these mechanisms, and (2) views work-family conflict as a mediator between stressors, psychosocial resources and mental health. These hypotheses were tested via a multilevel path analysis based on the SALVEO sample of 2026 Canadian workers from 63 workplaces who were interviewed between 2009 and 2012. The results for each hypothesis are presented in the form of scientific articles intended for publication. The analytical results empirically support the three mechanisms by which gender influences the psychological distress difference found between employed women and men. The exposure hypothesis emerges as the key mechanism involved in this inequality, whereas the vulnerability and expression hypotheses play a more marginal role. As the analyses show, each mechanism iv brings into play specific gendered stressors and psychosocial resources. Moreover, the mediating effect of work-family conflict is observed for all three hypotheses. These results call for a systematic consideration of all three mechanisms in order to better identify the processes leading to the psychological distress gap across a given population of workers. They further underscore the importance of taking into account both directions of workfamily conflict as well as psychosocial resources.

473	Utilisation de l’électrophysiologie dans l’étude du développement des capacités d’intégration audiovisuelle du nourrisson à l’âge adulte	An abundant litterature documents the benefits associated to multisensory integration in adults as well as brain mechanisms underlying these skills. However, numerous questions regarding the development of multisensory integration during childhood remain unanswered and there is no consensus among animal data in addition to behavioral, electrophysiological and neuroimaging studies conducted in humans wether these skills are innate or acquired. The first objective of this thesis is to review the literature on the development of multisensory integration capacities. This review, which will constitute the first article of this thesis, presents neuronal and behavioral studies in favour of the nature or nurture character of multisensory integration mechanisms. This review suggests that the capacity to detect and form multisensory associations begins very early in development, but that the ability to integrate multisensory information in an optimal manner is a progressive process that continues to develop over childhood and adolescence. This work has also allowed us to better target the gaps in the existing literature related to the neuronal development of integration capacities, with special emphasis on the integration of non linguistic audiovisual information. Thus, to date no electrophysiological study has yet address the developmental progression of audiovisual integration capacities in infants and preschool children. This ascertainment has justified the conduct of the experimental study presented in the second article with the aim of characterizing the neurotypical developmental progression of non linguistic audiovisual information integration mecanisms as early as 3 months of age to adulthood. This research is also aimed at confirming the age when audiovisual integration mechanisms, on the one hand, begin to operate in a similar fashion than adults and, on the other hand, reach their full maturity. For these purposes, we have conducted an experimental iv study. Here, we undertook a cross-sectional experimental investigation on a large cohort of 121 neurotypical individuals using high-density electrophysiology more specifically through time-frequency analysis. Our study revealed the presence of precursors of audiovisual integration in children as young as two years of age. Moreover, our results indicate that 11- to 14-year-old adolescents start to integrate this information in an adult-like manner, but that audiovisual integration mechanisms reach their full maturity late throughout adolescence between the age of 15 and 17 years. This study supports the literature regarding the progressive emergence of the capacities to integrate audiovisual information, documents the developmental progression of these capacities and answers the absence of literature on the neuronal processes of audiovisual integration in infants and preschool children. Overall, this thesis provides a better understanding of the development of audiovisual integration mechanisms and provides a benchmark to investigate these processes in children with neurodevelopmental disorders often accompanied with sensory impairments.	audition , vision , ondelettes , Multisensory integration , Audiovisual integration , Electrophysiology , Wavelets , Neurotypical development , Neurodevelopmental disorders	en	20615.0
474	Entraîner le contrôle attentionnel chez la personne âgée : perspective comportementale et cérébrale	The main objective of this thesis was to evaluate the effect of cognitive interventions on attentional control using behavioral measures and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The thesis comprises five empirical articles. The aim of the first study (Chapter II) was to examine the cause of age-related differences in attentional control. The results suggest that, compared to younger adults, older participants have more difficulty varying the level of attention to be allocated to each task according to the attentional focus that is required, reflecting a difficulty with attentional control. The second study (Chapter III) aimed to compare the effectiveness of three types of computerized attentionnal training in older adults. The results show specific effects depending on the type of training received. Only the older participants who followed the VARIABLEpriority training, in which they had to vary the level of attention allocated to each task across several blocks, showed improvement in their attentional control skills following training. This improvement cannot be explained by repeated practice in the tasks under focused attention or in the dual-task condition without attentional variation. The aim of the third study (Chapter IV) was to assess whether the benefits of VARIABLE-priority training could transfer to tasks similar to those trained and to tasks that are more representative of everyday life, using an immersive dual-task paradigm in virtual reality (VR). The results show that VARIABLE-priority training improves attentional control abilities and, for the first time, that the beneficial effects of this training can be transferred to a dual-task paradigm in VR in older adults. Furthermore, we show that older adults benefit as much, if not more than younger adults, from an intervention aiming to improve attentional control, and that age does not have an effect on the transfer effects observed. The fourth study assessed (Chapter V) the impact of attentional training on changes in fMRI activation. The results suggest that the brain is highly plastic, even in old age, and that the changes in activation are different depending on the type of intervention. VARIABLEpriority training, which aims to teach attentional control strategies and metacognitive abilities, is the only one that produces increases in activation in a frontal region involved in multitasking and attentional control. Repeated practice of a task under focused attention, on the other hand, causes decreases in activation in regions that were previously recruited. Finally, the aim of the fifth study (Chapter VI) was to evaluate the time course of activation changes across three fMRI sessions. An increase in activation followed by a plateau in regions related to the strategies learned for the VARIABLE-priority training is observed, while the activation changes following repeated practice are characterized by an inverse U-shape function. The results of the latter study show that activation changes are non-linear during training and, similarly to the results obtained in the fourth study, are modulated by the type of intervention followed.

475	Experimental and numerical study of a magnetic realization of a Bose-Einstein Condensate in a purely organic spin-1/2 quantum magnet (NIT2Py)	The research presented in this thesis focuses on studying the magnetic properties of a purely organic free radical molecule NIT2Py, which can condense into highly stable crystals at room temperature. The magnetization measurements reveal that each molecule carries a magnetic moment due to the existence of a spin-1/2 unpaired electron. The magnetic order is found to be antiferromagnetic (AFM). The field dependence of the magnetization isotherm measurement at 0.5 K shows a 1/2 magnetization plateau. Temperature dependence specific heat and magnetocaloric effect are used to produce the (H,T) phase diagram. In the vicinity of a quantum critical point, the (H,T) phase boundary moves towards a power law with a critical exponent of 1.47(9) that is compatible with the universal value of 1.5 for a 3D BEC. The dome-shaped field-induced ordering phases and the intersecting spin levels observed in NIT2Py are signatures of magnetic realisation of BEC, which is seen for the first time in a purely organic quantum spin-1/2 AFM.       We propose a relevant model spin Hamiltonian based on the Heisenberg exchange interactions. We exploit state-of-the art electronic structure calculations through density functional theory combined with the broken-symmetry and the energy mapping approaches to evaluate the exchange coupling constants (Js), which in turn provide us with the sign and strengths of the exchange interactions in the system. The strongest exchange interactions are found to be related to three AFM Js. An appropriate magnetic lattice, which is a repeat pattern of a minimal set of strong Js, is constructed. We found that the magnetic lattice consisting of spin tetramers, each having four spins with two intratetramer AFM interactions, explains the magnetic properties of NIT2Py. By resorting to mean-field approximation, we establish a magnetization model for a system of interacting tetramers, which can reproduce the magnetic properties of the system such as the two-step saturation with an intermediate plateau at half saturated magnetization. Furthermore, an exact diagonalization of the Heisenberg Hamiltonian for a system including four tetramers is carried out, and yields the magnetization and other required thermodynamic properties of the system.

476	Injustice nationale et asymétrie de pouvoir au niveau mondial : pour une approche républicaine de la responsabilité globale en matière de lutte contre la pauvreté mondiale	The objective of our research project is to design a republican approach to international obligations in the fight against global poverty which, while recognizing the need for normative reform of international institutions, grants, in the fight against global poverty, a priority for accountability at the national level.  Our work intends to subscribe to a theory of global justice that takes a stand in relation to the cosmopolitan approach of global responsibility defended by Thomas Pogge. In relation to Pogge’s thesis who based the necessity of global justice on the existence of a causal link between global poverty and the international system, we have proposed a quite different justification for global justice based on the informal nature of political power in poor countries, and the dynamics of power inherent in bilateral relations between the governments of poor countries and the governments of rich countries.  From this perspective, it has become clear to us that the extreme injustices in the persistence of global poverty were caused by the neo-patrimonial nature of the state in poor countries and that the rich countries, contributed to the maintenance of poverty by politically and financially supporting the infra-institutional practices that dominate the state in poor countries. Thus, drawing inspiration from the republican approach to freedom as non-domination, we re-evaluated the link between world poverty and the international system by showing, first of all, that domination at the global level is intimately linked to The way in which the neo-patrimonial State exercises its sovereignty, that is to say, the political management of dependence; Then it emerged that the institutional patterns of global domination were in many respects related to the unfairness of the foreign policy of the superpowers controlling the world political scene and the often informal clientelistic mode under which are functioning bilateral relations between Rich and poor countries. Thus, far from causing world poverty, the international system in its own way exaggerates existing poverty at the domestic level and the strengthening of which contributes to the foreign policy of the rich countries.  In the preceding analyzes, which follow the logic of a statist approach to global justice, we have developed, according to the principle of freedom as non-domination, the normative orientations that a system of global justice intended to fight against global poverty. Above all, we started from the assumption that in the absence of a normative reform of political institutions at the level of poor countries and of a democratic reform of foreign policy in the rich countries – in the absence of justice at these two domestic levels – the effectiveness of the global justice thought as non-domination will be compromised. The idea is to show that the normative reform of the international system is in many respects based on the normative reform of national political institutions.

477	Caractérisation des profils de traitements pour accident vasculaire cérébral et événements cliniques associés	Data on drug-prescribing practices following an acute ischemic stroke (AIS), a major health problem, and secondary stroke prevention treatments’ effectiveness are scarce in a realworld setting. The aim of this thesis was to describe patterns of treatments prescribed in the Quebec community practice setting among incident AIS patients and to determine the risk of death or AIS recurrence. A retrospective cohort study of 5,587 incident AIS adult (age 18+) patients identified between 1st January 2011 and 31st December 2012 was conducted using the claims databases of the Régie de l’assurance maladie du Québec (RAMQ). In the month after discharge, the majority of patients (n=4,005; 71.7%) were receiving antithrombotic agents (anticoagulant and/or antiplatelet) while only 55.7% were taking these treatments according to the Canadian clinical guidelines. However, nearly one fifth (20.2%) of patients did not receive any prescribed treatment in the month following hospital discharge. Survival analyses showed that all treatments were associated with a 50% risk reduction of allcause mortality and AIS recurrence. Clinical efficacy of secondary stroke prevention treatments reported in randomized controlled trials seemed to be confirmed in a real-world setting.

478	Innovations médiatiques et avant-garde musicale : une sociomusicologie des «musiques émergentes» à l’ère du web 2.0	"Through the study of Montreal’s early 2010s ""post-rap"" scene, our goal is to observe how the artists of this scene built a musical genre that stands out, within its audience, from all other hip hop production in Quebec. We proceed to this exercice with the use of taste and cultural practices ranking schemes developed by French and American sociology. We interviewed several stakeholders of the Quebec alternative media world and a band associated with the label ""post-rap"" to understand how the mediation of this music could create a social distinction between this scene and the rest of the production of other hip hop music. “Post-rap’s” mediation and dissemination of musical schemes, which involve specific uses of digital marketing and technologies, associate it with the world of ""emerging music"", whose consumption is theoretically linked to the habits of a student or educated population, thus to average or higher social classes. We observe that “emerging musics” aren’t filed under any specific genre but rather the belonging to an autonomous professional network standing in the margins of the Quebec music industry. As a scene, “post-rap” does belong to the “emerging music” network but shares stylistic traits with hip hop music. Since “post-rap” music manifests itself as a musically similar but socially different phenomenon than Quebec’s hip hop, we query the ways genres are classified within sociological studies of cultural and musical tastes."

479	Impact de l’IL-15 dans un modèle murin de la sclérose en plaques	Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS). This disease is characterized by demyelination and immune cell infiltration in the CNS. Studies have shown that the immune system plays a key role in MS pathogenesis. Our laboratory identified the cytokine, interleukin 15 (IL-15), as a potential effector in MS development. IL-15 has been shown to be elevated in the blood and lesions of MS patients; however, its implications or its mechanisms of action in MS are not well defined. The goal of this project was to assess the role of IL-15 in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) animal model of MS. In this project, we injected peripheral IL-15 for 8 days to EAE mice and followed their clinical score. We also harvested the CNS and the spleen for cytometry analysis. Our results showed that peripheral injection of IL-15 caused a more severe EAE, and changed the frequency of CD8 T lymphocytes and NK cells in the periphery and CNS. We also showed that CD8 T cells in the periphery and CNS have increased IL-15 receptor expression after the IL-15 injection. Overall, our data show that peripheral IL-15 plays a role in the progression of EAE and affects the phenotype and number of immune cells.

480	Sélection et étude de peptides inhibiteurs multi-cibles visant les Mur ligases chez Pseudomonas aeruginosa	Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen responsible of many nosocomial infections around the world.  Among cystic fibrosis patients, lung infections caused by this bacterium are the major cause of morbidity and mortality and thus developing new antipyocyanic agents, capable to fight this pathogen in an efficient and sustainable manner, is now a necessity to improve the quality and the life expectancy of these patients. To realize this, the peptidoglycan is one of the best targets for the development of antibacterial agents given the essential role of this polymer in bacterial survival. The Mur ligases (MurC, MurD, MurE and MurF), a family of very similar enzymes that have an essential role in the peptidoglycan biosynthesis pathway, are today not targeted by any antibiotic and are promising targets for the development of effective and sustainable antibacterial agents that target several of them. In this study, the Mur ligases of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were purified and used as targets in an innovative strategy to select peptides with affinity for the four Mur ligases. For this purpose, two peptide libraries were screened using an optimized version of the phage display technique and six selected peptides were evaluated for their specific affinity for the Mur ligases.

481	Effet des pesticides sur la diversité bactérienne des champs agricoles et la capacité des bactéries à les dégrader	This study presents the characterization of bacteria involved responsible in-vivo bioremediation of herbicides Diuron and Linuron. Microbial biodiversity was analyzed using 16S RNA amplicon sequencing methods for six soil samples of two different biofilters, sampled three times a year over three year period. Illumina MiSeq amplicon sequencing coupled with bioinformatics and statistical analysis showed that the Actinobacteria group are most abundant in soil noncontaminated by pesticides accounting for up to 45% of bacteria, whereas subsequent exposure of soil to pesticides altered the biodiversity and the abundance of each group of bacteria present in a given soil sample. Proteobacteria were found to be the most abundant after three successive exposures to pesticides during the growing session. Once pesticide exposure stopped during the winter period, the biodiversity of our soil had a tendency to recover. Rhodanobacter spathiphyllum and Geobacillus stearothermophilus were isolated from a soil sample exposed to pesticides and showed optimal growth in the presence of Diuron in liquid minimal medium compared to conditions without the pesticide. The results of degradation of Diuron and Linuron by R. spathiphyllum in minimal medium, were confirmed by High Performance Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (HPLC-MS), and showed a better degradation of Linuron (from 20 μg/ ml to 0.9 μg/ml and Diuron (from 40 μg/ml to 31 μg/ml) by R. spathiphyllum and (from 40 μg/ml to 37 μg/ml) by G. stearothermophilus. The degradation of Diuron by R. spathiphyllum seems to produce by-products that inhibit its growth.

482	Evaluation de la fonction microvasculaire myocardique par résonance magnétique cardiaque sensible à l'oxygène chez des transplantés cardiaques	BACKGROUND: Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is one of the leading cause of long-term mortality after heart transplantation. This multifactorial pathology is characterized by diffuse and concentric thickening of the graft vessels and induces microvascular damages to the myocardium. Due to the lack of angina symptomatology of cardiac transplant patients and the difficult detection of diffuse involvement by conventional coronary angiography, CAV progresses insidiously and is often diagnosed at an advanced stage. Our aim was to test a new method of assessment of microvascular function by oxygen-sensitive cardiac magnetic resonance (OS-CMR) in a population of cardiac transplant (CT) recipients with varying degrees of CAV at coronary angiography.  METHODS: We compared in OS-CMR the change in signal intensity induced by vaso-modulatory breathing maneuvers (hyperventilation followed by breath hold) in 46 CT, 23 of whom had an angiographic CAV and compared to 25 healthy volunteers (HV). The feasibility of breathing maneuvers and the quality of OS-CMR images were also evaluated. Finally, we looked for potential predictors of microvascular response after cardiac transplantation.  RESULTS: The myocardial microvascular response represented by the signal intensity change during breathing maneuvers is significantly attenuated in CT compared to HV (2.63 ± 4.16 versus 6.40 ± 5.96 p=0.0099) for SI change at 30 seconds breath hold; (4.91 ± 3.74 versus 8.86 ± 6.15 p=0.0063) for the maximum SI change measured during breath hold. The maximal response is significantly lower in grades 2-3 combined (1.02±2.03) compare to grades 0 (5.09±4.20) and to grade 1 (5.88±2.73), whilst there is no difference between these last 2 groups (p=0.45). The maximal response is lower in CT without any angiographically CAV compare to the HV (5.09±4.20 versus 8.86±6.15 p<0.05). The aforementionned comparisons at 30 seconds breath hold lead to the same conclusion. The breathing maneuvers of hyperventilation and breath hold are feasible in cardiac transplant recipients (0% total disability to perform maneuvers, 9% inability to maintain at least 30sec breath hold). Due to the good quality of the OS-CMR images, 94% of the myocardial segments could be analyzed (3074/3264). Finally, there is an inverse correlation between microvascular response and donor age, ventricular volumes and regional or diffuse fibrosis, while there is a positive linear correlation between the microvascular response and the presence of dyslipidemia.  CONCLUSION: OS-CMR combined with breathing maneuvers is a clinically drug-free, non-invasive and innovative imaging technique allowing the detection of abnormal microvascular response in cardiac transplant recipients at a stage where conventional angiography doesn’t diagnose any degree of CAV.	circulation coronaire , cardiac transplantation , heart transplantation , cardiac allograft vasculopathy , oxygen sensitive cardiac magnetic resonance , chronic rejection , coronary circulation , microcirculation , breathing maneuvers , oxygenation	en	20500.0
483	Contributions à la fusion de segmentations et à l’interprétation sémantique d’images	This thesis is dedicated to study two complementary problems, namely the fusion of image segmentation and the semantic interpretation of images. Indeed, at first we propose a set of algorithmic tools to improve the final result of the operation of the fusion. Image segmentation is a common preprocessing step which aims to simplify the image representation into significant and spatially coherent regions (also known as segments or super-pixels) with similar attributes (such as coherent parts of objects or the background). To this end, we propose a new fusion method of segmentation in the sense of the Global consistency error (GCE) criterion. GCE is an interesting metric of perception that takes into account the multiscale nature of any segmentations of the image while measuring the extent to which one segmentation map can be viewed as a refinement of another segmentation. Secondly, we present two new approaches for merging multiple segmentations within the framework of multiple criteria based on a very important concept of combinatorial optimization ; the multi-objective optimization. Indeed, this method of resolution which aims to optimize several objectives concurrently has met with great success in many other fields. Thirdly, to better and automatically understand the various classes of a segmented image we propose an original and reliable approach based on an energy-based model which allows us to deduce the most likely classes by using a set of identically partitioned segmentations (in the sense of a certain criterion) extracted from a learning database (with pre-interpreted classes) and a set of semantic likelihood (energy) terms	Fusion , Segmentation ensemble , Global consistency error (GCE) , Penalized likelihood model , Multi-objective optimization , Decision making , Semantic image segmentation	en	20490.0
484	Ni fable ni estoire : les fictions mitoyennes et la troisième voie du fabliau	Medievalists frequently emphasize the typological challenges that afflict the fabliau (Adrian Tudor, 2003). Often ineffectual in rethinking the definition proffered by Joseph Bédier (“tales written in verse to laugh at”, 1893), they contend that medieval authors and scribes do not distinguish generic labels. Criticism has only rarely queried the meaning of the word fable (fablel) that has been given to this accepted genre employed throughout the 13th century. If these brief narratives were sometimes read as “historic” documents as they generally favor a contemporary frame and do not convey the marvelous as do the Arthurian romances, the etymological link that the designation fablel maintains with the Latin term fabula (that contests historia as false speech to the word of truth) points the reader on the path to fiction. A perusal that takes into account the generic vocabulary, the metatextual commentaries and the manuscript collections that have preserved the narratives, reveals that the fabliaux claim to belong to the domain of the fabula while distinguishing themselves from other forms of fiction. Their singularity stems principally from the “third way” in which they are situated. On the fringe of absolute truth as well as pure fabrication, they offer a reflection on the truth-value of fictional texts.  The question of fiction permeates both the Latin medieval poetic arts as well as works in the vernacular that seek to be singularized in relation to the Latin language. The overview of instances of romance, as well as of epic and hagiographical genres reveals a continual desire to guarantee the legitimacy of fiction (chapter I). Examination of the lexicological and semantic highlights the specificity of the fabliau. More precisely, the use of fable testifies to an effort of semantic reinvestment of fable, a term associated with dishonesty in literature (chapter II). The use of octosyllabic couplets, accepted as the medium of literary fiction since the 12th century, lends a sentiment of usury regarding already practiced fictions that are also called to be renewed (chapter III). This desire to find new avenues in fiction becomes more apparent when one is drawn into the pedagogical content of the fabliaux that depicts a world of changing values and rejects both the courtly and Arthurian traditions and the absolute truths transmitted by the Bible (chapter IV), the conclusions that reinforce and enrich the examination of the manuscript collections (chapter V). In the end it is a question of identifying the nature of the ambivalent fiction (the “third way”) in the fabliaux. The analysis underscores a penchant for the semblance which, linked with the truth, traces the contours of a medieval definition of the vraisemblance recalling the category of the argumentum that refers to an in between in the Latin poetic arts and that, unlike those of the fabula (fable) and the historia (estoire), has not bequeathed an equivalent to the vernacular (chapter VI).

485	El lenguaje de los jóvenes hispanos de la ciudad de Montreal	Canada is internationally known and recognized as a country of linguistic and cultural convergences. In this setting, the Spanish language has found –through the years– a place that seems to be gaining ground every day. With the growth of the Hispanic population in Canada, and especially in the Greater Montreal Region, along with the need to start exploring a situation of language and dialect contact most probably unique in the Hispanic context, for Spanish being in contact not with one, but two majority languages (French and English), we intend to study one of the age groups that most favours linguistic change: the youth. The material used for this study is composed of a corpus made of questionnaires and recordings of group conversations from 53 Spanish-speaking youngsters from various Spanish dialect norms, men and women, between 14 and 24 years of age, and belonging to three generations of immigrants (1, 1.5 and 2). The results show a presence, at all analytical levels, of features specific to the dialect of origin, to standard Spanish, and more or less influence of the majority languages (French and English) depending on the level of linguistic analysis. In that respect, women informants show a disposition to use forms that are considered more prestigious in standard and regional Spanish, as well as among the youth and in a situation of language contact. The influence of the country’s majority languages is especially evidenced in generations 1.5 and 2. With respect to age, while informants of 18 years of age or more favour the use of regional forms, those under 18 years of age favour creations associated to youth language. Contact with youngsters speaking other dialect norms does not favours regional forms nor innovative forms resulting from contact, but levelling and the use of standard Spanish. The main features of such levelling are present at the lexical and morphosyntactical levels. Moreover, the results show various accommodation strategies, fundamentally converging. Finally, and in relation do language attitudes, informants acknowledge that Spanish is a diverse language and see themselves as transmitters of Spanish to future generations.

486	Communal Conflict and the Geopolitics of Land Tenure, Social Identity and Statehood in North Kivu (Democratic Republic of the Congo)	This thesis offers a geopolitical analysis of land tenure and land tenure conflict in North Kivu (DRC). From a close-up perspective based on interviews and survey questionnaires concerning land tenure conflicts in the rural areas of the province, the thesis proceeds to analyse links between land tenure, the existing land tenure systems and conflicts over land tenure, on one side, and the region’s more visible, and thus also more studied, communal, civil and interstate conflicts, on the other. On a first level of analysis, the thesis shows how the design and application of the Congo’s successive land tenure systems have affected longstanding inter-communal tensions and recurring conflicts over land tenure and social identities. On a second level, the thesis also shows how this has nurtured intense geopolitical tensions in the four southern territories of North Kivu that have erupted on several occasions in recent history into communal, civil and interstate wars.

487	Analysis of the religious practices of Hindus at Saint Joseph's Oratory : transmission of Christian faith after the Second Vatican Council	From the beginning of Christianity, the transmission of Christian faith constituted the essential mission of the Church. With the evolution of multi-religious and multicultural social milieu in many parts of the world, the Second Vatican Council recognized the importance of opening the door of the Church to all people. Basile Moreau (1799 - 1873), founder of the Congregation of Holy Cross, insisted that members of his order be educators in Christian faith, and sent missionaries to Quebec since the founding of his community in 1837. For the latter, among other pastoral commitments, Saint Joseph’s Oratory of Mount Royal, founded by Alfred Bessette (Brother André, 1845 - 1937), became the privileged place for the transmission of Christian faith even after the Quiet Revolution of the 1960s. Saint Joseph’s Oratory welcomes thousands of immigrants from around the world each year, including many Hindus. For many of them, the Oratory becomes a second home where they spend time in prayer and find peace. Some of them experience healing and miracles. The sharing of sacred space with Hindus is a new phenomenon at the Oratory. Hindus at the Oratory participate in catholic devotional activities. Among many other paths to achieve moksha or liberation, bhakti, an intense devotion to a personal God in Hinduism, influences Hindus who participate in Sacraments and Sacramentals at the Oratory. Based on my analysis of the religious practices of Hindus at the Oratory – especially the practices of the use of Holy Water and the lighting of candles – I recommend certain guidelines for the Oratory to nourish the piety and devotion of Hindus who adapt themselves to a Christian environment. I elaborate how the Catholic educators in faith can better establish themselves in serving an increasingly diverse and multicultural population. My study is based on a series of qualitative interviews with the educators in faith and members of Hindu religious tradition. This study helps to discover the meeting point between Christians and Hindus at the Oratory, and throws light on the transmission of Christian faith in the current setting at Saint Joseph’s Oratory, including the presence of Hindus.	ārtī , avatāra , bhakti , Dīpavali , moksha , pūjā , satchitānanda , tīrtha , catholicism and non-christian religions , congregation of holy cross , educators in faith , hindu philosophy , hinduism and Québec , hindus and Oratory , holy water at the Oratory , pastoral praxeology , popular piety and devotions at the Oratory , practice of lighting of candles at the Oratory , sacraments , sacramental , Saint Joseph’s Oratory , second vatican council , sharing of sacred space , theology of religions , transmission of christian faith	en	20447.0
488	Politiques publiques, programmes et projets sensibles au genre : cas de la communauté Mandjara au Cameroun	"The focus on ""the history of women in Africa"" seems to gradually shifting towards a new paradigm: would the new approaches have been imposing that a gender perspective should unavoidably been addressed? It must be said, however, that the boundary between the two epistemological postures is tenuous, namely the one which asserts that its main focus regards ''the history of women"" and the other which declares its primary interest in ""gender perspectives"". Indeed, heuristic bridges allow to write the history of women while questioning the gender issue. As nowadays' research is encouraging to deepen specific knowledge on African's women in all areas (health, education, economics, politics, rights), several recent studies address the issue of women from a gender perspective. Therefore the present thesis falls in this wake by also having the preoccupation that the view on women should not be separated from that on gender. The epistemological posture of this thesis, which is looking at women with a gender sensitivity, invites to reconsider the dichotomous logics underlying the heuristic approach between men and women, political and social, private and public, dominant and dominated. Nevertheless, we do not enter into the wake of research which, refuting the dichotomy conveyed by the notion of gender, would impose to consider transgender, transvestites and hermaphrodites. It is through a gender approach that we have examined the masculine and feminine identities' constructing processes, the feminine mobilization, socio-political phenomena, and the body's relationship. Social determinants such as age, social class, socio-professional category, living environment (urban, semi-urban and rural), level of education (literate and illiterate) were taken into consideration. We believe having been able to point out the coherences which emerge from the three articles of this thesis dealing with complementary aspects through the subjects covered. In addition to examining the place and action of women in their diversity, we seek to analyze ideological constructions that assign specific roles to women and men. This process highlights the differentiated impact of policies and situations according to the status of the individual and the various facets of his or her identity. The three articles are interwoven in the structuring of this thesis, which thus, places itself in the asserted perspective to adopt the reflection on the women issue with a gender sensitivity. This reflection applies to the African continent through a variety of thematic that contributes to enriching and renewing approaches on Africa. The questions that arise through analysis are grouped into two (2) themes.  The first under the title ""Gender: identities and (traditional) governance, public policies and féminine mobilization"" is an analysis of the construction of identity and governance female among the Cameroon’s Mandjara group; It also takes a look at the associative dynamics and its impact on the appropriation (or not) of public policies.  The second, under the title ""Gender, Public Policy and Health: Health as a place of apprehension of NGPC "", is a review of the understanding and interpretation of the NGPC statement on health.  The non-classical model of a thesis by articles is the one adopted by the present work structured as follows. The first part is a description of the conceptual research frameworks. It includes an introduction that states the motivations, the interests and the research context. Then follows chapter 1 which is dealing with a literature criticism, outlining the definitions of concepts and the various epistemological standpoints on women and gender issues.  Chapter 2 provides an overview and a problematization as well as identifying the research objectives. Chapter 3 concludes this first section with the methodology which gives an answer to the ethical question, describes the data collection tools and indicates the limitations of the study. The second part is the presentation of the research outcomes having five (5) chapters of which three (3) are articles. Chapter 4: ""The Mandjara: Ethnogenesis and identities"". Chapter 5: ""The Mandjara: an example of Africa's female traditional governance "". Chapter 6: ""Cameroon and the gender issue (article submitted for publication in the journal Advances in Anthropology (AA), the 06th December 2016, 08 pages, co-authors Professor Gilles Bibeau and Professor Bilkis Vissandjée"". Chapter 7: ""The National Gender Policy of Cameroon: challenged by the social reality of Mandjara's women and men (Article submitted for publication to the journal Anthropologie et Sociétés, 20 September 2016, 28 pages, co-authors Professor Gilles Bibeau and Professor Bilkis Vissandjée). ""Chapter 8: ""Gender and health in Cameroon, when anthropology intervenes in the doctor-patient relationship: a case study of Mandjara’s women’’ (article submitted for publication to the journal Anthropologica, September 28, 2016, 15 pages, co-authors Professor Gilles Bibeau and Professor Bilkis Vissandjé). The third and last part includes chapter 9 which demonstrate the relevance of the three articles in the thesis. Then the general conclusion illustrates the recommendations resulting from the research work.   Catherine Coquery-Vidrovitch thought until recently that African researchers should be more involved in research on gender relations (mainly in Africa). The experience of an ethnographic field in Cameroon, in the heart of the temporality, the contemporaneity and the daily life of the Mandjara’s women and men of the Bamoun, Bafia and Nso communities was organized around the effort to discover the Other and familiarity with the otherness of the Other. Qualitative, the methodological approach was based on documentation and bibliographic data and an organized combination of participant observation, individual interviews supplemented with group discussions. A self-reflexive approach has made it possible to become aware of the plurality of viewpoints within anthropology. It is in this perspective that our analysis made use of a multidisciplinary standpoint, beyond a transdisciplinary approach, and which called together ethno-history, socio-cultural anthropology and medical anthropology, political anthropology, anthropology of public policy and anthropology of gender. The melting point between these disciplines, which are claiming at the same time their specificity and disciplinary autonomy, is by working on various sources and the integration of the oral tradition as a legitimate support. This doctoral path, at the heart of contemporary anthropology, was achieved against the background of the theoretical and methodological orientations that characterize the department of anthropology of the Université de Montréal such as those of social and cultural anthropology.   The grammatical feminine sense: in order to ensure that the feminine and masculine senses of words are explicitly referred to, this thesis has chosen to make use of the capital E whenever possible. Otherwise and in order to lighten the text the masculine form is used."

489	Femmes canadiennes et intimités transnationales : mobilités, ancrages et réunification conjugale	In a global context characterized as much by its flows of information, ideas, people and goods as by the increasing impermeability of national borders, what are the dynamics at play in the development of intimacies and conjugal projects between Canadian women and men from the Global South? This anthropological study explores the lived experience of the romantic encounter, the development of intimacy during periods of physical co-presence and periods of separateness, marriage and the Canadian spousal reunification process from the perspective of Canadian women involved in transnational relationships with men from the Global South. It draws on the women’s narratives of their conjugal and mobility trajectories, on eighteen months of participant observation in two online support group designed for women in binational relationships, as well as on interviews with other key actors.  First, this thesis examines the romantic encounter and at the development of intimacy. It appears that for the women, the dynamics of conjugality, mobility and dwelling are all interconnected. However, they differ depending on whether the women lived in the country of her partner or the relationship developed mainly at a distance, such as when the romantic encounter occurred on the Internet or during a vacation trip. In the first case, the choice of destination and the conjugal trajectory of the women are generally the continuation of a familiarization with alterity that started early in their lives. In the second case, the women’s transnational intimacy generates a form of romantic hyper-mobility fueled by the intensity and the frequency of the visits to their husband, and by an extensive use of communication technologies. However, in both cases, the man’s mobility constraints rapidly become a limitation to the development of the relationship.   Second, this thesis explores the lived experience of the Canadian spousal reunification process. This bureaucratic process represents such a great investment on the part of the women that it becomes emotionally loaded and acquires great symbolic value, which, in turn, contributes to the reification of the women’s conjugal project. However, the legitimacy of the relationship is constantly questioned throughout the process—in forms to fill out and in interviews with immigration agents. Hence, the difficulties encountered in the reunification procedures are experienced as a set of administrative trials imposed on their relationship. Because of their first hand experience of this “economy of suspicion”, the women sponsors develop increased reflexivity about their couple relationship and form support networks where information and experiences are shared and discussed and where they question, redefine and reproduce conjugal norms.   Finally, this study demonstrates how trajectories of mobility, dwelling and conjugality are intimately connected. Canadian women’s matrimonial projects with men from the Global South propel their geographical and virtual mobility and thus reinforce their transnational habitus. However, the spousal reunification process acts as a national and a moral border. It contributes to augment the vulnerability of the women, and questions their ability (and their right) to make a legitimate matrimonial choice.

490	An approach to improved microbial eukaryotic genome annotation	New sequencing technologies have considerably accelerated the rate at which genomic data is being generated. One ongoing challenge is the accurate structural annotation of those novel genomes once sequenced and assembled, in particular if the organism does not have close relatives with well-annotated genomes. Whole-transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) and assembly—both of which share similarities to whole-genome sequencing and assembly, respectively—have been shown to dramatically increase the accuracy of gene annotation. Read coverage, inferred splice junctions and assembled transcripts can provide valuable information about gene structure. Several annotation pipelines have been developed to automate structural annotation by incorporating information from RNA-Seq, as well as protein sequence similarity data, with the goal of reaching the accuracy of an expert curator. Annotation pipelines follow a similar workflow. The first step is to identify repetitive regions to prevent misinformed sequence alignments and gene predictions. The next step is to construct a database of evidence from experimental data such as RNA-Seq mapping and assembly, and protein sequence alignments, which are used to inform the generalised Hidden Markov Models of gene prediction software. The final step is to consolidate sequence alignments and gene predictions into a high-confidence consensus set. Thus, automated pipelines are complex, and therefore susceptible to incomplete and erroneous use of information, which can poison gene predictions and consensus model building. Here, we present an improved approach to microbial eukaryotic genome annotation. Its conception was based on identifying and mitigating potential sources of error and bias that are present in available pipelines. Our approach has two main aspects. The first is to create a more complete and diverse set of extrinsic evidence to better inform gene predictions. The second is to use extrinsic evidence in tandem with predictions such that the influence of their respective biases in the consensus gene models is reduced. We benchmarked our new tool against three known pipelines, showing significant gains in gene, transcript, exon and intron sensitivity and specificity in the genome annotation of microbial eukaryotes.

491	H3K27M/I mutations promote context-dependent transformation in acute myeloid leukemia with RUNX1 alterations	Neomorphic missense mutations affecting crucial lysine residues in histone H3 genes have been shown to be initiating mutation in a variety of solid tumors. Despite the high prevalence of H3K27M mutations in pediatric glioblastoma proceeded by the loss of global H3K27me2/3, these mutations have not been studied in human hematological cancers. Using the H3.3K27M/I transgenes we studied the effects of the loss of H3K27me2/3 on normal and transformed hematopoietic cells. We identified oncogenic histone H3K27M/I mutations in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) that led to a significant reduction of H3K27me2/3. The mutation profiles of H3K27M/I patients revealed that these lesions invariably co-occurred with RUNX1 alterations. Expression of H3.3K27M/I in an AML1-ETO9a driven mouse model resulted in accelerated in vitro proliferation and in vivo disease latency. The expression of H3.3K27M in human CD34+ umbilical cord blood cells led to a selective expansion of a primitive hematopoietic progenitor population, but was insufficient to drive leukemogenesis on its own. This demonstrates a collaboration between RUNX1 and loss of H3K27me2/3. In the context of RUNX1 alterations in AML, hypo-H3K27me3 accelerates disease progression. We conclude that H3K27me2/3 has a leukemia suppressive function in RUNX1 mutant and translocated AML. Our findings have the potential to inform the development of a targeted therapeutic strategy for the treatment of RUNX1mut AML patients.

492	Les mailles de la fiducie en contexte de dissolution de l'union matrimoniale : de l'application des mécanismes du C.C.Q. au soulèvement du voile fiduciaire en droit québécois	Although companies and partnerships have traditionally been used to hold assets, the trust is a new legal tool that has gained tremendous popularity since its introduction in the Civil Code of Québec. Given this context, the question that must be asked is whether assets holding by a trust could have an impact on the partition between spouses at the time of the dissolution of their matrimonial union. When the family residence is held by a trust, the first resort of the spouse seeking partition is often based on section 415 CCQ, which establishes the family patrimony, that is composed of the family residence ans also by the rights which confer use of them. The nature of these rights, the identity of the holder of the rights, and the modalities of their calculation remain a source of debate amongst the legal community. When the assets held in trust are not the family residence, attributing a value to the interest in the trust may provide some relief to the spouse seeking partition, primarily when the matrimonial regime of the parties is that of the partnership of acquests. In this regard, it will be necessary to examine the legal nature of that interest in the trust and to identify the rights deriving with respect to the matrimonial regime of the parties, as well as to consider the modalities of calculating the value of that interest. When these legal mechanisms are not adequate to the circumstances, some spouses may seek to obtain the sharing of certain assets by applying the theory of the lift of the fiduciary veil, an analogy to the lift of the corporate veil. Although its use is infrequent at the time being, there are positive developments towards the recognition of this theory in Quebec civil law.

493	Evaluation et quantification de différents facteurs influençant le temps de traitement orthodontique	INTRODUCTION: One of the main concerns of orthodontic patients is the overall treatment time wearing braces. The patient’s desire is to obtain an aesthetic and functional result in minimum time. Prior to considering approaches which are supposed to reduce treatment time, it is essential to understand the factors that may lengthen it. A quick and efficient correction of the malocclusion is both beneficial to the patient and to the treating orthodontist. This reduces the potential side effects of prolonged treatment (caries, bone loss, white spot lesions, etc.), while allowing the orthodontist to better control office expenses arising from the proper functioning of the clinic. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate and quantify the variables that may influence the orthodontic treatment time. MATERIALS & METHODS: The study included records of 300 retention patients who were treated at the graduated orthodontic clinic, Faculty of dentistry, University of Montreal. Eight of them were excluded due to poor monitoring of their treatment related to health problems or because of lacking data. The following variables were evaluated: patient’s age and sex, the clinical and radiological data related to the malocclusions, the elements used in the planning and execution of treatment and the degree of patient cooperation. Uni-varied analyses (chi-square, t-test and ANOVA) were used to identify variables that affect treatment time. The data distribution normality was evaluated by the Shapiro-Wilk test. A p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Subsequently, a multiple regression analysis was used to build a model to predict the treatment time. RESULTS & DISCUSSION: We found that cooperation was an important factor in the variation in treatment time. Each missed appointment (MA) and each debonded bracket requiring rebonding increased the active time with fixed appliances by 2.3 months and 1 month, respectively. There are numerous variables affecting the duration of the active phase, ranging from planning extractions to other selected treatment protocols. For example, the use of Assure® resin and Transbond XT ™ adhesive resulted in a more effective and shorter treatment time, while limiting the number of debonded brackets. Age had no influence as opposed to the severity of the initial malocclusion (overjet [OJ] and overbite [OB]) which, for example, increased the treatment time by about 10 days per point of discrepancy index (DI) or 0.7 months per millimeter of class II according to the Angle classification. The collected data allowed us to establish the following prediction model: estimated treatment time = 12.606 months + 0.316 (if male) + 0.084 x (OJ value) + 0.301 x (OB value) + 0.339 x (per point of DI) + 0.699 x (Severity of Cl II) + X (type of adhesive) + Y (type of resin) + Z (type of bracket) + 4.297 (if extractions) + 4.163 (if elastics needed) + 1.750 (if clinician graduated more than 15 years ago) + 2.297 x (by MA) + 0.971 x (by the number of debonded brackets). CONCLUSION: This study revealed that the duration of orthodontic treatment is influenced by the following factors in order of importance: extraction (s), cooperation, initial malocclusion, adhesive and resin products, bracket type, clinician’s years of experience and patient gender.

494	L’économique de la pauvreté au cœur d'une ville prospère : perceptions d'usagers d'aide alimentaire	This memoir takes food aid services in Drummondville, an economically prosperous city, as an observatory to make light of the economic social representations of people living a situation of impoverishment and the way these social representations influence how they appropriate food aid. Therefore, we have worked on three levels of observation of the food aid relationship.   The first level of observation was constructed with social-historic and statistical documents about the city and the food aid environments in order to reveal its social morphology. The second level of observation of the food aid relationship was based upon periods of participant observation within two food aid organizations in Drummondville with the goal of grasping the social interactions taking place there. The third and final level of observation consisted of a series of individual open structure interviews with food aid users specifically selected in order to represent a variety of impoverishment types and social appropriation of food aid.  Among other things, we learn that when the social use of food aid is strictly merchant, it can contribute to the reduction of the social network, harming a potential social appropriation of the economy which would be better adapted to a situation of impoverishment. However, in cases where a merchant social use of food aid is accompanied or is gradually replaced with a use more akin to re-socialisation to the environment, resorting to food aid may promote the development of new social regularities and a renewed social appropriation of the economy. Social representations of the economy and the relation to dominant socioeconomic norms preceding the impoverishment situation become altered after facing a situation of impoverishment. A transformation of the relation to the economy occurs.	Food assistance , Economy , Social representations , Poverty , Food security , Food banks	en	20370.0
495	La conciliation études-travail chez les jeunes Québécois : travailler pour étudier, étudier pour travailler ou concilier pour étudier?	"This thesis aims to suggest different reflections on the propensity of Quebecois students to have a paid job while completing their university studies. Recent statistics show that Quebecois students are more likely to take on this dual role than students in the rest of Canada, and that they also tend to devote more hours to it. Why? To answer this question, the conciliation of studying and working will be considered beyond the number of hours that can be devoted to them and will focus on highlighting the constitutive dispositions of this phenomenon, thus making it possible to display the importance or the value of any of its activities. To do this, we must examine five elements that are likely to influence these dispositions: age, gender, social origin, the constraints of the curriculum and the responsibilities taken by students. In this survey, the notion of ""disposition"" as developed by Bourdieu will be solicited in order to translate practical knowledge (mainly resulting from semi- directive interviews) into theoretical knowledge. For Bourdieu, the notion of ""disposition"" corresponds to ""attitudes, inclinations to be perceived, felt and thought, internalized by individuals because of their objective conditions of existence and which then function as unconscious principles of action, perception and of reflection ""(Bourdieu, 1980, p.88-89). The analysis is mainly based on a series of comprehensive interviews conducted using the latest work by Elsa Ramos as reference. The students targeted for this project come from differentiated programs and hold a position that is not related to their field of study. The qualities of this sample provide a relatively diverse portrait of the student population. The dispositions that emerge from the interviews highlight the (expressive / instrumental) values that enable us to explain the phenomenon of school-work conciliation amongst young Quebecers through a sociological lens."

496	L’université québécoise en mutation : entre valorisation du savoir et recherche partenariale	This thesis focuses on the transformation of universities and, more specifically, the impact of their research partnerships with private companies on the role of universities in contemporary Quebec society. To achieve this, the evolution of university research is described: from its integration in the Humboldtian University as an institutional mission, to the valorization of its results in accordance with the discourse emerging from knowledge economy theories. The qualitative analysis is based on semi-directed interviews with professors-researchers experienced in partnership research projects and their designs. These interviews retrace these professors’ daily life as they work in those partnerships. Different topics such as academic freedom, the relationship with the industrial partners and the training of students were discussed. The data collected was analysed from an Habermasian’s perspective which is particularly adapted for studying science and technology development in higher education institutions.	transformation of universities , exploitation of research , university-company research partnerships , knowledge society , knowledge economy	en	20360.0
497	Les Valoristes : étude sociologique du cas de la récupération informelle des matériaux à Montréal	With this master’s thesis, I propose an analysis of the mutations of labour, by looking at the reality of the Valoristes, Montreal workers who collect refundable containers in the streets, alleys and parks of the city. I describe the workers and the activity itself, but I also look at the different dynamics of this type of informal activity, while analyzing the process who got the Valoristes to collects these containers in the first place. From the start, I define these individuals as workers who have an informal and atypical economic activity, but who are not substantially different from other kinsd of more traditional wage workers. This leads me to study their work not as a “mean to climb out of poverty”, but as the result of a multitude of exclusion dynamics and actors who create marginalized and precarized forms of labour. From this definition, it is possible to study the mutations of the labour market in new ways, different from the traditional work structure, while linking this reality with other forms of atypical or precarious work, which are growing to be a large part of today’s labour market. The study of the “Coopérative de solidarité Les Valoristes”, a cooperative that tries to organize these workers, then leads me to take a look at new forms of collective organization, that can improve the situation of marginalized workers while positioning itself outside the traditional codes of collective action.

498	Doubles stigmates : au croisement de la judiciarisation et de la folie	Empirical studies have reached somewhat inconsistent results regarding whether judicialization is beneficial or is a backdraw for individuals with mental health problems. Some argue it is a way to normalise the person, others claim it is an additional stigma adding a supplementary burden to their challenges. This Master’s thesis research is structured around ten interviews conducted with individuals who experience mental health issues and who have been involved with the legal system more than once. The interviews were conducted around five themes: identity and personal trajectory, mental health experiences, judicial experiences, articulation between the mental health and judicialization experiences and trajectories and their consequences on their identity and life courses. By experience, we mean to understand what it is like to live with a mental illness and moreover a criminal backround and the stigma around those two experiences. The goal of this research is to understand their perceptions of living with a mental illness and their experiences of judicialization. By judicialization we understand that a person is or has been accused of a crime at the municipal or criminal court more than once. The objective here on the one hand is to present the experiences of people living with a mental health problem within the legal system and on the other hand, to explore the issues connected to the penalization of mental health problems. We also interrogate participants’ understanding of the consequences on their identities of these two interlocking experiences. In particular, we explore through their perceptions their relations with the various socio-legal actors, medical via their personal trajectories. The concepts of stigmas and identity are at the center of our analysis and emphasize the importance of social context in the interiorization of a given identity. More precisely, our study shows that the way in which the person will interpret his experiences, legal and medical, will have consequences on his interactions with the various social actors and will affect his capacity to a part of the community he lives in, depending on how he integrates, or not, the various stigmas and labels given to him. This research centers its analysis on the actor and his perceptions. With this intention, symbolic interactionism was privileged in order to give an account of the trajectories of the actors and to identify the consequences of their identity.

499	The effect of background music on episodic memory	Most  university students  report studying while listening to background music because  it would help  them to improve their cognitive performances, including the memorization of new  information.  However,  results  from  the  literature  regarding  the  effect  of  background  music  on  episodic  memory  (i.e.  the  long-term  memory  for  spatiotemporal  events)  are  heterogeneous.  Indeed,  beneficial  effects,  and  sometimes  impairing  and  null  effects  are  observed.  The  heterogeneity  in  these  results  could  be  explained  by  methodological  and  individual  differences  across  studies.  Indeed,  the  emotional  characteristics  of  the  musical  selection  vary.  Namely,  the  musical  excerpts  vary  in  their  arousal  levels,  being  either  stimulating  or  relaxing.  Moreover,  individual  differences  such  as  intellectual  quotient  were  rarely considered in previous research. Thus, the  central  aim of this study is to explore  the effect of stimulating and relaxing background  music  on  episodic  memory  while  considering  the  variability  in  intellectual  quotient.  To  do  so,  three  groups  of  participants  matched  on  sex,  age,  schooling  years  and  musical  expertise  memorized  three  word  lists  in  the  presence  of  stimulating  or  relaxing  background music, or noise. Results indicate that the stimulating background music, compared  to  the  relaxing  background  music  and  noise,  marginally  facilitated  the  memorization  of  the  third  list,  only  when  the  intellectual  quotient  was  considered.  These  results  suggest  that  episodic memory  could benefit from  the presence of  stimulating background music, but  in the  context  of  a  prolonged  music  listening  and  when  considering  the  listeners’  intellectual  quotient.

500	Recherche d’un boson de Higgs doublement chargé par diffusion de bosons vectoriels à désintégration leptonique dans le modèle de Georgi-Machacek avec le détecteur ATLAS au LHC	We seek to establish limits on the exclusion of a doubly-charged scalar resonance in the Georgi-Machacek model based on data gathered by the ATLAS experiment located on the LHC ring, at CERN. Key models that extend the scalar sector of the standard model by addition of weak isospin scalar triplets are listed, and their relationship with the custodial symmetry is studied. The phenomenology of the VBS process generating the doubly-charged resonance of the Georgi-Machacek model is presented, particularly regarding the VBS jets and charge misidentification. Mass reconstruction techniques in the presence of neutrinos and signal isolation techniques via cuts are explored, as well as their optimisation process. Expected limits are produced, and true limits will be obtainable once the standard model study on same-sign W bosons has been completed. A machine learning tool aiming to identify charge misidentification cases is suggested as a future asset for the analysis.

501	Effets de l'intoxication au monoxyde de carbone et de l'exposition au bruit sur les systèmes auditifs périphérique et central	Some studies have shown that acute poisoning with carbon monoxide (CO) may cause a hearing loss in humans. However, those studies failed to document and take into account the history of noise exposure in their participants. Moreover, in many of those studies, evaluation methods were used that today are not considered valid. The interpretation of the most affected test frequencies and of the potential severity of hearing loss are thus limited. The first study is a synthesis of case studies from literature (n=11) aiming to document which test frequencies are the most susceptible to demonstrate a hearing loss, and how auditory thresholds recover over time. Despite the important variability in the information available regarding the participant’s noise exposure, past medical history and treatments provided for carbon monoxide poisoning, our synthesis showed evidence for high frequencies hearing loss after acute carbon monoxide poisoning, with potential for recovery over time. However, most subjects included in the synthesis were not treated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy, the gold standard treatment for CO poisoning. Moreover, aggravation of the hearing loss by age or noise exposure may have occurred. Auditory thresholds were the only means for assessment of hearing in these subjects. Effects of the CO poisoning on several other hearing functions remain unknown. The participants of the second study were treated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy following acute CO poisoning (n=12). Since CO poisoning is known to cause memory and concentration effects and animal data suggest an auditory central effect of CO poisoning, the test battery included peripheral tests, such as hearing thresholds up to 16 000 Hz, as well as auditory processing tests. As in the first study, some of the participants presented a hearing loss in the high frequencies, sometimes followed by recovery. The second study shows a notch configuration in participant’s audiogram despite the absence of a history of noise exposure. No evidence of auditory processing changes attributed to carbon monoxide poisoning was found. When abnormal results were found, noise exposure, age or hearing loss effects seem the most plausible cause, except possibly for a correlation between CO poisoning severity and dichotic digit test results in the left ear. Outer hair cells damage has been long considered as an early sign of noise exposure. However, recent animal studies have found an even greater sensibility to noise in inner hair cells synapses with auditory nerve fibers. This synaptopathy is believed to lead to delayed auditory nerve fiber deterioration in the central auditory system. In humans, the effects of these changes are not well documented because of the available measurement tools (non-invasive measurements). The third and final study focussed on chronic noise exposure effects on auditory processing in middle-aged participants (n=25). Poorer performances for the tests using speech stimuli were found compared to normative data for young adults found in the literature. When compared to a middle-aged group taken from the literature, poorer low frequency gap detection scores were also found. Rank correlations between auditory brainstem responses to clicks and auditory processing performances also suggest that neural synchrony impacts auditory processing capacities. Those correlations were independent (rho < 0.4) from age and hearing loss effects. These results suggest that noise-induced cochlear synaptopathy may lead, after many years, to auditory processing alterations. If this is true, it may be necessary to review the interpretation of some existing studies that participants with chronic exposure to noise had a strictly cochlear hearing damage.

502	Évaluation de l'innocuité et de l'efficacité d'un dérivé synthétique marqué de l'adrénomédulline dans l'imagerie moléculaire pulmonaire chez l'humain	Background. The pulmonary circulation is submitted to large physiologic hemodynamic variations and possesses numerous important metabolic functions mediated through its vast endothelial surface. Unfortunately, no test is currently available that can directly evaluate endothelial integrity and pulmonary perfusion gradients at the same time. We developed PulmoBind, a chelated derivative of human adrenomedullin labeled with 99m-Tc for nuclear medicine SPECT imaging. By specifically binding to its endothelial receptors, abundantly expressed in human alveolar capillaries, PulmoBind can provide a non-invasive evaluation of pulmonary function that can help in the diagnosis of disorders affecting the pulmonary circulation. This thesis represents my doctoral work to determine the safety of PulmoBind in humans and its capacity to generate good quality imaging for diagnosis purposes. Methods. Twenty healthy participants were included into escalating doses groups of 5 mCi (n=5), 10 mCi (n=5) or 15 mCi (n=10) 99mTc-PulmoBind. Vital signs were closely monitored and safety biochemistry and hematology parameters obtained. SPECT imaging was serially performed and 99mTc-PulmoBind dosimetric and spatial distribution analysis accomplished. Imaging quality of the lungs was assessed serially. Results. Radiochemical purity of 99mTc-PulmoBind was greater than 95%. There were no safety concerns at the 3 dosages studied. Imaging revealed a predominant and prolonged lung uptake with mean peak pulmonary extraction of 58% ± 7% (mean ± SD) of the injected dose. PulmoBind was well tolerated and resulted in no clinically significant adverse events. The highest dose of 15 mCi provided a favorable dosimetric profile and excellent quality tomographic imaging of the lungs. The postural lung perfusion gradient was detectable. Indeed, dorsal activity was 18.1 ± 2.1% greater than ventral activity, and caudal activity was 25.7 ± 1.6% greater than cranial activity. The intensity of PB activity followed a normal distribution while macro aggregated albumin (MAA) activity was importantly skewed and bimodal. Conclusion. 99mTc-PulmoBind up to a dose of 15 mCi is safe and provides good quality lung perfusion imaging that can reveal the heterogeneity of the pulmonary perfusion. Therefore, the safety and efficacy of this agent could be tested in disorders of the pulmonary circulation such as pulmonary arterial hypertension.

503	Enjeux éthiques des communications directes aux patients par les compagnies pharmaceutiques	It is widely accepted that patients should be provided with balanced and credible information so that they can make informed decisions about how best to manage their health. However, the sources are not always reliable and the search for balanced, impartial and comprehensible information can be particularly difficult. With a wealth of marketing experience and significant financial resources (far in excess of national regulators), the pharmaceutical industry is one of the major players in direct-to-consumer communications (DTCC). However, pharmaceutical marketing is often seen as a vehicle for transmitting biased information to increase drug consumption, to the extent that in recent years there have been many calls for more government regulation and for industry to better self-regulate its practices.  Although DTCC are generally presented in an accessible and comprehensible way, pharmaceutical company practices raise (and are influenced by) a significant tension between two conflicting imperatives: 1) social expectations for information and consumer empowerment; and 2) commercial expectations that marketing stimulate the sale of drugs and serve as a reference for evaluating the practice of pharmaceutical marketers. These two requirements simultaneously justify pharmaceutical practices, each with different stakeholders: the first for regulators and patient advocates, and the second for industry stakeholders and shareholders. Without these two imperatives, the promotion of medicines would simply not happen: the industry would not invest time, money and energy if there were no financial gains, and practices would not have social and regulatory legitimacy if they did not possess informational qualities.  The social value given to the DTCC, and the regulatory response, varies greatly between jurisdictions. Only two countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the United States and New Zealand, have a permissive approach and are more inclined to recognize the informational quality in DTCC. Most other OECD countries (including Canada) have a rather prohibitive approach and only allow for disease awareness, help seeking and other communications not directly related to the sale of a drug. Although they must coexist, the two imperatives are nevertheless often difficult to reconcile given the very high marketing targets, arising from the expectations of the financial markets, that pharmaceutical marketers must attain. It is therefore not surprising that marketing activities present one of the most controversial and challenging ethical issues in the contemporary business world.  This, of course, raises many questions regarding the proper management and resolution of ethical issues related to marketing. In the context of this thesis, these considerations are analyzed through the study of four paradigmatic cases as a means of explaining the ethical and regulatory issues raised by DTCC. Each case is targeted at a particular communication device and aims to provide a more accurate picture of the impact of DTCC, its social considerations and regulatory and ethical implications. The objective of each case study, and more generally that of the thesis, is to make recommendations concerning the responsibility of the main actors in order to better oversee marketing practices and to layout an ethics for DTCC.  Ultimately, the analysis of the cases highlights the ethical dimensions that are the most conducive to systemic change in the practice of pharmaceutical marketing. The cases are therefore focused on the practices of industry employees, for whom benchmarks are proposed, in the form of an ethical engagement and a preliminary ethical framework. The idea is to directly target the actors who, on a daily basis, play a major role in the deployment of DTCC, but who have never received training in ethics to enable them to understand the implications of their practice.

Several types of MAPs expressed at the surface of cancer cells can be targeted for ATC: 1) minor histocompatibility antigens (MiHAs), that derive from germline polymorphisms between a donor and a recipient during an ATC, 2) tumor associated antigens (TAAs) that include antigens that derive from overexpressed transcripts in cancer cells compared to their normal counterpart and 3) tumor specific antigens (TSAs) that derive from somatic mutations or from aberrantly expressed transcripts in cancer cells. Hundreds of clinical trials have highlighted the therapeutic potential of each of these classes of antigens. Nonetheless, ATCs targeting these antigens have been studied in dramatically different contexts: donor-derived T cells targeting MiHAs are used for treating hematologic malignancies while patient-derived T cells targeting TAAs or TSAs are used for the treatment of solid tumors. As such, the therapeutic potential of these MAPs has never been assessed in a single tumor model. Thus, the goal of this thesis was to evaluate and compare the therapeutic potential of MiHAs, TAAs and TSAs expressed on the EL4 cell line to better understand the mechanisms dictating their immunogenicity. We first selected MiHAs and TAAs previously reported in the literature, then developed a proteogenomic approach that enabled us to identify all types of TSAs presented by EL4 cells. By doing so, we found that : 1) Only MAPs that are seen as non-self by T cells (MiHAs and TSAs) can induce strong antitumor responses, 2) Both the abundance and functional avidity of MiHA- or TSA-specific T cells dictated the immunogenicity of these antigens, and 3) The clonality of the antigen and the nature of their genetic alterations also represented an important parameter dictating TSAs’ immunogenicity. In conclusion, we developed a proteogenomic platform that will enable the identification of all types of cancer antigens and identified metrics that will guide the priorization of MiHAs and TSAs in a clinical setting.

505	L’Éthique non-géométrique de Spinoza	The Ethics by Spinoza, demonstrated in geometrical order (more geometrico demonstrata), faces the issue of introducing the non-geometrician reader to the objective content of its knowledge. Although his philosophy is in its majority exposed within a mathematical structure, this paper aims to study the intrinsically non demonstrative elements that reside therein and therefore determine the propaedeutics dimension of the Ethics, i.e. its capacity to bring an individual enslaved by passions into an ethical becoming. From a methodological point of view, and after exposing the euclidian origins of spinozism, we will defend the idea that scolies, resonating with an affective order of knowledge, fulfil a pedagogical function relying mostly on the virtues of imagination. Consequently, it will then be argued that imagination is a means of knowledge that is inherently positive. It is capable of producing joyful affects, an observation from which Spinoza conceived the possibility of accessing, through common notions, knowledge of the second kind and a life guided by reason. Thus we will show how the ruling principles of spinozistic anthropology explain the epistemological problem of the passage between these different kinds of knowledge. Finally, we shall see that it is through a pragmatic use of language - that is to say a language that encompasses in its expression the recipients’ multiple levels of comprehension - that the philosopher allows the Ethics to become a place of passionate confluence whose specificity is to introduce the non philosopher to the emancipating virtues of true knowledge.

506	À la recherche de Proserpine : la loggia du palais épiscopal de Bagnaia au temps du cardinal Niccolò Ridolfi (1541-1550)	Located on the border between Tuscany and northern Lazio, Bagnaia has been an ideal holiday resort for the most eminent members of the Roman Curia throughout the whole 16th century. For this reason, this small village of Tuscia became from the 1540s an important political and artistic center. Several studies have focused on the Villa Lante and its famous gardens, whereas the Episcopal Palace – better known as the “Loggia Palace” – has been ignored by scholars for a long time. This dissertation proposes, for the first time, a thorough study of the exceptional decoration of this spacious loggia, built between 1541 and 1548 for the Florentine cardinal Niccolò Ridolfi, Lorenzo de' Medici's grandson. The analysis of style allows first to review an incorrect attribution, as well as to formulate new hypotheses about the authors of the painting cycle, of which all scenes have been identified and deciphered. The mythological cycle is dedicated to the story of Ceres, goddess of agriculture. The decorative system is admirable for originality and erudition, and interacts with the two fountains situated in the loggia, representing the rivers Arno and Tiber. Finally, this dissertation gives a detailed reading of the pagan iconography in the cultural and religious context of Cardinal Ridolfi's court.

507	La « cinématisation » des séries télévisées contemporaines : le cas inédit du parcours de la série française Kaamelott (Alexandre Astier, M6, 2005-2009)	Contemporary television is undergoing profound changes within a media landscape in which the boundaries between television and cinema are gradually disappearing. This research offers a study of these changes through the concept of “cinematization”. It will be first of all a question of analyzing the discourses on this complex notion. More than a merging of small and big screen, cinematization refers to a process whose effects remain visible in the creation, criticism, analysis and act of spectatorship of the television series. It will further be necessary to study the authorial and spectatorial figure of television. Finally, the unique process of the French series Kaamelott (Alexandre Astier, M6, 2005-2009) will serve as an example for illustrating the transformations that this audiovisual form undergoes at the level of narrative structure, aesthetics and viewing habits.

508	La construction des représentations genrées et racialisées de Catherine de Médicis par les Monarchomaques et les Malcontents (1573-1576)	This study of gendered and racialized representations of Catherine de Medicis examines how misogygny, anti-italianism and hatred of the parvenu in XVIth century France served to shape this queen’s black legend. Such discourses, as contained in Monarchomaques and Malcontents’ lampoons published in 1573-1576, strongly convey misogynous, xenophobics and “anti-parvenus” critiques of the queen mother’s government, a time when her representations shifted to profound contempt, and formulate a very real theory of monarchial power. These libels, participating in the debates about the nature of French monarchy during the age of religious wars, as well as this analysis of Caterine de Medicis’ representations through the lens of intersectionality, provide us with more information about the dynamics of monarchy’s profound transformations into modern times, as well as unveils the gendered and racialized representation of nobility and of the monarchial ideals as promoted by these libelists.

509	Les variétés de l'expérience ascétique : étude de la psychologie des pratiques de renoncement dans les textes du monachisme chrétien ancien et du bouddhisme Theravada	This thesis explores how psychology can bring a deeper understanding of different motivations likely to influence the way asceticism is experienced. An exploration of important texts of the ascetic tradition from two religions will allow us to understand how the phenomenon takes form in a theistic religion like Christianity and in a non-theistic tradition like Theravada Buddhism. Those texts will be analyzed from four angles. First, we will describe potential pathological motivations based on the DSM-5 diagnostic criterion to then contrast this reading with a healthier one based on positive psychology and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). We will then get out of this dichotomous vision to explore the impact of other dimensions which could influence the underlying motivations to asceticism. With regard to a theistic religion like Christianity, we will use attachment theory to analyze how the relationship with a significant figure or with a divine figure can have an impact on renunciation practices. To understand other factors that could be at stake in the case of a non-theistic religion, we will explore asceticism in Theravada Buddhism to see how this practice can lead to the development of a specific status in the renunciant’s membership group and to some advantages from an evolutionary standpoint. This analysis will give us a more nuanced understanding of the motivations in play in the case of religious behavior like asceticism.

510	L’Escalier dans les arts : un dispositif de (dé)montage	Giving rhythm to our daily routine, the staircase that we climb and descend, like a musical scale, can be opened up like a fan of possibilities, especially in art. An architectural feature meant to permit passage from one level to another, it channels bodies and the flow of information, giving way to a change of state. Seeing how the writer Georges Perec uses the staircase to gather the collective life of a building, in this case the dwelling in La Vie mode d’emploi, we understand that the stairs are a gateway to people’s stories, an access to perspectives from which narratives are born. Taken for granted most of the time, the staircase can be a powerful and dramatic tool, a structure suspended between two planes, designed to create suspense. Its delayed temporality animates the shadow plays of anticipation as well as memory, akin to vertigo in space, the stairs being the source from which all rays of imagination project.  In brief, we’ll study how the literary and visual poetics of Georges Perec, Julio Cortazar and Marcel Duchamp takes a common place and reinvests it as a means to articulate new forms of motion, of the collective and its representation.	design , suspense , art et architecture , Marcel Duchamp , Julio Cortazar , Georges Perec , stair(s) , art and architecture , intermediality , user manual , literary analysis	en	20127.0
511	Droit de cité: représentations de Paris et expériences de l'altérité dans Le syndrome d'Ulysse de Santiago Gamboa et Black Bazar d'Alain Mabanckou	"This memoir aims to show how Santiago Gamboa’s Le syndrome d’Ulysse (2005) and Alain Mabanckou’s Black Bazar (2009) contribute, each in their own way, to the development of a ""new narrative identity"" of Paris (Régine Robin) through the description of the socio-cultural alterity experienced by the depicted characters. Both novels present ""foreigners"" who live in Paris and have a different perception of the cultural codes, conceptions of history and social practices prevailing in their new home town. If their situation leads them to take a critical look at these codes and practices, it also often confines them to the margins of society and underlines the communities' worrying tendency to isolate themselves from one another. Situated in the field of sociocriticism, this study explores the various rhetorical, narratological and semiotic processes by which these texts criticize or reject different discourses proposing problematic conceptions of social life that oppose, ignore or compete with each other."

512	De l'économie de la mélancolie du scholar : figures du pharmakon chez Robert Burton	"An unrivaled summation of erudition, intelligence and humor in which all knowledge is stored and linked, Robert Burton's Anatomy of Melancholy (1621, 1624, 1628, 1632, 1638, 1651) is still today an object of research of great value for the history of medicine as well as for social and cultural history and the history of ideas. Composed in this particular period of in-between ages, The Anatomy constitutes a unique point of articulation between the still current authority of the hippocrato-galenic medical discourse, tributary of an indissociable union between a natural and a moral philosophy, and the advent of the remarkably modern spirit of labour/work and economics which the ""Protestant ethic"" opens up and which rather takes part in a gradual separation of the fields of science and morals. If Robert Burton, through the publication of his book, certainly intends to perpetuate the Greek tradition of melancholia as it was instituted, among others, by the Letters of the pseudo-Hippocrates, an aspiration which he reveals from the outset by the choice of his pseudonym: ""Democritus Junior"", we shall see that he is, however, not its most faithful disciple. The present paper will indeed examine how Burton lays the foundation of an ethic that no longer relies on the serenity of the wise man (as incarnated by Democritus of Abdera), who succeeded to eradicate, by the sole means of his reason and his will, his melancholy, but rather on the resignation of the gentleman devoted to the professional, civic and domestic task, capable of enduring indefinitely, and even profiting from, his ambivalent melancholy. A vocational posture characteristic of a distinctly modern ethic and which is ideally exemplified, in Burton’s book, by the more ""positively"" melancholic figure of the scholar. Particular attention will be paid, in the first part of this paper, to Burton's relationship with his book and his reader in order to identify the therapeutic/pathological potential of The Anatomy itself as a book. Then, we will look at the more implicit or peripheral healing strategies that are deployed in the text and which are attached to the more properly vocational dimension of the scholar's intellectual work and life."

From the ideas of Aristotle and Henri Bergson, we think about the role of image as a mediator between the mind and the experience, and how it can create a reality in the mind. Bergson is also responsible for offering some categories of time, which help us to go deeper into the analysis of time figures in ""Pedro Páramo"", by Juan Rulfo, and ""Relato de um certo Oriente"", by Miton Hatoum. These two novels represent time plasticity in literature. This research also finds in Saint-Augustin and Jorge Luis Borges some crucial elements to think about the power of time figures in both novels."	comparative literature , figures of time , image , Milton Hatoum , Juan Rulfo , Jorge Luis Borges , Henri Bergson , latin american literature	en	20106.0
514	Évolution de la qualité des années vécues entre 45 et 70 ans : espérance de vie partielle sans incapacité au Canada, de 1994 à 2014	In response to the upward trend in life expectancy and financial pressures on the public pension system, some suggest to raise the normal retirement age. However, before recommending such an increase, it is important to consider the state of health of older adults. This paper proposes to examine recent trends in the health status of Canadians aged 45 and over. Using the Sullivan method, trends in partial disability-free life expectancy (PDFLE) between the ages of 45 and 70 years are computed from 1994 to 2014. Considering that caregiving responsibilities to a parent or spouse with a loss of autonomy may have an impact on the labor market participation of older adults, trends in disability-free life expectancy (DFLE) at 70 and 85 years and over are also documented. Disability among adults aged 45-69 is estimated from the attributes of the Health Utility Index (HUI) correlated to work ability. For seniors, it is defined according to the attributes of the HUI associated with the need for assistance. In both cases, disability is graded in severity levels to allow a finer analysis of morbidity. Data used to estimate the prevalence of disability was from the National Population Health Survey (NPHS) and the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS). Trends examined in this study reveal an increase in the prevalence of disability among older adults. Accordingly, a decreasing PDFLE45-69 has been found since the mid-1990s. While it would be hasty to claim that there has been an expansion of morbidity among older adults, the findings do not confirm the compression scenario. Hence, this study brings no evidence in support of the postponement of the normal retirement age if this decision was based solely on gains in life expectancy.

515	L’environnement sous haute surveillance? : éclairage sur plus de quarante-cinq ans d’action publique au Canada	During his years in power, the Harper government was heavily criticized for its lack of commitment towards the environment. These criticisms are the starting point for this research project. This study attempts to contextualize the “Haper decade” by tracing the history of Canadian government action in the field of environment, starting with the creation of Environment Canada in 1971. Two objectives guide this research. On the one hand, to better understand how the environment and its protection were thought and gradually transformed as a public policy issue under successive federal governments. On the other hand, to understand how the evolution of political discourse in the recent history of Canada translated into sanctions. In order to do so, this study essentially relies on the analysis of a wide body of official publications associated with Environment Canada, which were published over the studied period (1971-2015). Following a broad outline of the key developments, the adoption of public policies is then linked to concrete measures taken to deal with offenses related to the application of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act (CEPA). Crossing the analysis of official environmental discourses with the implementation of sanctions under more than forty years of activities sheds light on the transformations, the points of tension and the paradoxes at the heart of public action in this field in Canada. Research thus illustrates that the Harper government’s “law and order” ideology has initiated a historic rise in the number of public interventions in environmental crime control, albeit a trend that appears to have affected corporations and smaller delinquent actors.

516	Impact of Maltreatment on Depressive Symptoms in Emerging Male Adults : the Mediating and Moderating Role of Coping Strategies and Cortisol Stress Response	An extensive body of work suggest that maltreated individuals are more likely to manifest depression at an early age and are more prone to experience recurrent depressive episodes that persist over long periods of time. However, the mechanism implicated in this association remain elusive. The present study examined the contribution of cortisol response to stress and coping strategies to the association linking childhood maltreatment to depressive symptoms. Data from 156 young men aged 18 to 35, of whom 56 were maltreated, were collected through self-reported questionnaires assessing maltreatment, depressive symptoms, and coping strategies. Cortisol was measured in response to the “Trier Social Stress Test” (TSST). Findings showed that maltreated individuals adopted emotion-oriented coping strategies more frequently and these, in turn, are more strongly associated with depressive symptoms. Conversely, maltreated individuals who were less prone to adopt task-oriented coping strategies reported higher levels of depressive symptoms. In addition, the more participants showed a higher cortisol response to stress, the greater was the association between maltreatment and depressive symptoms. In contrast, while cortisol response to stress is associated with depressive symptoms, it does not explain the association noted between maltreatment and depressive symptoms. These findings invite practitioners to consider coping strategies as a potential target for preventing or reducing depressive symptoms among young adults with a history of childhood maltreatment.

517	L’appropriation des connaissances visuo-orthographiques par des élèves de la première à la quatrième année du primaire	Reading and writing are fundamental skills for school learning. Learning to spell represents a major challenge for many pupils, whether they have a learning disability or not. Yet, the growth of spelling skills is closely associated with reading and writing development. The French spelling system, due to its structure and its opacity, requires that learners amass knowledge about the phonological properties of words, and also their morphological and visual properties, to succeed in reading and spelling all words. Research has shown that the visual properties of words, which can be classified according to forms of visual-orthographic phenomena, represent orthographic properties which are particularly difficult to master in the primary grades. Furthermore, working memory and processing speed are required for processing the orthographic components of words. Empirical data have shown that memory and rapid naming abilities are linked to reading and spelling performance. The general goal of this study was to investigate the extent to which visual-orthographic processing, phonological and visual memory, and rapid naming performance play a role in the reading and spelling performance of 119 pupils enrolled in the first to the fourth grade of primary school. The specific objectives were to describe their overall performance, examine the relationships among the variables being studied, and identify which one(s) best explain(s) reading and spelling performance.  A word recognition task, a reading comprehension task, and a spelling production task were administered to assess reading and spelling skills. A matching test in which nonword sequences were presented orally and a matching test with visual sequences as stimuli were used as phonological and visual memory measures. A rapid object-naming task (R.A.N.) and a rapid color-naming task were used as measure of processing speed. To observe their visual-orthographic processing skills, the participants were given a word-pseudohomophone choice task and retrieval tests (oral and written).  Results indicated that visual-orthographic processing skills increased with grade level. Correlational analyses revealed that grade was related to each variable, that reading and spelling skills were linked to each other, and that visual-orthographic processing skills appeared to be the variables most strongly correlated to reading and spelling skills. Regression analyses indicated that grade level best explained performance in spelling production, word recognition, and reading comprehension and that the word-pseudohomophone choice task represented the only variable making an additional and significant contribution to reading and spelling performance. These results suggest that the visual properties of words should be taught in class so as to support the development of learners’ reading and spelling skills. It should be the subject of future research intending to explain how these properties are acquired and develop.

518	Approche théorique et expérimentale combinée dans l’exploration de LiFeV2O7 et son application comme matériau d’électrode positive pour batterie aux ions lithium	Lithium ion batteries are developed to power a growing amount of portable applications and meet the needs of an increasingly mobile society. These batteries owe their success to the performances of electrode materials and electrolytes which were continuously optimized these last decades. The process leading to their industrial and commercial application was always initiated by the discovery of new materials. The research of new materials can be seen as an uncertain approach, when compared to the engineering and optimization of existing ones, but remains the driving force behind innovation. In this context, we revisited the Li2O-V2O5-Fe2O3 ternary phase diagram on the lookout for new positive electrode materials. The systematic study of the diagram led to the synthesis by solid state reaction of a new material with the composition LiFeV2O7. The following manuscript will be covering the study of this material. After a detailed characterization of LiFeV2O7, an electrochemical study was carried out to evaluate the material’s potential as a positive electrode material. The results displayed a rather complex electrochemical behavior. ex situ XRD and Mössbauer analyses were carried out on LiFeV2O7 upon cycling to try to comprehend this behavior. The experimental section was complemented with a theoretical study on LiFeV2O7 behavior in electrochemistry. It includes the modelling of LiFeV2O7 electrochemical curve and the evolution of its magnetizations upon discharge.	vanadate , LiFeV2O7 , ex situ , Mössbauer , VASP , Electrochemistry , Lithium-ion battery , XRD , Computational chemistry	en	20036.0
519	Roche, papier, relique :  une approche biographique et comparative de la consécration des images de Bouddha en Birmanie	This thesis is about the consecration of Buddha images in Myanmar, i.e. what makes the difference between a « simple image » and an image considered efficient for worship. Through a « biography of things », this research follows the journey of a stone carved Buddha image from the quarry to the shrine. Moreover, a comparative perspective is added to include printed images (stickers, posters, etc.) in order to isolate some relevant variables at stake in the consecration process. The goal is to show that if the ritual consecration is important, it is of tantamount importance to contextualize it in a larger chain of semiotic events. By following the production, the circulation, the trade and the practices involved around these images, some discursive, aesthetic and praxical features have been isolated as participating to the consecration. Hence a processual conception of the consecration is proposed, to complement the more commonly admitted one stating the ritual as sole performative act able to change the status of a Buddha image. The semiotic dispositive that emerged from this analysis is mostly indexical, meaning the character of contiguity, of contact, that a sign (the image) shares with its object (Buddha). It appears then that what gives an image its legitimacy, inside and outside the ritual, is its capacity the beholder has to infer a « vector of proximity » between it and the historical Buddha. This explanation allows us to link the consecration ritual to larger semiotic ideologies about likeness, materiality and performativity.

520	Mécanismes de pluralisme juridique et utilisation paradoxale du droit : le postmodernisme de l'État français en Nouvelle-Calédonie	The French state has not avoided the various sociopolitical disruptions experienced by the international affairs of the 21st century. In its overseas territories, and particularly on the sui generis New-Caledonian territory, where multiculturalism is endemic and autonomist aspirations have been flourishing since the 1970s, French-republican values struggle to set up. The difficulties that result from the inadequacy of modern European principles engender some issues regarding the effectiveness and the legitimacy of the law. The monism and positivism that characterize the law in France do not really make sense on this “other side of the world” territory. The existence of legal pluralism – the coexistence of State law with the Caledonian law and the civil customary law – gives way to the establishment of mechanisms partially supporting this legal pluralism. Moreover, the context of decolonization in which the territory is gives place to the development of indigenous autonomist claims which manage to take over the law and to a certain extent use it against the State. Developed legal pluralism mechanisms as well as the singular use of the law that takes place in New-Caledonia demonstrate a postmodern evolution of the French state structure.

521	Social support and symptom severity among patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder or panic disorder with agoraphobia: A systematic review	Panic disorder with or without agoraphobia (PD/A) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) are characterized by major behavioral dysruptions that may affect patients’ social and marital functioning. The disorders’ impact on interpersonal relationships may also affect the quality of support patients receive from their social network. The main goal of this systematic review is to determine the association between social or marital support and symptom severity among adults with PD/A or OCD. A systematic search of databases was executed and provided 35 eligible articles. Results from OCD studies indicated a negative association between marital adjustment and symptom severity, and a positive association between accommodation from relatives and symptom severity. However, results were inconclusive for negative forms of social support (e.g. criticism, hostility). Results from PD/A studies indicated a negative association between perceived social support and symptom severity. Also, results from studies using an observational measure of marital adjustment indicated a negative association between quality of support from the spouse and PD/A severity. However, results were inconclusive for perceived marital adjustment and symptom severity. In conclusion, this systematic review generally suggests a major role of social and marital support in PD/A and OCD symptomatology. However, given diversity of results and methods used in studies, more are needed to clarify the links between support and symptom severity among patients with PD/A and OCD.

522	Utilisation des anti-infectieux chez la femme enceinte et issues indésirables de grossesse (avortement spontané, malformations congénitales et faible poids à la naissance)	Infections during pregnancy are frequent. For example, the prevalence of urinary tract infections is between 2% and 10%. A pregnant woman with asymptomatic bacteriuria is 20-30 times more likely to develop pyelonephritis, 50% more likely to have a baby with a low birth weight, and twice as likely to have a premature baby. It is therefore essential to treat pregnant maternal infections. Though antibiotics are among the most used drugs during pregnancy (20%-49%), evidence regarding its fetal safety remains limited. As such, the choice of antibiotics that should be prescribed during the first trimester of pregnancy could be a difficult task. Therefore, our aim was to assess the risk of spontaneous abortion and major congenital malformations associated with antibiotics use during pregnancy. Furthermore, it is estimated that 8-14% of low birth weight occurring in endemics regions is due to malaria. Hence, the growing role of some antibiotics such as azithromycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in the prevention of malaria during pregnancy emerged as a potential avenue of exploration. Within the QPC, a nested case control study was conducted to evaluate the link between gestational exposure to antibiotics and the risk of spontaneous abortion. To assess the association with major congenital malformations, a cohort study was used. A meta-analysis was carried out to synthesize data on the efficacy of antimalarial drugs to reduce the risk of low birth weight Our results indicate that amoxicillin, cephalosporins and nitrofurantoin use during pregnancy were not associated with an increased risk of spontaneous abortion or major congenital malformations. In contrast, we observed a 65% and 70% increased risk of spontaneous abortion following clarithromycin and metronidazole use respectively. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, quinolones and tetracyclines exposure was also linked to more than two fold increased risk of spontaneous abortion. Doxycycline use was associated with more than a twofold increased risk of circulatory system malformation and more than a threefold increased risk of ventricular/atrial septal defect. Clindamycin exposure was associated with a 67% increased risk of musculoskeletal system malformations and 81% increased risk of ventricular/atrial septal defect This thesis also demonstrates that antimalarial were associated with a 27% reduction of the risk of low birth weight. However, this finding could be overestimate. Three doses compared to two doses of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine was associated with a 25% reduction of the risk of low birth weight in regions where the prevalence of molecular markers of this drug did not exceed 50%.   In conclusion, health professionals should give priority to safer antibiotics such as cephalosporins, amoxicillin and nitrofurantoin for the treatment of maternal infections occurring in early pregnancy (first trimester) when possible. The use of three doses compared to two doses of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine should be recommended by health professionals for malaria prevention during pregnancy in areas where the prevalence of molecular markers for this drug does not exceed 50%.

523	"À la recherche d’une diversité dans l’unité : l
e passé, le présent et l’avenir de la Chine multiethnique"	This thesis divided into three chapters deals with the national question in China. The first chapter traces the conceptual evolution of the notion of nation, a concept imported into China from the West through Japan, to reveal how Chinese society adapts to this new idea. It demonstrates that the concept of minzu, because of its semantic ambiguity by an ab initio indecisive interpretation, allows political powers to manipulate it for political purposes and meanwhile, il enables ethnic minorities to challenge the legitimacy of power. The indeterminacy makes the concept of minzu a double-edged sword: on one hand the Chinese government is committed to building a nation-state and on the other hand it recognizes and maintains an ancient multinational legacy.  The second chapter first presents the current policies on ethnic minorities in China through a descriptive approach and a critical evaluation. It demonstrates that the system of ethnic regional autonomy, based on political recognition of ethnic minorities characterized by antisecessionism, paternalism and developmentalism, runs counter to what the Chinese Communist Party wanted, namely inter-ethnic cohesion within the Chinese nation. The second section of this chapter examines the contemporary intellectual debate on the national question. Several thinkers wonder about cultural pluralism that would strengthen the ethnic identity of minorities who want to separate if common citizenship is not required. The debate takes place in an authoritarian environment, which leads eventually to an opposition between sectarianism and statism. The last part of the chapter is devoted to a thorough examination of Confucianism. After analyzing the revival of Confucianism as a manifestation of majority ethnic nationalism, it examines the ideas inherent in Chinese philosophy to reveal its political and cultural repercussions on today's identity politics.  The third chapter seeks to explore a solution for managing diversity in the unity. It begins by dissecting the nationalist strategy that the party-state promotes under the guise of patriotism to underpin its legitimacy. The state nationalism, although distanced by majority nationalism, must rely on the dominant group’s culture to represent sinity, which is disputed by both the majority and minorities. Then we move to review different expressions of identity crisis of contemporary Chinese and we demonstrate that a common citizenship is not able to unite the Chinese in an undemocratic China. We then examine the relationship between democratization and the national question. By bringing Habermas’ constitutional patriotism and neo-tianxiaism, an idea drawn from local experiences, we propose in the end that only a Chinese identity built on a new civilization that shall take all the civilizations and cultures present in China into account, shall be shared by all Chinese.  To conclude, China remains a test bed to test the idea of a multinational state and its variants.	minzu , Chine , national minority, minzu, ethnicity, multinatinonal state, citizenship, China , National minority , Ethnicity , Multinational state , Citizenship , China	en	19982.0
524	Le droit de participation des salariés canadiens lors des restructurations d'entreprises : le cadre législatif britannique comme source d'inspiration pour le Canada. Une étude de droit comparé : Québec, cadre juridique fédéral canadien, Union européenne, Royaume-Uni	In the current economic context marked by the growing number of restructuring and the unemployment rate, it seems important to address the employee’s issue of job security and the need to reduce the negative impacts that some restructuring processes have on businesses and employees. One of the solutions in this regard is to ensure that employees are heard during the restructuring process. Since the Canadian legal framework on the subject offers insufficient protections, the goal of this thesis is to find solutions in order to strengthen the existing framework and to find possibilities of adopting other legal information and consultation procedures applicable to company restructuring in general. To this end, the author is interested in whether a process of information and consultation of workers in restructuring matters involving collective redundancies, similar to what exists in the European Union is possible at the federal level in Canada and the province of Quebec in light of the British experience. The United Kingdom’s case is particularly interesting on the subject since this country originally applied a collective laissez-faire approach to company restructuring similar to the North American one. It is only because of mandatory directives of the European Union on the subject that the United Kingdom has set up information and consultation procedures. In terms of methodology, we used the comparative law approach to perform this study. In addition, as a theoretical framework we have applied the «capability for a voice», developed by Amartya Sen, which provides a method of assessing the impact and relevance of laws that recognize extended participation rights to employees in regards to company economic decisions. In doing so, the thesis assesses the extent that the European directives, the British legislation and the federal Canadian and Quebec legislation, related to the subject matter under study, meet the four criterias of the «capability for a voice», which are prerequisites to pass from the involvement stage of the employees in company decisions to their real influence on such issues. This study demonstrates that the protections offered by the European directives on the subject are relatively small and that these guidelines have resulted in national legislation that also offer inadequate protection in the UK. In addition, this study shows how the implementation of the information and consultation procedures of employees worked in the UK. By observing the experience in this country, we have reached a better understanding of the complications and potential risks of the legislative imposition of information and consultation procedures in the context of restructuring involving collective redundancies. In addition, we have learned some important lessons in order to strengthen the existing Canadian framework of employee participation rights and consider a new, comprehensive framework that will apply to all types of restructuring and not only to collective redundancies and technological changes. Given that Canada is more interventionist, in regard to the determination of labor standards, than the United Kingdom, it seems that it is possible to have a better legal framework of employees participation in Canada taking into consideration the suggestions that we have made in strengthening the «capability for voice» and the lessons learned by the implementation of the British legislation on the matter. This thesis is the first in-depth study on the right of employees to participate in restructuring, which compares and applies the analytical framework of the «capability for voice» to all European Directives related to the subject, as well as to the applicable British, Quebec and Canadian laws relevant to the subject matter.

525	Residential choice and sustainability : comparing people and place performances in sprawled city	This thesis examines the sustainability performance of households’ behaviors and compares it to their place of living. This thesis deals with an innovative and important subject. The results shed light on the complexity of the links between residential behaviors and the living environment regarding sustainability behaviors. With the aim of identifying variables to evaluate behavioral sustainability, it investigates the scientific evidence. The results show that the indicators frequently used to assess the sustainability of the places depict the built environment regarding its form, functions and density, and its socio-economic features. To evaluate the behavioral sustainability, multiple indicators are used of different natures, that is, environmental, social, economic, and transport modes related to daily mobility, as well as traveled space and time. The links found between sustainability performance of places and behaviors are described as matching or lacking congruity. An inventory framework is proposed to help to study the performance of residential choice concerning the three pillars of sustainability. Applying this framework, a group of 740 households with at least one respondent working full-time is analyzed. The database is « Demain Québec » an Internet survey of residents of the Quebec City metro area detailing their socio-economic profiles, residences and mobility characteristics. To assess the behavioral sustainability, a principal component analysis is performed on 20 variables. Six factors are extracted accounting for 74.9% of the variance. They are as follows: 1) Car dependency, global travel distance, and economic costs, 2) Global activity intensity, 3) Recreational activity intensity and travel distance, 4) Shopping activity intensity and travel distance, 5) Travel distance in public transport and global travel time costs, and 6) Housing expenditures and global active transport distance. These factors are put on to a two-step clustering analysis leading to identification of seven behavioral profiles: « Immobile Shoppers », « Immobile Recreationist using Public Transport », « Savers-on-Time and Spenders-on-Housing », « Mobile Individuals using Public Transport », « Mobile Individuals using Active Transport », « Hypermobile Shoppers using Car », and « Recreationist using Car ».   To assess the sustainability performance of places and to compare it to the profiles of behaviors, we use the neighborhood Walk Score. The results confirm the correspondence between place and people’s performance for some profiles, while for the others, the influence of location seems to be interfered by socio-economic characteristics of households. In some groups, neither these indicators do not account for the fitness or discrepancy between the both. It is rather the households’ prevailing activities in relationship with the location in which they go on that plays a crucial role in sustainable prosperity. In the final step, the thesis examines the desirability of sustainable residential choices, understood as satisfaction-with and aspiration for, based on the behavioral typologies developed in the previous step. The results show residential choices that at once sustainable and desirable are possible. However, households who make such choices are less satisfied with the greenery, quietness, and ambiance, security, and characteristics of neighbors. Also, sources of dissatisfaction does not necessarily drive the moving intentions. The main reasons for moving are often connected to the desire to become a homeowner or having access to a larger residence. On their residential choice decisions, households regard mostly the environmental features which are in accordance with their needs and goals at a particular stage in their life’s course, as well as their dominant activity. Although the built environment plays a major role in the achievement of desirable sustainable choices, the households are the protagonist in enhancing sustainable prosperity.

526	"Expected or completed? Comparing two measures of education and their relationship with social
inequalities in health among young adults"	Background. Similarly to other age groups, there are significant social inequalities in health among young adults (YA). Education is thought to be the most appropriate indicator of YA socioeconomic status (SES), yet it is often in progress at that age and may not be representative of future achievement. Therefore, scholars have explored YA ‘expected’ education as a proxy of SES. However, no study has examined how it compares to the more common SES indicator, ‘completed’ education. Methods. Using data from 1,457 YA surveyed twice over a two year period, we describe associations between participants’ completed and expected education at baseline and completed education at followup. We then compare associations between these two measures and three health outcomes – smoking status, self-rated mental health, and participation in physical activity and sports – at baseline and follow-up using regression models. Results. At baseline, half of the participants were imputed a higher ‘expected’ level than that ‘completed’ at that time. In regression models, ‘expected’ and ‘completed’ education were strongly associated with all outcomes and performed slightly differently in terms of effect size, statistical significance, and model fit. Conclusions. ‘Expected’ education offers a good approximation of future achievement. More importantly, ‘expected’ and ‘completed’ education variables can be conceptualized as complementary indicators associated with inequalities in health in YA. Using both may help better understand social inequalities in health in YA.	Young adults , Education , Social inequalities , Measurement	en	19939.0
527	Génération automatisée de rapports de signes vitaux	This report focuses on the development of a system for the automated production of a document that includes vital signs measured during rubidium-82 myocardial perfusion examinations at the Montreal Heart Institute nuclear medicine department. This project addresses the needs of information access for clinicians and productivity support for technologists. The recorded data may also be used for research purposes. The requirements of the system were the automatic collection of physiological data produced by the Dräger monitoring system and its storage in a database. Moreover, the system had to manage the display of vital signs on a web page whose printing eliminates the need to manually record the measurements. The development of this solution will be presented in three phases. The first is related to the reception of HL7 messages containing the vital signs and the storage of this information thanks to the Mirth software. The second phase is raw data processing with PHP. Finally, it will be about web programming to allow the printing of a document that replaces the form previously filled by hand. This report will end with the means used to validate the solution as well as the additions planned shortly. In conclusion, a functional solution was realized and put into production to collect the vital signs from the Dräger monitors in order to substitute the manual transcription of this information.

528	Intégration de la démarche d’évaluation et des TIC mobiles (iPad) au préscolaire	Kindergarten education in Quebec follows the changes inspired the competency-based approach, constructivism and the integration of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) which have had particular ramifications in the field of assessment: the child needs to play an active role in same. Even if the integration of ICT in assessment is a challenge in kindergarten, few studies have shed light on these changes as regards teaching practices. In this context, we proposed a training program aimed at accompanying a kindergarten teacher in her assessment practices through the use of a digital tablet. This training program addressed problems dealt with in class and helps enrich teaching practices.  In this study, we aimed to document the integration of mobile technologies and assessment practices in the daily life of a kindergarten teacher through the following tools: a questionnaire on assessment practices and video taping of learning circles, classroom practices and group discussions. The five components of professional development as defined by Shulman and Shulman (2004) were considered for analysing changes brought about in the vision, the motivation, understanding, practices and community sharing, during and at the end of the training. Results indicate a number of changes, which are more or less pronounced as regards regulation practices, differentiated instruction practices and use of assessment tools, be it at the level of the use of descriptive rubrics or self-assessment. As regards the integration of the digital tablet, results show marked changes as its use was favored in certain stages of the evaluation procedure, like data collection, judgement and communication. Finally, teacher accompaniment through learning circles proved to be beneficial.

529	Is Luck Capabilitarianism Possible?	Capability theorists claim that real freedoms should constitute the informational basis for assessing individual wellbeing. Nevertheless, they have not yet developed a normative theory of social justice accounting for why or under what circumstances a political community has the obligation to mitigate deficits in real freedoms. This paper examines whether combining Luck Egalitarianism principles with capabilities as a metric of advantage can deliver an acceptable solution to this problem. However, in light of its inconsistency with the core claims found in capability literature, this paper ultimately rejects that possibility for two reasons: First, because it disregards the multidimensional character of the metric. Second, because it undermines the notion that capabilities are valuable not just because they represent positive freedom but because of the beings and doings they enable.	philosophy , ethics , economics , Capabilitie , Luck Egalitarianism , Wellbeing , philosophy , ethics , economics	en	19821.0
530	Évaluation gastrointestinale de chats présentant un comportement de pica	The aims of this prospective study were to (1) characterize pica in cats, (2) conduct a thorough behavioral and medical evaluation of affected cats, (3) implement specific treatments for conditions identified and evaluate the outcome of these treatments on fabric ingestion.  Cats who ingested fabric at least weekly were recruited.  Cat owners recorded baseline frequency of pica and gastrointestinal signs during one month.  Information about fabric ingestion and a complete medical history were obtained.  A behavioral evaluation and a medical investigation including gastrointestinal evaluation were completed.  Treatments were then implemented according to the diagnoses made and modified as needed.  Cats were followed for a minimum period of six months during which the owners were asked to keep a one month logbook to determine the new frequency of pica and gastrointestinal signs.  Eight cats were enrolled in the study.  All cats showed abnormalities of the gastrointestinal tract.  Six cats were diagnosed with eosinophilic enteritis or gastroenteritis.  Delayed gastric emptying was suspected in four cats.  Gastric reflux was suspected in one cat.  One cat tested positive for Giardia spp.  Mild hypercholesterolemia was observed in seven cats.  Half the cats responded to treatments implemented for gastrointestinal disorders.  Fabric ingestion in cats, a specific form of pica, could in some cases be the consequence of gastrointestinal disorders.  Cats with pica should undergo a thorough medical and behavioral evaluation.

531	Les gestes dans l’environnement numérique : la ponctuation des affects	Through the prism of an anthropological approach inspired by the externalist theory, I propose to study the way digital tools have an impact on the morphology and rhythms of affects. To correctly situate our emotions in their respective environment, I offer a spatial model different from that of the interface in order to demonstrate how digital affects emerge in a social environment produced by our gestures. Thus, I suggest that, when these gestures are based within digital platforms, they create a context of tactile relationships that is more than simply visual, whose effects I would describe as marks of punctuation effects (in their dynamic aspect) and attention (in their temporal aspect).

532	Les Botmasters et leurs rôles dans le marché des botnets	Botnets still represent one of the biggest threats in cyberspace. These corrupted computer networks are used to facilitate the propagation of cybercrime and to reach simultaneously an important number of victims. Previous studies have covered subjects such as the bot infection mechanisms, botnets’ behaviour and also the consequences of their usage. While botnets are well documented, there is a gap in literature regarding botmasters, the hackers responsible for creating and controlling these networks. To understand better those individuals, a content analysis of the underground forum Dark0de helped identify a pool of 88 botmasters that were categorised according to their roles in the botnet market. This preliminary study aims to measure the status, reputation, activity and expertise of botmasters according to their groups: coding, business, distribution, operation, monetization, interest and experience. Preliminary results indicate that distributors and operators have a better reputation in their community, while traders and experienced botmasters have higher statuses in the forum. Operators and traders are the most active botmasters in this forum. Also, most of the botmasters in this study have been found in another forum or none. Finally, except for half of the coders and a third of experienced botmasters, most of these individuals possess many expertise in different fields than botnets.

533	Redefining personal information in the context of the Internet	In the late sixties, with the growing use of computers by organizations, a very broad definition of personal information as “information about an identifiable individual” was elaborated and has been incorporated in data protection laws (“DPLs”). In more recent days, with the Internet and the circulation of new types of information (IP addresses, location information, etc), the efficiency of this definition may be challenged. This thesis aims at proposing a new way of interpreting personal information. Instead of using a literal interpretation, an interpretation which takes into account the purpose behind DPLs will be proposed, in order to ensure that DPLs do what they are supposed to do: address or avoid the risk of harm to individuals triggered by organizations handling their personal information. While the collection or disclosure of information may trigger a more subjective kind of harm (the collection, a feeling of being observed and the disclosure, embarrassment and humiliation), the use of information will trigger a more objective kind of harm (financial, physical, discrimination, etc.). Various criteria useful in order to evaluate this risk of harm will be proposed. The thesis aims at providing a guide that may be used in order to determine whether certain information should qualify as personal information. It will provide for a useful framework under which DPLs remain efficient in light of modern technologies and the Internet.

534	L'organisation juridique des publicains sous la République romaine	The purpose of this thesis is to verify whether at the time of the Roman Republic, the publicans were organized in a structure similar to the modern corporation. After the introduction, the second chapter introduces the corporation, the other legal structures used to organize a business and legal personality in modern law.  It refutes three preconceived ideas which have influenced historians and jurists.  The third chapter presents the publicans and their activities, since historians and jurists abundantly refer to those in their argumentation regarding the legal organization of publicans.  It is therefore necessary to familiarize ourselves with them.  A critical review of historical literature is conducted. The fourth chapter proceeds to a critical analysis of the position of the historians and the jurists on the legal organization of publicans.  It starts with an explanation of the ordinary partnership in Roman law, it then discusses the evolution of legal personality in Roman law and finally, it presents the special case of the partnerships of publicans.  These were apparently been different from ordinary partnerships, because they had legal personality and had a three-levels internal organization (shareholders, directors and officers).  However, this point of view is based on sources which post-date the Republic by several centuries.  We should therefore examine contemporary sources to verify if they lead us to the same conclusions. The fifth chapter contains an original analysis of the republican documentation.  New pieces of evidence are identified.  It confirms that publican partnerships had an embryo of legal personality during the last century of the Republic; however, it was also the case of ordinary partnerships.  Publican partnerships did not have a three levels internal organisation; in addition; that of the ordinary partnerships included magistri like their own.  The publican partnerships were similar to limited partnerships, not to corporations. The conclusion identifies the new elements contributed to knowledge by each chapter of the thesis.	societates publicanorum , publicani , Roman Republic , publicans , roman law , legal personality	en	19675.0
535	"Diagnosis and management of benign fibro-osseous lesions
of the jaws: a current review for the dental clinician"	Benign fibro-osseous lesions of the maxillofacial skeleton constitute a heterogeneous group of disorders that includes developmental, reactive (dysplastic) and neoplastic lesions. Although their classification has been reviewed multiple times in the past, the most common benign fibro-osseous lesions are fibrous dysplasia, osseous dysplasia and ossifying fibroma. For the dental clinician, the challenges involve diagnosis and treatment (or lack thereof). A careful correlation of all clinical, radiologic and microscopic features is essential to establish a proper diagnosis and a clear treatment plan. This article aimed to review the clinical, radiologic and histopathologic characteristics of benign fibro-osseous lesions of the jaws, with emphasis on their differential diagnoses. With a deeper understanding of benign fibro-osseous lesions, clinicians will be better prepared to manage these lesions in their practice.

536	Reaching Innu and Atikamekw Youths in their communities: Future Healthcare Professionals Working Together	Background Mini-Schools of Health are held since 2011 in indigenous communities by the Université de Montréal's Faculty of Medicine and the student's Groupe d’intérêt en santé autochtone (GISA). These events take place in schools and allow health sciences and social work undergraduates to discuss health issues with Innu and Atikamekw youths. The Mini-School aims to promote school perseverance, a healthy lifestyle, and build cultural competence in undergraduates. Mini-School participants come from thirteen different undergraduate programs and multidisciplinary collaboration is facilitated by commonly addressing complex indigenous health issues.  Method Mini-Schools take place three times a year. The communities of Wemotaci and Manawan are visited in the fall or spring, during a one-day trip. The third Mini-School takes place in June during a full week. Innu communities located in the Côte-Nord region, notably Ekuanitshit and Nutashkuan, are visited. Between 250 and 300 students are met yearly in each community by forty undergraduates. Recruitment of undergraduates is managed by the GISA and the Interprofesionnal Student Council. Pre-departure training is mandatory to provide knowledge about the community’s reality and promote respectful and culturally informed interactions. Interdisciplinary exchanges are initiated during the training as participants from various programs bring different perspectives in the discussion. Mini-Schools are held a few days after training and allow undergraduates to join students in class to discuss various themes. In elementary schools, the pleasure of physical activity and healthy eating are addressed, as well as general well-being. In high schools, emphasis is given to complex health issues such as mental health, drug abuse and sexual health. At the same time, other participants host kiosks in the gymnasium and share with students their passion about their future profession. Interactive games are organized to present career prospects such as: nurse, doctor, social worker, pharmacist, nutritionist, optometrist, dentist, audiologist and physiotherapist. Mini-Schools are concluded by a community dinner and a visit to the healthcare facility.  Outcomes Since the introduction of the Mini-Schools in 2011, more than five hundred undergraduates have taken part in the project. Medical students were the only participants at first but the potential for interprofessional education was soon perceived and students from other programs, mainly in health sciences but also information sciences, were invited to join. Participants from various study programs have developed strong friendships and have kept in touch by organizing social and academic activities.  Positive feedback is commonly reported from undergraduates and students. In-person meetings with school administrations and teachers revealed a great level of community satisfaction with these activities. The good reception of the Mini-Schools suggests a short-term positive impact. The long-term impact is yet difficult to measure since it will require data such as the evolution of the graduation rate and the number of future health professionals from these communities.  Conclusions The immersive and intense experience of the Mini-School might be prone to enhance readiness for interprofessional collaboration among future healthcare professionals. This project also allows rich interactions in the communities that hopefully will encourage students to believe in their dream and to become healthcare professionals.	santé autochtone , mini-école de la santé , collaboration interprofessionnelle	en	19649.0
537	Étude d’inspiration néo-riemannienne des structures harmoniques et scalaires d’extraits musicaux du film The Empire Strikes Back	This thesis is centered on John Towner Williams’s (b. 1932) music composed for the movie Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980). It concentrates on extra-diegetic music, that is, music that originates outside the fictional world where the story takes place. The interest for this repertoire originates in its conception, which is based on classical Hollywood film scores, specifically in its high degree of correspondence with narrative content. This study proposes an analysis of pitch organization (chords, strata in a multi-layer texture) and seeks to establish the narrative connections that the music maintains with the image throughout selected scenes. Rather than relying on traditional tools drawn from functional or Schenkerian approaches, here analysis borrows from the theoretical method of Neo-Riemannian theories such as transformations and Tonnetz. These are used in a conventional way, but also as representations of harmonic spaces capable of encompassing broader musical events aside from simple triadic progressions. For example, they may represent motives, or the connections between the different strata comprised in a layered texture. This allows musical material to unfold through the diatonic, hexatonic or octatonic axis from the Tonnetz. Furthermore, the reiteration of particular transformations suggests harmonic spaces that establish the identity of thematic material in a way similar to that of orchestration or scales. Finally, because this type of soundtrack is punctuated by frequent breaks and changes, we will consider its construction throughout multiples shifts between harmonic spaces.

538	Variation de l'épigénome, du phénotype et des stratégies écologiques pour la persistance d'un vertébré asexué	The capacity to cope with environmental changes is crucial to the establishment and persistence of populations. The processes underlying such a capacity can take different forms. The high genetic (and phenotypic) diversity arising from sexual reproduction is one process that allows to cope with different environmental conditions through the survival of at least a few individuals. On the other hand, epigenetic processes, allowing the modification of gene expression, are also responsible for phenotypic variation. Epigenetic changes may occur accidentally (epimutations) or in response to an environmental stimulus (plasticity). Thus, epigenetics would represent an alternative process to genetic variation to explain the ecological success of genetically identical organisms. However, genotypes are not equally capable of coping with environmental changes. Some genotypes are generalists and can acclimatize to a wide range of environmental conditions, whereas other genotypes are specialized and restricted to narrow environmental conditions. The general objective of this thesis is to highlight the processes responsible for the persistence of asexual organisms by determining the relationship between epigenetic processes, phenotypic variation and ecological strategies. To achieve this, the clonal hybrid fish Chrosomus eos-neogaeus were used as a biological model. By reproducing by gynogenesis, the clonal lineages (genotypes) are distributed among the same environments than the sexual parental species. Moreover, the geographical distribution of the lineages suggests the presence of generalist and specialist genotypes. The analysis of these lineages in natural and controlled conditions allowed to disentangling the influence of genetic, environmental and epigenetic variations on phenotypic variation. On the one hand, generalist and specialist strategies were empirically tested: (i) genetic analyses were used to infer the historical processes explaining the diversity and the current distribution of the clonal lineages; (ii) the comparison of methylation patterns in different lineages allowed to determine the dynamism of the epigenetic processes according to environmental fluctuations and to associate them with an ecological strategy: an important environmental or stochastic effect on epigenetic variation being associated with phenotypic iv plasticity or bet-hedging, respectively; and (iii) the role of phenotypic plasticity in niches diversification was highlighted by comparing individuals’ trophic morphology in natural and controlled conditions. On the other hand, the second part of this thesis has allowed to associate a cost (developmental instability) to phenotypic plasticity and to propose a hypothesis about the existence of a demographic handicap necessary to explain the paradox regarding the coexistence of sexual and asexual sperm-dependent organisms. Understanding these different mechanisms underlying the ecological success of organisms in face of environmental heterogeneity allows us to better establish their evolutionary potential and provides additional tools to protect them against changing environments.

539	Étude de la transcription par des techniques à haut-débit chez le dinoflagellé Lingulodinium polyedrum	Dinoflagellates are a diverse group of unicellular eukaryotes found in marine habitat where they have a major role in the primary production of the ocean and in the formation of coral reefs. They are also responsible for some of the harmful algal blooms whose toxin production can contaminate crustacean and fish. Dinoflagellates possess unique molecular characteristics in eukaryotes, especially for their nucleus. For example, their genome is found in a permanently condensed liquid crystalline state stabilized by metallic cations instead of the nucleosome organized by histones. This condensed form persists throughout the cell cycle and limits transcription to DNA loops localized at the periphery of the chromosomes. These unusual characteristics, coupled with a generally large genome size, have greatly limited the study of basic molecular mechanisms such as transcription regulation. In order to better characterize this process for the dinoflagellates, I used Lingulodinium polyedrum, a dinoflagellate studied extensively for its circadian rhythms. As a first approach, high-throughput sequencing was used to characterize the complete transcriptome of the organism at four different times throughout the day. Surprisingly, this sequencing revealed that an extremely low number of transcripts vary in abundance between time points and that those variations are of low amplitude, a result in stark contrast with what has been observed in other organisms. A pharmacological inhibition of transcription was also done and shows that bioluminescence and photosynthesis rhythms persist in absence of transcription, suggesting that the classical transcription/translation feedback loop used to generate rhythmic timing in eukaryotes is probably absent in Lingulodinium. The second approach was the characterization of two proteins with a cold-shock domain (CSD), a type of domain strongly overrepresented in dinoflagellates and predicted to be a potential transcription factor. Those two proteins showed a preferential binding to single stranded DNA versus double stranded DNA while also being able to bind RNA, and were not specific to a particular sequence. Protein abundance analysis after a prolonged cold shock did not yield a massive increase in the abundance of those two proteins, as seen in E. coli. Furthermore, neither protein was able to complement a quadruple cold shock protein (CSP) mutant in E. coli. Data gathered here suggest that CSD proteins in dinoflagellates are probably iv not sequence-specific transcription factors and may also have a function different from bacterial CSP. The third approach consisted of the in vivo cross-linking of chromatin-interacting proteins. After cross-linking, the chromatin was purified and the proteins associated with it extracted and identified by mass spectrometry. Of the identified proteins, few DNA binding proteins were found, unlike similar studies done in animals. Peptides derived from a histone H4 were discovered, one of the first instances of histone identification in dinoflagellates. Multiple proteins able to bind RNA have been identified and could be used to regulate multiple steps of RNA biology and therefore modulate RNA translation. Some proteins related to cell cycle control and DNA repair were also identified. Taken together, these three approaches support the view that the transcriptional regulation and control over mRNAs abundance seem to have a lower importance in dinoflagellate than in other eukaryotes.

540	Association between asthma during pregnancy and postpartum depression	There is evidence from several epidemiological studies on the increased risk of depression among women with asthma outside of pregnancy. However, we found no studies designed to investigate the association between asthma during pregnancy and postpartum depression. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess the association between asthma during pregnancy and postpartum depression.          Based on Quebec administrative databases, we constructed a cohort of 35,520 pregnancies from asthmatic women and 197,057 pregnancies from non-asthmatic women who delivered between 1998 and 2009. Asthmatic women were identified using a validated operational definition. Postpartum depression was defined and specified with diagnostic codes for depression from the definition of Statistics Canada recorded in the RAMQ or MED-ECHO databases and assessed 1 year postpartum. A generalized estimating equation model was used to estimate the crude and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of postpartum depression and 95% confidence intervals (CI) comparing women with and without asthma during pregnancy.          The proportion of postpartum depression 1 year after delivery was higher among asthmatic compared to non-asthmatic pregnant women (6.1% vs. 2.9%). After adjusting for potential confounders, we observed that women with asthma were 58% more likely to have postpartum depression (adjusted OR: 1.58; 95%CI, 1.50-1.67) than women without asthma during pregnancy.         The findings of our study suggest an increased risk of postpartum depression among asthmatic women. Attention should be given to depressive symptoms in asthmatic women in the year postpartum to detect postpartum depression more rapidly and intervene more efficiently.

541	Thawing permafrost and land-atmosphere interactions of boreal forest-wetland landscapes in northwestern Canada	Boreal forests store large amounts of organic carbon and are an important component of the regional and global climate systems. Climate and land surface are closely coupled through the land-atmosphere exchange of greenhouse gases, such as CO2 and CH4, and of energy and water vapor. In lowlands of the North American sporadic permafrost region, thaw-induced surface subsidence leads to expansion of permafrost-free wetlands at the expense of boreal forests underlain by permafrost. However, the spatial extent of these land cover changes and their implications for land-atmosphere interactions are unknown. In this study, I analyze eddy covariance flux measurements from an organic-rich boreal forest-wetland landscape in the southern Taiga Plains, NT, Canada. I combine these measurements with flux footprint modeling, satellite remote sensing data, paleoecological records, and downscaled climate projections to characterize how thaw-induced land cover change affects land-atmosphere interactions and climate.  In the Taiga Plains ecozone, thaw-induced boreal forest loss currently transforms the composition and structure of the boreal zone in North America and is of equal importance for tree cover dynamics as wildfire disturbance. Forest loss modifies landatmosphere energy fluxes through changes in aerodynamic and ecophysiological land surface properties. On the one hand, increasing albedo decreases total turbulent energy fluxes (i.e., sensible (H) and latent heat (LE) flux), and on the other hand decreasing surface roughness and increasing wetness enhances LE at the expense of H. The resulting maximum summer air temperatures and humidity would be substantially colder (1-2 C) and wetter (2 mmol mol-1) in a hypothetical permafrost-free wetland landscape, as indicated by planetary boundary layer model simulations.  In contrast to the regional biophysical climate cooling impact of thaw-induced land cover change, wetland expansion and related increases in landscape CH4 emissions induce a net global biogeochemical climate warming impact. At the current rate of wetland expansion in the southern Taiga Plains of 0.26 % yr-1, landscape CH4 emissions increase by 0.034 g CH4 m-2 yr-1. Typical rates of long-term net CO2 uptake in these landscapes are too small to neutralize the associated climate warming effect until the end of the 21st century.  The rapidly thawing boreal forest-wetland landscape still acts as a net CO2 sink taking up 74 g CO2 m-2 yr-1. Wetland expansion does not affect landscape-level net CO2 uptake as changes in gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) are of similar magnitude. The negligible thaw-induced effects on net CO2 fluxes are contrasted by larger direct climate change impacts of warming air temperatures and reduced incoming shortwave radiation. For a high warming scenario (RCP8.5), increases in modeled ER outpace the increasing GPP significantly. For a moderate warming scenario (RCP4.5), ER and GPP increase are of similar magnitude.  Thaw-induced land cover change in the Taiga Plains causes thus biophysical and biogeochemical climate impacts of opposite sign and at contrasting scales of impacts (regional vs. global). In an increasingly warmer climate, thawing permafrost alters how boreal landscapes interact with climate highlighting the need to incorporate thaw-induced land cover changes into global Earth system models.

542	"Improving practice guidelines for the
treatment of denture-related erythematous
stomatitis: a study protocol for a
randomized controlled trial"	Background: Denture-related erythematous stomatitis (DES) is a chronic biofilm-mediated disease, affecting one in every three complete denture wearers. Antifungals are the treatment most commonly prescribed by oral health professionals, based on the belief that colonization by Candida spp. is the main cause of DES. However, high recurrence rates and adverse effects are commonly observed, prompting the need for practice guidelines regarding treatment. Results from our pilot study demonstrate that palatal brushing can reduce the palatal inflammation and potentially associated Candida carriage without any need for antifungal therapy. The objective of this study is to validate these pilot results by means of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) and provide a practice guideline for clinicians. Methods/design: A pragmatic, two-parallel-arm, multicenter RCT will be conducted in Canada, Brazil, and Chile. Fifty-two adult complete denture wearers presenting with moderate to severe DES will be allocated randomly to two groups: the Intervention arm will consist of palatal brushing and standard oral and denture hygiene measures, while the Control arm will include only standard oral and denture hygiene measures. The study outcome will be the oral Candida carriage. Participants will be assessed at baseline, and at 3 and 6 months post intervention. Descriptive, bivariate, and mixed models with repeated measures will be performed following the intention-to-treat principle. Discussion: This pragmatic RCT will serve to provide a clinical practice guideline regarding the use of preventive measures in the treatment of biofilm-mediated oral diseases. Moreover, it will have a great impact on reducing the harm of antifungal overtreatment on patients suffering from DES.

543	La volonté du public à contacter le Centre de prévention de la radicalisation menant à la violence : une analyse des enjeux à la recherche d’aide pour un proche radicalisé	Communities are key players in efforts to prevent radicalization. In fact, family members and friends are among the first to observe changes or early signs suggesting that someone might be heading toward a form of violent extremism. Yet, we still know very little about communitybased views on reaching out to a formal or informal resource regarding a possible case of radicalization. This study seeks to better understand the issues that influence the willingness to contact the Center for the Prevention of Radicalization leading to Violence (CPRLV), a Montreal-based independent organization. For this purpose, we conducted interviews and focus groups with 29 individuals living in Greater Montreal, who self-identify as Quebecers or as Jewish, Muslim, Latin American or African. The results suggest the presence of a multitude of issues inhibiting reaching out to a specific resource; while some have been identified by most participants, others seem to be rather specific to a community. Among the results shared by all respondents, it has been observed that the lack of knowledge of available resources and the fear of repercussions appear to be central issues. Moreover, the results suggest that the participants perceive radicalization as a phenomenon essentially linked to Islam, which could be explained by the influence of media representation of the issue and could consequently have an impact on their way of understanding and identifying a radicalization-prone case. Finally, the gray area surrounding the behaviors associated with radicalization appears to be a problem in assessing the severity of the situation and ultimately the decision to reach out to an aid resource, such as the CPRLV, or the police.

544	Étude de la stabilité thermique et protection à la surcharge de cathodes pour batteries au lithium-ion	In this thesis, we have investigated the thermal stability of cathode materials used in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Using accelerating rate calorimetry, the study was carried out on two of the most attractive cathode materials for large scale LIBs; namely, lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) and nickel-manganese spinel oxide (LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4). While the impact of partial nickel substitution for manganese in LiMn2O4 was investigated for LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4 along with its decomposition mechanism, the effect of the synthetic method was evaluated for LiFePO4. Our results have demonstrated that the high intrinsic thermal stability of LiFePO4 was only slightly affected by the synthetic method within the three studied routes. In order to enhance the safe operation of this material by providing a protection form electrical abuse during overcharge, we have developed a new class of overcharge protection additives. By combining a redox shuttle with an ionic liquid, we were able, for the first time, to dissolve the additive for protection against overcharge at concentrations up to 1 M in conventional electrolytes for LIBs. Our results have shown an overcharge protection of LiFePO4 for over 200 cycles, using an optimal concentration of 0.7 M, without compromising its electrochemical performances. Finally, by studying the thermal behavior of LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4 at different temperatures, we were able to establish the decomposition mechanism of this material. Moreover, our study has proven that the presence of nickel in LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4, that ensures the high voltage of this cathode material, is also responsible for the very poor thermal stability of this material at temperatures as low as 60 ºC.

545	Social inequalities in health information seeking among young adults in Montreal	Over their lifecourse, young adults develop different skills and preferences in relationship to the information sources they seek when having questions about health. Health information seeking behaviour (HISB) includes multiple, unequally accessed sources; yet most studies have focused on single sources and did not examine HISB’s association with social inequalities. This study explores ‘multiple-source’ profiles and their association with socioeconomic characteristics. We analyzed cross-sectional data from the Interdisciplinary Study of Inequalities in Smoking involving 2093 young adults recruited in Montreal, Canada, in 2011–2012. We used latent class analysis to create profiles based on responses to questions regarding whether participants sought health professionals, family, friends or the Internet when having questions about health. Using multinomial logistic regression, we examined the associations between profiles and economic, social and cultural capital indicators: financial difficulties and transportation means, friend satisfaction and network size, and individual, mother’s, and father’s education. Five profiles were found: ‘all sources’ (42%), ‘health professional centred’ (29%), ‘family only’ (14%), ‘Internet centred’ (14%) and ‘no sources’ (2%). Participants with a larger social network and higher friend satisfaction were more likely to be in the ‘all sources’ group. Participants who experienced financial difficulties and completed college/university were less likely to be in the ‘family only’ group; those whose mother had completed college/university were more likely to be in this group. Our findings point to the importance of considering multiple sources to study HISB, especially when the capacity to seek multiple sources is unequally distributed. Scholars should acknowledge HISB’s implications for health inequalities.	Health information , Youth , Inequalities	en	19490.0
546	"Sleeping Toward Behavioral Regulation: Relations Between Sleep and Externalizing 
      Symptoms in Toddlers and Preschoolers"	Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the concurrent and longitudinal relations between sleep and externalizing symptoms among young children. Method: Sixty-four families (mostly Caucasian; 36 boys) were met twice, when children were 2 (T1) and 4 years of age (T2). At T1, children wore an actigraph monitor for a 72-hour period, and both mothers and fathers completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). At T2, both parents as well as the daycare educator filled the CBCL. Results: At T1, longer sleep duration and higher sleep efficiency was associated with fewer externalizing symptoms as assessed by mothers. Results also indicated that higher sleep efficiency at T1 was related to fewer parent-reported externalizing symptoms at T2 (while controlling for prior externalizing symptoms). Relations between sleep efficiency at T1 and externalizing symptoms as assessed by mothers at T1 and by fathers at T2 were moderated by child sex, such that links were significant among boys only. Results pertaining to educators’ reports were inconclusive. Conclusions: The current study highlights the importance of rapidly treating sleep difficulties, which are associated with persistent behavioral maladjustment, perhaps especially for boys.

547	Inégalités socioéconomiques et effets cardiovasculaires des expositions aux émissions industrielles au Québec, Canada	On a daily basis, populations are exposed to a complex mixture of air pollutants such as fine particulate matters, sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide that have been associated with a range of health effects namely respiratory and cardiovascular effects. Emitting sources’ distribution, landscape characteristics (i.e. infrastructure, topography) and thus the complex mixture of air pollutants and populations’ exposure vary greatly in space and time. This thesis aimed to document social inequalities in exposure to industrial air emissions of pollutants and associations between daily exposure to these pollutants and cardiovascular mortality in vulnerable populations living near these sources. Thus, using an ecological design, we analyzed Pearson’s correlations between deprivation level (using four indicators) of 2,189 primary and secondary Quebec schools and their exposure to industrial emissions in a radius of 2.5 to 7.5 km. Our results suggest inequalities in exposure to industrial air emissions at school in children. These associations were not consistent among all four indicators of deprivation. Besides, using a case-crossover design, we evaluated the associations between exposure to industrial air pollutants using both emission exposure estimates and sensor levels and deaths from cardiovascular diseases in the elderly living near industrial sources (<7.5 km). We found no convincing evidence of association. Our results varied greatly which could be caused by the limits of our study related to estimating exposure. Further studies using improved exposure estimates are necessary to support our findings.

548	L'implantation valvulaire aortique par cathéter : évolution des résultats cliniques suite aux avancées technologiques et techniques	Context: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is a relatively young procedure intended to treat patients with severe aortic stenosis who are at high risk for conventional surgery, or inoperable. This procedure underwent multiple technological improvements (successive generations of devices) and multiple technical improvements (simplification of various steps in the procedure).  Objective: We intend to describe the clinical impact of a technological improvement (the transition from the second to the third generation of the Edwards device in a high-volume center) and that of a technical improvement (TAVI without pre-dilatation, known as direct TAVI). Methods: We first describe, through a meta-analysis, the state of TAVI at the beginning of its widespread use, in 2012. Next, we describe, through a single-center retrospective study, the clinical impact of the transition from the second to the third generation of the Edwards device in 507 patients. Finally, in a retrospective study with matching, we tested three pre-dilatation strategies: systematic pre-dilatation, selective pre-dilatation, and direct TAVI. Results: In the article describing the initial TAVI experience, the 30-day mortality rate was between 5 and 18%. One-year mortality was estimated at 23% by meta-analysis (random effects model). Stroke rate at 30 days was between 0 and 6.7% and major vascular complication rate was between 2 and 16%. The transition from SAPIEN XT to SAPIEN 3 resulted in a non-significant reduction in 30-day mortality (from 8.7 to 3.5%; p=0.21) and 30-day stroke rate (from 2.8 to 1.4%; p=0.6), and a significant reduction in major vascular complications (from 9.9 to 2.8%; p<0.0001). However, there was a significant increase in permanent pacemaker rate (from 9.8 to 17.3%; p=0.03). Next, we found no adverse effect of performing direct TAVI in terms of mortality or vascular complications at 30 days. We found a trend towards a reduction in stroke rate with direct TAVI (3 vs. 1%; p=0.11), particularly in patients with mildly or moderately calcified valves. However, in those with extensive valvular calcification, the risk of device malposition was numerically higher. In all three studies presented, there was little variation in 1-year mortality (20 to 25%).  Conclusions: Short-term adverse events were reduced by the transition towards the third-generation Edwards device. Direct TAVI is feasible and safe. However, both of these improvements have limitations and should be considered carefully.

549	Implication de HMGB1 dans la différentiation des trophoblastes	The placenta plays a crucial role during pregnancy and trophoblast differentiation is fundamental to its proper functioning. The absence of inflammation is also essential for the success of gestation, the presence of uncontrolled inflammation is associated with several pregnancy complications, such as preeclampsia (PE) and preterm delivery. High Mobility Group Box 1 (HMGB1), a nuclear protein that acts as a pro-inflammatory mediator when secreted into the extracellular media, is one of the endogenous inflammatory mediators increased during pathological pregnancies. However, the actions of HMGB1 at the materno-fetal interface are still unknown. The aim of this work was to evaluate the concentration, subcellular localization and secretion of HMGB1 during trophoblast differentiation and to evaluate the distribution of HMGB1 in the placenta from pregnancies complicated with PE. In my studies I have shown an increase of HMGB1’s nuclear concentration during the spontaneous differentiation of trophoblasts. Moreover, the use of a histone deacetylase inhibitor (i.e. NaB) leads to an accumulation of HMGB1 in the cytoplasm and promotes differentiation, while the use of a nuclear export inhibitor (i.e. leptomycin) leads to a decrease in differentiation. Concerning pregnancies complicated with PE, there is a redistribution of HMGB1 with cytoplasmic accumulation. In conclusion, this work demonstrates the association between the modulation of HMGB1 localisation with trophoblasts differentiation, although the causal link remains to be determined.

550	Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase de classe II : aspects structural et dynamique dans le mécanisme réactionnel	Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase catalyzes the reversible aldol reaction in glucose metabolism interconverting dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) into D-fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP). Aldolases are furthermore classified based on their reaction mechanism: class I aldolase (e. g. human aldolase) forms a covalent Schiff base intermediate with substrate, whereas class II aldolase utilizes a divalent metal cation in catalysis.  Class II aldolase is commonly found in pathogenic organisms such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis (tuberculosis), Giardia lamblia (giardiasis), Escherichia coli (diverse infections) and  Helicobacter pylori (ulcer and gastric cancer) but not in mammals. This distribution makes class II aldolase a potential target for drug discovery. Structure driven drug design depends on an explicit knowledge of the reaction mechanism of class II aldolase and its three-dimensional structure. Our current knowledge is lacking; existing aldolase crystal structures with reaction intermediates and with competitive inhibitors are not coherent with proposed mechanisms in literature.   The present study focuses on the catalytic role of two residues, each located on a mobile loop of  H. pylori class II aldolase and each implicated in a critical proton transfer step. Single mutants H180Q and E142A were characterized enzymatically and crystallized for X-ray structure determination. Crystal structures of reaction intermediates formed with substrate were determined. The catalytic mechanism requires proton abstraction at the FBP C4 hydroxyl group to initiate C3-C4 bond cleavage, first step of the retroaldol reaction. Our data supports His180 situated on the mobile loop beta6-alpha8, as the residue responsible for this proton transfer. Notably, His180 chelates the zinc ion in the native structure. The structural change induced due to C1 phosphate binding of FBP releases His180 to promote cleavage. Displacement of the catalytic zinc ion ensues, facilitating substrate binding and subsequent stabilization of the enediolate intermediate. Our results do not support the previous hypothesis of a catalytic role for Asp82 in C4 hydroxyl group proton abstraction; it rather plays an important role in maintaining structural integrity for active site binding. Displacement of the nascent aldehyde G3P and concomitant stereospecific protonation of the enediolate species generates the obligate triose phosphate, DHAP. Dissociation of DHAP from the active site completes the catalytic cycle. The residue responsible for initiating enediolate protonation was identified as residue Glu142, situated on mobile loop beta5-alpha7, and this is in agreement with previous kinetic studies of enediolate protonation in other class II aldolases, attributing the same role to this conserved residue. We devised a molecular dynamic simulation method to follow the catalytic loop folding event, further investigating details of the role of Glu142 in catalysis. We gained further knowledge of the cleavage event, although work remains to elucidate missing details of the catalysis and integrate our findings. By attributing a role in catalysis to loop beta6-alpha8 not limited to substrate binding, this loop of class II aldolases becomes a potential target in drug design. In addition, ligand independent zinc ion migration suggest it is possible to chelate the metal and restrain it far from the active site.

551	Pour ne pas perdre le Nord : vers une protection efficace du milieu marin arctique	The Arctic is currently facing significant environmental threats. Yet, because of its particular precariousness, those threats will possibly impact its ecosystem and local communities. As those problems are posing unique management challenges, some solutions have been put in place, but are not really effective. In order to protect the arctic marine environment, several hard law and soft law instruments have been set at the international, regional, subregional, bilateral and national scales, but they are all facing serious shortcomings. The question of arctic marine environmental governance has therefore become inevitable in addressing those issues. The needs to protect the arctic marine environment, its ecosystem and inhabitants and the economic imperatives of resources exploitation and economic growth have to be balanced. Thus, arctic marine environmental protection has to (1) put forth an instrument with more implementation and conformity mechanisms, with more flexibility, more precision and depth, and more transparence and accountability; (2) be thought in terms of continuum and synergies of the different levels of governance instead of approaching them separately; (3) put forward an international regimes complex; (4) include a plethora of actors in the governance system and (5) establish marine protected areas that recognize the concepts of ecosystem-based management and respect some environmental principles. In this way, equilibrium between environmental, social and economical needs and effectiveness in governance will be reached.	pollution marine , international environmental law , law of the sea , environment , Arctic , marine environment , international law , climate change , marine pollution , environmental protection , marine protected areas , MPAs , Arctic Council	en	19414.0
552	Négociations climatiques et mesures d'adaptation : la prise en compte des droits humains en droit international des changements climatiques	"This Master's thesis attempts to underline the link between environmental law, more precisely international climate change law, and human rights law. Since the Rio Summit in 1992 and the emergence of Agenda 21's soft law principles, the growing connection between these two spheres of law seem to have had an influence on the latest programmes derived from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (or UNFCCC) adopted in 1992. Does the latest addition to the UNFCCC adopted in 2015, the Paris Agreement, better highlight the importance of this link between human rights and the environment?   In facing the inevitable effects brought on by climate change, we will explore the efficiency of the Framework-Convention's bodies and programmes tasked with aiding Member States adaptation and mitigation efforts. Do the commitments undertaken by world States in their intended nationally determined contributions underline the urgent need for action? In truth, the international community seems to suffer from a severe lack of ambition, often referred to the ""ambition gap"" or ""emissions gap"". Failure to sufficiently mitigate greenhouse gas emissions will undeniably result in a greater need to finance adaptation, yet ""climate finance"" already suffers from underfunding, which implies that the effects of climate change will not be sufficiently offset to ensure human rights violations won't take place.   Is it possible that by renouncing to take ambitious commitments, Member States violate their human rights obligations as well as their obligations under the Framework Convention? We will explore this question."

553	Social consequences of the privatization in Bulgaria and socio-economic impact of the neo-liberal economic theory on the transition to free market and democracy in the period from 1989 to 2015	Objectives : We look at the privatization in Bulgaria as defined above from a certain historical distance of 25 years, trying follow the visible now social consequences of the privatization, such as social inequality vs economic development; demographic impact and new social structures and values. Method: We use a two-prong approach. For the socio-economic development we study six constant variables for the defined period such as number of people below poverty line, GDP, Gini Index, demographic dynamcs, employment rate, and Human development index; for the social changes, new structures and values we use a qualitative approach, based on based on interviews, questionnaires, field studies, etc. Results: We find that results by both methods, with all the limittaions they have, rather align with our hypothesis that privatization in Bulgaria was economically necessary, but socially destructive and led to devastating social consequences, mainly as a result of flawed privatization policies and practices. It did emerge from the predominant at that time neo-liberal economic view and the specific practices used in the Bulgarian privatization favoured mainly in short term for some small social groups but for the society as a whole. Conclusion: We find that the way Bulgarian privatization was conducted was socially and economically damaging with long lasting consequences. In the long run the economy has recoverd, however the social divergences tend to grow.	social inequality , socio-economic development , neo-liberal theory , social values	en	19409.0
554	Effet de l'intrication brouillée sur la téléportation quantique	Quantum teleportation will be a centerpiece of practical quantum cryptography and quantum computing in a soon to be future. As no physical implementation is perfect, we study quantum teleportation in the context of impaired quantum resources which we call noisy entanglement. In a first part, we introduce how quantum mechanics is formalized by quantum information theory. In the second part, we study standard quantum teleportation, in both the absence and presence of quantum repeaters, as well as port-based teleportation. Our analysis of standard quantum teleportation and port-based teleportation follows three main directions. The first goal is to compare the use of a noisy channel for teleportation to the one of the same channel for direct transmission. We thus find the conditions under which the two cases are equivalent. Our second objective is to observe the non-local properties of noisy entanglement by finding when and how Alice can blame Bob for her noise. Thirdly, we quantify, in the worst-case scenario, the quality of a teleportation channel by reducing the effect of any noisy entanglement to the one of a one-parameter Pauli channel that can be interpreted as a depolarizing channel in most instances. We achieve this task by erasing unneeded classical information at the appropriate time and by twirling either the entanglement or the teleported state. Finally, we analyze the composition of Pauli noises and the impact of the erasure channel parameter on the protocol of teleportation with quantum repeaters. We thus aim to understand how the effects of noisy entanglement cumulate in a teleportation network. The next logical step is to create robust teleportation schemes that take into account the effects of noisy entanglement.

555	La critique romantique face au Moyen Âge : La Harpe, Villemain, Nisard et Sainte-Beuve	The nineteenth century rediscovered, in a context of rupture with the Ancien Régime's aesthetic, the middle Ages' literature and its prolongations. That literature has been received in different ways, according to the position of each critic in the quarrel of the romantics. This quarrel thus modulated the reception of the works from before the XVIIth century: those became an example to follow for some; or were only, for others, mere examples of the French civilisation's childhood. That new taste of romantics for works neglected by the two preceding centuries brought a questioning about the literature in general, in a new perspective of its historicity. From now on, literature had to be regarded as an expression of a particular and ever changing civilisation. In this context, a new discipline appeared soon: the history of French literature; history still mixed with subjective evaluations and didacticism. We'll delve therefore on the reception that the literature before the XVIIth century received from the most famous and the most representative critics and historians of the nineteenth century, i.e. La Harpe, Villemain, Nisard and Sainte-beuve. We'll study how the literary doctrines of each critic influenced theirs judgements; and will see how the Middle Ages' works has been sometimes used to defend the aesthetic contentions of its judges. We'll analyse as well the variety of the judgements that happened to occur over the years within the framework of a same trend.

556	Examen des difficultés psychosociales chez des adolescents, neuf (9) mois après une tragédie ferroviaire	Objectives: To examine the psychosocial difficulties in a group of exposed adolescents aged 14 to 18 nine months after the railway accident. Compare adolescents who reach the clinical level of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) to those who do not, depending on range severity of exposure and on symptoms of depression, anxiety and other related issues. Methods: The analyses were conducted on a suitability sample of 227 young people, with an average age of 15.96 years, in secondary levels III, IV and V, and living in the Mégantic sector of the Eastern Townships in the province of Quebec. Results: Almost half (41.5%) of adolescents report being severely exposed to the railway accident and one third (29.6%) has described severe PTSD symptoms reaching the clinical threshold. In addition, there appears to be a tendency for a higher proportion of girls compared to boys to have PTSD problems and depression and anxiety symptoms. The majority of adolescents report a non-problematic use of psychoactive substances, while 8% are at risk or problematic. Delinquency, mainly non-violent, is more common among boys. Adolescents who reach a clinical threshold of PTSD symptoms have been more severely exposed to the tragedy and report feeling more depressed and anxious. There was no significant relationship between PTSD and externalized behaviours. Conclusion: The results of the study highlight the relationship between a traumatic event such as the railway accident and the presence of PTSD symptoms as well as of internalized behaviours in a group of adolescents.	adolescents , consommation de substances psychoactives , Railway accident , post-traumatic stress disorder , depression , anxiety , use of psychoactive substances , delinquency	en	19346.0
557	Gambling Problems among Community Cocaine Users	Cocaine use is highly prevalent and a major public health problem. While some studies have reported frequent comorbidity problems among cocaine users, few studies have included evaluation of gambling problems. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of gambling problems and compare those who were at-risk gamblers with non-problem gamblers in terms of mental health problems, substance use problems, and some risk factors (i.e. family antecedents, erroneous perceptions and coping strategies) among individuals who smoke or inject cocaine. METHOD: A total of 424 smoked or injected cocaine users recruited through community-based programs in Montreal, Quebec completed the questionnaire, including the Canadian Pathological Gambling Index, the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI), the CAGE, and the Severity Dependence Scale (SDS). RESULTS: Of the sample, 18.4 % were considered at-risk gamblers, of whom 7.8 % had problems gambling and 10.6 % were moderate-risk gamblers. The at-risk group was more likely to have experienced a recent phobic disorder and alcohol problems than the non-problem group. A multivariate analysis showed that, compared to those who were non-problem gamblers, the at-risk ones were more likely to have lost a large sum of money when they first started gambling, believed that their luck would turn, and gambled in reaction to painful life events. These results indicate the need to include routines for screening to identify gambling problem among cocaine users	Cocaine user , Gambling Problem , Addiction , Substance abuse , Comorbidity , Coping strategies	en	19338.0
558	Visits to primary care physicians among persons who inject drugs at high risk of Hepatitis C Virus infection: room for improvement	Abstract: The role of primary care physicians (PCP) in Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) prevention is increasingly emphasized. Yet, little is known about the patterns of contacts with PCP among persons who inject drugs (PWID). We sought to assess the six-month prevalence of PCP visiting among PWID at risk of HCV infection, and to explore the associated factors. Baseline data were collected from HCV-seronegative PWID recruited in HEPCO, an observational Hepatitis Cohort study (2004-2011) in Montreal, Canada. An interviewer-administered questionnaire elicited information on socio-demographic factors, drug use patterns, and health care services utilization. Blood samples were tested for HCV antibodies. Using the Gelberg-Andersen Behavioral Model, hierarchical logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify predisposing, need and enabling factors associated with PCP visiting. Of the 349 participants (mean age=34; 80.8% male), 32.1% reported visiting a PCP. In the multivariate model, among predisposing factors, male gender (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR]=0.45, [0.25-0.83], chronic homelessness (AOR=0.08, [0.01-0.67]), cocaine injection (AOR=0.46, [0.28-0.76]) and reporting greater illegal or semi-legal income (AOR=0.48, [0.27-0.85]) were negatively associated with PCP visits. Markers of need were not associated with the outcome. Among enabling factors, contact with street nurses (AOR=3.86, [1.49-9.90]) and food banks (AOR=2.01, [1.20-3.37]) were positively associated with PCP visiting. Only one third of participating PWID reported a recent visit to a PCP. While a host of predisposing factors seems to hamper timely contacts with PCP among high-risk PWID, community-based support services may play an important role in initiating dialogue with primary health care services in this population.

559	Recourse policies in the vehicle routing problem with stochastic demands	In the field of logistics, many practical problems can be formulated as the vehicle routing problem (VRP). In its broadest picture, the VRP aims at designing a set of vehicle routes to pickup or delivery goods through a set of customers with the minimum costs. In the deterministic VRP, all problem parameters are assumed known beforehand. The VRPs in real-life applications, however, involve various sources of uncertainty. Uncertainty is appeared in several parameters of the VRPs like demands, customer, service or traveling times. The VRPs in which one or more parameters appear to be uncertain are called stochastic VRPs (SVRPs).  In this dissertation, we examine vehicle routing problem with stochastic demands (VRPSD). In this variant of SVRPs, the customer demands are only known upon arriving at the customer location and are defined through probability distributions. In this setting, the vehicle executing a planned route may fail to service a customer, whenever the observed demand exceeds the residual capacity of the vehicle. Such occurrences are called route failures; in this case the planned route becomes infeasible. There are two approaches when facing route failures. At the customer where the failure occurred, one can recover routing feasibility by executing back-and-forth trips to the depot to replenish the vehicle capacity and complete the service. In anticipation of route failures, one can perform preventive returns whenever the residual capacity falls below a threshold value. All the extra decisions, which are in the form of return trips to the depot in the VRPSD context, preserving routing feasibility are called recourse actions. To model the VRPSD, a recourse policy, governing the execution of such recourse actions, must be designed. The goal of this dissertation is to develop cost-effective recourse policies, in which the fixed operational conventions can govern the execution of recourse actions.  In the first part of this dissertation, we propose a fixed rule-based policy, by which the execution of preventive returns is governed through the preset thresholds. We particularly introduce three volume based policies which consider the vehicle capacity, expected demand of the next customer and the expected demand of the remaining unvisited customers. Then, the integer L-shaped algorithm is redeveloped to solve the VRPSD under the rule-based policy. The contribution with regard to this study has been submitted to the Journal of Transportation Science.  In the second part, we propose a hybrid recourse policy, which combines the risk of failure and distances-to-travel into a single recourse rule, governing the execution of recourse actions. We employ a risk measure to control the risk of failure at the next customer. When the risk of failure is neither too high nor too low, we apply a distance measure, which compares the preventive return cost with future failures cost. The contribution with regard to this study has been submitted to the EURO Journal on Transportation and Logistics.  In the last part of this dissertation, we develop an exact solution methodology to solve the VRPSD under an optimal restocking policy. The optimal restocking policy derives a set of customer-specific thresholds such that the expected recourse cost is minimized. The contribution with regard to this study will be submitted to the European Journal of Operational Research.

560	Sideshadow views : narrative possibilities in Charles Dickens's late novels	This essay discusses the role of the hypothetical – that which can be proposed only as a hypothesis -- in Charles Dickens’s last eight novels and the variety of literary means used to invoke it. In any language-based communication, words are uttered (and heard) or written (and read), one after the other, in the order that grammar demands. The linearity and order of such sequences seem to reflect naturally a temporality and a causality governing the represented events. In fact, this can only account for their necessity and their chronology. I argue that the novels under consideration make use of hypothetical and counterfactual actions, thoughts, events, perspectives, voices, etc., in order to overcome the limits imposed by the determinism apparently inherent to narrative structures. In Dickens’s fictional worlds, the present is not the simple consequence of the past and what happens is not only the necessary consequence of a sufficient cause. What happens is often without necessity and could as well not have happened. Such an event, when it was still only a possibility, competed with other unnecessary possibilities until chance decided its actualization. This contingent reality -- with its ethical, epistemological and ontological “payload” -- cannot be represented by the linear discourse of teleology. The representation of contingency demands the insertion of the real and the speculative in a narrative fabric woven out of virtual and actual developments and events. That is why, in Dickens’s novels, the unseen can be shown, silence can be eloquent, and what is in plain view can remain secret. Other possible stories always contribute to the plot. At various forks in the narrative, paths not taken could have led elsewhere. Hypothetical directions and indistinct emplotments define the narrative as powerfully as the developments that are pursued. iv To produce such a complex world of possibilities, Dickens not only refuses to rely upon a supposed mimetic quality of language, but he also contemplates the reality that he represents as a natural literary fact. He does not conceal his art. On the contrary, with an amazing fertility and inventiveness, he makes a lavish display of his capacity to play with language, with rhetorical flourish and with potential lines of emplotment. Everything that constitutes Dickens’s wild narrative economy is always on permanent display and is an inherent part of the pleasure procured for his readership. In the introduction, I discuss Dickens’s recourse to the hypothetical in its interaction with an important ideological conflict of his time -- the confrontation of the creationist teleology with the existential indeterminism of broadly Darwinian evolution theory. In the next three chapters, I address the function of the hypothetical in the incipits of David Copperfield, A Tale of Two Cities and The Mystery of Edwin Drood. I then examine how, by sustaining the epistemic anxiety generated in the incipit, the hypothetical propagates across the novel, raising questions without often answering them. I conclude that in Dickens’s last eight novels -- and, I suggest that this may also be the case in the modern novel in general -- the recourse to the hypothetical participates in the acquisition of a literary truth, because, after all, literature -- like science and philosophy -- is just another way to experiment with reality.

561	De l’accaparement des terres aux investissements agricoles internationaux responsables : la construction de l’acceptabilité sociale	"June 25, 2011, Kofi Annan, said « the problem of climate change, global food and nutrition security is the challenge of our time. » As forecasts estimate the world population will achieve nine billion in 2050, the question of how the world is to be fed is thrust into startling focus. In this context, the emerging phenomenon of international agricultural transactions is on the spot.  While the World Bank encourages agribusiness in developing countries, social movements denounce ""land grabbing"", with a total area of land that changed hands, estimated between 48.9 and 63.1 million hectares. The agricultural world is in crisis, and the subject of land grabbing has become a must in the media. This interdisciplinary research is intended to be exploratory and aims at identifying how the construction of the social acceptability of the agricultural industry at international level could be started, based on the representations of the actors of what is “unacceptable”.  Having identified the main issues of the agricultural world, the central question of the legitimacy of public decisions, that is to say decisions having a public scope, whether taken by private or public actors, will be addressed. Subsequently, a parallel will be drawn with the mining sector, which has been confronted for several years with the notion of ""social risk"", focusing in particular on hybrid regulatory instruments, which emerged in response to the crisis of legitimacy of the sector. The research will therefore concentrate on the process of homogenization of the judgment of social acceptability within the agricultural industry, analyzing the media coverage of the phenomenon, and reinforcing the analysis by semistructured interviews with different actors working in international NGOs, international organizations (such as the World Bank or the International Finance Corporation), a large multinational involved in mining, or responsible investment groups."

562	Étude sur l’expérience des relations amoureuses des jeunes hommes ayant vécu un premier épisode psychotique	This qualitative study aims at understanding the factors underlying the difficulties young men (18-35 years old) who had a first episode of psychosis have at initiating and maintaning intimate relationships. 12 participans took part to a semi-structured interview of 60 minutes. Four main themes have been identified following the data analysis : Coping with proximity, Conception of intimacy, Identity and Recovery process. Results suggest that difficultiess faced by this population could be related to previous relational experiences, metacogntives and emotional regulation deficits that apeared after the first episode, but more research is needed.

563	Anxiety, mood disorders and injection risk behaviors among cocaine users: results from the COSMO study	"Background and Objectives: Despite being common among cocaine users, mental health problems and their relationship with HIV and hepatitis C high risk injection behaviors are poorly documented. This study was undertaken to examine the relationships between mood and anxiety disorders and the sharing of drug injection equipment among cocaine users who inject drugs.  Methods: The sample was drawn from a prospective cohort study and comprises 387 participants. The outcome of interest was ""sharing injection material"" in the past three months. The presence of mood and anxiety disorders during the past year was assessed using the CIDI questionnaire. Statistical analyses were conducted on baseline data using logistic regression.   Results: Most participants were male (84.5%) and were aged 25 or over (92.2%); 43.0% qualified for an anxiety disorder diagnosis and 29.3% for a mood disorder diagnosis. Participants with anxiety disorders were more likely to share needles (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR): 2.13, 95%CI: 1.15-3.96) and other injection material (AOR: 1.81, 95%CI: 1.12-2.92). No significant association was found between mood disorders and sharing behaviors. Discussion and Conclusions: Primary anxiety disorders but not mood disorders increases injection risk behaviors among cocaine users. These results bring to light another negative outcome of mental health comorbidity in this vulnerable population.  Scientific Significance: This study underlines the need to fine-tune therapeutic approaches targeting specific mental health problems in individuals with cocaine use disorders. Longitudinal studies that assess impulsivity and other correlates of psychiatric disorders are needed to examine underlying mechanisms of high risk injection behaviors in comorbid populations."

564	"Sustained increases in skin blood flow are not a pre-requisite to initiate sweating during passive
heat exposure"	Some studies have observed a functional relationship between sweating and skin blood flow. However, the implications of this relationship during physiologically relevant conditions remain unclear. We manipulated sudomotor activity through changes in sweating efficiency to determine if parallel changes in vasomotor activity are observed. Eight young men completed two trials at 36°C and two trials at 42°C. During these trials, air temperature remained constant while ambient vapor pressure increased from 1.6 to 5.6 kPa over 2 h. Forced airflow across the skin was used to create conditions of high (HiSeff) or low (LoSeff) sweating efficiency. Local sweat rate (LSR), local skin blood flow (SkBF), as well as mean skin and esophageal temperatures were measured continuously. It took longer for LSR to increase during HiSeff at 36°C (HiSeff: 99 ± 11 vs. LoSeff: 77 ± 11 min, P < 0.01) and 42°C (HiSeff: 72 ± 16 vs. LoSeff: 51 ± 15 min, P < 0.01). In general, an increase in LSR preceded the increase in SkBF when expressed as ambient vapor pressure and time for all conditions (P < 0.05). However, both responses were activated at a similar change in mean body temperature (average across all trials, LSR: 0.26 ± 0.15 vs. SkBF: 0.30 ± 0.18°C, P = 0.26). These results demonstrate that altering the point at which LSR is initiated during heat exposure is paralleled by similar shifts for the increase in SkBF. However, local sweat production occurs before an increase in SkBF, suggesting that SkBF is not necessarily a prerequisite for sweating.

565	Les effets du fentanyl sur la douleur et la motricité suite à une hémorragie intracérébrale induite chez le rat	The pain associated with traumatic brain injury is linked with the central nervous system sensitization and chronic cephalalgia when pain is not treated. However, analgesics in human patient must be done with caution since they are associated with cognitive and motor deficits. The present study aims to assess the efficiency of fentanyl to treat pain and evaluate motor behaviors on a rat model of intracerebral hemorrhage (IH).   Twenty-one male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent a stereotaxic surgery to produce a collagenase-induced IH with an injection of 2 µL of colagenase (0.5 UI) in the right caudoputamen nucleus. The control group (n=6) received saline subcutaneously (SC), and experimental groups received either 5 (n=6), 10 (n=6), or 20 (n=3) µg/kg of fentanyl SC, 2h following surgery and on the 2 subsequent days. The rat grimace scale, a neurological examination, balance beam test and rotarod test were performed for 5 consecutive days postoperatively to evaluate pain and motor performance. At the end of the experimentation, the animals were euthanized, the brains were collected and evaluated to determine hematoma volume, the number of reactive astrocytes and necrotic neurons.  When compared to controls, the grimace scale has showed that 5 µg/kg fentanyl significantly alleviated pain on day 2 only (p<0.01) and that 10 µg/kg alleviated pain on days 1 (p<0.01), 2 (p<0.001), and 3 (p<0.01). For the rotarod test, only the 10 µg/kg group showed significant decreases in performance on days 5 (p<0.05) and 6 (p<0.02). The neurologic exam was not significantly different between groups, but only the hopping test showed a poor recuperation for the 5 and 10 µg/kg fentanyl group when compared to saline (p<0.01). During brains exams, no differences were found between groups for the results of the 3 parameters.  Fentanyl, at a dose of 10 µg/kg SC, has provided a substantial analgesia following a collagenase-induced intracerebral hemorrhage in rats; however it can alter motor performance following analgesic treatments.

566	Studies on the extra-neuronal cholinergic system in HIV-1 infection	Acetylcholine (ACh) is an important neurotransmitter produced in the nervous system. However, the molecule is also produced by non-neuronal cells in the body. CD4+ T cells, the main targets of HIV-1, produce it abundantly. ACh exerts its effects on cells via its nicotinic (n) and muscarinic (m) receptors that are expressed on both immune and non-immune cells in the body. ACh is well known to exert anti-inflammatory effects on immune cells. The main receptor that is indispensable for the anti-inflammatory effects of ACh is the α7 nicotinic receptor. Another molecule, secreted by activated T cells and by other cells is SLURP-1 (Secreted Ly6/uPAR-related Protein-1), which acts as an allosteric ligand for α7 and fine tunes the effects of ACh on T cells. Little is known as to how this extra-neuronal cholinergic system (ENCS) is regulated in HIV-infected individuals.  Our results show that the circulating levels of ACh and SLURP-1 do not change significantly in HIV-infected individuals, as compared to the circulating levels in healthy controls. Interestingly, higher levels of these soluble mediators were detected in HIV-infected long-term non-progressors (LTNP) who control the viral replication for more than seven years without any chemotherapy. It is tempting to speculate that the increase in levels of these two soluble mediators of the ENCS present in HIV-infected LTNPs may play a role in their ability to control HIV replication. The results from this study show that an α7 agonist decreased HIV replication, whereas a receptor antagonist increased its replication in vitro in human PHA blasts. Furthermore, hemicholinium (HC-3), a compound that inhibits the ability of the cells to produce ACh, by competing with their uptake of choline, increases the viral replication. The expression of the α7 receptor on peripheral blood CD4+ T cells, but not on monocytes, was significantly reduced (p<0.01) in HIV-infected individuals, and it was not fully restored by antiretroviral therapy (ART). Interestingly, the expression of the β2 adrenergic receptor was decreased significantly (p<0.01) on both monocytes and CD4+ T cells in HIV-infected individuals. These cells respond to norepinephrine via this receptor and secrete ACh.  Overall, the results of this study suggest that HIV causes significant modulation of different components of the ENCS in virus-infected individuals. This system could be manipulated to reduce viral replication and inflammation in these patients.	HIV , Acetylcholine , α7 nicotinic receptor , SLURP-1 , SLURP-1	en	19157.0
567	Sensibilité non-visuelle à la lumière et décalage du cycle éveil-sommeil	Problem: Some people suffer from having a delayed sleep schedule that they can’t modify to satisfy school/work requirements. These individuals suffer from sleep deprivation and sleepiness when they have to comply with a socially acceptable schedule. Despite its high prevalence, the etiology of a delayed schedule remains unknown.  Objective: This study aims to elucidate factors that might contribute to the maintenance of a delayed sleep schedule in young adults.  Methods: Fourteen young adults (8 women) complaining of delayed sleep schedule were compared to matched subjects with an adapted sleep schedule. Habitual bedtime (HB) was after midnight in all delayed subjects and before midnight in all adapted subjects. Subjects were admitted 5h before HB and kept in dim light for 6h. They were then exposed for 1.5h to blue light. Salivary melatonin and subjective sleepiness were assessed every 30 min. Melatonin suppression was used to measure circadian sensitivity to light. Dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) was used to estimate circadian phase.  Results: DLMO was later in the delayed than in the adapted group. There was no difference for melatonin suppression over the 1.5h of light exposure. However, in the delayed group, there was a significant correlation between DLMO and melatonin suppression. There was a smaller increase of subjective sleepiness in the delayed subjects than in the adapted subjects before HB.  Conclusions: Our results suggest that a delayed circadian phase, a slower build-up of sleep propensity and an enhanced circadian sensitivity to evening light contribute to the complaint of a delayed sleep schedule.

568	Développement et validation des ateliers d’éducation culinaire et nutritionnelle du projet VIE : Valorisation, Implication, Éducation	Context. Cancer is still the main cause of death by illness in children. Furthermore, two third of the survivors will present treatment-related late effects in adulthood. As it will be described in this thesis, the VIE program (Valorisation, Implication, Education) at the Sainte-Justine University Hospital Center aims to implement an intervention program to raise awareness of patients ongoing cancer treatments and their family to the benefits of adopting a healthy lifestyle and to support them with expected behavior change. One component of this program consists in nutrition and cooking education workshops. Objectives. The main objective of this project is to develop and validate a nutrition and cooking education workshop curriculum which will address concerns specific to on-treatment pediatric oncology patients and help prevent cardiometabolic late effects. A second objective is to develop an evaluation tool for the workshops. Methodology. The workshops’ themes, specific objectives and content have been subject to an eight-steps development and validation process, including steering committee consultation. The recipes in demonstration have been developed and standardized by two research staff registered dietitians and their nutritional value analyzed with a nutritional analysis software. Evaluation tools have been developed in accordance with the workshops learning objectives, inspired by existing tools and reviewed by expert. Results. Six nutrition and cooking education workshops based on scientific evidence and clinical experience of three pediatric oncology registered dietitians have been developed and validated. Twelve recipes related to the workshops themes, two for each workshop, have been developed, standardized and their nutritional value validated. Six questionnaires have been developed for each workshop to measure participants’ perception of knowledge acquisition, behavioral intention and satisfaction. Conclusion. It is, to our knowledge, the first nutrition and cooking education workshop curriculum elaborated specifically for families of an on-treatment pediatric oncology population. We think that this program will address the needs specific to pediatric oncology patients and their family, while contributing to raise awareness to the importance of adopting and maintaining healthy eating habits during and after cancer treatments.

569	L'Économie de communion : devoirs moraux et responsabilité sociale axée sur le relationnel dans l'entreprise	Within the liberal economy, a business model was born combining altruism and profit-seeking: the Economy of Communion. Through its social responsibility, this model adopts specific management strategies that try to put people at the center of the firm's activities. The aim of the paper is to present the Economy of Communion, its purpose and the various axes that support it, as well as its understanding of the interaction of the business world with ethics, values and law. In the light of the experience of 811 firms, the Economic of Communion acknowledges the efficiency of its management mode in terms of optimizing entrepreneurial performance. It emphasizes in particular an approach where economic dynamics are based on solidarity and fraternity.

570	L'interrelation entre la participation des usagers en santé mentale dans une activité institutionnelle et leur propre processus de rétablissement	This research seeks to better understand the interrelation between the participation of mental health services’ users in participative activities of a health establishment, offering psychiatrist services in Québec’s province, and their perspective of their recovery process. First, we determined the nature and the functioning of the activities in which the users were involved. Furthermore, we obtained the personal journey of each of the users according to their personal recovery process. Twelve adults receiving or having received mental health services from this establishment and having participated into institutional activities as participating patients were recruited through the participating patients’ mechanism.  The health establishment put in place this mechanism to select the individuals to be participating patients. Individual and semi-directed interviews were carried out with them.  Going back to mental health history in Québec’s province, we can notice that the users’ participation in organisational instances have greatly increased throughout the years. The recovery model in mental health has contributed in the change of paradigm. This qualitative and constructivist research has shown that the users have identified impacts of their participation. These impacts depend on their individual empowerment and include feeling appreciated by others, feeling gratified by the acknowledgement of the competencies, an increase of self-confidence and self-esteem, as well as a decrease of distress. Many have identified the acquisition of new competencies. With regards to regaining collective power, the development of new social roles and of mutual aid and the development of a sense of belonging were mentioned by the users interviewed. The recovery process dimensions were positively changed by the users’ participation were identity, hope, empowerment and the relationship with others.	psychiatrie , participation , mental health , psychiatry , recovery , experiental knowledge	en	19137.0
571	Être impulsif rend moins altruiste : une expérience avec les diamants mandarins	Reciprocal altruism, the most probable mechanism for cooperation among unrelated individuals, can be modelled as a Prisoner’s Dilemma. This game predicts that cooperation should evolve whenever the players, who expect to interact repeatedly, adopt conditional strategies. Yet, experimental data suggest that reciprocity would be rare in animal societies, maybe because animals, compared to humans, are very impulsive. Several studies examining the effect of impulsiveness on cooperation have indeed found a negative impact of temporal discounting. On the other hand, the role of impulsive action, another facet of impulsiveness, remains unexplored, though it could also impede cooperation by affecting the capacity of individuals to flexibly adjust their behaviour to their partner’s decision. To address this hypothesis, we conducted an experiment with zebra finches (Taenyopigia guttata) that were paired assortatively with respect to their level of impulsive action and then played an Alternating Prisoner’s Dilemma. As anticipated, we found that mutual cooperation occurred more frequently between self-controlled partners than between impulsive ones, a difference that was caused by differences in the strategy used by both types of individuals. Specifically, self-controlled individuals used a Generous TFT strategy, as predicted by theory, whereas impulsive birds chose to cooperate with a fixed probability, which was independent of their partner’s previous decision. If the inability of impulsive individuals to use reactive strategies are due to their reduced working memory capacity, our findings might contribute to explaining interspecific differences in cooperative behaviour.

572	L'identité professionnelle des infirmières comme source d'un travail gratuit et d'une obligation de disponibilité implicite	New organizational norms based on a model of flexibilisation of working hours have had a major impact on workers in recent years. An increasing focus on productivity and profitability can impose strong pressures on employees who are progressively changing their behaviour at work. Indeed, the increase of temporal availability imposed on workers is not always acknowledged by the employers. The distinction between work time and rest time has become more blurred and less clear than in the past. Moreover, temporal availability has become an expected but unrecognized behaviour used to measure motivation at work and employee engagement without any impact on employee classification or wages. The care sector is likely even more prone to this lack of recognition as its definitive core have historically been invisible.  Firstly, this research aims to shed light on manifestations of invisible work performed by nurses for the health and social services sector in Quebec. The unpaid work completed by the care professionals and the mandatory availability required of nurses to exceed their period of working time will be reviewed. Secondly, this research is seets to explain the role of professional identity in the performance of invisible work. The empirical data collected through ten interviews with nurses and clinical nurses working in the public sector in Quebec illustrated many manifestations of unpaid work and an implicit obligation of availability. Also, the data show that nurses' professional identity is actually linked to the supplemental work completed. However, its influence was emphasized by organisational failures affecting the quality of health services.

573	L’interaction entre l’opinion publique et la diplomatie françaises au moment de la guerre d’Indépendance américaine	As early as the battles of Lexington and Concord, April 19th 1775, the American War of Independence holds the attention in France of both French diplomats as well as French public opinion. Amongst both groups, we find elements trying to favour and prepare an official French intervention in this war.  The aim of this thesis is therefore to study the interaction that took place then between public opinion and diplomacy. The first chapter studies how public opinion created the opportune conditions for Beaumarchais’ intervention to the French government and the impact of this intervention. As for the second chapter, it is interested in the arguments put forward by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs – through its own newspaper, the Affaires de l’Angleterre et de l’Amérique – to convince and prepare public opinion to the intervention of France in the American War of Independence.

574	Trajectoires et subjectivités italo-québécoises : le processus identitaire de la deuxième génération tel que conçu par Marco Micone, Mary Melfi et Paul Tana	This thesis focuses on the process of identity formation of second generation Italo-Quebeckers during the second wave of migration. More precisely, it looks at the creative works of Marco Micone, Mary Melfi and Paul Tana in order to reveal certain aspects of identity that are contained in works of fiction. It is through their vision that it is possible to identify several narrative frames that underscore different migratory and settlement trajectories in Quebec. These visions also expose the challenge of the (re)definition of self in a modern and bilingual society.   Instead of defining a “global” identity, this thesis is more interested in the elements that shape, affect, and above all, put pressure on the (re)identification of this generation. Drawing upon the sources employed in this thesis, three main themes emerge as modelling elements of identity for the second generation of Italo-Québécois: the relationship to language(s), gender relations, and intergenerational dynamics. All these themes are explored by each of the creators, although in different ways. This reinforces the idea that it is impossible to talk about a common Italian-Québécois identity and that it is preferable to talk about Italian-Quebecois subjectivities. Ultimately, it is a matter of disclosing how literary and creative works encourage us to rethink the establishment of Italians in Quebec, as well as their vision of Quebec society.

575	Épandage de biosolides papetiers et de boues de chaux dans une plantation de peuplier hybride : effets sur la nutrition foliaire et la croissance	The use of fertilizing residual materials (FRM) in hybrid poplar (HP) plantations in Quebec could maximize yields and merchantable volumes. It would also have the advantage of minimizing the burial (landfill) or incineration of FRM. However, applications rates of FRM must be calibrated for an optimal response of the trees. The study was conducted in a PEH plantation in the Eastern Townships. An experimental design comprising two blocks (repetitions) of five plots - one control and four combinations of papermill biosolids and lime sludge - was established in fall 2012/spring 2013 and sampling was conducted three years later (summer 2015). The treatments represented the following application rates: 140 and 15 t ha-1 (wet), 140 and 30 t ha-1, 240 and 15 t ha-1 and 240 and 30 t ha-1 of biosolids and lime, respectively. Soil properties as well as morphology and nutrition of HP were evaluated. We observed a highly significant treatment effect on HP growth compared to untreated plots. The height of HP trees in the treated plots increased by 1.6 to 2 times, diameter by 2.5 to 4 times, leaf area by 3 to 8 times and the foliar weight by 2.7 to 9 times compared to the trees in the untreated plots. However, there was no significant difference among the various treatments. Foliar nutrition analyses showed that fertilization with FRM was sufficient to compensate for the low availability of nutrients in the soil. Thus, with FRM application, the macronutrients N, P, K and Ca in the leaves were within the optimal concentration ranges, whereas without FRM, the leaves showed concentrations below these thresholds. Despite the small differences observed among the four amendments, the treatment combining 240 t ha-1 of biosolids and 15 t ha-1 of lime was the one the closest to the optimal nutrition for HP. Papermill biosolids in combination with lime sludge provide very encouraging results in regard to foliar nutrition and yields of HP plantations.

576	Corps et érotisme dans l'oeuvre de Nelly Kaplan	This master’s thesis concentrates on the human body ; how it is perceived in the context of social, historical and political norms that shape it. The thesis focuses on the approach of Nelly Kaplan who introduces lifestyles where sexual and moral freedom reigns, to the delight of the protagonists featured in her work. This is accomplished through analysis of three significant works by Kaplan : a collection of short stories called Le Réservoir des sens ; the cult-movie La Fiancée du pirate ; and the narrative Un manteau de fou rire.  Kaplan attacks preconceived and historical prejudices about the male and female body through humour and irony, which leads to Kaplan questioning an outdated paradigm that is the binarity of sexual identities. Her creations are marked by the desire for liberation, which is expressed through an (erotic) revolt carried out by her characters. This act leads them to emancipate themselves from the petite bourgeoisie catholic ideal. Kaplan thus engages in the deconstruction of moral and political rules and proposes a new organization of the world based on respect for individual impulses and desires.

577	L'acte poétique guillevicien : de la paroi-poème au poète-paroi	This thesis is about three works from the french poet Eugène Guillevic : Terraqué, Sphère, Paroi. Through an approach that combines enunciative, pragmatic and thematic analyzes, this paper will attempt to highlight the fundamental role played by the wall (paroi) in the emergence of the poetic subject, as well as in the poetics of the author.  The postulation is that the wall is at the heart of Guillevic’s poetics and that it largely modulates the experience that the subject makes of reality. The wall is in every boundary – space, time and self to oneself – and it is, paradoxically, thanks to this “refusal that says yes” that writing on the invisible and intangible wall becomes possible and allows the poet to “live in poetry”.

578	Détermination du destin des nanoparticules d'argent dans les eaux usées et dans les biosolides en utilisant la microscopie en champ sombre et analyse hyperspectrale	Nanomaterials are a class of emerging and increasingly produced contaminants that are present in increasing concentrations. In complex environmental media, their detection is often complicated by interferences from environmental matrices. The objective of this work was to follow the fate of silver nanoparticles in the wastewaters using enhanced darkfield microscopy (EDM) coupled with hyperspectral imaging (HIS). When coupled with a pixel by pixel analysis, EDM can be used to screen for the presence of nanoparticles, and to locate, identify, and follow their fate in situ. Transformation kinetics of several different silver nanoparticles (40, 80 and 100 nm) with different coatings (citrate and polyvinylpyrrolidone) were analysed in complex media (wastewater, biosolids). Results demonstrated that when spiked into complex systems containing natural organic matter, certain nanoparticles were rapidly transformed (over a period of 2 hours), as shown by a shift in the wavelength attributed to their plasmonic resonance (450 to 570 nm) leading to a decrease in signal intensity of 95%. Based upon complementary results obtained by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and single particle inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (SP-ICP-MS), it was possible to attribute the changes not to particle aggregation or dissolution as much as a change in the nature of the particles due to the adsorption of organic matter on their surface. This memoir will show that the properties of the nanoparticles in complex systems are very different from those in simple systems.

579	L’utilisation de l’hallux par le jeune macaque rhésus transporté par sa mère et ses implications quant aux coûts de la bipédie humaine	The human hallux (more commonly called big toe) is now aligned with the other toes, which makes its opposition to other toes impossible. It has been proposed that the loss of opposability of the hallux in early hominins would have led to increase the energetic costs related to maternity, due to the obligation to carry juveniles actively (Tanner & Zihlman 1976; Wall-Sheffler 2007, Watson et al. 2008). This implies that Australopithecus afarensis juveniles had to be actively transported instead of grasping their mother's hair. My study proposes to test whether a juvenile primate needs its hallux to cling to the hair of its mother. The two hypotheses of this work are as follows: The abduction of the hallux is essential for the grasping of the hair of a carrier (usually the mother) by the young macaques and the abduction of the hallux is not necessary for the grasp of the hair of a carrier (usually the mother) by young macaques during transport. Videos of mother/child dyads of rhesus macaques are used in this study to evaluate the use of the hallux in juveniles being carried. The macaques are from a free-range colony in Cayo Santiago, Costa Rica, and they were filmed over a 5-month period. Results tend to support my hypothesis. Indeed, rhesus macaques are able to cling and maintain themselves on their mother during transport without using their hallux. It would, however, be necessary to supplement this study with further research in order to infer this type of behavior in A. afarensis.

580	Les comportements anti-organisationnels au travail : exploration de l’interaction entre la personnalité et l’environnement organisationnel perçu	Organizational deviance or counterproductive work behaviors are a subject of interest for work and organization psychologists. On the individual, organizational or economical levels, the impacts of these potentially destructive behaviors call the researchers to investigate. Specifically, this dissertation will address voluntary behaviors committed by organizational members that negatively impact the organization (hereafter AOWB for anti-organizational work behaviors). Henceforth, the focus is put on behaviors that directly target the organization rather than the behaviors that target its members or clients.  Previous studies having identified individual predictors of AOWB, like personality factors, and work environment factors, this dissertation aims to further investigate the domain by exploring possible moderating relations between those variables. As such, we will examine the possibility that some individual dispositions can not only enhance the risk that an individual commit those behaviors, but that personality could act as a moderator on the relationship between different organizational variable that have been identified as triggers for AOWB.  The first article of this dissertation propose a theoretical model integrating different mechanisms explaining AOWB. Agreeableness and conscientiousness personality factors are identified as individual predictors of AOWB. Organizational justice, perceived group norms regarding AOWB and control mechanism and opportunities are identified as organizational predictors of AOWB. Moreover, three interactions between personality dimensions and different organizational predictors are also suggested based on the review of the scientific documentation.    The second article presents the translation, adaptation and validation of an instrument measuring the AOWB. A four dimensions’ structure is found following an exploratory factorial analysis. Comparison of the dimensions found in the translated and adapted measure with the original instrument are discussed. Practical implications regarding the instrument for researchers and organizations are also discussed.  The main objective of third article is to test the direct relationships and moderating effects hypotheses presented in the theoretical model of the first article. Direct relationships between organizational justice and conscientiousness predicting AOWB were not supported event though the benefited from a large support from the previous scientific literature. Direct relationships between agreeableness, perceived group norms regarding AOWB, control mechanisms and opportunities as predictors of AOWB were supported. No moderating effect between personality and organizational variables could have been confirmed.  Finally, this dissertation proposes a theoretical model integrating different predictors of AOWB that act in complementarity to explain a larger portion of variance that any single predictor could explain. The presented multiple mechanisms that can trigger AOWB underline the complexity of the phenomenon. This results of this dissertation invite the researchers to pursue the investigation while keeping in mind that AOWB can not be explained by individuals, work group dynamics or organizational contexts separately, but by a composition of those variables.

581	Interactions interhémisphériques dans le contrôle du mouvement unilatéral	The execution of purely unilateral hand movements requires the recruitment of vast cortical and subcortical brain areas known as the non-mirroring network. This network counteracts the natural tendency of the brain, which tends to execute movements in a bilateral and synchronized manner.  Despite the efficacy of the non-mirroring network in restricting motor output to contralateral limbs, subtle mirroring can be observed in the inactive hand of healthy individuals when performing a unilateral task. This motor overflow needs to be inhibited through interhemispheric projections coursing through the corpus callosum (CC), the biggest white matter tract of the brain. This mechanism makes it possible for motor commands originating from the primary motor cortex (M1) to reach the contralateral hand performing an action via the corticospinal tract (CST). It has been suggested that the premotor cortex (PMC) is an important component of the non-mirroring network since its interference with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) enhances mirror activity in the inactive, mirror hand when a unilateral hand movement is performed. Indeed, modulation of parts of the non-mirroring network and interhemispheric projections can result in enhanced mirror movements (MM). It is not known whether specific interventions can decrease MM.    The clinical and methodological studies that compose the present thesis have two main objectives: (1) Determine whether transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) can be used to assess non-mirroring network function and reduce MM intensity in healthy individuals; (2) Characterize brain function and anatomy in two clinical populations presenting specific genetic mutations that affect the development of structures involved in the lateralization of movement (the CC and CST).    Article 1 provides a theoretical basis for the present essay through a review of the literature pertaining to interhemispheric interactions in the production of unilateral movements.      Article 2 shows that tDCS can be used to study the non-mirroring network since a bilateral stimulation protocol significantly increased the intensity of physiological MM (pMM) in healthy individuals. However, despite different stimulation protocols, it was not possible to reduce pMM.     In article 3, anatomical MRIs performed in individuals born without a CC revealed increases in cortical thickness in primary somatosensory (S1) and visual (V1) cortex, as well as in the hand representation of M1. Taken together, however, the data suggest that anatomical differences between acallosal patients and healthy participants are relatively subtle considering the size and function of the CC.    Article 4 showed that individuals presenting a mutation on the DCC gene display a phenotype similar to that of individuals presenting a mutation on the RAD51 gene. DCC mutations affect the crossing of the CST at the pyramidal level, resulting in a CST that projects to both hands simultaneously, causing congenital mirror movements (CMM). This pathological condition is accompanied by neurophysiological anomalies that include reduced interhemispheric inhibition (IHI).    In summary, the studies comprised in the present thesis significantly increase our knowledge of the specific brain structures that enable the proper lateralization of movements. It also describes novel methods that can be used to investigate the non-mirroring network.

582	Lengua y religión en la Castilla del siglo XIII : la Biblia E6/E8 y sus glosas	The investigation focuses on the prologues and glosses of the Castilian biblical versions contained in manuscript Escorial I.I.6 (Bible E6, 13th century) and Escorial I.I.8 (Bible E8, 14th century) from a contextualised exegetical perspective. The Bible E6 is the largest and the oldest translation of the Latin Vulgate to Castilian Romance. The two codices seem to be related because of their complementarity: E8 contains from Leviticus to Psalms and E6 contains from Proverbs to Revelation. E8 may be an uncompleted copy, linguistically updated, of a first volume of E6 that may have been lost. The tradition represented by E6/E8 stands out for referring to a Latin critical and textual basis that was the result of the integration to one of the multiple editions of the Paris Vulgate (12th century) of contributions from the manuscripts of the Hispanic tradition of the Latin Bible (Toletanus, Cavensis, Legionensis 2).  The first part of the thesis (chapters 1-4) introduces the Castilian translations of Judeo-Christian Scriptures of the 13th-15th centuries and describes the two versions as far as their critical, textual and linguistic characteristics are concerned. Moreover, it presents a hypothesis about the milieu from where the version arose, by relating it to Bishop Rodrigo Jiménez de Rada of Toledo and Bishop Juan de Soria of Burgos, and to Prince Felipe and Prince Sancho, sons of King Ferdinand III and future archbishops of Seville and Toledo. These considerations are followed by a historical and literary contextualization of the medieval tradition of glossing the Bible, by the description of the corpus and by a historical contextualization of the socio-political dynamics of the 13th century, encompassing the reigns of Ferdinand III (r. 1217-1252) and Alphonse X (r. 1252-1284), during the Reconquista and the consequent integration to Castile and León of significant minorities of Muslims and Jews. A special attention is dedicated to the beginnings of the problematics of the status of converted Jews and to the strategies of construction of the legitimacy of the dynastic authority through their artistic, literary and historiographic manifestations. Codex E6 as well gives evidence of an intent of contributing to the justification of monarchical power; such a preoccupation was shared also by the main representatives of the historiography of the time of Ferdinand III, the bishops Lucas de Tuy, Juan de Soria and Rodrigo Jiménez de Rada, Archbishop of Toledo and Primate of the Hispanic Church. As a matter of fact a few miniatures contained in the manuscript represent the sovereign by depicting him around the model of biblical King Solomon. Within this general overview the Castilian language and the Catholic religion exerted the function of axes for the articulation of a national identity of cultural nature around a coherent and long-term project called to deal with the diversified cultural characterizations of the population of the kingdom.  The second part of the investigation (chapters 5-8) focuses on the prologues to the biblical books and on the almost 500 glosses that accompany the text, with a special concern for the identification and transcription of the original sources. This material is then analysed from a contextualised exegetical perspective in order to determine its relationship with the problematics that were present in the society of Castile and León during its process of expansion and definition, where religion played an indisputable socialising role. This kind of approach constitutes the original contribution of this research to the advancement of knowledge of Medieval Castilian Bibles and their function within the wider social, religious, historical and political context that was surrounding the endeavour of translating the Judaeo-Christian Scriptures.     As far as the glosses are concerned, almost 300 are located in the New Testament –significantly concentrated in the Pauline epistles that deal with the relationship between Christians of Greek and Jewish origin (1-2 Corinthians, Galatians)– around 100 are in the Psalms and the remaining ones in the other books of the Hebrew Scriptures. Their main sources are the Historia Scholastica of Peter Comestor (12th century) for E8, the Collectanea of Peter Lombard (12th century) for the New Testament of E6, the Postillae of Hugh of Saint-Cher (around 1230) for Ezekiel in E6 and a few Hispanic rabbinic commentaries from the 11th-12th centuries for the Palms of E8. Some of the glosses of the Psalter may be the result of a work of harmonisation between those rabbinic texts and may allow as well an indirect access to the exegetical endeavour of Rabbi Moses ha-Cohen ben Giktilla (11th century) from Córdoba, which has mainly been lost today in its Hebrew and Arabic originals. The glosses and prologues of E6 and E8 give evidence of an aware intent of selection and edition.  The themes that are tackled by the glosses show a consistent relationship with the exigencies of the politics of the kings of Castile and León and with issues that were affecting the life of the Church. More specifically, the translation might have been directed to the formation of clergy in order to provide not only religious instruction to the Catholic people, but also a tool for the catechism of converted Jews, while promoting their reception into the wider social Christian community. The glosses provide as well tools for the preaching activity oriented to strive against the influence of the Albigenses and other heterodox movements that had small centres in the kingdom. As a matter of fact, both theology and the Castilian legislation held as a reference the idea of the imminent conversion of the Jews to Christ –inherited from Saint Paul and Saint Augustin– to be realised near the end of times. Therefore, this version of the Scriptures very well fits as part of an aware theological and socio-political process oriented towards the long-term. The realisation of a Bible in Romance was also coherent with the remarkable increase of the proportion of documents in Castilian issued by the Royal Chancellery during the reign of Ferdinand III, if compared to Latin (from 7% to 60%), which reached its full development during the reign of Alphonse X. Such an endeavour corresponded as well to the preoccupations of the Church that since IV Lateran Council (1215) had been adopting radical measures in order to improve the insufficient level of preparation of the clergy. Within this perspective, the tradition represented by E6 and E8 stands out as a witness of the theological, ecclesiastical, social and political dynamics of Castile and León during the 13th century.

583	Le pluralisme des systèmes juridiques et les perceptions de la justice : une ethnographie des conflits matrimoniaux chez les Mossi de Koudougou, Burkina Faso	This thesis aims to contribute to the development of empirical knowledge in the scientific fields of legal anthropology and the study of kinship in Burkina Faso. More to the point, it focuses on the understanding of the consequences of legal pluralism in matrimonial dispute cases among the Mossi society in Koudougou, the country’s third most populous city. Marriage is a social indicator and a fundamental institution which allows the reconstruction of the social organization and kinship systems, a process which highlights the transversal effect of customary justice. This situation of legal pluralism induces the creation of processes such as innovation, resistance and legal interbreeding. It engenders a phenomenon of forum shopping, whereby social actors navigate through a multiplicity of tactics, among several legal orders, and is being analyzed through the lens of the perception of justice concept.

584	Repenser le droit de marque : essai sur une approche fonctionnelle des marques dans l’économie globale et numérique	Rethinking Trademark Rights: An Essay on a Functional Approach to Marks in a Global and Digital Economy – Trademarks, one of the oldest social institutions, rose to a unique standing in the 20th century to become the symbol of modern globalization as well as a means of expression and activism. Since the 1920s, the evolution of the function of marks and trademark rights is discussed. Rights holders sought to extend their protection beyond the initial boundaries to include the marketing concept of brand through erroneous language and rhetoric of property, ownership and theft. Such propositions have disrupted the fragile and dynamic equilibrium between commercial interests and civil liberties. Looking at History, Semiotics and Marketing, I argue that brands gained prominence, but took off from trademarks. The rationale for the latter and for trademark rights is still fundamentally rooted in the referential function to a source. The protection and the legal construction of trademark rights should only revolve around such a function. I therefore propose to recast trademarks’ legal framework upon this function of origin. Redelineating the concept of “mark” through a functional approach will align the law with the diversity and versatility of trademarks in modern societies: whatever serves a referential purpose should amount to a mark. This will notably offer a coherent scheme to include holograms or domain names, among future and unknown new means of reference. This functional approach will also refocus mark rights on the standard of public confusion. I argue that the law should deviate from the standard of use, and understand marks out of the trade sphere. This rationale would offer a stringent but flexible framework that addresses issues of freedom of expression as well as those arising out of the digital world, e.g. advertisement and hashtags.

585	High methylmercury in Arctic and subarctic ponds is related to nutrient levels in the warming eastern Canadian Arctic	Permafrost thaw ponds are ubiquitous in the eastern Canadian Arctic, yet little information exists on their potential as sources of methylmercury (MeHg) to freshwaters. They are microbially active and conducive to methylation of inorganic mercury, and are also affected by Arctic warming. This multiyear study investigated thaw ponds in a discontinuous permafrost region in the Subarctic taiga (Kuujjuarapik-Whapmagoostui, QC) and a continuous permafrost region in the Arctic tundra (Bylot Island, NU). MeHg concentrations in thaw ponds were well above levels measured in most freshwater ecosystems in the Canadian Arctic (>0.1 ng L−1). On Bylot, ice-wedge trough ponds showed significantly higher MeHg (0.3−2.2 ng L−1) than polygonal ponds (0.1−0.3 ng L−1) or lakes (<0.1 ng L−1). High MeHg was measured in the bottom waters of Subarctic thaw ponds near Kuujjuarapik (0.1−3.1 ng L−1). High water MeHg concentrations in thaw ponds were strongly correlated with variables associated with high inputs of organic matter (DOC, a320, Fe), nutrients (TP, TN), and microbial activity (dissolved CO2 and CH4). Thawing permafrost due to Arctic warming will continue to release nutrients and organic carbon into these systems and increase ponding in some regions, likely stimulating higher water concentrations of MeHg. Greater hydrological connectivity from permafrost thawing may potentially increase transport of MeHg from thaw ponds to neighboring aquatic ecosystems.

586	Le visuel et le sonore en matière de composition musicale : un rapport homologue	Is it possible to treat visual material, in particular theatre, physical gestures, video and dance, as an equal element to sound in musical composition? What strategies are available to us to incorporate, in a relevant way, image and sound? What does the interaction between sound and visual material in the creation and the performance of a musical piece imply? Guided by these questions, I composed seven pieces as part of my Masters, between September 2014 and August 2016. This paper describes the main stages of these pieces and their composition process, which aimed to find solutions and strategies for a homologous relationship between the visual and the sound in the process of musical creation. The first chapter draws a portrait of artists and composers who worked on the relationship between sound and visual. Some strategies of these composers were used during the process of creating a musical composition capable of integrating the visual as an essential element. The second chapter presents the pieces which I have investigated the link between music and video, gesture and dance. The third chapter addresses a series of four pieces composed for the purpose of expressing, through the relation between music and staging, issues related to our daily life. Finally, the last chapter presents conclusions that emerged as a result of my writing process and, in some cases as a result of the performance of the parts.

587	Impact of Nutrient Restriction on the Structure of Listeria monocytogenes Biofilm Grown in a Microfluidic System	Biofilm formation by the pathogen Listeria monocytogenes is a major concern in       food industries. The aim of this work was to elucidate the effect of nutrient       limitation on both biofilm architecture and on the viability of the bacteria in       microfluidic growth conditions. Biofilm formation by two L. monocytogenes strains       was performed in a rich medium (BHI) and in a 10-fold diluted BHI (BHI/10) at 30        degrees C for 24 h by using both static conditions and the microfluidic system       Bioflux. In dynamic conditions, biofilms grown in rich and poor medium showed       significant differences as well in structure and in the resulting biovolume. In       BHI/10, biofilm was organized in a knitted network where cells formed long       chains, whereas in the rich medium, the observed structure was homogeneous       cellular multilayers. Biofilm biovolume production in BHI/10 was significantly       higher than in BHI in these dynamic conditions. Interestingly, biovolume of dead        cells in biofilms formed under limited nutrient conditions (BHI/10) was       significantly higher than in biofilms formed in the BHI medium. In the other       hand, in static conditions, biofilm is organized in a multilayer cells and       dispersed cells in a rich medium BHI and poor medium BHI/10 respectively. There       was significantly more biomass in the rich medium compared to BHI/10 but no       difference was noted in the dead/damaged subpopulation showing how L.       monocytogenes biofilm could be affected by the growth conditions. This work       demonstrated that nutrient concentration affects biofilm structure and the       proportion of dead cells in biofilms under microfluidic condition. Our study also       showed that limited nutrients play an important role in the structural stability        of L. monocytogenes biofilm by enhancing cell death and liberating extracellular        DNA.

588	Le retour en collectivité d’ex-détenus aînés présentant des problèmes de consommation d’alcool : défis et réflexions sur le plan de l’intervention	The aging of the prison population is an occurring reality. In the past few years, several studies have attempted to better understand this phenomenon in order to suggest solutions to adapt the prison facilities. Nonetheless, only a few of the researchers took interest at elderly inmates returning into the community. This reality is increasingly present and will represent many challenges from an intervention perspective. This internship report is therefore interested in better understanding the reality of former inmates with alcohol problems returning to the community. The objective is to begin a reflection on adapted and supportive intervention options. In order to do that, an 80 days internship was completed at CRC Beauce. More specifically, we conducted semi-structured interviews with five senior residents of the center, performed an analysis of their records, as well as a complete individual follow-up and in situ observations. These analyzes have enabled us to demonstrate that this group is experiencing several difficulties during their return to the community on various levels, such as health, employment, social network and finances. In addition, it was found that these difficulties have an impact on their stay at the CRC. Finally, facing this specific population's reality, we've brought forward the challenges that emerged to us on the intervention level and we started a thorough reflexion process on the type of interventions who needed to be made in priority. For that being done, general and specific clinical recommendations have been identified.

589	Le rôle des déceptions dans « À la recherche du temps perdu » de Marcel Proust. Autofiction, crise du sujet et montage identitaire	“Remembrance of things past“ tells tales of learning for the proustian narrator on his way to becoming a literary figure, a path fraught with much deceit that will steer its hero towards nihilism. Such will be the case until the very end of “Time Regained“. Proustian deceit will be examined first through the filter of the character’s literary education, then from an autofiction angle. Indeed, deceit takes the narrator through a crisis of the subject, the only way out of which is through “autofiction“, a new literary process whose name took a few decades to coin. What one could describe as “proustian autofiction“ also leads the author to yet another concept we call “establishing identities“, in keeping with the research of Sophie-Jan Arrien and Jean-Pierre Sirois-Trahan on the development of identities, and based on Anne Henry’s recently published essay, “The Temptation of Marcel Proust“.

590	"Extended-spectrum β-lactamase, carbapenemase, and the mcr-1 gene: Is there a historical
link?"	The plasmid mediated mcr-1 gene encoding for Enterobacteriaceae colistin resistance has been recently identified across five continents. The objective of the present study was to trace historical events concerning the discovery and emergence of the mcr-1 gene along with ESBL and carbapenemase genes since several studies have reported identifying mcr-1 genes among Extended-Spectrum β-Lactamases (ESBL) and/or carbapenemase producing Escherichia coli. A retrospective study reported the identification of the mcr-1 gene in E. coli strains isolated in the 1980s, and this seems to correspond to the first identification of ESBL enzymes. The first discovery of the New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) in 2009 was associated with a significant increase in mcr-1 gene prevalence in E. coli strains obtained from food producing animals. We noticed that a historical link has existed between mcr-1, ESBL and carbapenemase genes since the 1980s, and we believe that the re-evaluation of colistin use in livestock needs an overall approach that includes not only colistin use reduction but also the reduction of all antibiotic use.

591	Dynamics of viral distribution in a defined swine production network using enteric viruses as molecular markers	Modern swine production systems represent complex and dynamic networks involving numerous stakeholders. For instance, livestock transporters carry live animals between fattening sites, abattoirs, and other premises on a daily basis. This interconnected system may increase the risk of microbial spread within and between networks, although little information is available in that regard. In the present study, a swine network composed of 10 finishing farms, one abattoir, and three types of stakeholders (veterinarians, livestock transporters, and nutritional technicians) in Quebec, Canada, was selected to investigate specific vectors and reservoirs of enteric viruses. Environmental samples were collected from the premises over a 12- month period. Samples were screened using targeted reverse transcription-PCR and sequencing of two selected viral markers, group A rotaviruses (RVA) and porcine astroviruses (PoAstV), both prevalent and genetically heterogeneous swine enteric viruses. The results revealed frequent contamination of farm sites (21.4 to 100%), livestock transporter vehicles (30.6 to 68.8%) and, most importantly, the abattoir yard (46.7 to 94.1%), depending on the sample types. Although high levels of strain diversity for both viruses were found, identical PoAstV and RVA strains were detected in specific samples from farms, the abattoir yard, and the livestock transporter vehicle, suggesting interconnections between these premises and transporters. Overall, the results from this study underscore the potential role of abattoirs and livestock transport as a reservoir and transmission route for enteric viruses within and between animal production networks, respectively.

592	Dual infections of CD163 expressing NPTr epithelial cells with influenza A virus and  PRRSV	In the pig, respiratory co-infections involving various pathogens are far more frequent than single infections. Amongst respiratory viruses, swine influenza type A virus (swIAV) and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) are frequently associated. Previously, we performed co-infections with swIAV and PRRSV in porcine alveolar macrophages (PAM) and precision cut lung slices (PCLS). With these two approaches it was practically impossible to have co-infections of the same cells as the main target cell of swIAV is the epithelial cell while the main target of PRRSV is the PAM. This constraint makes the study of interference between the two viruses difficult at the cellular level. In the current report, an epithelial cell line expressing, CD163, the main receptor of PRRSV was generated. This cell line receptive for both viruses was used to assess the interference between the two viruses. Results showed that swIAV as well as PRRSV, even if they interacted differently with the modified epithelial cells, were clearly interfering with each other regarding their replication when they infected a same cell with consequences within the cellular antiviral response. Our modified cell line, receptive to both viruses, can be used as a tool to assess interference between swIAV and PRRSV in a same cell as it probably happens in the porcine host.

593	Postvaccinal reovirus infection with high mortality in breeder chicks	A broiler breeder flock was subcutaneously vaccinated at the hatchery with a live avian orthoreovirus (ARV) vaccine against viral arthritis. Chicks began to die at 3 days of age and postmortem examination revealed massive subcutaneous hemorrhages and edema on the dorsal aspect of the neck at the site of vaccination, a severe necrotic hepatitis, and pulmonary edema. Microscopically, the main lesion was a multifocal vacuolar degeneration and necrosis of randomly distributed small groups of hepatocytes with presence of apoptotic and multinucleated syncytial cells. Necrotic foci were also found in the lungs as well as a hemorrhagic, granulomatous, and heterophilic cellulitis and myositis of the neck and a generalized depletion and lymphocytolysis of lymphoid organs. At 8 days of age, birds also began to show hock swelling histologically characterized by a fibrinoleucocytic inflammation of the articulation and tendon sheaths, with hyperplasia of the synovial membrane, and lymphoplasmocytic infiltration. PCR and viral culture of livers were positive for ARV. Partial sequencing of the S1 gene from the virus isolate showed 99.2% to 99.8% homology with three vaccinal strains (ARV S1133, 1733, and 2408). Viral particles compatible with reovirus virions were observed at transmission electron microscopy. Investigation at the hatchery revealed that chicks were inadvertently administered an S1133 reovirus vaccine labeled for water administration in 10- to 17-week-old chickens. This human error is most likely the reason for this unusually severe viremic reovirus infection that affected this flock at such an early age.

594	Quality of Physiotherapy Services for Injured Workers Compensated by Workers' Compensation in Quebec: A Focus Group Study of Physiotherapy Professionals	Musculoskeletal disorders are among the leading causes of work-related physical disability in the province of Quebec in Canada. The authors conducted a focus group study with physiotherapists and physical rehabilitation therapists working with patients whose treatments are compensated by the Quebec Workers’ Compensation Board with the goal of exploring quality of care and ethical issues. Three main themes were identified: (1) systemic factors, (2) complexity in treatment decisions and (3) inequality of care. Although physiotherapy professionals strive to give these patients the best possible care, patients might not always be provided with optimal or equal treatment. When compared with other patients, there appear to be differences with respect to access to care and types of services offered to injured workers, raising equity concerns. Factors that shape and constrain quality of physiotherapy services for injured workers need to be addressed to improve care for these patients.	ethics , quality of care , physiotherapy , Quebec , injured workers , workers' compensation	en	18939.0
595	Mise à l’essai d’une intervention éducationnelle visant à optimiser l’utilisation des mesures de prévention de la déhiscence sternale à la suite d’une chirurgie cardiaque	Introduction: Sternal dehiscence is the most common wound complication of cardiac surgery via sternotomy. Although its incidence varies between 0.2 and 0.5%, sternal dehiscence can lead to dangerous complications that can cause death. In the literature, authors, most of whom are physiotherapists, present different measures for preventing sternal dehiscence, like thoracic support vests and sternal precautions. However, there is no consensus on any of those measures. This document is a report of an internship held in an ultra-specialized heart institute between July and December 2016, to develop and test, with nurses, medical orderlies and patients, an educational intervention aimed at optimizing the use of measures to prevent sternal dehiscence in patients following cardiac surgery. Method: During the internship, theoretical training capsules on sternal dehiscence and its preventive measures were developed and offered to the nursing staff and patients through a variety of educational tools. Coaching sessions related to postoperative mobilization methods were also offered to the nursing staff. A thoracic support vest was introduced for patients at high risk of sternal dehiscence. Results: The training capsules as well as the coaching were well received by the patients and the nursing staff, and managed to promote knowledge on the sternal dehiscence and its preventive measures.  The educational tools could serve as guides for postoperative mobilization methods.

In addition to analyzing three orchestral and choral pieces, this thesis first addresses the notion of character, and its role in my music. It also discusses the way I use motives in my composition for purposes of unity. It then offers a few alternatives to classical tonality, which assure tonal attraction in my pieces, such as pandiatonicism, chords progressions by common notes, enrichment of tonal progressions by addition of color notes to chords, and the combined use of these different techniques.	orchestra , character , choir , continuity , unity , tonality , wind orchestra	en	18919.0

toujours efficace?"	The construction hypothec is the main mechanism for the protection of the claims of every participant in the construction industry. With the adoption of this legal regime, the Quebec legislator tried to protect the economic integrity of this industry. However, the use of notions more or less efficient for the execution of this legal regime, the increase of contractual mechanisms which avoid the application of the legal regime and legal dispositions which protect the owners harm the efficiency of the legal regime to correctly protect subcontractor's claims. Nevertheless, some correctives can be found to restore the legal regime's equity. Moreover, when a immoveable is owned by the State or any of its agents, it is practically impossible for a subcontractor to exercise his hypothecary rights because of the State's privileges and immunities. The property appropriated to public utility of the legal persons established in the public interest which are not agents of the State enjoy also a strong protection, particularly in the municipal sector. In any case, it is rendering illusory the exercise by a subcontractors of any of his hypothecary rights despite the fact that the legislator's goal, by maintaining this legal regime, was precisely to protect their claims.

This physiological anemia is more severe in neonates admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), who frequently require a red blood cells (RBC) transfusion. In neonatal medicine, the indications for transfusion are controversial and practices are highly variable. To better understand those practices, we conducted the prospective study: «Epidemiology and determinants of red blood cells transfusion in a neonatal intensive care unit: a cohort study». Among the patients consecutively admitted to NICU during the study period, 13.4% received at least one RBC transfusion. Although premature babies born at less than 28 weeks gestation received the majority of transfusions (62.2%), term neonates admitted to NICU were also frequently transfused (4.9% of transfusions). The main justifications for giving a RBC transfusion were: low Hb level, underlying illness and to improve oxygen delivery. We also observed a wide range of Hb thresholds that triggered a decision to transfuse (from 62 to 137 g/L). The multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), which is defined as the simultaneous dysfunction of at least two organs or systems, is highly associated with mortality and morbidity in critically ill children. The association between MODS and transfusions is also well described in this population. Two sets of criteria of pediatric MODS are currently used in the medical literature: one by Proulx, and another by Goldstein. We did the prospective cohort study «Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome in critically ill children : clinical value of two lists of diagnostic criteria» to validate and compare the diagnostic value of those two definitions of MODS. We observed that the epidemiology of MODS varies according to which list of criteria is used: the incidence was 21.4% vs. 37.3% with Proulx and Goldstein criteria, respectively. Both sets of criteria have a good inter- and intra-rater reproducibility. The diagnostic of MODS according to Proulx criteria is associated with higher 90-days mortality (17.8% vs. 11.5%, p = 0.038). MODS is also described in neonates, using a score adapted to this population, the NEOMOD. Neonatal MODS represents an interesting outcome measure in clinical trials in neonatal transfusion medicine. However, prior to that, it needs to be better characterized.

599	Évaluation des facteurs influençant l’évolution clinique et l’utilisation des ressources au cours de l’hospitalisation aigue suivant une tétraplégie traumatique et leurs impacts sur la récupération fonctionnelle six mois post-lésion	Introduction and objectives: The occurrence of a spinal cord injury (SCI) causing tetraplegia is a tragic event leading to devastating consequences on the life of individuals and huge costs to our healthcare system.  Individuals who experience a traumatic SCI (TSCI) with tetraplegia require several weeks of hospitalisation in an acute care center where they are at risk of various medical complications. While factors related to the initial trauma or to the patient’s baseline characteristics are recognized to determine their clinical outcome, the impact of the perioperative management following a TSCI is still unclear. Thus, the main objective of this study is to identify factors influencing the course of acute care hospitalization in terms of clinical outcome and use of hospital resources following acute tetraplegia. Then, in order to determine clinical relevance of these factors in longer-term outcome of patients, the second objective of this project is to determine if these factors also have an impact on the functional recovery six months post injury.   Methods and results: A retrospective cohort study in a single level-1 trauma center specialized in SCI care, and a predictive prospective study were completed. Early admission to a specialized SCI center and a decreased incidence of medical complications during acute care hospitalization were found to significantly improve clinical outcomes and decrease resource utilization during acute care. Higher occurrence of medical complications and longer acute care length of stay were significant predictors of lower functional recovery (as measured by the Spinal Cord Independence Measure six-months post injury).  Conclusions: Optimization of acute care hospitalization in a specialized center may improve clinical outcomes and decrease hospital resource utilization following acute tetraplegia and thereby have a positive impact on the 6-month functional recovery. Early admission and complete perioperative management in a specialized SCI center is thus recommended following tetraplegia. This could also reduce the economic burden on our healthcare system.   Clinical applications and future directions: By highlighting the importance of high-quality care following acute SCI, this study supports current recommendations suggesting prompt transfer to a specialized acute care center following tetraplegia. Acute care management focussing on the early prevention of medical complications and optimization of recovery should be provided as early as possible following tetraplegia. Future projects working towards development of precise clinical and administrative protocols for acute SCI care will help to better regulate and define the importance of specialized centers, and to promote knowledge transfer.

600	La prévention et la réduction des problèmes liés à la consommation de substances psychoactives par une intervention brève ciblée à la personnalité chez les adolescents présentant des problèmes de santé mentale	Background: In adolescents, mental health disorders frequently co-occurs with substance misuse, a dual diagnosis that tends to complicate the patient’s treatment and prognosis, resulting in astounding costs for society. Thus, it is critical to investigate how to prevent and reduce substance use problems in this population and optimize their global treatment. According to recent literature and to health provincial and federal governments’ priorities, an integrated services approach has been identified as the strategy to favour. In three randomised-controlled trials, brief personality-targeted interventions have shown to be effective in preventing adolescent onset and growth of drinking, binge-drinking and drinking problems. The personality profiles targeted (Hopelessness/Negative thinking, Impulsivity, Anxiety-Sensitivity, Sensation Seeking) play an important role in the onset and development of both substance misuse and psychiatric symptoms. In this thesis, we hypothesized that brief personality-targeted interventions aiming to prevent and reduce substance misuse in a high-risk population would also benefit a psychiatric clinical sample of adolescents.  Methods: To test this hypothesis, 2 studies were conducted as part of this thesis. In the first one, data from an existing sample of adolescents from a school cohort were analysed to determine if among these students, those at high risk of alcohol misuse and presenting with psychiatric symptoms could benefit from this brief intervention. The same intervention was then delivered to a clinical sample of adolescents; this second study was conducted in a psychiatric department in a hospital setting. Results: The first study showed that the intervention was as effective regardless of whether the adolescents reported depression and anxiety symptoms; these symptoms did not moderate the intervention effects on substance misuse and associated problems. However, reporting hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms and conduct problems did significantly moderate the intervention effects on some drinking outcomes, showing mainly more beneficial intervention effects in adolescents reporting higher levels of externalizing symptoms.  In the second study, no significant intervention effects were found regarding substance use and psychiatric symptoms outcomes. Adolescents who received the intervention significantly had higher rates of follow-up compared to those who did not receive the intervention (p =0,003).  Conclusion: The first study is promising regarding the applicability of the intervention with adolescents with psychiatric disorders’ symptoms. In that sense, the lack of significant findings in the second study could potentially be explained by attrition and small sample size at follow-up and therefore to the statistical limits encountered. It is also possible that the intervention as delivered did not address the issues specific to this clinical population in enough depth.  Nevertheless, it was observed that the evaluation and organization of patient care did not simultaneously include support for patients’ substance use or associated problems. The coordination between treatment and research should be optimized, not only to support the stated mission of governments to harmonize these two dimensions, but also to follow their recommendations as to the need to prioritize the integration of care for patients with comorbid disorders.

601	Implantation du processus de soins en nutrition	Problem: In Quebec, the use of the Nutrition Care Process (NCP) is limited, organizations apprehend its implantation will be arduous but are motivated to proceed. Objective: To accompany two clinical nutrition services of health facilities in the greater Montreal area in the deployment of the NCP and document the barriers and facilitating factors. Methodology: The Hôpital du Sacré-Cœur de Montréal and the CSSS Champlain–Charles-Le Moyne were recruited. Data collection was accomplished through accompanying sessions throughout the deployment of the NCP. An end of project meeting was held in each area, with nutritionists and heads of departments. The data collected is qualitative. The exchanges were recorded and a logbook was completed. The synthesis was written using a change management model. Results: A total of 18 accompanying sessions were held and five end of project meetings were held. The main obstacles to the implementation of the NCP are largely related to the commitment of nutritionists, training and time constraints. The main facilitating factors are the presentations of case studies with discussion and the manual of the International Dietetics and Nutrition Terminology (IDNT). Discussion: Our health system is increasingly subject to change and leaders will need to optimize resources. The International Confederation of Dietetic Associations suggested adopting the NCP as an international framework for the profession. Implementation strategies for organizational change management principles will facilitate the integration of these important changes. The experience of the two documented environments will be enlightening for other organizations wishing to implement the NCP.

602	Au menu : ma santé mentale : la santé mentale des travailleurs et travailleuses de la restauration : test du modèle demande-contrôle-soutien de Karasek et Theorell	This study investigated how the work conditions of the restoration industry in Canada may explain the level of psychological distress and the level of positive mental health of their employees. The Job Demand Control Support (Karasek et Theorell, 1990) claims that the combination of strong psychological and physical demands, low decision latitude and low social support in the work environment can affect negatively the psychological mental health of employees. But some adjustments were conducted to fit with this industry (ex: we separate the social support of the collegues and supervisor). Linear regression analyses were conducted to see how working conditions specific to the restaurant sector can affect the mental health of these employees. We took data collected from Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS), where a mental health component was added as of 2012 and a component of work stress was added too. By controlling for the individual and family characteristics, as well as lifestyle habits the psychological high efforts and collegues social support were significantly associated to the both mental health outcomes. The supervisor social support had no effect on both outcomes. All the other aspects of work examined (the physical high efforts, low decision latitude, part time work and insecurity of work) were associates at one or other of these outcomes. These results indicate that these two indicators of mental health are two dinstict phenomenons. This study finishes with the discussion and the limits of this study.

603	Réflexions sur la religion invisible : le développement personnel vu par la sociologie des religions	My master thesis focuses on personal development. Drawing on the sociology of religion put forward by Thomas Luckmann in his book The Invisible Religion (1970 [1967]), I understand personal development as a “new” social form of religion. In this book, the sociologist argues that religion has become, in modern societies, a quest for existential meaning driven by the theme of self-realization. Defining religion as a system of meanings and linking its contemporary form to self-realization, Luckmann’s approach allows for the development of a theoretical framework that apprehends personal development as one manifestation of the “invisible religion.” Because it is not be perceived as religion, contemporary religion would be—according to Luckmann—be invisible. Not being tied to any official religious institution, the new form of religion would manifest itself in the private sphere. In my thesis, I question the ubiquity of personal development in the contemporary world in terms of its visibility/invisibility.      The present thesis is an empirical study on personal development; it aims to make visible one invisible manifestation of religion in our lives. To this end, I develop a method that enables to identify its presence in the contemporary world. After a review of the literature on personal development in the first chapter, I present in my second chapter Luckmann’s book and the questions at the heart of the thesis. In the third chapter, I discuss the method used to capture a contemporary manifestation of religion, a discourse analysis. In the fourth chapter, I seek to uncover the knowledge paradigms of the personal development, often associated with the field of non-religious, by reading a selection of books from this literature : Le chemin le moins fréquenté (1987 [1978]), Écoute ton corps (1991 [1987]), Les quatre accords Toltèques (1999 [1997]) et Le secret (2007 [2006]). After delineating their “meaning system of personal development”, I dedicate myself, in the fifth chapter, to highlight the invisible religion in a “visible” one; a group whose members consider religious, the Raelian Movement. For this purpose, I undertake to a second discourse analysis with sources published by the Movement: La méditation sensuelle (1980), Le Message donné par les Extra-Terrestres (1997) et Le Maitraya: extraits de son enseignement (2003). In doing so, I assess the place of the invisible religion in contexts that are specifically perceived as non-religious and religious. I conclude my thesis by addressing issues related to the visibility of religion and, based on my results, suggest new research perspectives for the sociology of religion.

604	Fragmentation et stagnation : enjeux de mobilisation du mouvement LGBTIQ aux Philippines	This Master’s thesis investigates the development of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans, Intersex and Queer (LGBTIQ) movement in the Philippines from the fall of Ferdinand Marcos’ dictatorship in 1986 to the present moment. Since then, the LGBTIQ movement has developed rapidly. It was among the first in Southeast Asia to organise a Pride March and to constitute an LGBTIQ political party. However, despite this dynamism, LGBTIQ communities are still discriminated in the workspace, schools, and the healthcare system. Moreover, they are still the victims of homophobic crimes. To the present day, the movement has not been able to secure political protection for the rights and the safety of these communities. Although the current situation can be attributed to a certain extent to conservatism in the ruling class or the strong influence of Catholicism and homophobia, this thesis argues that the fragmentation and the lack of coherence of the movement iii has itself complicated the formulation and implementation of concrete policies. My analysis of the movement’s development throughout the last 30 years will highlight four fundamental conflicts resolving around 1. the definition of one collective identity, 2. the framing used to conceptualize these issues, 3. the different ideologies underlying the social activists’ actions, and 4. the divergence in organisational modes and strategies. As such, this thesis shifts attention from external factors to internal conflicts within the LGBTIQ movement of the Philippines. My arguments are based on 17 interviews with social activists, conducted between May and October 2015 in Manila. In the first two chapters of this thesis, I review current scholarship on social movements in general and about the Philippines and South East Asia in particular. This review will provide the theoretical foundation necessary to identify and understand the four identified social factors and their role on the fragmentation of the movement. In chapter four, I analyse the fragmentation of the movement based on the social activists’ scales of action, their targets of mobilization, and their mobilization trajectories. In chapter five, I analyze this fragmentation through the identified factors in the literature.

605	Pouvoir conjugal et immigration chez des couples colombiens immigrants à Montréal	The effects of immigration on individuals as the result of social, cultural and economic influences of the new context are well known in the scientific literature. So for those who immigrated as a couple, the immigration experience leads them to renegotiate their roles in order to adjust to the conditions of the new environment. This renegotiation makes changes in the distribution of marital power and allows the adaptation of the partners in the new society and the return to balance in the couple. However, this adaptation is not done evenly between men and women. This research aims to predict changes in the distribution of marital power among a group of thirty Colombian couples who immigrated to Montreal, depending on length of stay and degree of identification with the host society (Canada and Quebec). Marital power is evaluated in this study according to the perception of the partners about their responsibilities in making global decisions and in four specific categories before and after immigrating to Montreal. About the length of stay, the data obtained show that, for women, the time lived in the host society predicts changes in the distribution of marital power. These results also confirm that these changes favour the empowerment of women within the couple in two of four categories: « leisure time and social activities » and « care and education of children ». However, the perception of women is not shared by men ; for men, the time spent in the host society does not predict changes in the distribution of marital power. Regarding the degree of identification, our data show that for the women interviewed, identification with Canada can predict changes in the distribution of marital power globally. Regarding the degree of identification with Quebec, it predicts changes in the distribution of marital power in the « care and education of children » category for both men and women.

606	Caractérisation neuropsychologique de l'atrophie corticale postérieure dans le stade débutant	Posterior cortical atrophy (PCA) is an insidious, rare and progressive clinic syndrome which causes complex visual difficulties, associated with atrophy predominating in posterior cortical areas, despite a relative preservation in other cognitive domains. This unusual type of dementia has been poorly characterized in the very early stage of the disease from a neuropsychological standpoint. The main goal of this project is to better characterize PCA from a neuropsychological and functional perspective in the very early stage of the disease, through a very detailed single case study of a 63 years old patient who presented with slowly progressive difficulties in visual perception. A detailed neuropsychological assessment of patient M.T. was carried out in order to assess his abilities in different cognitive domains. A functional evaluation of his activities of daily living was also carried out. The results of the neuropsychological assessment revealed specific difficulties in processing three-dimensional, visuospatial information, suggesting lesions to the occipitoparietal pathway (dorsal stream). M.T. carried out a high-resolution 3T anatomical MRI, which revealed bi-parietal atrophy, predominating in the right hemisphere. This study helps better documenting the nature of neuropsychological, functional, and neuroanatomical deficits in the very early stage of PCA.	neuroimagerie , posterior cortical atrophy , Alzheimer disease , case study , neuropsychology , neuroimaging , visuospatial processing , visuoperceptual processing	en	18815.0
607	L’influence d’un masque rétrograde sur le déploiement et l’engagement de l’attention	The attentional blink (AB) is a difficulty in correctly processing a target when it follows one or more other targets after a short delay.  When no backward mask is presented after the critical target, there is no or little behavioral AB deficit. The mask plays an important role in limiting conscious access to target information.  In this electrophysiological study, we tested the impact of masking on the deployment and engagement of attention by measuring the N2pc and P3a components in an RSVP paradigm.  We also attempted to replicate previous studies that found a smaller P3b amplitude for masked targets. We found that the presence of a mask in an AB paradigm reduced the amplitude of the N2pc, P3a, and P3b components. In addition to reducing encoding in memory, masking also seems to make the deployment and engagement of attention on the last target less effective. We discuss the role of these findings in the context of current masking, consciousness, and AB models.

608	L’intégration des identités : contraste de deux hypothèses contradictoires	Every individual has multiple identities, which can be seen as conflictual or compatible. When identities are seen as compatible and complementary, they are said to be integrated. Two theoretical models try to explain the cognitive processes by which identities become integrated. The bicultural identity integration model propose that identities are merged while the cognitive-developmental model of identity integration (CDMII) proposes that identities stay distinct. Two preliminary studies and an experimental study have been conducted to compare the two models. The activation of the student identity has been manipulated with student workers, followed by a lexical decision task. If identities are combined, a facilitation effect should be observed. However, if they are distinct, an inhibition effect should be observed. Statistical analyses reveal that participants having integrated identities in the experimental group were slower to identify words linked to the worker identity than participants in the control group. These results support that integrated identities stay distinct. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.	Activation , Inhibition , Integration , Identities , Schema	en	18809.0
609	Implantation d’une sonde d’absorption photo-induite dans une expérience de spectroscopie bidimensionnelle d’excitation sur le système polymérique modèle PCDBT:PCBM	This master’s thesis present the implemantation of a photo-induced absorption probe to a collinear phase modulated two-dimensionnal excitation spectroscopy experiment. This type of spectroscopy studies the correlations between different elctronic states of a material on an ultrafast timescale to know better about the system’s dynamics. This new probe, combined to this experiment gives insight on materials where a coupling prevents from understandin the dynamic of the system. If there is such coupling between two states, it is impossible to probe the relaxation directly with light. Studying the correlations between the states, is it possible to learn more about this coupling. To prove that this new technique brings valid information on a studied material, we want to compare the results obtained with the photoinduced absorption probe to those obtained with a photoluminescence one for a system where we expect these results to be the same, PCDTBT:PCBM. Since the two-dimensionnal spectroscopy experiment enlightens the correlations between the excited states and the final products, if we probe the same final products with different probes, we should obtain the same results. Even though it was impossible to compare the results with the photoluminescence probe since the emitted signal was too low to be detected, the validity of the new probe was shown by comparing with data already known in the litterature and by making sure that the sample’s response was linear when it was expected to be. Also, the signal obtained with the new probe came from the excited states of the PCDTBT:PCBM, hence of the absorption. Finally, these results were compared to the ones obtained by a photocurrent probe. The quantum efficiency of the obtained results by the both probes was almost identical, proving the validity of this new probe to study correlations in different materials.

610	Une exploitation additionnelle du catalogue de mouvements propres LSPM pour l'étude statistique des étoiles naines blanches	We present an additional exploitation of the Lépine \& Shara Proper Motion catalog (LSPM) divided in two main parts: a follow up and some improvements on the census or northern white dwarfs within 40 pc of the Sun and a study of the SDSS white dwarfs component in the LSPM survey. The former consists in the use of criteria previously established in order to create a list of white dwarf candidates with an associated priority. The priority order has been enriched and one of the criteria has been slightly modified. We then use a non-linear least square method to the observed magnitudes in each available photometric system simultaneously in order to determine the atmospheric parameters and, in particular, the distance of each white dwarf candidate. This approach allows a second criteria to be applied on our sample based on the goodness of the fit. This will lead us to the identification of 31 new white dwarfs, from which 11 are likely to remain  within 40 pc of the Sun. A new list of 340 candidates has also been established for eventual observations. The latter consists in the use of all the objects from the 7th data release of the SDSS that have a counterpart in the LSPM catalog to elaborate a statistical study of white dwarfs, in this case by calculating the white dwarf luminosity function. To do so, one of the same criterion mentioned above will be used to make a first selection of presumed white dwarfs. Afterwards, the distance will be determined by the same least-square method, but without any restriction on the distance. To balance the effect due to the sensibility in magnitude of the survey, we used a ponderation method based on the maximum observable volume (1/v_max). However, other factors come to affect our results and the last part of this work concentrates on their identification.

611	Modulation du spectre infrarouge du graphène	Graphene is a promising nanomaterials thanks to its excellent mechanical, optical and electrical properties. However, its most innovative applications require that it be altered, but the understanding altered graphene is still limited.  Some applications are considered in infrared optics. However, our current understanding of graphene does not explain the appearance of the infrared peaks that are observed in bilayers and grafted monolayers. The behaviour of grafted graphene is especially baffling, since the addition of grafts makes it more transparent, not less!  A model proposed by Bruno Rousseau, a postdoctoral student of Professor Michel Côté at Université de Montréal, suggests an explanation for this phenomenon: although the phonons of graphene cannot couple directly with light, they could couple indirectly through collisions with the electrons, which can couple with photons. This indirect coupling may produce constructive and destructive interference, depending on the conditions, so this mechanism can produce absorbance peaks as much as transparency peaks.  In this master’s thesis, we have undertaken to experimentally verify the validity of this model, and we conclude that it seems to adequately predict the behaviour of the infrared activity of graphene bilayers and grafted monolayers. We also studied the methods by which we synthesized these different types of graphene to optimize them. Finally, we determined techniques based on Raman spectroscopy to characterize the intensity of the alteration induced by these methods.

612	Autonomie et vulnérabilité : l'apport de l'autonomie relationnelle	The common definition of autonomy takes its origins from the works of Emmanuel Kant. During the twentieth century, a feminist lecture of this nature denounces, while also highlighting an atomistic and masculine conception of autonomy, non-representative of the vulnerable and social nature of the human being. This memoir explores the themes and concepts surrounding autonomy and vulnerability within a feminist perspective, while actively establishing the possibility of the moral agent as a separate and autonomous member, dependent on its social environment.  The concept of relational autonomy proposed by Catriona Mackenzie and Natalie Stoljar constitutes an alternative to this Kant notion, which is further adjusted with human sociability.

613	Fibrés symplectiques et la géométrie des difféomorphismes hamiltoniens	This thesis presents a reasonably complete account of the elements theory of symplectic and Hamiltonian fibrations.  We assume a familiarity and comfort with the basic notions of differential geometry and algebraic topology but little else.  Proceeding from this, the first chapter develops the necessary notions from the theory of fiber bundles and G-fiber bundles, while the second chapter develops all the notions and theorems required to understand the later theory of symplectic fibrations.  Most notably the second chapter includes a detailed account of the classical relationship between the flux homomorphism and Hamiltonian isotopies.  The third chapter is where we develop the theory of symplectic and locally Hamiltonian fiber bundles, and in particular give an invariant construction of the coupling form on a symplectic fibration admitting an extension class.  the third chapter ends with a proof of a structure theorem characterizing those symplectic fibrations for which the structure group reduces to the Hamiltonian group.  In the final chapter, we present some applications of the theory of Hamiltonian fibrations by the way of characterizing the positive part of the Hofer norm of a Hamiltonian loop as the K-area of its associated Hamiltonian bundle over the sphere, and we finish by giving a proof of the non-degeneracy of the Hofer norm for closed symplectic manifolds.

614	Étude de l’évolution dans la terminologie de l’informatique en anglais avant et après 2006	In this study, we propose a method to observe lexical changes (neology and necrology) in English in the field of computer science in short-period diachrony. Since computer science evolves quickly, we believe that a short-period diachronic approach (over a period of 10 years) lends itself to studying the terminology of that field. For this purpose, we built a corpus in English with articles taken from computer science magazines for the general public, PC Magazine and PC World, covering the years 2001 to 2010. The corpus was divided into two subcorpora: 2001-2005 and 2006-2010. We chose year 2006 as a pivot, because Facebook (the most popular social network) has been open to the public since that year, and we believed that would cause quick changes in computer science terminology. For each of the magazines, we selected one issue per year from 2001 to 2010, for a total of about 540,000 words for the 2001-2005 subcorpus and about 390,000 words for the 2006-2010 subcorpus. Each subcorpus was submitted to term extractor TermoStat to extract nominal, verbal and adjectival term candidates. We proceeded to three experiment groups, according to the reference corpus used. In the first experiment group (Exp1), we compared each subcorpus to the default reference corpus in TermoStat for English, a British National Corpus (BNC) extract. In the second experiment group (Exp2), we compared each subcorpus to the whole computer science corpus we created. In the third experiment group (Exp3), we compared the two subcorpora with each other. After cleaning up the term candidates lists thus obtained to retain only the terms in the field of computer science, and generating data about relative frequency and relative specificity of the terms between subcorpora, we proceeded to the validation of novelty and obsolescence of the first terms of each list to determine whether the proposed method works better with a particular type of lexical change (novelty or obsolescence), part of speech (nominal, verbal or adjectival term), or experiment group. The validation results show that the method seems to work better with neology extraction than with necrology extraction. Also, we had better results with nominal and adjectival terms than with verbal terms. Finally, we had much more results with Exp1 than with Exp2 and Exp3.

615	Comparaison de méthodes de détection automatique d’intersections sur surfaces paramétriques	The question of determining if a given geometric model has extraneous intersections is common to many domains: numerical simulation, CAD/CAM, animation, computer graphics, etc. The complexity of this problem varies with the representation chosen to generate the model. For parametric surfaces, it is a hard problem, but for which many solutions have been proposed. Those solutions differ from one another by their underlying ideas, their complexity and the exactitude of the result they give. In this thesis, we will try to compare some of these methods. We will concentrate on the class of methods we call failsafe, the methods that will surely detect the possibility of an intersection if there is one. Those are the methods used in all critical applications, the applications in which a malformed model would have important consequences. The work of this thesis is mostly theoretical. First, we will compare the different techniques on their power of resolution. Then, we will discuss the execution cost of the different methods. We did some implementations while working on this thesis, but only as a way to support our theoretical observations. A complete empirical study of the execution times of the different methods would be left to do. We will see that there is a partial order between some of the methods in their strength, but not all of them. For example, the test-point method is strictly stronger than the separation of the convex hulls method, but is neither stronger nor weaker than the Volino- Thalmann method.	intersection , auto-intersection , surface , detection , interference , parametric	en	18761.0
616	Using Workflows to Automate Activities in MDE Tools	Software engineering aims to create software tools that allow people to solve particular problems in an easy and efficient way. In this regard, Model-driven engineering (MDE) enables to generate software tools, by systematically modeling and transforming models. In order to do this, MDE relies on language workbenches: Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for engineering modeling languages, designing models executing them and verifying them. However, the usability of these tools is far from efficient. Common MDE activities, such as creating a domain-specific language or developing a model transformation, are nontrivial and often require repetitive tasks. This results in unnecessary risings of development time. The goal of this thesis is to increase the productivity of modelers in their daily activities by automating the tasks performed in current MDE tools. I propose an MDE-based solution where the user defines a reusable workflow that can be parameterized at run-time and executed. This solution is implemented in an IDE for graphical modeling. I also performed two empirical evaluations in which the users’ productivity is improved.	Workflow , Enactment , Domain-specific Modeling , Model Transformation , Fitts Law	en	18758.0
617	Du cinéma militant au cinéma résistant : le regard décalé d'Elia Suleiman	This work, a project originally motivated by a personal desire of making « political films », attempts to redefine certain links between cinema and resistance by leaning on the resistant approach of Elia Suleiman. If the engagement in cinema was mostly associated with the ideological approach of the militant cinema, that consists of using cinema as an « instrument » for revolutionary purposes (to oppose a government, a colonizer or any other particular power), I propose in this work to demonstrate that the resistance of Suleiman consists in questioning all kinds of dominant narratives and every possible form of power, including those that concern the medium of cinema itself. Therefore, Suleiman presents a resistance with the cinema and not in the cinema: It is a mediation of resistance rather than a representation of revolutions. Following the same theoretical line as Gilles Deleuze, Michel Foucault, Jacques Rancière and Edward Saïd, I put forward the hypothesis that cinematographic resistance must be active, in other words able to invent new ways of seeing and listening (being and thinking) that can be distinguished from the repressive logic of power. By questioning the ideological, narrative and didactic discourse of the militant cinema, I identify three possible fields of resistance (political, aesthetic, and ethic) that will ultimately be verified and completed by my work of creation.

618	Institutions and “Collective Action” in a transitional country context : managing water resources in the Syr Darya River Basin	"Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the newly independent countries of Central Asia undertook reforms of their agrarian sectors with varying degrees of speed and depth.  In general, the reforms consisted of changes in the nature of land tenure and in the decentralization of irrigation and drainage management.   Through these reforms, former state management institutions were abolished leaving an institutional vacuum that presented an opportunity for the development of local-level management institutions.  However, the historical context of the region poses particular challenges that may impede users to capitalize on such opportunities.     Water User’s Associations or the local administration manage irrigation and drainage systems at the local level.  Water User Associations represent international donor-driven initiatives to introduce equitable, democratic and participative institutions for irrigation and drainage management.  There are indications that those informal institutions and traditional modes of cooperation that survived the Soviet era are gaining importance.  This study maps out the various institutions, defined as ""rules in use"", that farmers employ to manage the irrigation and drainage system in the Ferghana Valley within the context of changing land and water rights.  The key objectives of the study are (1) to understand the importance of irrigated water for local livelihoods in the research area; (2) to explore certain characteristics of the formal and informal institutions through which farmers manage irrigation and drainage systems; and (3) to depict ways in which “collective action” in irrigation water management can be strengthened.  The methodology consists of a synthesis of existing literature and fieldwork in the Ferghana Valley in Kyrgyzstan, from April 30 until 31 July, 2008. The results of the research are presented as a case study."

619	Éclairage théologique et historique du credo corinthien : critique de la forme et histoire de la tradition de 1 Corinthiens 15:1-11	This Master’s thesis deals with the creed found in 1 Corinthians 15:1-11: its origin, literary and historical contexts in I Corinthians as well as the theology and historical significance of its parts. It is focused primarily on identifying the boundaries of the creed in the pericope. A form criticism analysis leads to an argument for a long version of the creed which includes verses 3b-7 (but excluding v. 6b). Secondly, the question of Paul’s use of tradition is addressed as well as its contextualization in I Corinthians 15. On the one hand, it is argued that Paul received the creed from the Apostle Peter and James, the brother of Jesus, in Jerusalem around the year AD 36, and that the creed had been formed before that time. On the other hand, Paul uses it in 1 Corinthians 15 to oppose a Greek perspective on life after death, which viewed physical resurrection as absurd. In this perspective, resurrection meant a return to a body identical to the present body, which is mortal/corruptible and characterized by vice/sin. Thirdly, the creed is systematically analyzed on both the theological and historical levels. On the theological level, it will be demonstrated that the mystical union of Christians with Christ is presupposed and that the notion probably goes back to the tradition present in 1 Corinthians 11:23-25. Furthermore, Isaiah 53, Hosea 6:2 and Genesis 22:4 are presented as the primary texts used to develop this ancient tradition. Finally, it is argued that three founding events, namely, the death, the burial and the appearances of Christ, are to be considered historical. The author does not take a position on the historicity of the resurrection, considering that it is an explanatory fact and not an observed fact. This question would require another methodology which goes beyond the scope of this thesis.	1 Corinthians 15:1-11 , Creed , Form criticism , Tradition history , Theology , Historicity , Paul of Tarsus	en	18722.0
620	Catalogue raisonné des maies en Grèce antique	Among the plethora of highly comprehensive books dedicated to agricultural processing workshops in ancient Greece, there is no publications to date that specifically concerns the study of press-beds. Yet, a detailed analysis of this essential component of ancient presses, whose functions were to support the loads to be pressed and redirect the liquid extracted during the operation to a collection vessel, is not without interest. Made in various shapes and with a wide variety of materials, it was used in the production of many goods: oils, cosmetics, wines, cheeses, dyes and textiles. It is a crucial element for archaeologists when it comes time to restore the production line surrounding the creation of these products. This thesis aims to fill this gap, both in establishing a catalogue of most press-beds that were discovered in the territory belonging to modern Greece, as well as analyzing and commenting on the data resulting from this operation, despite all methodological issues inherent in this type of study. The result is a picture of the distribution, both in space and time, of these press-beds, which can be used with elements provided by other researchers, to provide a fresh look at productions using presses.	production , minoen , press-bed , press , oil , wine , archaeology , Greece , Minoan , Archaic , Classical , Hellenistic , Roman	en	18719.0
621	Suspendu(e) et l'écriture du deuil et du souvenir dans La place d'Annie Ernaux et L'orphelin de Pierre Bergounioux	The question in this research-creation comes from a first reflection on the writing of mourning: Is it possible to tell a story, my story, but especially the story of the other and what are the effects on the memory? In the research section, we focus on the modalities of the writing of mourning in La place by Annie Ernaux and L’orphelin by Pierre Bergounioux. Initially, we focus on the poetics of these two authors before to go further and question the writing on memory in the two novels. In this part, we relied on the theories and concepts of Ricoeur, Todorov and Nora in the idea of exploring possible links with the processes at work in the narrative. Finally, we are also exploring the issue of the search for identity and heritage as presented in the narrative filiation, we will support our reflection on the writings of Dominique Viart. Memory and its preservation are the main concern before the creation. Suspendu(e) is a narrative whose form both the new and the novel. It is part of the concerns of the narrative filiation as presented by Dominique Viart. As such, it reflects on the trace and origin. It consists in two parts. The first, more narrative, tells my father's death event; the breaking point. The second part is more fragmented. It consists of fragments of life that are both memories and interpreted traces (videos, pictures). Key words : mourning, testimony, memory, self-writing, father, Annie Ernaux, Pierre Bergounioux.

622	Contexte de vie et facteurs précrime chez des agresseurs sexuels de femmes	The aim of this thesis is to investigate offending process profiles amongst sexual aggressors of women which integrate predisposing factors (two years prior to the offence) and precipitating factors (48 hours prior to the offence). Precrime factors included in offence cycles are internal and external to sexual aggressors. Thirty-seven convicted sex offenders who participated in a relapse prevention group are included in this study. Participants identified important life events. The sequence following these events forms a behavioural chain, which includes: 1) life events; 2) cognitions; 3) emotions; 4) fantasies; 5) behaviours; and 6) consequences. The series of behavioural chains reported by each participant shape his offending process. Offending processes were analyzed based on a qualitative exploratory method to put forward similarities and differences amongst participants. Results suggest three main offending-process profiles: 1) sexuality-oriented; 2) crime-oriented; and 3) mixed (sexuality and crime-oriented). The sexual dimension encompasses two sub-groups: 1) sexual deviance; and 2) deviant and/or disinhibited sexuality. Sexuality-oriented offenders (n = 17) had negative views of others and of life in general, which were associated mainly with hostility and negative emotions (e.g. depression, anxiety). Crime-oriented offenders (n = 6) had various cognitions, including negative views of themselves, of others, and of life in general, as well as cognitions supporting deviance. Following emotions were mainly hostile and negative. Mixed-profile offenders had various cognitions, including negative views of others and of life in general, as well as cognitions supporting deviance. A combination of hostility and negative emotions, or hostility, negative, and positive emotions followed.

623	Les conséquences juridiques de la coexistence de l’obligation d’accommodement raisonnable et du régime public de réparation des lésions professionnelles	Following the review of the genesis of two fundamental regimes in Quebec labour law, the public system that provides repairs to injured workers, established by the Act respecting industrial accidents and occupational diseases, and the duty to provide reasonable accommodation arising from the right to equality under section 10 of the Quebec Charter, this thesis focuses on the development of the normative conflict and the jurisdictional conflict stemming from the parallel evolution of these two sources of obligations for employers. Both of these are based on the reinstatement of disabled workers and the continuation of their employment relationship. This study proposes to explore the legal consequences of the solution adopted by the Quebec Court of Appeal in Caron’s case, dated June 2015, in which the Court decided to overlay the employer’s duty to accommodate onto the Workers’ Compensation public system. Thus, emphasizing on the role that the right to equality plays in public law and discussing its impact on the separation of powers, this thesis shows the consequences from the approach used in the Caron judgment and its particular results through Canadian constitutional and Quebec quasi-constitutional principles. Furthermore, this significant change gives rise to many difficulties regarding the particularities of administrative law, and more specifically, the role and the limited powers of C.N.E.S.S.T. and T.A.T.-D.S.S.T. Finally, this analysis highlights that the solution held by the Court of Appeal infringes on the balance attempted by the public system based on an important social compromise.

Initially, the author exposes the various disturbances caused by these schemes on early warning systems and follows up with repercussions that reverberate through to the Canadian corporate laws framework. Detailed case reviews are also presented to highlight the practical implications of these aforementioned schemes. Legislative solutions to mitigate the potential misuse of derivatives are proposed and ultimately the preferred solution tailored to Canadian financial markets is selected.

625	Coopérer pour apprendre la syntaxe écrite : recherche-action sur la phrase subordonnée relative en troisième secondaire	"This research aims to document the learning of grade-nine students in writing situation following the testing of a didactic sequence based on cooperation. Given the large number of syntactic errors in the texts of secondary students as reported by the MELS (2012), our series of courses targets a syntactic structure, the relative clause. In addition to causing problems for learners of French regarding the choice of the relative pronoun in particular, the relative clause is a dense teaching object known for posing many challenges to French teachers according to the work of Groupe de recherche pour l’analyse du français enseigné (e.g. Dolz et Schneuwly, 2009a, 2009b). After describing the writing situation and the relative clause conceptually, we extricate principles from the fields of grammar didactics and writing didactics deemed relevant to foster the learning of the relative clause and the mobilization of grammatical knowledge in writing situation. An innovative principle for teaching is integrated, one based on cooperation. Developed in the field of cooperative learning, cooperation is an educational approach aimed at structuring work in small groups to establish a dynamic of positive interdependence (Johnson and Johnson, 2009) so as to induce the unfolding of verbal interactions between students shown to be more fruitful in terms of learning than those prevailing in the absence of cooperative framework (e.g. Krol et al., 2004). Following an action research approach conducted jointly with a teacher, the series of courses is designed and tested with 55 students from three grade-nine students classes of Montreal (Canada) in order to actualize the didactic principles extricated. Two instruments are used to document students’ learning. The text aims to document the evolution in the production of subordinate clauses, while metagraphic interviews are aiming at metalinguistic skills related to these relative clauses. The analysis of texts collected at pretest and post test (n = 107) shows a significant decrease of mistakes in the use of relative pronoun in the texts, and a significant increase in use of complex relative pronouns such as ""dont"" (whose) and ""auquel"" (which). Analysis of metagraphic interviews at pretest and post test (n = 34) shows that students rely more on syntactic criteria to explain their use of the relative pronoun, and they use significantly more metalanguage in their explanations. The results of this research highlight the interest of implementing in French class didactic principles used, and more specifically the innovative cooperation one in order to reduce the syntactic errors in the texts and to develop students’metalinguistic skills."

626	Implications des spasmes infantiles sur le neurodéveloppement des enfants	West syndrome (WS), commonly referred to as infantile spasms (IS), is an epileptic disorder usually characterized by the triad of infantile spasms, a pathognomonic electroencephalogram (EEG) pattern called hypsarrhythmia, and developmental regression. While previous treatment studies were able to achieve relatively adequate spasm control and hypsarrhythmia resolution in this population of patients, they have failed to provide conclusive and definite therapeutic options aimed at improving the poor cognitive outcome often associated to IS. Our study, on which this thesis is based, was the first to use an add-on treatment to conventional antiepileptic drugs, with the intent to improve long-term cognitive outcome in this population. Patients recruited in our original randomized clinical trial (RCT) followed a standardized treatment protocol consisting of vigabatrin (VGB) as first-line treatment for two weeks, followed by adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) in non-responders for another two-week period, and topiramate in refractory cases. In addition, patients were randomized to either receive placebo or flunarizine adjunct therapy for six months. Our multi-centric RCT recruited and evaluated 68 patients, most of which were followed at 8 different time points over a five-year period, to precisely evaluate their neurodevelopmental progress. Our clinical trial generated three main studies which comprise the core of this thesis. In a first study, clinical and cognitive data from the first two years were analyzed. Spasm arrest and hypsarrhythmia resolution were the short-term clinical endpoint measures, while the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale (VABS) and Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID) were used as cognitive outcome measures at 2 years. This first study most importantly reports on the superior short-term clinical response rate achieved in our study population. Preliminary cognitive results were also presented in this work. Our second study essentially presented long-term cognitive data 5 years after the start of the study. Cognitive outcome measures were similar to those used at two years with the addition of the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale, Fifth Edition (SB5) for higher functioning patients. Most IS patients, particularly those with no known etiology, displayed a significant and progressive improvement of cognitive functions, irrespective of adjunctive therapy. Risk factors of long term poor cognitive outcome were also revealed in this study. Our last study tried to understand the relationship between IS and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Autism was initially screened by means of the Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (CHAT) at 24 months, and formally assessed at the 30-and 60-month follow-up visits using the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS). ADOS was performed in 44 patients, 10 of which were diagnosed with ASD. A description of risk factors associated with an ASD outcome in the IS population were presented in this article. Finally, based on our study results and in conjunction with literature information on the topic, we attempted to elucidate the pathophysiological characteristics of the disorder. A conceivable description of the underlying biological mechanisms implicated in West syndrome and associated target treatments were presented. Although our complementary treatment, flunarizine, did not prove to be beneficial in our cohort, our treatment protocol was nonetheless able to demonstrate superior clinical and cognitive outcomes in patients with unknown etiologies. These findings, as well as the identification of new potential neurodevelopmental risk factors, could be used clinically to improve the diagnosis and medical follow-up of patients with West syndrome.

627	Modulating T Cell costimulation to prevent renal allograft rejection in nonhuman primates	"Organ transplantation is often the best therapeutic approach for end-stage organ failure. Graft rejection is the major obstacle to successful transplantation because transplantation is most frequently carried out between genetically distinct individuals. Transplanted tissues or organs are usually recognized by the immune system as foreign and are rapidly destructed without immune interventions. A series of approaches have thus been applied in clinic to inhibit the allogenic immune responses and in turn increase organ transplant acceptance. Immunosuppressive drugs are the key players in the ""war"" against immune cell-mediated rejection of allogenic transplants. Currently, the use of calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) has dramatically decreased the risk of acute transplant rejection and improved the short-term outcomes of organ transplantation, but the long-term outcomes are still unsatisfied. One of the main reasons causing unsatisfied long-term outcomes is that current immunosuppressive drugs do not specifically target immune cells that cause transplant rejection. These immunosuppressive agents, especially CNIs, are the risk factors for late graft loss and death with functioning graft (DWFG) due to drug toxicity, over-immunosuppression, and other side-effects. Thus there is an urgent need for seeking novel therapies that can selectively eliminate the alloreactive immune responses while preserving the integrity of the remainder of the host immune system.    It has been known that T cells play a central role in initiating allograft rejection. Full activation of T cells requires at least two collaborative but distinct signals. The first signal is generated by the interaction between T cell receptor (TCR) and MHC-peptide complex. The second signal, termed costimulatory signal, is delivered through the engagement of costimulatory receptors by their ligands. Importantly, TCR engagement in the absence of costimulatory signals can result in T cell anergy, a state of T cell unresponsiveness. Costimulatory molecules thus gain attention as potential therapeutic targets. Because these molecules are primary expressed on T cells and/or antigen-presenting cells, targeting costimulatory signaling pathway offers the oppertumities to modulate immune system in a more selective way relative to conventional immunosuppressive agents.   To date, numerous costimulatory molecules have been identified and some have been tested as therapeutic targets in organ transplant models. CD28–CD80/86 and CD40–CD40L axis are two important and the most well known costimulatory signaling pathways. Belatacept, a variant of cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4-immunoglobulin G (CTLA4-Ig) that blocks CD28–CD80/86 signaling pathway, is the only costimulation blocker to be approved for clinical use in organ transplantation. Compared to CNI-based regimen for kidney transplant recipients, belatacept-based regimens show similar patient and graft survival rate, superior graft function, and improved cardiovascular risk profile. However, belatacept is also associated with higher rates of acute rejection and posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD). Disruption of CD40–CD40L interaction with anti-CD40L mAbs has also been demonstrated to be a reliable approach for preventing acute rejection and for prolonging allograft survival. Unfortunately, unexpected thromboembolic complications in preclinical studies and clinical trials discontinued the development of anti-CD40L mAbs. The main objective of this thesis is to identify the optimal T cell costimulation blockers that can show improved safety and non-inferior efficacy in promoting allograft acceptance relative to current costimulatory blocking agents.  Anti-CD40 mAbs are an alternative approach to block CD40–CD40L costimulatory pathway. CD40 is not involved in the stability of platelet thrombi and anti-CD40 mAbs are expected to not cause thromboembolic events. ASKP1240 is a novel fully human anti-CD40 mAb. In this study, the efficacy of ASKP1240 in the prevention of renal allograft rejection was evaluated in cynomolgus monkey kidney transplantation model. When ASKP1240 was administered alone, it dose-dependently reduced the incidence of acute rejection and prolonged renal allograft survival. Renal allograft acceptance was further improved in the monkey which received regiments using ASKP1240 combined with conventional immunosuppressive drugs tacrolimus (sub-therapeutic dose) or mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). Acute allograft rejection was totally eliminated in these animals and the kidney allograft median survival times (MST) of these groups were significantly longer than those of monotherapy groups. ASKP1240 administration did not induce cytokine release. This agent was well tolerated in monkey kidney transplant recipients during the 180-day treatment period. There were no obvious side effects including drug-related thromboembolic complications.   Next, we tested the hypothesis that a CD86-selective variant of CTLA4-Ig might show non-inferior efficacy on the prevention of allograft rejection and prolongation of graft survival in comparison with belatacept. CD86 is the dominating ligand between the two natural ligands for CD28 in alloimmune response. Improvements in CD86 binding affinity of CTLA4-Igs confer increased immunosuppressive potency. A CD86-selective CTLA4-Ig variant may reach therapeutic levels of CD86 occupancy while occupies substantially less CD80 ligand than non-CD86-selective CTLA4-Igs. Preservation of CD80 signaling may be favoring to retain protective immunity and to improve safety of CTLA4-Ig therapy. This thesis investigated the effects of a novel CD86-selective CTLA4-Ig variant, ASP2409, on renal allograft rejection and survival in cynomolgus monkeys. ASP2409 possesses 14-fold higher in vitro CD86 binding affinity than belatacept and improved immunosuppressive potency. Compared to no-treatment control, low-dose (0.3 mg/kg) ASP2409 monotherapy significantly prolonged renal allograft survival (MST = 5 and 26 days, respectively) but did not decrease the incidence of acute rejection (8/8). The rate of acute renal allograft rejection was reduced in the group of high-dose ASP2409 monotherapy (2/7) and, correspondingly, a much longer MST (>91 days) was shown in this group. Combination therapy of low-dose ASP2409 and tacrolimus (sub-therapeutic dose) completely eliminated acute allograft rejection and notably prolonged renal allograft survival (MST >91 days). The MSTs of renal allografts in the animals receiving high-dose ASP2409-, belatacept-, and therapeutic dose tacrolimus-based immunosuppressive regimens were same (>91 days). High-dose ASP2409-based regimens exhibited better histopathological results than belatacept-based regimen. Furthermore, higher frequencies of FoxP3+ Tregs in renal allografts were observed in ASP2409- and belatacept-based regimens compared to tacrolimus-based regimen. ASP2409 was also demonstrated to be safe for animals with the doses to be tested. There were no serious side effects related to ASP2409 to be found in term of 91-day study.   This study demonstrates that ASKP1240 is as effective as anti-CD40L mAbs on inhibition of acute rejection and prolongation of renal allograft survival, and do not cause thromboembolic complications. Previous studies indicated that CNIs could diminish the effects of anti-CD40L mAbs. In our study, ASKP1240 in combination with tacrolimus or MMF shows improved efficiency. Furthermore, the effects of ASP2409 on promoting renal allograft acceptance are not inferior to belatacept. These results collectively suggest that ASKP1240 and ASP2409 both are the promising immunosuppressive agents for solid organ transplantation."

628	Differences in brain structure between males and females diagnosed with schizophrenia	Advances in cerebral neuroimaging techniques have helped our understanding of mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia. Few findings remain consistent and are often contradictory, making it difficult to draw informative conclusions about the disease. Several factors play a role in both diverging and converging results. Imaging technique and analyses, number of patients involved, age of patients, age at onset of the disease, diagnostic criteria, antipsychotic treatment effects, social status, comorbidities, are among some of the reasons. Despite well established cerebral sex differences in healthy population, it is only in recent years that neuroimaging studies in schizophrenia have addressed sex differences as a major possible explanation for discrepant neuroimaging finding.  The aim of this thesis is to help understand the role of sex on brain structures in schizophrenia, by conducting studies that control as much as possible for other variables and by using MRI automated analyses for patients and controls matched for age and sex. This work will briefly present findings in schizophrenia in general, and then an extensive review of the literature on sex differences in schizophrenia will be presented. From it, we are able to conclude that sex differences have been reported with rare exception in almost all aspects involved in the life of patients with schizophrenia.   Chapters 1. The first study investigated sex differences in cortical gyrification in schizophrenia patients (SZ). In addition, considering that schizophrenia is a disease of “clinical symptoms” that determine the quality of life of patients afflicted by it, we explored the relation between cortical gyrification and symptoms in males and females with schizophrenia. The role of sex on cortical gyrification and its association with symptoms has been scarcely investigated in patients with schizophrenia. In this study, 3T T1 images were acquired from 48 schizophrenia patients (24 males [SZ-M] and 24 females [SZ-F]) and 48 normal controls [NC] (24 males [NC-M] and 24 females [NC-F]) matched for age, sex, and handedness. Gyrification Index (GI) analyses for each hemisphere and four cerebral regions (frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital) were performed using the fully automated CIVET pipeline. Patients had significant lower values of the overall GI relative to normal controls and SZ-M had significant lower right hemispheric GI values compared to NC-M. This was not observed in either NC-F or in SZ. No gender difference in GI values decreases with age were observed in NC. In patients, GI decreases with age were greater in SZ-M than SZ-F, with a more progressive deterioration in the right hemisphere in both patient groups. Significant GI value reductions in association with duration of illness were observed in SZ-M but not in SZ-F. Patient groups had lower GI in bilateral frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes than controls. SZ-F had significant lower GI values in left frontal, bilateral temporal and left parietal lobe compared to NC-F. No significant correlations were found between GI values and symptom scores in either group of patients. Since GI reflects, in part, alterations in cerebral development and connectivity, the decrease in GI observed in patients is in agreement with the neurodevelopmental model of disconnectivity in schizophrenia, and may explain the worse prognosis and social outcome observed in male patients. Furthermore, we emphasize the importance of age and duration of illness when comparing males and females with schizophrenia. Observed differences between male and female patients may reflect a more diffuse and generalized cortical loss in males. Female patients had cortical loss in specific regions, while preserving cortical gyrification in compensatory regions. Our latter finding -no significant correlation between GI values and symptom scores- was of particular interest and was unexpected in view of neuroimaging findings of correlations between positive symptoms and temporal lobe abnormalities. 2.  In the second study, we examined the association between symptoms and brain structure using gray (GMD) and white matter (WMD) densities. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM8.0 with Diffeomorphic Anatomical Registration Through Exponentiated Lie Algebra [DARTEL]) and Automatic Linear Modeling (SPSS21.0 ALM) were used on 3T T1 MPRAGE images acquired from 40 schizophrenia patients (SZ) and 41 normal controls (NC). We found that SZ had lower GMD in the anterior cingulate cortex and left middle temporal gyrus, and higher GMD in the left posterior cingulate in comparison to NC. SZ had significantly lower WMD in the left inferior fronto-rectal and the left posterior parietal regions in comparison to NC. Significant positive correlations were found between positive symptoms and GMD in the left insula and right caudate, and between negative symptoms and GMD in the right middle frontal and the posterior lobe of the right cerebellum (uvula). Inverse relationships between GMD in the right parietal (precuneus), the left posterior lobe of the cerebellum (uvula) and positive symptoms, and between GMD in the left anterior lobe of the cerebellum and negative symptoms were observed in SZ. In addition, positive correlations were found between WMD in the right middle frontal lobe, and between positive symptoms and WMD in the right superior frontal region with negative symptoms. Negative correlations were found between positive symptoms and WMD in the right inferior occipital and the right occipital cuneus, while negative symptoms correlated negatively with the WMD of the left superior frontal.   When symptom clusters were analyzed, conceptual disorganization symptom positively correlated with both total GMD and WMD. While increases in GMD were associated with decreased severity of lack of spontaneity and hallucinations symptom, increases in total WMD were associated with decreased severity of hostility and grandiosity symptoms. Comparison between male subjects revealed decreased GMD in male schizophrenia patients, while no differences were observed between females across groups. No correlations were found in female groups between GMD, WMD, CSF, or total brain volume and individual symptoms. In males with schizophrenia, significant negative correlation between ideas of grandiosity and WMD, a positive correlation between disorientation and WMD, and attention deficits and GMD and WMD were found. The current data suggest region-specific GMD and WMD association with negative and positive symptoms. In addition, it reveals that such associations are different in male and female schizophrenia patients.  3. The third study investigated the relationships of GMD and WMD with memory accuracy for emotionally negative, positive, and neutral pictures in schizophrenia patients relative to normal controls. Schizophrenia is characterized by an amalgam of cognitivo-socio-emotional deficits. The relationship between emotion processing on cognition and neurobiological underpinnings merit more attention than it has received so far. Memory deficits are among the most common deficits in schizophrenia and have a widespread impact on cognition in general. Additionally, consistently with the major theme of the present thesis, we investigated the effect of gender on the observed effect. Forty one, right-handed medicated patients with schizophrenia (SZ) and 40 right-handed normal controls (NC) matched by age and sex were assessed for memory accuracy using negative, positive and neutral pictures taken from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS). Imaging methods and analyses were similar to our second study. Fifteen minutes after presentation of selected IAPS images (incidental encoding), subjects were asked to recognize the previously seen images among other images. We found higher GMD in NC in the right posterior parietal cortex, lentiform, putamen, and caudate, as well as the left inferior orbitofrontal cortex, in relation with the negative images accuracy. NC had higher GMD in the left temporal and fusiform regions in relation with the positive images accuracy, and higher GMD in the left anterior cerebellum in relation with neutral images. Schizophrenia subjects had higher GMD in the left inferior occipital cortex in relation with the negative images accuracy, but GMD was not correlated with positive or neutral images accuracy in this group. WMDs correlations were higher in NC in the left postcentral parietal region for negative images; in the left inferior temporal, left precuneus parietal, and left frontal regions for positive images; and in the left middle temporal region for neutral images. Schizophrenia patients had higher WMD in the left lingual occipital for negative images; in the left angular parietal for positive images; and in the right superior temporal region for neutral images. While examining the two sexes separately, we observed inverse correlations between WMD and both negative and positive pictures in male patients. In addition, only in male controls, GMD positively correlated with negative pictures and this correlation was absent in female SZ subjects and NC females. These findings support the hypothesis of fronto-temporal regional atrophy in schizophrenia. Schizophrenia patients have relatively increased occipito-parietal WMD, advancing the hypothesis that the core pathophysiological problem underlying recall memory in SZ may be related to disruptive alterations in the coordination of large-scale brain networks, and this may be affected by structural deficits that are more evident in male patients. It is recommended that future studies should use the connectomes or the brain networks approach to investigate the effect of sex on memory deficits in schizophrenia.  Our overall findings point out to the importance of sex in modulating the clinical and functional manifestations of schizophrenia. We believe that controlling for covariates as age, duration of illness, social status, etc. is insufficient and that future studies in schizophrenia should systematically separate male and female findings, if we wish to understand this complex and devastating mental illness.

This study aims to determine the incidence of hypotensive events and more specifically acute isolated hypotensive transfusion reactions associated with PC transfusions. We also sought to ascertain whether these reactions are associated with high bradykinin levels. Materials and Methods: This is a prospective descriptive study of PCs administered at Sainte-Justine Hospital over 28 months. All PCs administered during this period were screened for hypotension through review of all transfusion-associated reaction reports (TARRs) sent to the blood bank. All residual PC bags were returned to the blood bank. TARRs associated with hypotension were reviewed by adjudicators who established the imputability of the PC transfusion to the reaction. Bradykinin levels were measured in the first 168 PC bags returned to the blood bank. Levels were compared between PCs associated with hypotension and control PCs not associated with hypotension. Results: A total of 3672 PC bags were returned to the blood bank; 25 PCs were associated with hypotension. Adjudicators ascertained that five hypotensive events were 8 imputable to PCs of which one was an acute isolated hypotensive transfusion reaction (incidence per transfusion: 0.03%). Bradykinin level in the latter PC was 10 pg/ml, whereas levels were 226.2 pg/ml (95%CI : 20.0-432.4 pg/ml) in the 143 control PCs. Conclusion: Our results show a low incidence of hypotension after PC transfusion. We identified only one acute isolated hypotensive transfusion reaction. No correlation between bradykinin level and the occurrence of acute isolated hypotensive reactions could be observed given that only one event was identified. Abstract 2 Platelet transfusions in pediatric intensive care Objectives: To characterize the epidemiology and the determinants of platelet transfusion (PT) in a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) and determine whether there exists an association between PT and adverse outcomes. Design: Prospective observational single center study, combined with a self-administered survey. Setting: PICU of Sainte-Justine Hospital, a university-affiliated tertiary care institution. Patients: All children admitted to the PICU from April 2009 to April 2010. Intervention: None. Measurements and Main Results: Among 842 consecutive PICU admissions, 60 patients (7.1%) received at least one PT while in PICU. In the univariate analysis, significant determinants for PT transfusion were admission PRISM >10 (odds ratio (OR): 6.80; 95%CI: 2.5-18.3, p <0.01) and PELOD scores >20 (OR: 26.9; 95%CI: 8.88- 81.5, p<0.01), history of malignancy (OR: 5.08; 95%CI: 2.43-10.68, p <0.01), thrombocytopenia (platelet count <50 x 109/L or < 50,000/mm3) (OR: 141; 95%CI: 50.4- 394.5, p <0.01), use of heparin (OR:3.03; 95%CI 1.40-6.37, p <0.01), shock (OR: 5.73; 95%CI: 2.85-11.5, p<0.01) and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) (OR: 10.41; 95%CI: 5.89-10.40, p <0.01). In the multivariate analysis, platelet count <50 x109/L (OR: 138; 95%CI: 42.6-449, p<0.01) and age less than 12 months (OR: 3.06; 95%CI: 1.03-9.10, p=0.02) remained statistically significant determinants. The attending physicians were asked why they gave a PT; the most frequent justification was prophylactic platelet transfusion in presence of thrombocytopenia with an average pre10 transfusion platelet count of 32 ±27 x109/L(median 21), followed by active bleeding with an average pre-transfusion platelet count of 76 ±39 x109/L(median 72). PTs were associated with the subsequent development of MODS (OR: 2.53; 95%CI: 1.18-5.43, p=0.03) and mortality (OR: 10.1; 95%CI: 4.48-22.7, p<0.01). Conclusions: 7.1% of children received at least one PT while in PICU. Thrombocytopenia and active bleeding are significant determinants of PT. Patients that received PTs had a higher risk of developing MODS and had a higher risk of mortality.	platelet concentrates , platelet transfusion , transfusion reactions , cohort , pediatrics , intensive care , determinants , outcomes , thrombocytopenia	en	18555.0
630	Régulation de l'orientation du fuseau mitotique des divisions cellulaires asymétriques pendant le développement de la rétine : rôles de SAPCD2 et LGN	The control of cell division orientation is an integral processing during asymmetric cell division, a critical process ensuring cell diversity by asymmetrically distributing cell fate determinants between daughter cells. Cell fate determinants in invertebrate model organisms such as the C. elegans nematode and Drosophila fruit fly have been well characterized, and genetic analyses in these organisms has identified the evolutionarily conserved ternary protein complex Gai-LGN-NuMA as essential molecules involved in mitotic spindle orientation, as well as the polarity protein complex PAR3-PAR6-aPKC. Precisely how the Gai-LGN-NuMA complex achieves proper sub-cellular localization in vertebrate neural progenitors to induce planar cell division remains unclear.  We used the developing vertebrate retina as a model system to study the role of cell division orientation in cell fate decisions. We have previously demonstrated a link between cell division orientation and daughter cell outcome in neural retina. Specifically, vertical cell divisions have a tendency to give rise to asymmetric pairs of daughter cells, and appear in later stages of retinogenesis. We wished to elucidate the mechanism underlying the switch from planar to vertical cell divisions over time during the neurogenic vs. proliferative developmental phases of retinogenesis.   With our collaborators from the University of Toronto in the lab of Dr Stéphane Angers, we identified a novel Gai, LGN and PAR3 interacting protein, named SAPCD2 (suppressor APC domain containing 2). SAPCD2 is a poorly characterized protein, but known to be expressed in a cell cycle-dependent manner with higher expression during mitosis and elevated expression in many human cancers.  We first analyzed Sapcd2 and Lgn expression in the developing retina, and found strong expression during proliferative phases, with its subcellular localization dependent on mitotic phase and developmental stage. During mitoses at P0 (birth), SAPCD2 and LGN display complementary localization with an apical or cortico-lateral enrichment, respectively, suggestive of a role in planar cell division induction. However, at E14.5, SAPCD2 and LGN have a highly similar localization, independent of spindle orientation, suggesting different roles during retinal development.  We then analyzed mitotic spindle orientation in Sapcd2 and Sapcd2/Lgn DKO mice at E14.5 and P0, and Lgn mutant mice studied in parallel by Dre Marine Lacomme, post-doc in the Cayouette lab. In the absence of Sapcd2, vertical divisions drastically increased, whereas in the absence of Lgn, horizontal cell divisions increased.   To test if this reorientation affects cell fate outcome, we analyzed the lineage of individual progenitor cells. As expected, in absence of Sapcd2, we observed a drastic increase in terminal asymmetric cell divisions, leading to two different neurons; whereas in the absence of Lgn, we observed an increase in terminal symmetric cell divisions, leading to two photoreceptors. Mechanistically, we showed that SAPCD2 negatively regulates LGN cortical localization, by competing with NuMA for its binding.  In Lgn;Sapcd2 DKO mice, the mitotic spindle reorientation phenotype is even more drastic, containing almost exclusively vertical cell divisions, combined with an increase of proliferation and non-apical mitoses. This leads to a drastic expansion of the neuronal population, which forms an extra-layer containing many different retinal cell types. This over-proliferation could be due to the increase of vertical cell divisions, leading to an asymmetrical distribution of cell fate determinant, NUMB, an antagonist of Notch, between daughter cells. We hypothesize that the retinal basal progenitor, without NUMB, has a higher proliferative potential than the apical progenitor. Contrary to previous studies, this suggests that retinal progenitors are not equipotent.   This work identifies a new regulator of mitotic spindle orientation and clarifies the sub-cellular localization of the LGN-NuMA complex. Our results also suggest that SAPCD2 and LGN change their role and the way they interact throughout the course of retinogenesis. This research contributes to an understanding of both how neural number is regulated, and how cell diversity is generated during vertebrate central nervous system development.

631	Étude des types d’expérience de maltraitance subie dans l’enfance chez les mères adolescentes et leur association aux conditions pouvant mener à l’adoption de pratiques parentales maltraitantes	Objective: To explore the association between histories of childhood maltreatment types among a group of adolescent mothers and recognized variables linked to the Adoption of maltreating parental behavior (AMPB) towards their child in accordance with Trauma-focused theory landmarks.   Design: Secondary analysis of quantitative data from an evaluative study of the Programme de Soutien aux Jeunes Parents (PSJP) des Services intégrés en périnatalité et pour la petite enfance à l’intention des familles vivant en contexte de vulnérabilité (SIPPE).    Sample: 288 adolescent mothers from Québec, Canada, 18 years old on average, receiving or having received services through the PSJP.   Method: Data was collected four times (twice during pregnancy, as well as at 5 and 17 months postpartum) over an average period of two years. Childhood maltreatment history was measured by using the short version of Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ). Cluster analysis was performed using variables related to childhood trauma history (forms of maltreatment experience and severity classification). Analyses of variance, cross tables and binary logistic regression were then conducted to assess the association between the different types of childhood maltreatment and recognized variables linked to AMPB in adolescent mothers.   Results: Results show a high occurrence of childhood maltreatment experience among the adolescent mothers that took part in our study. Further, they highlight three distinct types of childhood maltreatment. The first type is characterized by emotional neglect without cooccurrence; the second one, by sexual abuse and emotional neglect; and the third one, by a cooccurrence of all forms of abuse but with a lower intensity of emotional neglect. Overall, despite certain distinctions, mothers from the second and third types present significantly more risk factors for AMPB than mothers from the first type (i.e. higher levels of poverty, fragile mental health, parental difficulties, and lower satisfaction of social network).    Conclusion: From a prevention perspective of AMPB, our results put forward the importance of focusing on and understanding adolescent mothers’ diversity of childhood maltreatment experiences. Difficulties related to a history of childhood maltreatment vary according to its nature and the co-occurrence of forms of maltreatment. These consequences can be persistent and put mothers at risk of intergenerational transmission of maltreatment towards their children. This puts forth the relevance of studying maltreatment among adolescent mothers not only according to the risk of perpetration but also according to the abuse they have themselves suffered in their childhood. The implications for social work and psychosocial intervention are also discussed.

632	L'évolution des pratiques en maison d'hébergement pour femmes victimes de violence conjugale au Québec	This dissertation focuses on the evolution of intervention practices in domestic violence shelters in the province of Québec, since their development in the mid-1970’s. More specifically, it provides an overview of 40 years of practices in these refuges, highlighting the transformations that have occurred over the years. Drawing upon a critical and feminist epistemological viewpoint and relying on a qualitative methodology, the study guiding this thesis was conducted with a total sample of 48 participants, including 8 pioneers, 7 veterans and 33 domestic violence shelter workers. Moreover, 53 documents issued by the Regroupement des maisons pour femmes victimes de violence conjugale and by the Fédération des maisons d’hébergement pour femmes have also supported the current research. The conceptual framework through which the intervention practices were analyzed emerged inductively from the data and is organized around six values: security, dignity, self-determination, equality, solidarity, and social justice. Overall, domestic violence shelters in the province of Québec which drew upon a feminist perspective of the phenomenon were developed with the ultimate goal of dissolving when violence against women was eliminated. Accordingly, these resources were conceptualized as mean of social change; collectively-oriented practices were thus targeting society as a whole (Lacombe, 1990). From a “means to and end” to “an end in itself” (Murray, 1988), domestic violence shelters have been gradually structured internally with regards to the way they work with women and children, a phenomenon which can be linked to the professionalization of services. The results also suggest that the six values on which the conceptual framework of the study was built have remained deeply entrenched in the history of domestic violence shelters and are still influencing the intervention practices, as conceptualized by the pioneers and veterans during the 1970’s. However, some of the data provided in the current research suggests some shifts in existing practices are occurring. More specifically, the challenge of understanding the situation of women affected by different issues (mental health, substance abuse, aggression) through a feminist lens and the lack of theoretical references seems to further complicate the participants’ work with women who are deemed “difficult”. Moreover, the resurgence of a medical discourse, the willingness of some to involve men in shelters and the conceptualization of women in their role as mothers through a “deficit perspective” (Peled & Dekel, 2010) raises important questions about the continuing strength and influence of feminism on workers.	violence conjugale , femmes , domestic violence , women , children , shelter , intervention practices , feminist practices , feminism , qualitative research , feminist research	en	18521.0
633	Effets des fluctuations de débit sur la réponse au stress des poissons : étude intégrative de la physiologie et du comportement chez le grand brochet (Esox lucius L.)	Flow is an important determinant of physicochemical characteristics of rivers. Fish communities in rivers are strongly dependant of their habitat, which is directly dictated by this set of characteristics. The loss of the natural flow regime, through regulation by hydroelectric facilities, for example, has the potential to directly affect the fish communities. Numerous studies have shown that the loss of natural flow regimes negatively impact fish populations and communities, but not much is known about the mechanisms that underlie such a relationship. Physiological processes determine the way that fish select their habitat. The stress response has been proposed as a mechanism that guides fish throughout the environmental changes happening in their habitat. Indicators of the fish stress response comprise behaviour, plasma cortisol, and blood glucose and lactate. First, northern pike Esox lucius L. movements were assessed in two rivers with contrasting flow regimes: a hydropeaking regulated river and an unregulated free-flowing river. Using manual tracking by radio-telemetry, we found that pike moved at a higher rate in the regulated river than in the unregulated river. Results also show that the direction of the relationship between movement of pike and flow can vary between rivers. Second, the effect of a water velocity increase on plasma cortisol, blood glucose and blood lactate levels in wild pike originating from the two rivers with contrasting flow regimes were assessed. Our results show that blood glucose and lactate concentrations are significantly diminished for fish originating from the regulated river, in comparison to fish originating from the unregulated river, following an increase in water velocity. Third, a novel analytical framework was developed that allow one to quantify the effect of the flow on fish selection of the physical conditions of their habitat (e.g. water velocity). Results obtained in the previous chapters suggest that pike living in the regulated river might be subjected to higher water velocities than fish living in the unregulated river. This novel tool will allow us to validate this hypothesis. Lastly, basal and maximum acute stress-induced concentrations in plasma cortisol, and blood glucose and lactate were quantified in pike living in both the regulated and the unregulated rivers. These physiological parameters can give an indication of the fish habitat quality. Our results suggest that fish from the regulated river are able to modulate their plasma cortisol to dampen their HPI-axis responsiveness and avoid chronic stress. This thesis assesses the effects of flow fluctuations on fish using novel approaches, situated at the intersection between the fields of physiology and ecology. It significantly contributes to broaden our knowledge of the mechanisms underlying fish habitat selection in rivers.	cortisol , glucose , lactate , physiologie , Esox lucius L. , stress response , river , fish , habitat selection , physiology , movement	en	18510.0
634	Intégration et topographie fonctionnelles : l'influence de la cécité précoce	The brain’s functional organization shows a remarkable similarity across individuals suggesting that its functional structure is innate. However, this observation is not unequivocal for the brain is also plastic; its organization is subject to changes following important early life experiences. Of such event, early or congenital vision-loss features among the most outstanding. Following blindness, cerebral regions usually involved with visual analysis (e.g. occipital lobes) are reorganized to process auditory, tactile, and olfactory stimuli, as well as higher order cognitive tasks such as memory and language.  Recent studies on blind individuals have focused on the relationship between the reorganization of the occipital lobes and the fundamental organizational principles of the brain: functional localization and integration. The first indicates that specific functions take place within circumscribed cerebral regions, whereas the second indicates that these regions communicate together. However, the extent to which blindness influences the brain’s organization is still unknown. First, the topography of modules possessing specific functions has yet to be the object of a direct, in depth, and holistic investigation in blind people. This is true even though module topography is a key characteristic of spatially localized functions. Moreover, studies investigating functional integration in blind individuals appear to contradict those which study integration indirectly. The dependence of results upon the method employed demands further investigation of the elements that might influence integration so that appropriate conclusions can be drawn.    Thus, even though blindness-induced brain plasticity has been the object of multiple studies, its influence upon cerebral organization is partly subject to debate, and must be further defined. Accordingly, the main objective of this thesis was to study the influence of early blindness upon the topography of functional modules and upon functional integration. In order to do so, three distinct experiments were carried.  The first experiment was conceived so as to compare the spatial topographies of functional modules across blind and sighted participants. To this end, a holistic and bias-free method, which made use of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imagery, was developed. Results indicate that only blind people’s occipital poles possess modules which were topographically different from those found in sighted individuals whereas higher level “visual” areas do not show this effect. This suggests that the formation of functional modules within the “visual” cortices depends on both sensory inputs as well as the hierarchical level of a region.   The second experiment of this thesis examined factors which might cause the contradictions observed by studies on blind people’s functional integration. Data obtained from a method devised to measure functional integration, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imagery, were compared to those obtained while participant focused on auditory stimuli. Results are twofold. First, results showed that group differences in functional integration vary as a function of the participant’s cognitive states, suggesting that differences in functional integration observed using resting-state fMRI should be interpreted with caution. Second, our results reveal novel findings pertaining to the occipital poles of blind people; these regions showed strikingly different characteristic following early visual loss which are suggestive of their role in a multitude of networks.   The third experiment of this thesis was designed following the first two. Specifically, it validates a method to examine the functions of blind people’s occipital poles, a region which had been shown to possess reorganized functional characteristics by the first two experiments of this thesis. A new methodology was designed to control the difficulty of a voice discrimination task, showing its validity. Thus, it will be possible to use it in future studies to investigate the function of the occipital lobes in blind people. Furthermore, results from the experiment revealed multiple mechanisms which might underlie voice perception in humans.   Overall, the experiments forming this thesis evidence a reorganisation of the occipital poles’ functional characteristics in early-blind individuals. Additionally, they provide methods needed to investigate the functions of this understudied region. Most importantly, the observation that blind people’s occipital poles show modified functional characteristics paves the way to new hypotheses and studies which will allow to further investigate and deepen our understanding of the human brain and its plasticity.

635	Prédire la déviance au travail : les rôles de l’autonomie et du leadership transformationnel	Organizations dealing with deviant employees are not only less enjoyable work environments, they are also less safe and less productive. While various organizational factors have been shown to increase workplace deviance, relatively little is known about the positive practices that could be implemented to actively reduce deviance in the workplace. The main objective of this dissertation is to examine the relations between key factors of the organizational context and interpersonal and organizational deviance. Based on self-determination theory, we postulate that autonomy in the workplace, work motivation, and the organizational social context are of primary importance in the reduction of deviant behaviors. More specifically, two articles explore the role of autonomy at work and management style (i.e., transformational leadership), respectively, in the prediction of workplace deviance.  In the first article, a model is proposed where employees who have more autonomy at work should engage in less organizational deviance. We also investigate the mechanisms underlying this association and postulate that identified motivation mediates this relation. Three studies conducted in a variety of settings (workplaces or laboratory experiments), countries (Canada or Greece), populations (employees or students), and assessment methods (self-reported or objective assessment) showed that employees who experienced more autonomy at work tended to engage in lower levels of organizational deviance. Two studies also showed that this relation was fully mediated by identified motivation. Thus, employees’ experiences of autonomy at work seem to foster higher levels of identified motivation towards work, which in turn predict lower levels of organizational deviance.   In the second article, we examine group and individual level perceptions of transformational leadership (TFL) as negative longitudinal predictors of indirect exposure to person- (e.g., insults/affronts) and work-related psychological violence (e.g., negation/intentional work overload) at work. TFL and workplace violence were also postulated to predict employee psychological need satisfaction (autonomy, competence, and relatedness). Results from multilevel analyses showed that workgroups where managers were perceived to engage in more frequent TFL behaviors reported reduced levels of person- and work-related psychological violence one year later. These associations were observed at the group and individual level. However, TFL did not predict change in psychological need satisfaction one year later at either level of analysis. Finally, although group-level violence did not predict change in need satisfaction one year later, witnessing higher levels of person-related violence than one’s colleagues predicted reduced satisfaction of the need for relatedness one year later at the individual level. These findings identify TFL as a potential managerial strategy to reduce psychological violence in workgroups. The implications of these findings for human resource management are discussed. Future research directions, aimed at increasing knowledge on the role of autonomy in reducing workplace deviance, are also presented.

636	Tests de permutation d’indépendance en analyse multivariée	The main result establishes the equivalence in terms of power between the alpha-distance covariance test and the Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC) test with the characteristic kernel of a stable probability distribution of index alpha with sufficiently small scale parameters. Large-scale simulations reveal the superiority of these two tests over other tests based on the empirical independence copula process. They also establish the usefulness of the lesser known Pearson type III approximation to the exact permutation distribution. This approximation yields tests with more accurate type I error rates than the gamma approximation usually used for HSIC, especially when dimensions of the two vectors are large. A new method for scale parameter selection in HSIC tests is proposed which improves power performance in three simulations, two of which are from machine learning. The problem of testing mutual independence between many random vectors is addressed. The closely related problem of testing serial independence of a multivariate stationary sequence is also considered. The Möbius transformation of characteristic functions is used to characterize independence. A generalization to p vectors of the alpha -distance covariance test and the Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC) test with the characteristic kernel of a stable probability distributionof index alpha is obtained. It is shown that an HSIC test with sufficiently small scale parameters is equivalent to an alpha -distance covariance test. Weak convergence of the HSIC test is established. A very fast and accurate computation of p-values uses the Pearson type III approximation which successfully approaches the exact permutation distribution of the tests. This approximation relies on the exact first three moments of the permutation distribution of any test which can be expressed as the sum of all elements of a componentwise product of p doubly-centered matrices. The alpha -distance covariance test and the HSIC test are both of this form. A new selection method is proposed for the scale parameter of the characteristic kernel of the HSIC test. It is shown in a simulation that this adaptive HSIC test has higher power than the alpha-distance covariance test when data are generated from a Student copula. Applications are given to environmental and financial data.

637	Aide à l'identification de relations lexicales au moyen de la sémantique distributionnelle et son application à un corpus bilingue du domaine de l'environnement	Identifying semantic relations is one of the main tasks involved in terminology work. This task, which aims to establish links between terms whose meanings are related, can be assisted by computational methods, including those based on distributional semantics. These methods estimate the semantic similarity of words based on corpus data, which can help terminologists identify semantic relations. The quality of the results produced by distributional methods depends on several decisions that must be made when applying them, such as choosing a model and selecting its parameters. In turn, these decisions depend on various factors related to the target application, such as the types of semantic relations one wishes to identify. These can include typical paradigmatic relations such as (near-)synonymy (e.g. preserve -> protect), but also other relations such as syntactic derivation (e.g. preserve -> preservation). This dissertation aims to further the development of a methodological framework based on distributional semantics for the identification of semantic relations using specialized corpora. To this end, we investigate how various aspects of terminology work must be accounted for when selecting a distributional semantic model and its parameters, as well as those of the method used to query the model. These aspects include the descriptive framework, the target relations, the part of speech of the terms being described, and the language (in this case, French or English). Our results show that two of the relations that distributional semantic models capture most accurately are (near-)synonymy and syntactic derivation. However, the models that produce the best results for these two relations are very different. Thus, the target relations are an important factor to consider when choosing a model and tuning it to obtain the most accurate results. Another factor that should be considered is the part of speech of the terms that are being worked on. Among other things, our results suggest that relations between verbs are not captured as accurately as those between nouns or adjectives by distributional semantic models. The descriptive framework used for a given project is also an important factor to consider. In this work, we compare two descriptive frameworks, one based on lexical semantics and another based on frame semantics. Our results show that terms that evoke the same semantic frame are not captured as accurately as certain semantic relations, such as synonymy. We show that this is due to (at least) two reasons: a high percentage of frame-evoking terms are verbs, and the models that capture syntactic derivation most accurately are very different than those that work best for typical paradigmatic relations such as synonymy. In summary, we evaluate two different distributional semantic models, we analyze the influence of their parameters, and we investigate how this influence varies with respect to various aspects of terminology work. We show many examples of distributional neighbourhoods, which we explore using graphs, and discuss sources of noise. This dissertation thus provides important guidelines for the use of distributional semantic models for terminology work.

638	Prédiction du délai d'attente en temps réel et modélisation des durées de service dans les centres d'appels multi-compétences	In this thesis, we begin with the study of delay prediction of customers in multiskill call centers. Waiting time has an important impact on the quality of service experienced by customers.  Delay announcement can reduce customer uncertainty about its delay time. It also can increase customer satisfaction and reduce the number of abandonments. This requires having a good delay predictor. Unfortunately existing predictors are not adapted for multiskill call centers.  We propose three types of predictors that use machine learning: the first uses regression cubic splines, the second employs artificial neural networks, and the latter uses the stochastic kriging. The predictors take as inputs the delay of the last customer of the same type to enter service, the arrival period of the new customer, the staffing of agents groups, the queue length of the same type, and the queue lengths of types served by the same agents. These predictors work well for multiskill call centers, but one drawback is that they have a large number of parameters that must be learned in advance during the training phase that requires a large amount of data and computional time.  We also propose two new delay predictors that are very simple to implement, require little optimization effort,  do not need any data, and are applicable in multiskill call centers. They are based on the wait times of previous customers of the same class. The first one estimates the delay of a new customer by extrapolating the wait history of customers currently in queue, plus the delay of last one that started service, and taking a weighted average. The second one takes a weighted average of the delays of the past customers of the same class that have found the same queue length when they arrived.   Next in this thesis, we are also interested in modelling service time in call centers. In general, the standard Erlang queueing models are used to analyze call centers operations. In these models, agent service times are modelled as independent and identically distributed  exponential random variables with a constant mean. Several recent studies have shown that the distribution of service time is: time-dependent, lognormal rather than exponential, and distinct by agent.   We propose a more realistic modelling of service times in call centers that takes into account multiple properties observed in real life data. Our models take into account: the heterogeneity of agents, the time dependence, serial correlation between service time of an agent for the same call type, and the cross-correlations between several call types served by the same agent. We show that these models predict agent average service time better than the considered benchmark models. Thereafter, we show by simulation that these more realistic models lead to system performance predictions significantly different from those of the benchmark models, and decisions that manager could take by observing this data can lead to important cost savings in practice.

639	Geographies of Care and Posthuman Relationality in North American Fiction by Women	This dissertation explores how seven contemporary North-American novels written by women illustrate the primacy of relationality. To achieve this goal, I use the notions of “geographies of care” and “posthuman care” critically to uncover, in the texts, gestures, and attitudes of care that facilitate, despite obstacles, the appropriation of social and intimate structures through the development of spaces and relationships of solidarity. This study places caring and discursive practices into dialogue to circumscribe “les inégalités structurelles et les enjeux de domination qui touchent les sujets marginalisés” (Bourgault & Perreault 11). The first chapter consists of a theoretical discussion at the intersection of emotional geography (Davidson, Bondi & Smith, Anderson & Smith), feminist space theory (Shands, Miranne & Young, Massey), care ethics (Laugier, Tronto, DeFalco), and critical posthumanism (Braidotti, Hayle). I expose the interconnections between care and relational space before showing the relevance of geographies of care over the notion of home. Finally, I introduce the idea of posthuman care as a critical tool for reading new subjectivities and for complicating the input of care when intersubjective relations involve the nonhuman. Chapter two explores caring and spatial preservation and protection practices in the novels Housekeeping and Room, by looking at how each text illustrates difficulties of caregiving and care receiving in contexts of patriarchal oppression, social marginalization, and familial tensions. It also sets certain theoretical and methodological beacons regarding the reading and the configuring, as a privileged reader, of representations of fragile subjectivities and spaces of domination in the texts. The third chapter investigates two novels that dramatize domestic spaces marked by exclusion, power dynamics, and control of the body: The Birth House and Sous béton. In both novels the geographies of care expose complex links between notions of relational proximity, belonging and autonomy as the characters’ everyday struggle is characterized by constraining social, moral and scientific conventions that tend to dehumanize those who do not fit.  Chapter four analyzes how the burden of trauma and ghostly figures affect the relational experiences of characters, their sense of hospitality and ability to heal. The novels Home and Le ciel de Bay City illustrate how these ghostly figures symbolize and testify to the interconnections between memory, trauma, and responsibility and uncover links between past and present that care illuminates. And finally, Chapter five addresses the notion of “posthuman care” directly by returning to Sous béton and Room, in which the characters evolve through interactions with the nonhuman. I also address the post-apocalyptic novel The Year of the Flood, in which the protagonists make use of strategies of resistance that foster solidarity, healing, and easier adaptation to techno-scientific excesses.	sujets marginalisés , Contemporary literature , Ethics of care , Posthuman , Lived space , Geographies of care , marginalized subjects	en	18452.0
640	Dessiner une écosophie transductive : matières résiduelles, milieux associés, arts technologiques	Multiple crises over the last several decades demonstrate the entanglement of materialities, humans, and technologies. Despite the 3RV-Es (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Valorisation and Elimination), waste increases. This media-based research-creation dissertation is an investigation of technological artistic experimentation with residual matter as aesthetic/political engagement. This dissertation is concerned with what wastewater treatment, engineered landfill sites, and atmospheric and electromagnetic pollution create. I analyze how these operations are at the very heart of artworks produced since 2006 by Ælab, an artistic research unit I cofounded with composer Stéphane Claude in 1996. Joselita Ciaravino, Gilles Deleuze, Félix Guattari, Brian Massumi, Gilbert Simondon, and Isabelle Stengers are my primary philosophical allies. Ciaravino discusses disegno’s third order, a form of non-representational drawing practiced by da Vinci during the Renaissance. This type of drawing activates a transduction process as described by Simondon: a disruptive element participating in a milieu under tension triggers a potential energy discharge that overflows onto neighbouring elements, which can, in turn, generate new pivots of interrelation. These assemblages recall Guattari’s discussion of ecosophy, a dynamic, triple intertwining of subjectivation, collectivity, and the environment that provides fertile milieus to follow the transductions art brings about. A new force accompanies their drawing and a “paying attention” (Stengers) emerges, act of resistance and solidarity. Ethico-aesthetic experiments with waste are a way of questioning dualisms that may hamper the technological exploration of materialities in order to participate in the transductive reticulation of ecosophy. Working with waste creates an amplified relation; it amplifies a technological practice that, as it resingularizes, also extends to collectivities. This dissertation presents five chapters in which practice and theory meet. In each, two concepts are placed in dialogue: Drawing and Diagrammatic; Milieus and Intervals; Translation and Transduction; Ecosophy and Paying Attention; Postmedia and Commons. “Blocks of sensation” (Deleuze and Guattari) arise between theorization and an a-chronological telling of artistic practice, one “through” (au travers) the other (perScapere), one with the other. The works build a plan of composition (Deleuze and Guattari) I call the “perse_plan”. The phases of the perse_plan are split by the actions of fissure, interval, undulation, and cascade. These phases are the result of ontogenetic experimentation through five artworks and their related processes interconnected with digital drawing, video, audio, light, materialities, sensors, performances, and installations. Across thresholds and various resonances, their “associated milieus” (Simondon) are drawn out over time.	perScapere , transduction , pollution , milieu , sensation , Drawing , Diagrammatic , Ecosophy , Technological arts , Waste , Ontogenesis	en	18444.0
641	Étude de la diversité des populations historiques de Montréal et de Québec par l’analyse de la morphologie dentaire : le cimetière catholique de la première église Notre-Dame (1691-1796) et le cimetière protestant Saint-Matthew de Québec (1771-1860)	Two colonisation events occurred in Quebec, from 1608 to 1763 (New France), and after 1763 (British Regime), providing new waves of immigrants. In order to examine differences and similarities between the latter waves and the possible interactions between the immigrants and the local communities already living on the territory, dental morphology, which allows us to propose paleogenetic interpretations on the ancestry of past populations, has been analysed for the following two groups: 37 individuals from the cemetery of the Première Église Notre-Dame in Montreal (1691-1796); and 61 individuals from the cemetery of Saint-Matthew in Quebec City (1771-1860). We used the Arizona State University’s -Dental Anthropology System protocol for the observation of dental traits. Mean measures of divergence and population heterogeneity analysis (R Matrix and Fst modified for non-metric data) were calculated. Biodistance values confirm that the majority of the analysed individuals from both collections were of European ancestry. However, intra-population analysis was able to identify certain individuals who were closer to Native American variation. Furthermore, results of R matrix and Fst tests showed that Notre-Dame sample was slightly more heterogeneous. It seemed to have incorporated more of a Native American component than Saint-Matthew, probably through admixture, which was a consequence of the assimilation of “Christianised” Native Americans within the early colonial society. Therefore, although our results are preliminary, interactions between Europeans and local groups seem to have changed through time as a result of colonisation. The higher levels of admixture in the 18th century Montreal (in comparison to the 19th century Quebec City) might reflect a rather urgent need from the first European migrants to set up alliances with Native Americans for the long-term viability of the colony.

642	Identification des freins et leviers associés à l’expérience de la mise en oeuvre de l’autodéclaration environnementale au coeur de PME québécoises	Ubiquitous in the business management’s strategy, environmental issues are a distinctive factor in what drives the manufacturing sector. Taking part in a trend that requires a high level of enthusiasm, environmental concerns of manufactured products are on the rise as of recent. Based on the ideology of sustainable development and on eco-design statements, companies tend to take advantage of environmental properties by using it as a main sales argument. As a result, environmental communication is gaining more and more importance through advertising so-called green marketing. Self-declaration is among these communications tools. Self-declaration is the most permissive tool and allows great freedom to manufacturers. In regard to its flexibility, it lacks guidelines. Therefore, it often results in a miscommunication and a misunderstanding where veracity can be questioned. The lack of accuracy of the argument can be the result of the industry’s unwillingness or a good will with pitfalls concerning the comprehension and use of the norm’s guidelines. The opinion of stakeholders is thus divided. Therefore, the reputation of self-declaration has been under the spotlight for sometime. Although being the simplest, cheapest and less time-consuming of all environmental tools, self-declaration is still highly used in the manufacturing industry. As 98 % of Québec’s industry is represented by small businesses (BDC, 2011:1), their reality of having limited resources makes it appropriate to use self-declaration. The popularity of the environmental compliance attracts consumers interest towards green products. However, the global controversy about those tends to impair consumers’ craze. In some cases, it may favor a cautious attitude and suggest a marketing skeems. This is likely to extrapolate and generalize consumers’ negative perceptions towards the entire green products market segment. The companies’ ethical principles are being questioned. The lack of accuracy of the argument due to the tool’s insufficient directives makes it hard to defend their arguments.  This qualitative research aims to highlight the self-declaration procedures. This multiples case study document the path of small and medium businesses in Québec concerned with self-declared environmental approaches; both business managers and advisors of the Institute of Product Development are invited to semi-directed interviews. The data analysis presents the benefits of the use of “double labeling”. This strategy combines the benefits of certification and self-declaration. In the process of strategically enhancing the standing of self-declaration, ‘double labelling’ would be an option to adopt, the ultimate goal being a well deserved recognition of its merits. This research invites industrial designers to get more involved in the development of communication, due to their skills and knowledge.

643	Rôle des polysaccharides de surface dans la formation des biofilms et rôle du biofilm d’Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae dans la pathogénicité	"Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae is a Gram-negative bacterium belonging to the Pasteurellaceae family and the causative agent of porcine pleuropneumonia, a highly contagious disease that causes important economic losses to the swine industry worldwide. Several virulence factors of A. pleuropneumoniae have been identified. These factors include the Apx toxins, iron uptake systems and surface polysaccharides. Surface polysaccharides including lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and capsular polysaccharides (CPS) are implicated in the adhesion of A. pleuropneumoniae. Recent literature indicates that A. pleuropneumoniae has the ability to rapidly form a biofilm rich in poly-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (PGA). However, the role of the biofilm in the pathogenesis as well as factors and signals involved in are little known to date. In this study, we demonstrated that the LPS O antigen plays an important role in the biofilm formation by A. pleuropneumoniae whether in a static model or a dynamic model under continuous flow, the ""drip flow reactor"" which is more representative of the lung environment. While truncation of the LPS core oligosaccharide or the absence of CPS did not have any effect, absence of O antigen markedly reduced the ability of A. pleuropneumoniae serotype 1 to form a mature biofilm. This finding was linked for the O-antigen mutant to a reduced pgaA expression and, consequently, a reduced PGA production. Indeed, compared to the parental or other strains, the biofilm of the O-antigen mutant was dramatically reduced and it had less cell-associated PGA. Real-time PCR analyses revealed a significant reduction in the level of pgaA which encodes for biosynthesis of PGA. Interestingly, the O-antigen mutant also exhibited reduced expression of stress extracytoplasmic CpxRA system. Expression of CpxRA system was also investigated during the exposure of field isolates of A. pleuropneumoniae to sub-minimal inhibitory concentrations of penicillin G (sub-MICs of PG). III   Surprisingly, cpxR, cpxA and pgaA expression was increased after exposure to sub-MICs of PG. The up-regulation of these genes was followed by an increase of the capacity of the studied strains to form a biofilm as well as a change in the composition of the induced biofilm extracellular matrix. These results suggest that sub-MICs of PG seem to act as activators signal towards biofilms of A. pleuropneumoniae. Finally, experiments to establish the involvement of the biofilm in the immune evasion of A. pleuropneumoniae have shown that biofilm cells have weaker ability to stimulate innate immune cells compared to planktonic bacteria. Using mass spectrometry, we demonstrated a different distribution of structures of lipid A of LPS between planktonic bacteria and those of the biofilm. These structural changes in the lipid A could explain, at least in part, the reduction of the inflammatory response following exposure of macrophages to A. pleuropneumoniae biofilm cells compared to their planktonic counterparts. During this project, we were able to identify new factors important for biofilm formation of A. pleuropneumoniae allowing us to better understand the biofilm formation and its involvement in pathogenicity."

644	Analyse des relations entre les pratiques professionnelles réfléchies et le bien-être pédagogique des enseignants du secondaire	This research explores the relations between the well-designed professional practices of high school teachers and their educational well-being. To do this, we conducted an exploratory research, with a qualitative dominance, among eleven female and two male high school teachers from the Greater Montreal Area. We adopted a sociocognitive approach to document their levels of reflection throughout their relations with their students and colleagues and their relations with dimensions of educational well-being among high school teachers. We used two data collection techniques: the Q technique and critical incident technique. To explore these links, we started by examining the change level model of Korthagen and Vasalos (2005), which highlighted the interactions between the specific reflections of six levels of reflection: work environment, schooling-centered behaviors, class management skills, professional beliefs and identify and mission with students. We then explored the concept of the educational well-being of teachers. According to the overall results of our research, the educational well-being of high school teachers is both a dynamic process whose evolution is influenced by what is going on in the work environment, especially in the classroom, and by the teacher’s essential qualities, and a construct based on specific dimensions; three dimensions were used in this study: self-efficacy, commitment and job satisfaction. Educational relations with students seem to be the main source of educational well-being for teachers. Believing in the efficiency of their class management skills and noticing that students are happy to be in their class and are involved in their learning apparently stimulates the commitment and job satisfaction of teachers. Reflections on the characteristics and background of students, including their well-being in the classroom, and professional skills seem to be the aspects of interactions with students that affect the educational well-being of teachers the most. As for interactions between work relations with their colleagues, they seem to have a positive impact on educational well-being, namely through collective reflections on the ordinary situations of professional practices. Lastly, despite certain methodological and conceptual limitations, this study highlights the existence of empirical links between well-designed practices and the educational well-being of high school teachers. It also identifies directions for future research on the reciprocal influences between educational practices and educational well-being, and proposes foresight research ideas.	well-designed practices , pedagogical well-being , sociocognitive approach , work environment , professional skills , professional identity , self-efficacy , commitment , job satisfaction	en	18375.0
645	Saberes profesionales de docentes en educación preescolar que laboran con niñez menor de tres años de edad : un estudio en Costa Rica	This research approaches the universe of the teaching knowledge from the perspective of the professionals who work in Preschool Education in Costa Rica. Its object of study is the problem of the knowledge foundation which is the basis of their work during the care and education of children below three years of age. Consequently, the general objective of the investigation is focused on the identification, according to the very same preschool teachers, of the knowledge required for teaching practice, focusing on: (a) the acquisition sources of their teaching knowledge, (b) the perception that the teachers in Preschool Education deal with the student population from 0 to 3 years, as well as the other necessary knowledge areas to be able to act and (c) to examine how the teachers move that knowledge in the exercise of their profession. This qualitative research was done from a comprehensive approach with the intention to find data and attempt to build and rebuild its meaning. The research took place in Costa Rica. Twenty three female preschool teachers who met the required criteria such as having a university degree, work experience and practice in both the private and public education sectors participated.  The methodological instruments provided were a semi-structured interview and the Instructions to Sosia. All the participants answered after signing a free consent letter approved by the Ethics’ Committee of the University of Montreal.  Data underwent a process of analysis supported with QdaMiner software and next came the creation of an initial classification and data organization stages, the general reading of the interview results and the assignment of preliminary categories as well as the creation of templates for the final encoding. The results can be seen according to three axes:  (1) Knowledge Acquisition Sources, which contemplates those emanating from their personal life history, those from early and continuous education, and those provided by work experience with children less than 3 years of age;  (2) Necessary knowledge to be able to work with infants from 0 to 3 years of age, comprising various types of knowledge which include personal and professional life; the knowledge from study disciplines regarding infant development, knowledge about learning theories and several other education-related disciplines; pedagogical knowledge derived from experience, related to educational proposal design, teaching, methodology and the evaluation of infants;  work management suitable to the characteristics of the job description,  its routine and relations with the family; finally (3) Moving of knowledge in their pedagogical practice, focused on built and reformulated knowledge learned throughout the daily teaching practice. These three axes are comprised by subcategories and after their introduction and discussion, it was possible to notice that knowledge is acquired through the contact and relation available in the different interactional spaces of development with the others, such as professional development and the teaching practice. The highest value from all these sources of knowledge was granted to the professional practice and the teaching experience inside the classroom, which allows the teacher to reformulate, to modify and reshape perceptions of the teaching-learning process.  The participants registered a wide range of knowledge pointing towards a complexity of sources in their professional practice which transcends the vision of preschool teachers as “caretakers” and places them as professionals. This has a tremendous repercussion in the educational development of their pupils. In general, teachers´ knowledge is strongly linked with the job context and it is a constant subject to be tested, reflected upon and modified, due to the movement of knowledge in their pedagogical practice. In addition, it is possible to identify the failures, knowledge blanks, targets of criticism and needs that the participants mentioned as key aspects to reflect upon, the relationship between the early and the continuous educational background, just as with the curricular support material and the work conditions. In this way, it is concluded that the research satisfied the set objectives. In addition, it has contributed to the thinking of improvements in preschool teacher training, being a timely opportunity to insert the topic of knowledge as an area for discussion and reflection during the process of knowledge acquisition of the professional teaching practicum.

646	Reconciling transition paradigms : a cross-national analysis of democratization during the third wave	"This thesis studies transitions from authoritarianism that lead to democracy. We ask: Which conditions are necessary for the instauration of a minimally democratic regime? Our answer to this question is that successful democratization hinges on the presence of essentially two factors: (1) pressure ""from below"" in the form of mass mobilization; and (2) willingness ""from above"" to carry out reforms, evidenced by a crisis of the authoritarian regime. On one hand, mass mobilization is an unmistakable indicator to rulers that liberalization is inevitable. It shakes up the internal unity of the ruling block and fulfils a crucial watchdog function throughout the transition process. On the other hand, reform is only possible if moderate forces embracing the idea of opening up the political space manage to grab ""the reins of power"" within the authoritarian regime. Both elements are thus key to understanding why and how countries democratize. To demonstrate our argument we examine twenty-five transition cases between 1973 and 2004 using multi-value qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) and supplement our results with three illustrative case studies of Tanzania, Togo and Indonesia. The central contribution of our thesis is to reconcile the two main theoretical debates in the democratization literature by showing the complementarity of theories on transitions ""from above"" and transitions ""from below""."

647	L’inscription du corps sourd dans le texte : mondes et langages chez Emmanuelle Laborit et Carson McCullers	This master’s thesis addresses the problems that the inscription of deafness and the deaf body in writing pose to representation. The Cry of the Gull, an autobiography by Emmanuelle Laborit and The Heart is a Lonely Hunter by Carson McCullers are the works compared. McCullers, through a grotesque esthetic, shows how a signing Deaf person reveals another world in potential via utopian utterances imbued with materialism. Emmanuelle Laborit is Deaf. Her writing is therefore subject to many constraints, amongst which is the problem of double translation: gesture to voice and voice to script. Laborit, to legitimize her discourse, emulates a voice and must reproduce it in text through metaphor. The traces of the hearing world are contained in its language. When hearing language represents a deaf body, in the ensuing inadequacy a way into a deaf world is opened where transcription, in the necessary translation, is overwhelmed. The trace of the body appears at the limit of language and its matter, locus of a possible encounter, revealing the hearing person’s world.

648	Coreference resolution with and for Wikipedia	Wikipedia is a resource of choice exploited in many NLP applications, yet we are not aware of recent attempts to adapt coreference resolution to this resource, a prelim- inary step to understand Wikipedia texts. The first part of this master thesis is to build an English coreference corpus, where all documents are from the English version of Wikipedia. We annotated each markable with coreference type, mention type and the equivalent Freebase topic. Our corpus has no restriction on the topics of the documents being annotated, and documents of various sizes have been considered for annotation. Our annotation scheme follows the one of OntoNotes with a few disparities. In part two, we propose a testbed for evaluating coreference systems in a simple task of measuring the particulars of the concept described in a Wikipedia page (eg. The statements of Pres- ident Obama the Wikipedia page dedicated to that person). We show that by exploiting the Wikipedia markup (categories, redirects, infoboxes, etc.) of a document, as well as links to external knowledge bases such as Freebase (information of the type, num- ber, type of relationship with other entities, etc.), we can acquire useful information on entities that helps to classify mentions as coreferent or not.

649	Impact du résidu voisin sur le pKa des peptides et leurs mobilités en électrophorèse capillaire	All theoretical, mathematical and empirical models used to evaluate the electrophoretic mobilities of peptides use three basic parameters: the peptide mass, its number of residues (its length) and its charge. However, all models have a common flaw: the charge parameter (q). When estimating this variable, the use of approximations for the ionization constants (pKa) leads to imprecise values for the calculation. One solution is to limit the development of mobility models to only low pH and assume full protonation of all acidic and basic groups.  In order to understand the effect of the neighboring amino acid (a.a.) residue on the terminal carboxylate and amine functions of a peptide (Cʹ et Nʹ), the pKa values of multiple series of peptides were determined by capillary electrophoresis (CE) using an optimized method. The peptides studied were of the form Z-X and X-Z, where X was one or multiple variable residues and Z was an invariable residue such as phenylalanine, glycine or alanine. The core of this project consisted of determining the actual Cʹ and Nʹ pKa values for 69 peptides to elucidate the effect of their immediate microenvironment. i.e., the effect of their nearest neighbor. This systematic compilation of pKa’s is an approach that is rarely used. With these values on hand, the uncertainty of the ionisation constant that most authors face is almost eliminated and the analysis of the electrophoretic behavior of peptides can be enhanced.  For the peptides studied, we observed that increasing the hydrophobicity of residue X lead to a decrease in Cʹ and Nʹ pKa values, but to different degrees depending on the terminal residue (Z) studied. Hydrophilic X residues possess charged or highly polar side-chains, which influenced Cʹ and Nʹ ionisations to a greater degree than hydrophobic X residues. Additionally, the elongation of a peptide from one to six residues, such as the oligoglycine series studied, lead to an increase in pKa-Cʹ and a decrease in pKa-Nʹ, which might be explained by a diminishing electrostatic interaction between the Cʹ and Nʹ functional groups. These results illustrate that the Cʹ and Nʹ pKa values for peptides are not accurate when based solely on the identity of the Cʹ and Nʹ a.a. residues, which is the classical way peptide charge is estimated for modeling not only mobilities but also chemical and biological reactivity. Potentiometric titration of dipeptides produced pKa values that were compared to pKa’s determined by CE. Significant discrepancies were obtained which brought to light the necessity of rigorously controlling experimental protocols when comparing results obtained with two techniques. Mobility data for high and low pHs were calculated using experimental and literature tabulated pKa values to estimate charge and to therefore understand the benefit gained when applying the Offord mobility model. Finally, simulations of separating 9 peptides by CE were carried out with the computer program PeakMaster and compared with experimental results. This showed the utility and superiority of our cumulated pKa values versus the most widely cited approximate pKa values from the literature.	pKa , Capillary electrophoresis , Peptide mobility , Peptide charge , Theoretical models , Separation simulation	en	18330.0
650	L’expérience coloniale anglaise et les relations interculturelles au Québec	Quebecers are now struggling with the presence of new immigrants in the province which many identified as an « identity crisis ». From 2006 onwards, many debates on the question were widely broadcasted in the media and extensively discussed within academia and NGOs, ultimately affecting the political sphere. Those debates revealed a constant nervousness of the French Canadian population of Quebec that immigrants were invading the province, refusing to adopt Quebec’s unique culture, leaving them as a marginalized alienated community on their own territory. This fear seems to have its origins in the British colonial era of the 18th century, then transformed into the modern nationalist movement that reemerged in the middle of the 20th century. A question then arises : What are the effects of the British colonial era on the way Quebecers understand and interact with immigrants ? We argue that it resulted in an unconscious cultural reflex, maintained by a lack of historical consciousness, to protect itself from potential new invaders influencing the mechanisms of how Quebecers understand the Other. As understanding has great effects on action, this view ultimately affected intercultural relations and interactions. Through interviews with Quebec’s French Canadians and immigrants, we showed the influence of that fear in understanding and discourse and explored how immigrants react to Quebec’s situation.

651	The introduction of real numbers in secondary education. An institutional analysis of textbooks	In this paper we analyse the introduction of irrational and real numbers in secondary textbooks, and specifically the propositions on how these should be taught, in a sample of Brazilian textbooks used in state schools and approved by the Ministry of Education. The analyses discussed in this paper follow an institutional perspective (using Chevallard's Anthropological Theory of Didactics). Our results indicate that the notion of irrational number is generally introduced on the basis of the decimal representation of numbers, and that the mathematical need for the construction of the field of real numbers remains unclear in the textbooks. It seems that textbooks used in secondary teaching institutions develop mathematical organisations which focus on the practical block.	real numbers , irrational numbers , textbooks analysis , praxeology , mathematical organisation	en	18324.0

653	La réalisation d’instruments de mesure électroniques : une intervention didactique pour l’apprentissage interdisciplinaire en science expérimentale, en mathématique et en technologie	Our developmental research in didactics has focused on two distinct aspects : The students' active engagement under the constructivist paradigms of competency-based learning and the technological enhancement of laboratory settings using the new MicrolabExAO environment. Towards these ends, we have explored the teaching possibilities offered by MicrolabExAO which allows learners to design their own electronic measuring tools with the computer assisted experimentation. By developing an appropriated teaching intervention, we wanted to enable the student not only to build his/her tools, but also to understand how they work. Through the actual implementation of four measuring tools, the student has progressively developed his/her own approach to resolving complex problems which call upon knowledge and skills in experimental sciences, mathematics and technology. In the final activity of the teaching intervention, with the objective of assessing the level of integration of this technoscientific approach, we have asked the learners to apply their new knowledge within the framework of building a manometer on their own. In doing so, the learners have deployed their knowledge and skills in experimental sciences, mathematics and technology in order to build the measuring tool and to explain its functioning, thereby achieving interdisciplinary learning. Since they have been given neither instructions from the teacher, nor operating protocols, we can say that they have been put in an adidactical situation which allowed them to demonstrate interdisciplinary expertise in their approach.	developmental research , computer assisted experimentation , measuring tool , adidactical situation , teaching intervention , interdisciplinarity	en	16443.0
654	La rétroaction corrective à l’écrit et la révision des apprenants de français langue seconde	Corrective feedback (CF) is defined as “an indication to a learner that his or her use of the target language is correct” (Lightbown and Spada, 2006, p.197). When the written product is revised, the learner reacts to corrective feedback in different ways. This study focuses on two aspects: it focuses on the various CF techniques used by teachers of French as a second language in six ‘accueil’ classrooms in Montreal, and it focuses on the reaction of 64 students in these classrooms, to these techniques in their revision process. How the teacher’s corrective feedback was incorporated in the revision process varied according to the student’s proficiency level (weak or strong), their grade level (elementary or secondary), their learning difficulties, their error types and the CF techniques used. The student’s written product, composed of 150 words, was analyzed. The results indicate that the teachers of French as a second language vary their CF techniques according to the variables. Corrective Feedback, overall, effected the student’s revision.	Revision , Feedback , Proficiency levels , Error types , Learning difficulties , Second language	en	16440.0
655	Le goût musical favorise-t-il le déplacement social chez les adolescents en milieu scolaire?	This project was conceived to allow us to illustrate in what ways musical taste intervenes in the social interactions of Montreal teenagers in their school environment.  In order to develop a working image of our target subjects, we polled over 150 students of the Montreal School Board in three learning establishments. This permitted us to identify and quantify the diversity of our subject’s musical tastes, how it affects their interactions with their peers, and how they use it to navigate their social environment. Using Glevarec and Pinet’s (2009) taste island concept, we were able to differentiate and organize the musical taste of our students by regrouping their favorite musical genres according to similarities (Rock, Punk, Metal) in style and by their social usage (Rap, Hip-Hop, Dance music).  Students who preferred genres who were closely related in any ways were not considered to have a diverse musical taste.  To have a diversified taste, the student needed to like more than two genres that belonged to archipelagos that were not linked.  With the data that was collected, we were able to produce a valid working image of our subjects.  Most of them had a limited musical taste but were still able to talk about music with people with different musical tastes.  They maximised their knowledge of popular music and social news about their favorite artists to create social networks with their peers.  They preferred listening to music in private and during their down time (in the bus, between classes), but tended to get their social knowledge and references from friends and via the internet and virtual networks.  Those who had a diverse musical taste liked mostly Rock music and had an eclectic group of friends.  The complexity of their taste made it harder for them to be recognized by the music they liked, but it made it a lot easier to join peer groups.  These students showed the most social competences and prosocial skills and had much more rooted relation with music, than their peers with a limited taste.

656	Comparaison entre la simulation d’alignement du ClinCheck® et les modèles numériques finaux des patients traités par la technique Invisalign® avec ou sans l’appareil AcceleDent®	INTRODUCTION: While there are presently many different options for aesthetic orthodontic treatment, patients are now concerned with the length of treatment. The AcceleDent® device was introduced by OrthoAccel Technologies in 2009. This device is placed between the teeth for 20 minutes a day, vibrates at a frequency of 30 Hz and is recommended to accelerate orthodontic treatment. This study’s primary objective is to evaluate the accuracy of the ClinCheck® simulation versus the actual final results. The secondary objective is to determine if the end result is influenced by the increased rate of treatment progression with the aligners.   MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study design was used with 38 patients treated with Invisalign®. The experimental group consisted of 13 patients, while the control group included 25 patients. The severity of malocclusion was quantified with the Discrepancy Index approved by the American Board of Orthodontics. In addition, the ABO’s Objective Grading System was used to compare the prediction of the final result provided by the ClinCheck® simulation and the actual final treatment result. All data were taken from the OrthoCAD software (Cadent, Fairview, NJ).   RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: There is no statistically significant difference between the two groups regarding their initial malocclusion (p= 0.761). For the final results, there is a statistically significant difference. The alignment is better in the control group (p = 0.002). Within each group, the difference between the predicted and the actual results are not statistically significant (p = 0.056). The use of AcceleDent® seems to give an overjet similar to that which was predicted; however, this finding is not clinically significant.  CONCLUSION: The use of the AcceleDent® combined with changing aligners every seven days negatively influence the final alignment in patients treated with Invisalign®.

657	Health professionals’ and patients’ perspectives on pelvic floor muscle training adherence : 2011 ICS State-of-the-Science Seminar research paper IV of IV	Aims There is scant information on pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) adherence barriers and facilitators. A web-based survey was conducted (1) to investigate whether responses from health professionals and the public broadly reflected findings in the literature, (2) if responses differed between the two groups, and (3) to identify new research directions. Methods Health professional and public surveys were posted on the ICS website. PFMT adherence barriers and facilitators were divided into four categories: physical/condition, patient, therapy, and social-economic. Responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics from quantitative data and thematic data analysis for qualitative data. Results Five hundred and fifteen health professionals and 51 public respondents participated. Both cohorts felt “patient-related factors” constituted the most important adherence barrier, but differed in their rankings of short- and long-term barriers. Health professionals rated “patient-related” and the public “therapy-related” factors as the most important adherence facilitator. Both ranked “perception of PFMT benefit” as the most important long-term facilitator. Contrary to published findings, symptom severity was not ranked highly. Neither cohort felt the barriers nor facilitators differed according to PFM condition (urinary/faecal incontinence, pelvic organ prolapse, pelvic pain); however, a large number of health professionals felt differences existed across age, gender, and ethnicity. Half of respondents in both cohorts felt research barriers and facilitators differed from those in clinical practice. Conclusions An emphasis on “patient-related” factors, ahead of “condition-specific” and “therapy-related,” affecting PFMT adherence barriers was evident. Health professionals need to be aware of the importance of long-term patient perception of PFMT benefits and consider enabling strategies.	adherence , health professionals , patients , pelvic floor muscle training , questionnaire , survey	en	16372.0
658	La pensée mixte : une approche de la composition par l'interaction des pensées instrumentale, électroacoustique et informatique	“Mixed-method thinking” is an approach to composition characterized by the interaction of three streams of compositional thought: instrumental, electroacoustic and computing-based.  It takes the form of a network within which the composer goes back and forth between these three types of conceptualization and succeeds in finding equivalences between parameters.  Instrumental thinking is connected to the Western notated compositional tradition, electroacoustic thinking alludes to practices derived from the analog studio environment and the acousmatic music tradition, and computing-based thinking refers to visual programming and spectral analysis practices.  Common areas exist where all three forms of thinking interact: Ivo Malec’s notion of the instrumental studio, Helmut Lachenmann’s notion of musique concrète instrumentale, computer-assisted composition, spectral music, the montage approach to instrumental composition, acousmatic music inspired by the written musical tradition and genres combining instruments with fixed media or electronics.  These areas comprise the influences around which I composed a corpus of two cycles of works: Les Larmes du Scaphandre and Nano-Cosmos.  Analysis of these works demonstrates the notion of “mixed-method thinking” through the adoption of electroacoustic thinking in my instrumental composition practice, computational thinking in my musical practice, and instrumental thinking in my electroacoustic practice.

659	Le processus décisionnel sous-jacent à la rétroaction corrective des enseignants de français langue seconde à l'oral	The aim of this qualitative study is to describe and understand the underlying decision-making process in the oral corrective feedback of a second language teacher. More specifically, this study describes the main factors which influence the decision to proceed to a corrective feedback as well as those which underlie the choice of a specific feedback technique. Three teachers of French as a second language, with adult immigrants in Canada, participated in this research. Entire teaching sequences were filmed and then presented to participants who commented on their practices. The comments were made in the form of a stimulated recall and an interview. These constitute the data of this research. Results revealed that the corrective feedback and the choice of the technique were influenced by factors related to the error, to the learner, to the curriculum, to the teacher and to the characteristics of corrective feedback techniques. They also revealed that the learner is at the center of the retroactive decision making of the second language teachers. Indeed, participants said that they want to adapt to the learner’s cognitive functioning, to his emotional state, to his language level and to the recurrence of his mistakes. The goal of this study is to contribute to the initial and continuous training of L2 teachers. For this purpose, pedagogical implications were proposed and recommendations were made specifically to notify the L2 teachers about the results of the research regarding the efficiency of the techniques of corrective feedback, particularly those ones which take into account the characteristics of the learners.

660	La subrogation légale de l’assureur en vertu du Code civil : historique, développements et aspects procéduraux	In damage insurance, article 2474 C.c.Q. provides the possibility for the insurer to be legally subrogated to the rights of the insured against the person responsible for the loss, up to the amount of indemnity paid. The insurer may never be subrogated against persons who are members of the household of the insured.  Firstly, the present Master’s thesis makes a historical overview of the right of subrogation of the insurer under the Civil Code. Since the codification of 1865, the principles governing the insurer’s subrogation have not remained static. They were subject of many legislative amendments and numerous controversies and case law developments.  Secondly, a global portrait of the current state of law is made in relation to article 2474 C.c.Q., with regard to the components of the subrogation and its procedural aspects.	2474 C.c.Q. , Legal subrogation , Insurance , Damage insurance , Civil Code of Quebec , Members of the household of the insured , Person responsible , Indemnity , History of the civil law in Quebec	en	16367.0
661	Differences in pelvic floor morphology between continent, stress urinary incontinent, and mixed urinary incontinent elderly women : an MRI study	Aims  To compare magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pelvic floor musculature (PFM), bladder neck and urethral sphincter morphology under three conditions (rest, PFM maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), and straining) in older women with symptoms of stress (SUI) or mixed urinary incontinence (MUI) or without incontinence.   Methods  This 2008–2012 exploratory observational cohort study was conducted with community-dwelling women aged 60 and over. Sixty six women (22 per group), mean age of 67.7 ± 5.2 years, participated in the study. A 3 T MRI examination was conducted under three conditions: rest, PFM MVC, and straining. ANOVA or Kruskal–Wallis tests (data not normally distributed) were conducted, with Bonferroni correction, to compare anatomical measurements between groups.   Results  Women with MUI symptoms had a lower PFM resting position (M-Line P = 0.010 and PC/H-line angle P = 0.026) and lower pelvic organ support (urethrovesical junction height P = 0.013) than both continent and SUI women. Women with SUI symptoms were more likely to exhibit bladder neck funneling and a larger posterior urethrovesical angle at rest than both continent and MUI women (P = 0.026 and P = 0.008, respectively). There were no significant differences between groups on PFM MVC or straining.   Conclusions  Women with SUI and MUI symptoms present different morphological defects at rest. These observations emphasize the need to tailor UI interventions to specific pelvic floor defects and UI type in older women.	aging , morphology , MRI , pelvic floor , pelvic organ support , urinary incontinence , women	en	16363.0
662	Assigning Refugees to Landlords in Sweden: Stable Maximum Matchings	The member states of the European Union received 1.2 million first time asylum applications in 2015 (a doubling compared to 2014). Even if asylum will be granted for many of the refugees that made the journey to Europe, several obstacles for successful integration remain. This paper focuses on one of these obstacles, namely the problem of finding housing for refugees once they have been granted asylum. In particular, the focus is restricted to the situation in Sweden during 2015–2016 and it is demonstrated that market design can play an important role in a partial solution to the problem. More specifically, because almost all accommodation options are exhausted in Sweden, the paper investigates a matching system, closely related to the system adopted by the European NGO “Refugees Welcome”, and proposes an easy-to-implement algorithm that finds a stable maximum matching. Such matching guarantees that housing is provided to a maximum number of refugees and that no refugee prefers some landlord to their current match when, at the same time, that specific landlord prefers that refugee to his current match.

663	La protection des données personnelles en droit international privé	New technologies and the rising of the Internet boosted international data trade between public and/or private companies and even between individuals. However, this digital revolution is coming with its consequences: this exchange of data leads to personal data transactions (personal information or pictures for example) without users’ will.  In case of violation of personal data, it is still unclear how to bring a case before the courts?  Which Law is applicable?  Quebec Law, European Union Law and Swiss Legislation show similarities in real life and on the internet. First, we consider the common law, then personal data real life and on the Internet if there are any differences. The conceptual doctrine is also analysed as it reveals new Internet specific issues. The first chapter tackles the international jurisdiction of the courts, potential criteria of ordinary law:  the court where the damage occurs, the court where the conduct occurred or the court where the plaintiff lives; and those that are and are not covered by the doctrine as the accessibility and the targeting for example. Law conflicts and multiple potential criteria of ordinary law are studied in the second chapter.  The State of the damage, the State of the misconduct and the State that benefit to the victim among others. The regulation that ensures the best personal data protection and the law that identifies the file master. From the international private law perspective, the most competent court is the one located in the State where the plaintiff is living when damage occurs. And the best regulation to follow is the he law of the country of domicile or the law of the law that promotes and protects the victim.

664	La protection de l'environnement par les sanctions administratives pécuniaires au Québec	On October 4, 2011, the Quebec government passed a bill entitled: «An Act to amend the Environment Quality Act in order to reinforce compliance ». Among other amendments, said bill increased the severity of penal sanctions set forth in the Environment Quality Act and broadened the scope of the Government and the Minister’s powers regarding administrative authorizations. However, the major change introduced by the bill is the power for a designated person to impose monetary administrative penalties on persons and municipalities that fail to comply with the Act or the regulations, concurrently with the penal, administrative and civil remedies. The present work sets forth the issue of the legality of the new amendments with the following question: is the person facing a monetary administrative penalty charged with an offence and, therefore, could they raise the constitutional protection of section 11 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms as a person facing criminal or penal proceedings? Secondly, since we concluded that the monetary administrative penalty is an administrative sanction, how does the duty to act fairly translate during the imposition, review process and contestation before the Administrative Tribunal of Québec of the penalty?	sanction , administrative , monetary , penalties , legality , duty to act fairly	en	16319.0
665	Analyse quantitative de la carrière criminelle des internautes effectuant du leurre d’enfants	Objectives: The aim of this paper is to understand the criminal career characteristics of people who are known from the police to have committed child luring on the Internet. Using a taxonomic analysis created with the criminal history of these individuals, it will be possible to establish a typology of people who have lured children online. Ultimately, the variance in characteristics of the criminal background on the commission of offline sexual abuse will also be verified. Methodology: Drawing from official data of Quebec’s police community, the sample includes criminal careers of people having committed the offense of luring children over the Internet. Some descriptive analyses related to the different parameters of the criminal history will be included. Moreover, a mean test and a Cox regression analysis will verify the significance and the predictability of acting out prior and after the act of luring children online based on criminal background. Results: Analyses have shown that the majority of subjects have no criminal record. For many of them, children luring is the most serious crime committed in their criminal career. Three categories of individuals have been identified: amateurs, specialists and generalists. Those who are tempted to commit sexual abuse before luring are the polymorphic subjects with a more serious criminal history. However, those who are considered specialists with a significant proportion of sexual offenses in their career are more likely to commit sexual assault following sexual exploitation on Internet.

666	Modèles organisationnels et compétences infirmières en gestion de lits	Problematic : Bed management is a complex process in each hospital center because of many actors, objectives and needs that make even more difficult an already complicated process. The leader of this process, often times a nurse, coordinates bed management. This person makes use of many specific competencies, such as a nurse in advanced practice. This directed study shows the knowledge state related to different organisational models in bed management as well as the required competencies of nurses, as shown in the literature. More specifically, the objectives are to identify and analyse organisational models of bed management, to identify the required competencies and evaluate the added value of advance pratice of nurses. Method : The pinpointing of articles was done using grey literature and the following data bases : Pubmed, Embase, Embase reviews, Cinahl et Medline. A total of 43 articles were chosen and analysed based on S. Simard’s reading guideline on the basis of two reference books (Davies, Coutu-Walkulczyk et Logan, 2011; Law et coll., n.d.).  Results : The literature allowed us to discover four bed management models. Analyses of these different models allowed us to conclude that Proudlove’ model is the best one. Research also underlined many nurse competencies specific to bed management including leadership and partnership. An analysis enabled us to cross competencies in the literature with a university repository of competencies in advanced practice in nursing Conclusion : This work proposes an organisational recommendation to optimize bed management in hospital centers. We propose an embryonic conceptual framework to focus future research on nurse competencies in bed management.	Bed Management , Competency , Nursing , Framework	en	16297.0
667	Intervention éducationnelle visant à favoriser l’adaptation de la fratrie lors de l’hospitalisation de nouveau-nés prématurés à l’unité néonatale	Enlarging a family requires that oldest children adapt to a new role and a new family situation. When an infant is born prematurely, this adaptation becomes complex due to the hospitalization of the newborn in the neonatal intensive care unit [NICU]. This unexpected and stressful situation has not only an impact on parents, but also on siblings. Although it is essential to favor siblings’ adaptation adequately, support to siblings is often overlooked in NICUs. An intervention based on a scientific literature review on siblings’ adaptation and on the Roy Adaptation Model was developed and implemented in a level III NICU of a university healthcare center in Montreal to favor siblings’ adaptation. Three families participated and according to findings, siblings and parents were satisfied with the intervention. However, two parents out of three indicated feeling neutral about whether the intervention met their expectations. Overall, the intervention seems to have the potential to facilitate siblings’ adaptation during the experience of having a preterm infant hospitalized in the NICU.

668	Les interactions vestibulo-corticales qui sous-tendent le contrôle de la posture chez les sujets sains	The vestibular system and the motor cortex are involved in the control of posture but the nature of their interactions is poorly documented. To characterize vestibulo-cortical interactions underlying the control of balance during quiet standing, the electromyographic activity (EMG) of the soleus (SOL), tibialis anterior (TA) and peroneus longus (PERL) of the right leg was recorded in 14 healthy subjects. Bipolar galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) was applied with the cathode behind the right or left ear at various inter-stimulus intervals (ISI) before and after transcranial magnetic stimulation eliciting motor evoked potentials (MEP) in the muscles recorded. When the cathode was on the right, MEP in the SOL were inhibited at 40 and 130 ms while MEP were facilitated in TA at 110 ms. When the cathode was on the left, MEP were facilitated in the SOL at 50 ms, in TA at -10 ms and in PERL at 0 ms. The localization of these interactions along the neural axis was estimated according to the ISI and by comparing the effect of the GVS on the MEP to its effect on the background EMG and on the SOL H-reflex. Based on these analyses, the observed modulations of MEP observed could have occurred at spinal or supraspinal level. These results suggest that the corticospinal output may be modulated by the vestibular system at different levels of the neural axis.

669	Aider sans nuire: intervention de groupe destinée aux proches de victimes d'actes criminels	Abstract: Criminal acts have severe consequences. When crimes are committed, a majority of victims will turn to their natural support network to be assisted. The social support provided to victims by their own relatives and loved ones will have positive impacts on their well-being and recovery, only when properly adapted to the victims’ needs. Providing proper social support is not an easy task for victims’ relatives. In fact, victims’ relatives also suffer repercussions of criminal acts, making it difficult for them to carry out their role in supporting the victim. Even when well intentioned, some of their actions may inflict additional pain to victims, thus negatively impacting their recovery. Given those findings, we decided to create a group intervention program designed for victims’ relatives and loved ones which we named « Aider sans nuire ». This group intervention program will attempt, in its design, to support victims’ relatives and loved ones, as well as provide them with helpful tools to assist with their supporting role towards the victims. With the assistance of intervention workers from the Victim assistance center (CAVAC) of Montreal, we evaluated the usefulness and content of the program we designed. We used various data gathering methods, including a focus group and an evaluation questionnaire, in order to get the intervention workers’ feedback on the program. We were also able to get their opinion concerning the recruiting strategies used through an online survey. The feedback we received led us to confirm the relevance of this project. We were also able to determine that our inability to recruit a sufficient number of candidates to form a group was caused by other factors independent of the program itself. The feedback provided by the intervention workers allowed us to improve the content of the original program. We believe the changes made to the original program will be beneficial to those taking part in the program in the future.	crime victims' relatives , crime victims' loved ones , crime victims' social network , social support provided by victims' network , group intervention , program evaluation	en	16267.0
670	Modulation de l’homéostasie lipidique intestinale suite à une intervention en médecine traditionnelle Cri chez un modèle animal d’obésité et de pré-diabète	Introduction : Obesity and type 2 diabetes as well as their complications are present at higher rates in aboriginal communities than in the general population. One reason for this situation is the cultural resistance of Aboriginals to contemporary health care due to the cultural inadequacy of modern treatments for obesity and type 2 diabetes. In order to address this issue, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research Team in Aboriginal Antidiabetic Medicines (CIHR-TAAM) looked at 17 plants of the traditional pharmacopeia of the Cree Nations of Eastern James Bay in Canada, among which was balsam poplar, Populus balsamifera. Objective : The purpose of the present study is to examine the effect of P. balsamifera on the intestinal content of various lipid species and key protein components involved in lipid metabolism. Material and methods: Mice were exposed for eight weeks to a standard diet (CHOW), a high fat diet (HFD) or HFD containing 125 mg/kg of Populus balsamifera. Samples of jejunum were collected, homogenized and their lipid content extracted. Results: The results showed that jejunal total cholesterol, phospholipids and triglycerides were not affected by the absence or the presence of P. balsamifera extract. In contrast, the jejunal content in fatty acids was significantly increased by the DIO treatment as compared to Chow controls. P. balsamifera treatment significantly reduced intestinal fatty acid content back toward values observed in Chow controls. A non-significant change was noted in the expression of the FAS protein, CPT-1, ACC-P. Conclusion : This further strengthens the potential of balsam poplar extracts to be useful in the context of the high prevalence of obesity in Indigenous populations.

671	Understanding the role of CAP proteins in the polarization process of C. elegans	Asymmetric cell division is a crucial step in organism development, as it allows the generation of cellular diversity. In order to achieve asymmetric division cells need to polarize their cell fate determinants and properly orient their mitotic spindle before division. The C. elegans embryo is a powerful and widely used model to study asymmetric cell division. In the embryo the sperm entry site determines the anterior-posterior axis of polarity. In the newly fertilized embryo, shortly after meiosis, the cortex is uniformly contractile and the conserved PAR-3/PAR-6/PKC-3 complex (hereafter referred to as the PAR-3 complex) is localised on the entire cortex. Entry of the sperm triggers posterior smoothening and anterior-directed cortical flows. Asymmetric cortical contractions result in the formation of an anterior domain containing the PAR-3 complex, while the posterior-pole cortex, depleted of the PAR-3 complex, is enriched in PAR-2 and PAR-1 proteins. Therefore PAR domains define an anterior and a posterior pole of the embryo in response to cytoskeleton remodelling. The PAR-4 and PAR-5 proteins remain localized uniformly throughout the embryo. Intriguingly, the PAR proteins exert a feedback regulation on cortical contractility. PAR-5, one of the lately identified PAR proteins, was shown to be an ortholog of the adaptor protein 14-3-3 and to play an important role in cortical contractility. Despite its central role in cortical contractility and henceforth the polarization process, little is known on how PAR-5 regulates cortical contractility. The aim of this project is to better understand the regulation of cortical contractions via the PAR-5 protein and its interactors, and how they control cell polarity. In a GST pull down assay we identified several new interactors of PAR-5. Among these we found CAP-2 (actin capping protein), which was also pulled down with 14-3-3 in three different model systems. CAP-2 has been implicated in actin regulation. Interestingly we found that depletion of CAP proteins by RNA interference in wild type worms results in increased embryonic lethality, suggesting an important role in embryonic development. Live imaging of embryos depleted of CAP proteins shows that these embryos have decreased cortical contractions with a less stable pseudo cleavage furrow, indicating a defect in the regulation of the actin-myosin cytoskeleton. This was further confirmed by the decreased velocity and the number of NMY-2::GFP foci in CAP depleted embryos. Furthermore, these embryos show mild decrease in PAR-2 domain size during the polarity establishment phase. cap-2(RNAi) embryos also show a delay in cell cycle progression, however the role of the cell cycle delay in the regulation of cortical contractions has to be determined. The characterization of CAP proteins, which are cytoskeleton-remodeling regulators, will improve our understanding of the mechanisms underling the establishment and maintenance of cell polarity, and thereby asymmetric cell division.

672	Les enjeux juridiques concernant les nouveaux modèles d’affaires basés sur la commercialisation des données	This essay is submitted as part of a master's thesis in Information Technology Law. This thesis discusses different business models that have the common feature of commercializing data in the context of Information Technologies. One of the goals of this thesis is to inform the reader about the workings of the studied business practices, as they are not widely known. First, in order to situate the issues, this essay will consider the theoretical concepts of Privacy and Personal Information Protection. Once the review of Data Protection and Privacy has been established, this thesis will further explore Data Brokerage, Cloud Computing and Analytic Solutions as practices. Over the course of this description, the legal issues raised by each aspect of the aforementioned practices will be studied. Finally, the last chapter of the thesis will be dedicated to two issues that are not limited to the scope of a specific business practice, but are direct consequences of the evolution of Information Technologies: the role of Consent and Data Security.

673	L’intervention en médiation familiale en présence de violence conjugale : dépistage, pratiques d’intervention, défis et préoccupations	In Quebec, family mediation cases regarding domestic violence are controversial, and the interventions used are not well documented or known. The main purpose of this thesis is to understand how family mediators deal with cases of domestic violence within their own practice. The specific research goals include the following: (1) understanding how family mediators screen for domestic violence; (2) learning how they intervene in domestic violence cases, once they have been identified; and, (3) identifying the challenges and concerns the mediators face when working with these cases. This qualitative study was conducted with eight mediators from the psychosocial and legal fields. Semi-constructed interviews were conducted with these participants. Those interviewed brought forth the importance of offering in-depth advanced training regarding domestic violence and screening tools to all mediators across Quebec and to add to the current training by addressing the issues of dangerousness, the risk of recurring or increase of domestic violence, as well as the evaluation of risk for spousal homicide. The results of this study also demonstrate the importance of distinguishing between intimate terrorism and situational couple violence, as well as the implementation of best intervention practices specific to each type of violence. Family mediation that includes the presence of domestic violence cases should be a specialized field of practice that promotes collegial collaboration in order to access pertinent and useful resources.

674	La détermination des droits et des obligations relatifs à l'aide sociale en Allemagne : le cas des individus seuls aptes à l'emploi	This thesis aims to understand the determination of rights and obligations related to single unemployed able-bodied individuals benefiting from the German social assistance between 1990 and 2012. To do so, the thesis reviews the main formal benchmark and actualization mechanisms of monetary rights present in most OECD countries and shows how Germany determines the generosity of social assistance benefits. Raising the somewhat arbitrary nature of these mechanisms, it goes on to argue that the relative generosity of the rights and obligations of unemployed able-bodied individuals can be explained mainly in terms of conditionality and deservingness. Through a literature review on the topic, the thesis illustrates how the categorical differentiation and the particular construction of last resort programs in Germany come to reflect an implicit hierarchy based on deservingness, explaining both the lowest generosity of monetary rights and the greater conditionality attached to social rights concerning single able-bodied individuals. Finally, it argues that the construction of the rights and obligations for these citizens must be understood as a control lever allowing the regulation of both the individual and the labour market. From this perspective, the thesis shows that the Hartz reforms have not only formalized the activation paradigm regulating unemployment in Germany, but that the particular construction of the new scheme for able- bodied individuals ultimately reflects the objective of reducing unemployment by creating jobs in the low-wage sector.

675	Principle and prejudice : attitudes toward ethnic minorities in Quebec	Immigrant integration poses a particular challenge to sub-state minority nations where citizens are more prone to perceive immigrants as cultural and political threats. However, different ethnic groups might be seen as differentially threatening. This study investigates whether francophone citizens in Quebec perceive different ethnic minority groups differently and whether they are more negative towards these groups than other Canadians. To the extent that negativity exists, the study seeks to understand whether it is grounded principally in racial prejudice or in concerns about culture. Results from national and provincial data show that Quebec francophones are specifically negative toward religious minorities, not racial minorities, and that their negativity is largely couched in concerns over secularism and cultural security. Ethnic antipathy among Quebec’s majority francophone population thus appears to be more group-specific and culturally principled than generalized and racially based.	immigration , opinion publique , public opinion , ethnic minorities , multiculturalism , Canadian politics	en	16224.0
676	Variations développementales chez les poissons hybrides clonaux Chrosomus eos-neogaeus : transgressions phénotypiques en 3D	An organism’s success is highly dependent on its phenotype. A major component of the phenotype is functional morphology because of its role in determining performance in a given environment clues as to their ecology. Morphological disparity and developmental differences between species can thus lead to ecological differences. This project assesses the role that mechanisms capable of generating morphological variation have in producing ecological differences between species within the hybrid fishes of the Chrosomus eos-neogaeus complex. Using X-ray based computer-aided micro-tomography and 3D geometric morphometrics, the shape of bones composing the jaws was described to measure morphological variation and developmental differences in the C. eos-neogaeus complex.  Chrosomus eos-neogaeus hybrids displayed as much variation as parental species and novel, deemed transgressive, phenotypes. Hybrids were also markedly different from parental species in their patterns of allometric scaling and phenotypic integration. Finally, hybrids appeared to be plastic and able to acclimate to different environments. The results of this study indicate that changes in the development of hybrids could lead to phenotypic and, in turn, ecological differences with parental species.

677	L'éthique et sa place dans la nature	One of the burning questions among metaethical realists is whether moral facts and properties are natural or non-natural. In this thesis, I argue that we should treat a family of arguments for non-naturalism with considerable scepticism: the Open Question Argument, the Normative Intuition, and the argument from the Is-Ought Gap. Moore’s famous Open Question Argument only supports moral non-naturalism if it begs the question against the modest (non-reductionist) naturalist. As for the Normative Intuition, it either commits the fallacy of inferring on the basis of a thing’s specific difference that it does not belong to the genus it putatively belongs to, or it underestimates the breadth of natural properties that possess the features which non-naturalists allege are distinctive of moral and normative properties. The argument from the Is-Ought Gap, for its part, underestimates the ubiquity of the logical and conceptual gap that allegedly marks a deep metaphysical discontinuity between the normative and natural domains.

678	La distribution des zéros des fonctions L	The Katz and Sarnak philosophy states that the distribution laws of zeros of $L$-functions follow the distribution laws of eigenvalues of random matrices. The zeros near the central point would reveal the symmetry type of our family of $L$-functions. Once the symmetry has been identified, it is conjectured that many statistics associated to the zeros would be predicted by the eigenvalues of the corresponding group of random matrices. This thesis will study the low-lying zeros of the family of elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}[i]$. Brumer computed the symmetry type of the family of elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$ in 1992. New challenges arising from this generalisation over number fields of his work will be revealed in this thesis.

679	La mise en valeur de l'archéologie sur la côte nord du Pérou : le cas de Chan Chan et de Huacas de Moche	Our thesis discusses the development of enhancements in the archeological heritage of the Northern coast of Peru. Based on two case studies, namely Chan Chan and Huacas de Moche, we aim to highlight different approaches in the establishment of enhancements to the archeological site and the related site museum exhibition. The city of Chan Chan would have been the capital of the Chimor Empire (900 to 1476 A.D.) and used as a center for governments, settlement and as a religious hub. At its height, the site of Huaca del Sol y de la Luna would have been the capital of the Moche civilization (100 B.C. to 700 A.D.). It represents one of the most ancient urban-ceremonial sites of the Northern coast of Peru.    The Chan Chan site museum presents a model of museography dating from the 1990s whereas; the site museum of Huacas de Moche proposes an approach evidencing concepts of new museology (2010). In addition, the management approaches, one public (Chan Chan) and one joint public/private (Huacas de Moche) have influenced the way archeology is presented to the public.   The first chapter discusses the history of archeology, museum and tourism development in Peru. The second part of that chapter examines questions related to hermeneutics of material culture, esthetic topics of artifatcs and pre-Columbian architecture and mediation approaches.  The second chapter establishes a parallel analysis of the circuit of the archeological site of Chan Chan and that of Huacas de Moche. The third chapter analyses the site museum exhibitions through two case studies. It discusses the links created and established to their respective archeological sites. The fourth chapter pertains to forms of financing of archeological searches, conservation, restoration and projects for enhancing the value of archeology. It also discusses strategies for its dissemination and tourism development. Finally, the last section of the fourth chapter discusses how the archeological sites and their museums can integrate local communities in the research project and to enhance archeology.

680	"Traitement de la transidentité dans ""Laurence Anyways"""	Our work revolves around Xavier Dolan’s film Laurence Anyways (2012), in which we will explore the transgender woman representation. First, we will proceed to a film analysis that focuses on trans identity, and then to a double reception analysis: reception in the press, but also reception by trans people. Eventually, we will detail the research-creation process that led us to direct a documentary film featuring two trans people speaking about their views on trans representation in the audiovisual media today.	film , audiovisual , trans identity , transgender , representation , reception , research-creation	en	16149.0
681	La cinématographie-attraction à Montréal à la lumière de la législation (1896-1913)	Cinématographie-attraction / kine-attractography has for a long time been associated with the origins of cinema. But in 1978, an academic controversy created a rift in cinematic historiography and these works were subsequently deemed to be a separate object of study, one distinct from institutional cinema. This thesis will focus on kine-attractography in the setting of Montreal from the use of the Lumière Cinematograph projector in 1896 to the founding of the Quebec Board of Censorship in 1913. The legislative context surrounding these new forms of ‘amusement’ will be discussed (bills were modified or created to address legal questions). This thesis will investigate these events within the relevant historical, geographical and cinematographic contexts. It will then consider three aspects of kine-attractography that differ from those in cinema: manufacturing (which includes the way cinematic works were financed, shot and later modified), exhibition (the matter of where and how these works were shown) and reception (the ways these works were evaluated or judged). We will discuss how kine-attractography was initially overseen by diverse groups of people (from those who financed or shot the moving pictures, to the owners of ‘amusement’ theatres, to the policeman or fireman who was present at each projection), and then subsequently overseen by recognized institutions, government representatives included. We will explore the issues which accompanied its institutionalisation relative to these various groups by studying articles and ads in Montreal’s newspapers, legal texts, official pronouncements, diocese speeches, catalogues published by manufacturing companies, and the moving pictures themselves.	cinématographie-attraction , attractions , exhibition , catalogues , licences , kine-attractography , early cinema , institutionalization , moving pictures , amusement , manufacturing , exhibition , reception , legislation , film lecturer , the Sunday law , consumption	en	16134.0
682	Les grandes surfaces suivi de La logique du seuil ou la problématique de l’altérité dans Autoportraits de Marie Uguay et Nombreux seront nos ennemis de Geneviève Desrosiers	This memoir focuses on two poetry collections from Quebec: Marie Uguay’s “Autoportraits” and Geneviève Desrosiers’ “Nombreux seront nos ennemis”. These can be characterised as “intimist” as they bring to the forefront the poetical narrator’s close observations of his daily life. My two-part project includes a research on Uguay’s and Desrosiers’ view of “intimism” as well as a poetry collection inspired by their work. My research concentrates on the threshold’s logic and on the narrator’s troubled relationship with the various representations of alterity. In the two studied poetry collections, the “I” indeed occupies a reclusive position from which it does not have to face alterity.  The poems that form the second part of this project testify to the resourcefulness in which the narrator spreads out in order to avoid his humdrum existence. The monotony of daily life is seen as a trap or a form of imprisonment. Consequently, only a thin frontier separates dreams from reality in these poems. The contrast between the “I”’s actual positions and his fancied destinations plays a major role in the text’s aesthetic. Several wishes are laid upon the table, amongst them a new departure. The poems therefore express the narrator’s longing but attempt to avoid the dangers of a classic “intimism” which are an exaggerated sensitivity or narcissism.

683	Les tableaux homonymiques, principe d’unité du Cornet à dés de Max Jacob	This dissertation treats the structure of Le Cornet à dés (1917), a collection of prose poems written by Max Jacob. Upon reading this collection, one notices that things and events referring to the different definitions of the word “tableau” are repeatedly employed : paintings, visual descriptions, window and door frames, elders (vieux tableaux), living pictures (tableaux vivants), theater scenes and also blackboards. This dissertation, divided into three chapters, starts by exploring how these homonyms are employed as paintings in the poems. In-between fixity and movement, the descriptions and the narrations bring literature closer to pictorial art. This contributes to the aesthetic of doubt found in Max Jacob’s written work. The second chapter analyzes different kinds of repetitions and the way they build links between the poems. By employing the theories of movement and repetition, this dissertation demonstrates how the various motifs, similarly to a pair of dice, form different combinations from one poem to another. Inspired by the cubist painters who simultaneously show all the angles of an object, Jacob thoroughly examines the word “tableau”. In the last chapter, it becomes evident that the juxtaposition of the poems gives access to additional significance: certain arbitrary elements, such as obscure titles, suddenly make sense. A reflection on the act of reading concludes this dissertation, since the numerous repetitions are stored in the reader’s memory. This work falls within the field of collection studies and mainly relies on poetry analysis.

684	Forms of the Postmodern Historical Novel : Christoph Ransmayr, Daniel Kehlmann, Wolfgang Hildesheimer	Postmodernism, an aesthetic movement that rejects modernist dogmas, emerged in the U.S.A. in the 1960s and became, over the last decades of the twentieth century, the paradigmatic aesthetic in architecture, literature and the arts. Postmodernism also created the conditions for a renaissance of the historical novel. However, the postmodern historical novel now constitutes a new form of the genre which confronts the dominant discourses with parody, irony and skepticism. This new form does not limit itself to narratives situated in a realist historical setting. Rather, it questions the validity and, consequently, the very nature of historical discourse, problematizing and often foregrounding the process of interpretation and reconstruction of the past. In this manner, contemporary historical fiction reflects current debates about the forms of historiography, debates triggered by the work of Hayden White.  The 1980s saw a renewed flowering of historical fiction in the German cultural space and elsewhere. This paper examines postmodern forms of historical fiction through an analysis of three postmodern historical novels in the German language published between 1981 and 2005: Christoph Ransmayr’s Die Schrecken des Eises und der Finsternis, Daniel Kehlmann’s Die Vermessung der Welt and Wolfgang Hildesheimer’s Marbot: Eine Biographie. The analysis is based upon various models of postmodern fiction, in particular Ansgar Nünning’s five level categorization schema of the historical novel. This paper illustrates the extent to which these novels deploy postmodern stylistic devices and comment critically and comically upon German and Austrian history and culture.

685	Représentations identitaires chez un homme ayant purgé une longue peine : aspects stables et mobiles	Numerous studies have focused on the issues of abandonment of crime and the desistance process that precedes it. While the approaches retained are diversified, they all point to the social as well as personal changes the process implies. This thesis focuses on the  identity changes of an individual who received a long prison sentence, and who later obtained a full parole. The main objective of this thesis is to understand what are the permanent aspects of identity and those that are modifiable at work in the changing path of a man sentenced for murder and has obtained full parole.  The life approach, and in a phenomenological perspective, was used to achieve the objectives of this research. A man sentenced to a life prison and who later obtained his total release was met for ten in-depth interviews each lasting between an hour and an hour and a half. Such a large number of semi-structured type interviews allowed us to deepen our understanding. The results suggest that certain representations of identity remain stable over time while others change over the life course. Indeed, from the analysis of the individual's life story two stable representations emerged that permanently mark his identity during his life trajectory, and four modifiable, which developed during his detention. The results also show that stable representations appear to be involved in both the criminogenic process and during his desistance.

686	Détermination de la spéciation du samarium dans l'environnement	Samarium is present in several high technology products such as magnets, lasers, etc., however little is known about to what extent it can pollute environmental matrices. For divalent metals such as Cd, Cu and Ni, toxicity has often been closely correlated with the free ion concentration. Unfortunately, there are currently no techniques available for evaluating the speciation of samarium in environmental matrices. In this study, an economical and easy to use ion exchange technique (IET) using a resin has been studied for use in measuring free samarium. In order to optimize the IET for free samarium determinations, equilibrium times were first determined for pH buffered solutions of samarium (6.7x10 8 M Sm, 1.0 mM MES, pH 6.0) in the presence of different concentrations of sodium nitrate (NaNO3: 0.01 M to 0.5 M). Equilibrium was only attained for the highest concentration of NaNO3. Therefore, another technique using dynamic measurements on the Dowex resin was developed. Thus, the impacts of different organic ligands such as EDTA, citrate, malic acid and Suwannee River fulvic acid Standard I (SRFA) have been investigated using IET in dynamic mode. The calibration of the technique using different concentrations of NTA, EDTA, citrate, malic acid and fulvic acid (SRFA) allowed the determination of accumulation rates. Strong correlations were found between accumulation rates and the free samarium when using EDTA and NTA to control free samarium. The correlation was very low in case of citrate and malic acid suggesting that their complexes with samarium were adsorbed on the resin. Finally, fluorescence quenching titrations (FQT) and SP-ICPMS were used to determine samarium speciation.  The free samarium determined by IET is strongly correlated to that calculated by WHAM 7.0 using the stability constant from FQT and that from Sonke (2006). However, the free Sm resulted from IEC-SP-ICPMS technique has been overestimated once compared to that found using VMinteQ or WHAM 7.0 models. The Sm particulates determined by SP-ICPMS have demonstrated that pH has a great influence on Sm exchange on resin and has to be considered while measuring free samarium. Thus, the IET should be associated to other techniques such as fluorescence quenching titration and SP-ICPMS for evaluating the bioavailable Sm concentrations in natural waters.

687	Avancement vers la synthèse du (+) et du (-)-hodgsonox	This master thesis describes various strategies towards the total synthesis of (+)- and (-)-hodgsonox, a tricyclic sesquiterpene containing a diallylic ether functionality fused into a tetrahydropyran ring. The first synthetic approach involved the formation of the fivemembered ring followed by the formation of the tetrahydropyran moiety. The second approach consisted in the synthesis of both carbon cycles in a single stage. In the first part, is described the synthesis of an acyclic precursor to assemble the fivemembered ring via a ring-closing metathesis reaction. This approach proved unsuccessful and was not pursued. In the second part, is reported a Pauson-Khand cyclization to produce the bicyclic compound. The Pauson-Khand precursor was synthesized in 9 steps (30% overall yield) from diethyl tartarate. The cyclization was successful, but the isopropyl moiety could not be introduced. A former Lebel’s PhD student, Lise Brethous had also worked on the total synthesis of hodgsonox. She established that the 5-membered ring could be prepared from a-acetyl gbutyrolactone and observed the formation of the tetrahydropyran moiety via an OH-insertion reaction with a diazo intermediate. In the last part of this master thesis, some steps from Brethous’s approach were optimized. Unsuccessful attempts to tackle the last steps of the synthesis are also described.

688	Passages inclusifs : le réseau d'organismes communautaires autochtones de Montréal	This  research  aims  to  enrich  the  understanding  of  the  constitution  of  a  sense  of  belonging  to  an aboriginal           community            in            Montreal.            It            has            been            demonstrated            that           there            is            indeed            a           social cohesion      in     Montreal      based      on      the      collective      aboriginal      ethnic      identity,      or      aboriginality.      This cohesion            is             supported             by             aboriginal             organizations            and             associations,             whise             approaches            and engagements   have   a   direct  impact   on   their   inclusion   into   the   community.   These  institutions  are considered     as     the     source     of     communitarian     social     bond     in     the     city.

These       problems       produce       harmful consequences                on                the                member’s                relations                to                the                communitarian                system                and                reduce                their participation and attendance.

689	La perception du temps et sa modulation par la température chez les guêpes parasitoïdes	Optimality models assume that animals foraging for resources use the rate of fitness gain to optimize several behaviours such as patch time allocation and progeny investment. Although the duration of multiple behaviors needs to be regulated, few evidence of time perception are currently available for insects and none for parasitic wasps, despite their importance as ecological models. This capacity to measure time could be affected by temperature, since parasitic wasps are poikilotherms. We hypothesized that parasitic wasps should have the capacity to perceive time, both prospectively (measure of elapsed time) and retrospectively (duration of a past event), in order to optimize foraging decisions related to host patch exploitation and reproduction. We also hypothesized that temperature would affect the time perception of parasitic wasps.   For the prospective measure of time, we used the associative learning abilities of Microplitis croceipes (Hymenoptera: Braconidae). We trained them to associate an odour to the duration of an interval between hosts. Following their training, they were tested in a wind tunnel. The wasps chose significantly more the odour associated with the test interval they were trained to recognize. We also looked into the role of energy expenditure in the measure of time. When wasps were prevented from moving freely during the interval between hosts, they chose randomly in the wind tunnel. The lack of energy expenditure thus rendered them unable to measure time. Energy expenditure is therefore an essential proxy to measure time.   For the retrospective measure of time, we used the host evaluation process of Trichogramma euproctidis (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae). Trichogramma wasps use the duration of the initial transit on the host egg to evaluate its size and decide how many eggs to lay. We artificially increased the initial transit duration of T. euproctidis by suspending the host egg to make it appear larger than an unsuspended egg of the same size. An increase in initial transit duration increased clutch size in the host. This demonstrates the capacity of T. euproctidis to measure the duration of the initial transit duration, and therefore a retrospective measure of time.   To ascertain if temperature modified the measure of time in poikilotherms species, we measured the patch exploitation behaviour of T. euproctidis following intervals at different temperatures. Wasps are expected to stay longer and leave at a lower rate of fitness gain following a long travel duration between host patches than for a short travel. We tested the impact of a 24 h travel duration at different temperatures on patch exploitation. An increase in temperature during travel time increased patch residence time and decreased the rate of fitness gain at departure, both of which are associated to an increase in travel time. The reverse was observed when travel occurred at a lower temperature. The increase or decrease in temperature affected the measure of time by speeding or slowing the clock respectively and making the travel appear longer or shorter than it actually was.   Our results clearly show that parasitic wasps are able to measure time, both retrospectively and prospectively. There is now solid evidence that at least two species of parasitic wasps possess the capacity to measure time, an essential component of optimality models. We now also have evidence that energy expenditure is one of the proxies used to measure time.   Our results are also the first evidence of the impact of temperature on time perception in insects. The use of energy expenditure as a proxy to measure time could explain some of its thermal-sensitivity, since parasitic wasps are poikilotherms. This temperature sensitive measure of time could affect biological control strategies. In augmentative biological control, releasing parasitic wasps during the day could lead to a higher level of patch exploitation than early in the day because of the temperature gradient between the air and the plants.

690	Les stratégies syndicales face aux restructurations d’entreprises : une étude comparative des contre-pouvoirs syndicaux dans le secteur des équipementiers automobiles en France et au Canada	This thesis examines the impacts of the restructuring of multinational enterprises on trade union strategies. Are local union strategies an outcome of national institutional embeddedness and organizational contingencies, or can unions in fact influence core elements of corporate decision-making vis-à-vis restructuring? This research speaks to major scholarly debates concerning economic globalization, corporate restructuring, and union organization. In terms of theory, this thesis addresses three large analytical approaches, these being: neo-institutionalism and opportunity structures; critical political economy and the question of union power; and critical economic geography in relation to contingencies, embeddedness, and competition across borders. Drawing from these three theories, this research proposes a new multidisciplinary model of analysis for research on union strategies.  In terms of methodology, this thesis is structured around four case studies of local unions in two countries (Canada and France) and a specific sector (automobile equipment manufacturers). Three qualitative sources are at the heart of this thesis: descriptive statistics, documentation from secondary sources, and semi-structured interviews (44), primarily focused union actors.   This thesis analyzes union strategies within and across jurisdictions to elucidate their ramifications for firms and workers, particularly in the context of restructuring. The principal contributions of this thesis touch on: 1. the impacts of power resources developed by local unions on institutional opportunity structures; 2. the importance of cognitive aspects of strategy and its implications for power in a multi-level context; and 3. the importance of social embeddedness and social relations between unions and employers; 4. the omnipresence of international/national/regional/local competition in the automobile equipment manufacturing sector; and 5. the importance of trade-offs and relationships between business players from the vantage point of contingency theory to understand the structural facets of local union action.  This research invites social actors to rethink their strategies concerning corporate restructuring. In particular, local unions should explore new strategic repertoires of action for responding the new challenges pertaining to economic change and restructuring.	trade unionism , union strategies , multinational corporations , restructuring , international comparisons , automobile industry	en	16056.0
691	A dyadic perspective on genito-pelvic pain : trauma antecedents and treatment effectiveness	Provoked vestibulodynia (PVD), a chronic, recurrent pain elicited via pressure to the vulvar vestibule or attempted vaginal penetration, is the most common form of pain during intercourse (genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder), and the most frequent cause of vulvar pain in pre-menopausal women. Because of its deleterious impact on sexuality, it carries a heavy psychosexual burden for afflicted women, who report impoverished sexual function, decreased sexual frequency and pleasure, and more negative attitudes about sex. Research among couples with PVD has demonstrated the prominent role of partner variables in the modulation of PVD-associated consequences for women, and the negative sexual and psychological consequences experienced by partners. Yet, a dyadic analysis has not been applied to the most robust etiological risk factor for adult-onset PVD, childhood trauma or maltreatment. Furthermore, despite repeated recommendations to include the partner in psychological treatment of PVD, no study to date has examined the effectiveness of a treatment that systematically includes the partner and targets the couple. The overarching goal of this thesis was to use a dyadic perspective in examining trauma antecedents of PVD and treatment effectiveness of an intervention designed to improve outcomes for couples with PVD.  The first article aimed to examine associations between childhood maltreatment of both women with PVD and their partners and their sexual functioning, psychological adjustment and couple satisfaction, as well as women’s reported pain during sexual intercourse. Forty-nine couples with PVD completed self-report questionnaires. Women’s childhood maltreatment was associated with lower sexual functioning for women and men, increased anxiety for women only, and increased affective pain during sexual intercourse. Male partners’ childhood maltreatment was associated with lower sexual functioning, decreased couple satisfaction and increased anxiety for women and men, and higher affective pain reported by women during sexual intercourse.  Drawing from the recommendations in the empirical literature, a Cognitive-Behavioural Couple Therapy (CBCT) for PVD was developed. The second article presents the results from its pilot testing for potential effectiveness, reliability and feasibility. Nine couples completed pre- and post-treatment self-report measures following the 12-session, manualized intervention. Women reported significant improvements in pain, sexual function and satisfaction, and partners reported significant improvements in sexual satisfaction. Exploratory analyses revealed improvements in anxiety, depression and pain-related cognitions, such as pain catastrophizing, for both women and partners. Couples reported high rates of treatment satisfaction and therapists reported good treatment reliability. The third article, building on the promising pilot study results, describes the research protocol for a randomized clinical trial to assess the efficacy of CBCT compared to a first-line medical intervention, topical lidocaine, for the treatment of PVD. In this ongoing trial, couples with PVD are randomized to one of the two treatment options. The clinical and theoretical implications of the thesis are discussed.

692	Socializing toddlers :  autonomy-supportive parenting practices and potential risk factors	According to self-determination theory, psychological autonomy is a basic, universal need that, when supported, enables individuals to function more positively and experience greater psychological well-being (e.g., Deci & Ryan, 2008).  Parenting that supports the autonomy of a child is classically defined as the parental support for their self-determined functioning and includes practices such as providing rationales and choices for requests, communicating empathy, and encouraging initiatives while using non-controlling language (e.g., Soenens et al., 2007).  The benefits of autonomy-supportive parenting have been well-documented (e.g., Grolnick, Deci, & Ryan, 1997) however, few studies to date have been conducted with toddlers.  The present thesis thus sought to enrich the parenting literature by exploring what autonomy-supportive parenting practices are used by parents of toddlers in a socialization context (Study 1) and by examining the factors that may hinder their use (Study 2).   The first study examined a wide range of socialization practices that parents who favoured AS to a greater extent may use more frequently when making requests to their toddlers.  The study allowed us to explore how parents manifest AS towards their toddlers and whether AS in this context is associated with greater rule internalization.  Parents (N = 182) of toddlers (M age = 27.08 months) were thus asked to report the frequency at which they used 26 potentially autonomy-supportive practices when asking their toddlers to complete important yet uninteresting activities and the extent to which they valued AS.  Eight practices were identified as being autonomy-supportive:  four forms of communicating empathy, providing short rationales, explaining why the task is important, giving an informational and neutral description of the problem, and modeling the desired behaviour.  The set of eight practices was positively associated with toddlers’ level of internalization, further suggesting that they embodied the concept of AS.  Future studies may seek to replicate these findings in more potentially volatile or distressing contexts (e.g., reacting to misdeeds, with children with developmental delays).  The second study extended the results further by examining what factors influenced the use of parental AS in socialization contexts.  Since the literature points to parental stress and toddler difficult temperament (i.e., higher levels of negative affectivity, lower levels of effortful control, and lower levels of surgency) as possible risk factors, we explored how they related to the frequency of use of autonomy-supportive practices.  The goals of the study were:  (1) to examine how toddlers’ temperament and parental stress influenced parental AS, and (2) to verify if parental stress played a mediating role in the putative relationship between toddlers’ temperament and parental AS.  Using the same sample, parents were asked to answer questions regarding their toddler’s temperament and their own stress levels.  The results showed that greater child negative affectivity was associated with greater parental stress, which in turn predicted lower parental AS.  Moreover, parental stress partially mediated the positive relationship between child effortful control and parental AS.  Future research could investigate possible interventions that aim to help parents preserve their autonomy-supportive stance during challenging socialization contexts, in the face of exacting child temperamental characteristics, and in addition to the stress brought on by daily life.

693	Suivi par élastographie ultrasonore après réparation endovasculaire d’anévrisme aorto-iliaque : étude de faisabilité in vivo	Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide. Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are part of these horrible diseases. An aneurysm is a dilatation of an artery that can lead to death. A rupture of an AAA can lead to death nearly 80% of the time. One way to treat AAAs is the insertion of a stent-graft (SG) in the aorta in order to reduce the pressure on the wall, commonly known as endovascular repair (EVAR). Endoleak, defined as persistent blood flow within the aneurysm sac and outside the SG, is the main complication of EVAR. This phenomenon increases the risk of rupture and can develop at any time after EVAR. A life-long surveillance follow-up with computed tomography (CT-scan) is required to detect endoleak, increasing the cost of EVAR, exposing patient to ionizing radiation and nephrotoxic contrast agent.  Aneurysm growth without evidence of endoleak on CT-scan is called endotension. After SG delivery, the blood is trapped between the SG and aneurysm wall. If there is no residual flow (endoleak), the blood will coagulate to form fresh thrombus that will progressively organize to become a fibrous thrombus leading to aneurysm shrinkage. There is little data in the literature to study the timing of this process and the relationship between thrombus organization and aneurysm shrinkage. The gold-standard of post-EVAR surveillance, the CT-scan, cannot detect the presence of fresh thrombus. There is a clear need to invest in a safe and cost effective technique for post-EVAR surveillance. A recent method, dynamic elastography, measures the elasticity of tissues in real time. The principle of this technique is based on the generation of shear waves and studies their propagations for the determination of elastic properties (stiffness) of tissues. This thesis aims the application of dynamic elastography for the detection of endoleak and to characterize mechanical properties of AAAs tissues after EVAR. This project reveals the potential of elastography to reduce costs, exposure to ionizing radiation and nephrotoxic contrast agents in CT-scan follow-up of AAAs post-EVAR. Dynamic elastography using the shear wave imaging (SWI) is promising and can complement the Doppler ultrasound (DUS), which is already used in post-EVAR follow-up. SWI has the potential to get information from thrombus organization and to detect endoleak. The first objective of this thesis was to test the SWI on AAAs in canines models for the detection of endoleak and the characterization of thrombus. SGs were implanted in 18 dogs after surgical creation of type I endoleaks (4 AAAs), type II endoleaks (13 AAAs) and no endoleaks (1 AAA). DUS and SWI were engaged before (baseline) and 7, 30, 90 and 180 days (sacrifice) after SG implantation. Digital subtraction angiography, CT-scan and macroscopic tissue sections were analyzed at sacrifice. Endoleak and thrombus areas were identified and segmented. Elasticity (Young's) moduli were measured in different regions of interest (endoleaks, fresh and organized thrombi) after registration of pathological findings. Rigidity values of the regions of interest were significantly different (P < 0.001). SWI was able to detect endoleaks where CT-scan (1) and DUS (3) failed. The second objective of this project was to characterize the evolution of the thrombus in time, also as the endotension after endoleak embolization in canines models. EVAR was done with creation of type I endoleak in 18 aneurysms created in nine dogs (common iliacs arteries). Two embolization gels (Chitosan (Chi) or Chitosan-Sodium-Tetradecyl-Sulfate (Chi-STS)) were injected in the sac to seal the endoleak and promote healing. SWI and DUS were performed at baseline (implantation, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months) whereas angiography and CT-scan were performed at sacrifice to evaluate the presence and type of the endoleak. Macroscopic and histopathological analyses were processed to identify and segment five different regions of interest (ROIs) (endoleak, fresh or organized thrombus, Chi or Chi-STS). Elasticity values of endoleak and fresh thrombus areas were significantly lower than organized thrombus, Chi and Chi-STS areas (P < 0.001). Elasticity values of fresh thrombus at 1 week and at 3 months indicated that SWI can evaluate thrombus maturation. It can also characterize embolization agents degradation. SWI was able to detect endoleak where DUS failed (2) and distinguish fresh thrombi which cannot be detected on CT-scan.  Finally, the last step of the doctoral project was to apply the SWI in a clinical phase with humans with an AAA for the detection of endoleak and characterizing elasticity of tissues. 25 patients were selected to participate in the study. Comparison of SWI, CT-scan and DUS images was conducted. Rigidity values by SWI of regions of interest (endoleak, thrombus) were identified and segmented. These were significantly different (P < 0.001). SWI detected 5 endoleaks on 6 (sensitivity of 83.3%) and had 6 false positives (specificity of 76%). SWI detected endoleaks where CT-scan (2) and DUS (2) failed. No statistical difference was found in elasticity between thrombus with an AAA with endoleak and thrombus with an AAA without endoleak. Also, no correlation was found between AAA diameter or its variation over time and thrombus elasticity. SWI has the potential to detect endoleaks and characterize thrombus. The approach could be combined with DUS surveillance of AAAs after EVAR, which is currently widely practiced to reduce the cost of AAA follow-up and exposure to ionizing radiation and contrast agents.

694	L’influence de l’aménagement linguistique sur l'orientation des travaux de terminologie à l’Office québécois de la langue française (1961-2004)	Terminology, as practiced in Québec for the past fifty years, has been part of a language-planning project to make French the common language of communication throughout the province. The implementation of the project was entrusted to the Office québécois de la langue française. This thesis looks at how language planning and policies have influenced the practice of the terminology at the Office québécois de la langue française from 1961 to 2004.  The main objective is to demonstrate that the language-planning project generated intense terminology activity as a result of the language laws adopted over the past fifty years. The analysis focuses more specifically on the impact of this legislation on the development of the practice of terminology. Six periods are identified for the purpose of characterizing the terminology work done by the Office québécois de la langue française from 1961 to 2004. For each of the six periods, the legislated mandates of the Office and their repercussions on its terminology operations are analyzed. Like the situation described at the beginning of this thesis, the research findings show the links between the practice of terminology and Québec’s social policy in defence of the French language. In fact, the language legislation fostered developments in the practice of the terminology. This practice and the terminology work method developed by the Office québécois de la langue française were honed according to the various mandates assigned to the Office. Québec’s language policy provided a framework in which terminology developed and became a key instrument for the province’s language-planning project.

695	La divination par les sorts dans le monde oriental méditerranéen du IIe au VIe siècle après J.-C. : étude comparative des sortes Homericae, sortes Astrampsychi et tables d'astragalomancie en Asie mineure	The objective of this thesis is an exhaustive comparison of three contemporary cleromantic systems from Late Antiquity. Based on a rigorous analysis of the vocabulary, themes, rhetorical devices and probabilities, several similarities can be noticed. In all cases, positive and negative statements are well-balanced and the systems often use temporal variants to moderate predictions. When not linked to specific questions, they build on proverbs and epic elements from the literary, fictional tradition concerning oracles, though without abandoning the everyday concerns and themes of actual consultations. Rhapsodomancy falls within this trend and proves how epic poetry provides perfect material to conceive oracular predictions without ever exploiting the narrative context or literal aspects of the selected verses.	oracle , astragalomancie , Homer , cleromancy , rhapsodomancy , astragalomancy , fortune	en	16019.0
696	Récits du vieillir « actif » et de la citoyenneté au quotidien : l’expérience des femmes aînées au Québec	Taken as a policy framework, active aging ranks high on most supranational bodies’ agenda. The new political economy of aging portrays “active” citizenship amongst seniors as a key challenge for the years to come. Our research focuses on, first, elderly women’s everyday ‘active’ practices, their meaning and purpose, in the context of Quebec’s active aging policy framework; and second, their day-to-day practical citizenship experiences. Informed by discourse analysis and a narrative approach, the life stories of women 60 to 70 years of age allowed for the identification of a plethora of distinctive old age activity figures.      More specifically, four activity figures were identified by which respondents materialize their routine active practices, namely: (1) paid work; (2) voluntary and civic engagement; (3) physical activity; and (4) caregiving. Set against Quebec’s active aging policy framework, these patterns and set of practices that underpin them are clearly in tune with government’s dominant perspectives. Respondents’ narratives also show that active aging connotes a range of ‘ordinary’ activities of daily living, accomplished within people’s private worlds and places of proximity. Despite nuances, tensions and opposition found in dominant public discourse, as well as in active aging practices, a form of counter-discourse does not emerge from respondents’ narratives. To be active is normally the antithesis of immobility and dependence. Thus, to see oneself as active in old age draws on normative, positive assumptions about old age quite difficult to refute; nevertheless, discourses also raise identity and relational issues. In this respect, social inclusion issues cut across all active aging practices described by respondents. Moreover, a range of individual aims and quests underpin activity pattern.  Such quests express respondents’ subjective interactions with their social environment; including their actions’ meaning and sense of social inclusiveness in old age. A first quest relates to personal identity and social integration to the world; a second one concerns giving; a third centers on the search for authenticity; whereas the fourth one is connected to a desire for freedom. It is through the objectivising of active practices and related existential pursuits that elderly woman recognize themselves as active citizens, rooted in the community, and variously contributing to society. Accordingly, ‘active’ citizenship experiences are articulated in a dialogic manner between the dimensions of ‘doing’, ‘active’ social practices, and ‘being’ in relation to others, within a context of interdependence. A proposed typology allows for the modeling of four ‘active’ citizenship figures. Overall, despite the role played by power relations and social inequality in structuring aging experiences, in everyday life ‘old age citizenship’ appears as a relational process, embedded in a set of social relations and practices involving individuals, families and communities, whereby elderly women are able to express a sense of agency within their social world.	discours , Active aging , elderly women , citizenship , discourse , activity	en	16013.0
697	Impact de la cécité sur le système nociceptif	Vision is important for avoiding encounters with objects in the environment that may imperil physical integrity. Since pain also plays a major role in preventing bodily injury, we tested whether, in the absence of vision, pain hypersensitivity would arise from an adaptive shift to other sensory channels. Indeed, a wealth of literature indicates that blindness leads to sensory compensation and crossmodal plasticity. Furthermore, studies have shown that pain perception can be modulated by vision and by temporary visual deprivation. In a first study, we measured innocuous and noxious thermal thresholds using a Peltier-based thermotester in congenitally blind and normal sighted participants. We also assessed their suprathreshold pain ratings using a CO2 laser device and evaluated their attitude towards daily pain encounters using questionnaires on attention and anxiety. Results show that congenitally participants have lower pain thresholds and higher suprathreshold pain ratings. The psychometric data further indicates that they are more attentive to pain compared to their sighted peers. In a second study, we investigated whether visual experience has an impact on pain perception by replicating the first study in late blind participants. Results indicate that individuals who lost sight later in life are similar to the sighted in every aspect of pain perception that we measured. In a third study, we tested whether blind individuals have supranormal skills in detecting small and quick increases in temperature, as these thermal cues of the environment might help identifying and avoiding potentially harmful objects. Results show that congenitally blind participants outperform their sighted peers and that they are more susceptible to spatial summation of heat. In a fourth study, we examined the contribution of A∂ and C-fibres to blind individuals’ nociceptive processing, as these fibres are thought to signal the first and second pain, respectively. Our findings indicate that congenital blindness leads to an enhanced detection to C-fibre mediated sensations and to faster reaction times to these nociceptive inputs. In a fifth and final study, we probed the potential changes in the descending modulation of nociceptive inputs following visual deprivation by measuring the effects of psychological factors like anticipation and anxiety on blind individuals’ pain perception. Results show that congenitally blind participants are more sensitive to pain in response to uncertainty about threat, suggesting that they are more susceptible to top-down modulation of pain. Overall, this work indicates that visual deprivation from birth, but not later in life, causes a leftward shift in the stimulus–response function to nociceptive stimuli and lends new support to a model of sensory integration of vision and pain processing.

698	Étude fonctionnelle d’un nouveau complexe multi-enzymatique régulant l’épigénome	The reverse reaction of ubiquitination, a crucial post-translational modification, is catalyzed by deubiquitinases (DUBs). BAP1 is an ubiquitously expressed nuclear DUB that recently emerged as an important tumor suppressor highly mutated and inactivated in an increasing number of cancers of diverse origins. Both somatic and germline mutations with loss of heterozygosity were observed in tumors, making BAP1 the most mutated DUB in human malignancies. We previously reported that BAP1 is a component of a large multi-protein complex that includes several transcription regulators. The Drosophila homologue of BAP1, Calypso, forms the Polycomb-repressive DUB (PR-DUB) complex with Additional Sex Comb, ASX. This complex catalyzes the deubiquitination of histone H2A, an essential chromatin modification that regulates gene expression. Despite the ever increasing number of findings describing the occurrence of BAP1 mutations in cancers, few studies investigated the mechanisms of action of this DUB as a tumor suppressor. Therefore, the biological function and the mechanism of action and regulation of BAP1 remains largely uncharacterized. In the work described in this thesis, we investigated the roles of BAP1 partners in modulating its catalytic activity and tumor suppressor function. More specifically we discovered a unique mechanism of regulation between two major components of BAP1 complexes, namely HCF-1 and OGT. Indeed, HCF-1 is important for the maintenance of the cellular levels of OGT. OGT, in turn, is required for the proper proteolytic maturation of HCF-1 by promoting its O-GlcNAcylation. This signaling event is required for HCF-1 function as a cell cycle regulator. On the other hand, we deciphered an intricate mechanism of regulation of BAP1 by the atypical E2/E3 ligase, UBE2O. UBE2O, promote the multi-monoubiquitination of BAP1 on its NLS mediating its cytoplasmic sequestration and thus inhibition of its tumor suppressor function. Another aspect of modulation of BAP1 H2Aub catalysis is provided by the association of BAP1 with ASXL1 and ASXL2 (ASXL1/ASXL2), two orthologs of ASX. We investigated the role of BAP1/ASXL1/2, particularly in the mechanisms of deubiquitination and tumor suppression.  We have demonstrated that BAP1 interacts directly via its C-terminal domain with the ASXM domain of ASXL1/2, thus forming two mutually exclusive complexes. Significantly, ASXM promote, through assembly with BAP1, the generation of a composite ubiquitin binding domain (CUBI), indispensable for inducing the deubiquitinase activity of BAP1 towards H2Aub. The interactions between BAP1 and ASXL1/2 regulate cell cycle progression. In addition, overexpression of BAP1 or ASXL2 in fibroblasts induces senescence in CTD- and ASXM-dependent manner. We also identified cancer-derived mutation of BAP1 that selectively abolish its interaction with ASXL1 and ASXL2 as well as its H2A deubiquitinase activity. Significantly, this mutant suppressed senescence induced by BAP1 overexpression. Thus we provided a link between the tumor suppressor BAP1, its deubiquitinase activity and the control of cell proliferation.

699	La loi applicable aux transferts de biens virtuels	Multi-player virtual worlds are three-dimensional games. Over the past few years, players have been engaging in various activities involving the transfer of virtual objects that they have themselves created or purchased in these virtual worlds and over which they claim ownership. The objects, called “virtual goods”, exist only in the online world and may take any number of forms (e.g. avatars, space ships, etc.). Although the market for virtual property has important economic, social and legal impacts on consumption, these “goods” are neither recognized by the law, nor protected by North American or European legislation or jurisprudence; only the licensing contracts drafted by the developers regulate their uses. However, conflicts that arise in this domain may grow very complex since virtual interactions give rise to a great variety of activities and create legal relationships between the cybernauts who meet in the virtual environment of cyberspace although they may be physically located on either ends of the planet. Thus, the adverse effects of these activities may manifest themselves outside of the cyber environment. Since the virtual world and the physical world are interconnected in these cases, we have to ask the following question: what law should apply to the transfer of the “virtual goods”? In order to answer contentious questions that arise under private international law, one must first go through the initial step of juridically qualifying the objects in question, here the virtual goods, in order to be able to assign them to a specific legal regime and to the specific conflict of laws rules that apply under that regime. Virtual goods – inherently immaterial – do not really exist: they are graphic representations of source code embedded in the software of the virtual world. Thus, the legal characterization of the virtual objects as “property” is controversial under civil law because it depends on whether one adopts a strict (traditional) concept of property law or a more expansive (modern) concept. Even if virtual goods were to be recognized under property law, since the conflict of laws rules applicable to property law place a lot of importance on the physical location of the property in order to determine the legal attachment, this renders the search for a solution to the conflict of laws in this area very difficult. Application of the principle of contractual autonomy therefore provides greater scope in determining property rights, but this solution may not be satisfactory to third parties. Thus, it is useful to turn to the contemporary doctrine that criticizes the general application of the rule of physical attachment to particular and novel contexts that present difficulties in determining the location of the property and instead applies the intellectual property regime which is specifically designed to deal with incorporeal goods. Copyright law is better suited to virtual goods as creations of the mind since its application is not hampered by the non-existence of the goods and because the conflict of laws rules applicable to traditional copyright law provide international protection for copyrights.	virtual worlds , virtual goods , virtual property , private international law , conflict of laws , intellectual property	en	15967.0
700	Retour post-isolement en milieu psychiatrique : développement, implantation et évaluation d’une intervention en soins aigus	In Quebec, seclusion with or without restraint (SR) affects nearly one in four patients in psychiatric wards (Dumais, Larue, Drapeau, Ménard & Giguère-Allard, 2011). It is widely recognized that this practice affects patients, nurses, and organizations (Stewart, Van der Merwe, Bowers, Simpson, & Jones, 2010). Coercive measures pose an ethical dilemma and are the object of policies aimed at reducing or even eliminating their use. Studies on patients’ experience and nurses’ perception of seclusion showed the need for a review of the seclusion event. Several teams of researchers proposed a post-seclusion and-or restraint review (PSRR) involving both the staff and the patient as an intervention to reduce the incidence of SR. It aims at exchanges on emotions, analysis of the steps leading to the decision to use SR, and projection of future interventions.  The purpose of this study was to develop, implement, and evaluate a PSRR with patient and staff of an acute psychiatric care unit to improve their care experience. The research questions were: 1) What is the context of implementation of the PSRR? 2) What are the facilitators and barriers to PSRR implementation according to patients and staff? 3) What is the point of view of patients and staff regarding the modalities and impact of PSRR?, and 4) Is PSRR implementation associated with a decreased prevalence of SR and a reduction of hours spent in SR?   This instrumental case study (Stake, 1995, 2008) was rooted in a participatory approach. The case was an acute psychiatric care unit specialized in first-episode psychosis. To document the context prior to the implementation of the PSRR, the principal investigator went through a 56-hour immersion on the unit and individually interviewed a convenience sample of staff (n= 14) and patients (n= 3). A committee of experts (the principal investigator, six nurses from the unit and a patient partner) developed the two PSRR tools (one for the patient and one for the staff) that were implemented. To evaluate the impact of the PSRR, patients (n = 3) and staff (n =12) were interviewed and data on the prevalence and duration of SR were collected before (6 months) and after (6 months) the implementation of the PSRR. Qualitative data were subjected to thematic analysis (Miles, Huberman, and Saldana, 2014) and administrative data were analyzed with descriptive and non-parametric statistics.  The findings were that, for patients, the context of implementation was defined by implicit and explicit standards. They felt they had to conform to staff expectations and unit’s rules. Patients believed that the use of SR could create a vicious circle of aggressive behaviours fuelled by their profound feeling of injustice regarding SR. Participants’ viewpoint showed the ongoing need to foster opportunities for authentic communication, especially through a PSSR. The practice of PSSR seemed to vary from one staff member to the other.  For staff, findings suggested that the main facilitator for the implementation of the PSRR was the study’s participatory approach, while barriers were related to the difficulties in involving all witnesses of the SR witnesses within the staff PSSR. During the PSRR with the patient, nurses felt they could explore patient’s feelings and point of view, which led to the restoration of the therapeutic relationship. The staff PSRR was perceived as a learning opportunity and allowed for adjusting the patient’s treatment plan. There was a significant reduction in the use and the duration of seclusion in comparison with data prior to implementation.  The findings highlighted the possibility to overcome the perceived discomfort of all parties regarding SR by systematizing the use of a PSRR with patients and staff. Additionally, the findings emphasized the need for a genuine presence of the nurse to achieve meaningful sharing in the therapeutic relationship, which is the cornerstone of mental health nursing. This study contributed to knowledge on the management of aggressive behaviour in psychiatric settings by shedding light on the context in which SR practices occur, by offering two PSRR tools, and by exploring the impact of their implementation. The results supported the potential of a participatory research approach in which patients and staff perspectives were taken into account to develop alternatives approaches to the use of SR.	seclusion and restraint , post-seclusion and/or restraint , mental health , nursing , reflexivity , case study , participatory approach	en	15961.0
701	Creative conflicts : shaping the law on surrogacy and assisted reproduction in Québec and Canada	This memoir is, on one hand, an overview of the state of the law in Canada and Québec on surrogacy and assisted reproduction.  I discuss the dissonance between the practice of surrogacy and assisted reproduction in the country and the current criminal prohibitions under the Assisted Human Reproduction Act, the regulatory vacuum left by the Supreme Court’s decision in Reference re Assisted Human Reproduction Act, which the provinces are reluctant to fill, as well as the incongruity with which parentage laws are being shaped in the provinces where surrogacy arrangements are involved.  On the other hand, this memoir is also a critic of the hold family law has had on the issue of surrogacy in Québec and of how narrow the concepts of autonomy and consent are in the language of civil legal thought on the issue.  Despite being the sole province with a legal framework on assisted reproduction, Québec has poorly connected this framework to family law’s discourse on surrogacy.  Indeed, surrogates have been, for the most part, studied as abstract legal subjects within an atomistic liberal perspective in family law and practically omitted under the legal analysis afforded by Québec adoption courts.  I argue that a more holistic point of view is necessary in the shaping of new laws and policy on surrogacy and assisted reproduction.  I propose Against Family Law Exceptionalism and Relational Theory as analytical tools to broaden the discussion on the subject.  I highlight Jennifer Nedelsky’s relational theory particularly, as her ideas underscore the complexity of human subjects and relationships, a complexity which I argue is primordial for jurists to consider when examining creative conflicts.

702	Hydroxyamidinates et polymères de coordination : suspicions et valences mixtes	In a context where energy supply represents a major challenge for countries and organizations with emerging and developed economies, the search for new renewable resources and the democratization of energy vectors allowing sustainable worldwide supply is a responsibility for the international scientific community. Besides, it would be essential that the many disciplines of chemistry concerted their efforts. In particular, the growth of research in coordination chemistry oriented toward artificial photosynthesis and the development of functional materials demonstrates the undeniable importance of this field of research. The first part of the work presents different synthetic routes to hydroxyamidines, a chelating ligand with promising properties and receiving very little attention from the scientific community. Secondly, we present the development of a strategy of assembly of their supramolecular complexes involving abundant and cheap first row transition metal. Thirdly, we will discuss the investigation of their photophysical and electrochemical properties for their purposes in functional materials applications. To do this, the different synthesis routes of hydroxyamidines and their corresponding amidines which have previously been studied by other members of the group will first be improved then investigated to determine their versatility. Next, the complexing properties of the resulting amox having selected patterns will be determined to finally study the photophysical and electrochemical properties of a series of first row transition metal complexes. In sum, the various designs offered by amox and the bis-amox complexes are studied and the properties of the resulting architectures of their self-assemblies are determined.

705	Climat motivationnel en éducation physique et besoins psychologiques : impact sur les buts d’accomplissement, les attitudes et les habitudes des élèves	To better understand the issue of teenagers’ lack of motivation in physical education and towards physical activity in general, this study proposes to verify the relationships between, on one hand, the motivational climate (mastery and performance) and the basic psychological needs (competence, autonomy and relatedness) of students of both gender and, on the other hand, the achievement goals (mastery, performance-approach and performance-avoidance) they pursue in physical education. This research project also investigates the influence of achievement goals on the teenagers’ attitudes and habits towards physical activity in general. To meet these objectives, 909 students (age mean = 13,87[0,94]) filled self-reported questionnaires on three occasions during the school year. Structural equation models (AMOS 22), invariance analyses and the unconstrained approach were used to analyse the data. Results show that students’ achievement goals vary in accordance to the perception of the motivational climate and that the perceived competence has a positive relationship with the three types of achievement goals. Those relationships were invariant across groups (boys and girls). Furthermore, only one climate/need interaction was significant: the interaction between mastery motivational climate and perceived autonomy negatively predicts the adoption of performance-avoidance goals. This means that perceiving a mastery motivational climate reduces the adoption of performance-avoidance goals but only for students with high feelings of autonomy. Finally, pursuing mastery and performance-approach goals in physical education has a positive impact on students’ attitudes which, in turn, affect their habits in physical activity. Only the adoption of performance-approach goals has a direct positive relation with students’ habits in physical activity in general. In conclusion, physical education teachers can have a positive influence on students’ motivation and engagement during physical education classes—¬but also outside that environment—by promoting a mastery motivational climate and by satisfying their students’ competence need.

706	Les politiques de revenu minimum dans les provinces canadiennes : une étude comparée de l’aide sociale au Canada	This thesis aims at identifying the determinants of minimum income protection in Canada. Specifically, we seek to explain the variations in social assistance generosity across Canadian provinces from 1990 to 2009. Why are Quebec, Saskatchewan and Newfoundland-Labrador more generous than Alberta and New-Brunswick? We analyse 10 different provincial policies through a theoretical framework that focuses on 4 dimensions: the role of actors (political parties and unions), institutions (public expenses and redistribution), budgetary constraints (social assistance rate, debt, economy) and the role of the central government (amount and type of transfers). Results show that social assistance is a highly path dependent and incremental policy. The presence of shared-cost programs with the federal government and high union density increase social assistance generosity, while a difficult budgetary context and right wing parties have negative effects. It is noteworthy that provincial wealth is not associated with higher benefits rates. In general, welfare income decreased between 1990 and 2009 in Canada, while GDP per capita almost doubled. Furthermore, Alberta and British-Columbia, two wealthy provinces, have a below-average generosity level. Last of all, the expected relationship between the presence of left wing parties and a more generous minimum income protection hasn’t been empirically demonstrated.	welfare , social policies , provincial comparison , canadian politics	en	15896.0
707	Remédiation cognitive portant sur les aspects fluide et cristallisé de l’intelligence auprès d'adolescents présentant un fonctionnement intellectuel limite : approche par le jeu	The main objective of this study was to create, implement and assess the efficacy of a cognitive intervention program targeting both fluid (Gf) and crystallized (Gc) aspects of intelligence in a clinical population of adolescents presenting with borderline intellectual functioning (BIF). Considering the high prevalence of BIF, the GAME (“Gains et Apprentissages Multiples pour Enfants”, or “Multiple Gains and Learning for Children”) cognitive intervention was developed using commercially available games, to allow for application of this program to different settings. The first article of this thesis consists of a systematic review of the literature pertaining to the use of game in paediatric cognitive rehabilitation. Efficacy and global methodological quality were assessed for all reviewed studies and recommendations for the design and reporting of game-based cognitive interventions were proposed. Some methodological issues raised in this article allowed us to improve the overall quality of the cognitive program developed in this thesis. Considering the limited number of studies in the current literature regarding BIF (70<IQ<85), it was important to develop a better understanding of the cognitive, adaptive, behavioural and psychiatric profile of adolescents with BIF who participated in the GAME program. This second study helped to empirically develop a better understanding of this population’s profile. A strength regarding verbal abilities for receptive vocabulary and verbal fluency was identified in this population. Moreover, some aspects of attention seemed well preserved, possibly through the effect of psychostimulant medication. Surprisingly, adaptive functioning was not directly linked to overall intellectual functioning and appeared to be heterogeneous. This underscores the importance of directly assessing adaptive functioning in this population to obtain a better estimate of their daily living skills, rather than relying solely on cognitive profiles. Adolescents with BIF also exhibited a much higher prevalence of both internalized and externalized behavioural and psychiatric manifestations than their peers. These manifestations explained an important proportion of parental stress levels. These findings may be helpful in guiding academic orientation, clinical, and family management of youth with BIF and highlight the importance of carrying out systematic and extensive neuropsychological assessments in these youth. The main focus of this thesis consisted in creating a cognitive intervention program targeting Gf and Gc, a rehabilitation domain that has long been overlooked, because of the presumed stability of intellectual processes. The GAME cognitive program was intended for adolescents presenting with either pure or partial BIF (either both of the main reasoning indices were in the borderline range or only one) and addressed two aspects of intelligence: GAME-c (targeting crystallized intelligence) and GAME-f (targeting fluid intelligence). The program lasted for sixteen hours over the course of eight weeks. Results show that adolescents following GAME-f improved on Gf; while adolescents following GAME-c improved on both Gc and Gf. This study sheds further doubt on the so-called stability of intellectual functioning. This is also the first time that intellectual improvements have been identified in a population of clinical interest through direct training. Finally, additional analyses were conducted to identify possible cognitive, adaptive, behavioural and psychiatric factors susceptible of influencing improvements after training. The results indicate that the GAME program may be suitable for other clinical population (e.g., intellectual deficiency).  This thesis underlines the interest of using games as a cognitive remediation tool because of their versatility, accessibility and low cost. It also highlights the necessity to develop a better understanding of individuals presenting with BIF and to provide them with exhaustive neuropsychological assessment (cognitive, adaptive, behavioral and psychiatric). Finally, it indicates that improvements of both fluid and crystallized intelligence can be achieved through direct training in individuals with below-average IQ, suggesting that cognitive deficits could also be addressed in other populations, such as in youth with intellectual disability. Future research and clinical avenues are discussed in relation to the project findings.

708	Causalité et explication causale chez James Woodward	Some philosophers claim that causal relations are based on the laws of nature.  This view is not consistent with the actual causal relations found in the biomedical and social sciences.  In order  to better reflect the actual practice in the various sciences, James Woodward puts forward a view of causation and causal explanation based on a much less demanding relation than that of law of nature, which he calls ‘invariance’.  This essay presents the concept of invariance and other related causal concepts, and identifies certain problems, in order to outline the proper use of this group of concepts.  Woodward’s conception assumes that the goal of causal inquiry is practical rather than merely epistemic :  agents use causal relationships to modify outcomes.  The conception is also non reductive ;  it uses counterfactuals and is a reflection of the experimental methods of the various sciences.  The fact that this conception is consistent with the actual causal generalizations found in the various sciences implies that the goal of universal truth associated with the notion of law of nature is set aside and is replaced by an objective of temporary reliability.  In addition, since the invariance criterion is not very demanding, other criteria must be added to identify, among causal (i.e. invariant) relations, those relations that can be relied upon to reliably modify outcomes.	intervention , invariance , Woodward , science , philosophy , epistemology , causation , explanation , law of nature , intervention , invariance , Woodward , science	en	15882.0
709	Imaginer l’Amérique : Québec à travers les vues d’optique des graveurs allemands Habermann et Leizelt	Published during the American Revolution in the Collection des prospects, the perspective views Vuë de la Place capitale dans la Ville basse a Quebec, Vuë de la haute ville a Quebeck, Vuë de la basse Ville a Quebec vers le fleuve St-Laurent, Vuë de la rue des recolets de Quebeck et Vuë de Quebeck were etched by the German engravers Franz Xaver Habermann (1721-1796) and Balthasar Frederich Leizelt (1755-1812). The main goal of this thesis is to show how these five images were perceived as authentic even if the urban scenery that they depict is not topographically accurate. This allows us to highlight the formal constraints stemming from the optical instruments as well as the cultural models prevailing within the dominant perception of the American urban territory at the time of their creation and reception. Analyzing the fictionality of the German engravings also yields clues into the ideological orientations and the collective discourse about Quebec, perceived as a far away land, by a political ensemble which was not exerting direct domination on the colony founded on the shores of the Saint-Lawrence river.

710	La mesure alternative d’hostilité dans les relations de rivalité interacteur	The present document explores the phenomenon of interstate rivalry and the measures that quantify its intensity. Each of the existing definitions sheds light on one particular aspect of rivalry. The enduring rivalry emphasizes the role of the militarized competition, the strategic rivalry gives a particular importance to the political leaders’ perception of the enemy, while the interstate rivalry focuses on the salient issues of the rivalry. These different interpretations influence the operationalization of the notion of rivalry and the choice of parameters that are selected to capture its manifestations. We combine those three visions in one definition of interactor rivalry, proposing a new classification of hostile actions and an alternative measure of hostility based on the frequency of the latter. The four following case studies helped us to achieve these goals: the rivalries between Afghanistan and Pakistan, between Armenia and Azerbaijan, between Belize and Guatemala, and between Somalia and Ethiopia.

712	Analyse simultanée des hormones stéroïdiennes et leurs formes chimiques dans les matrices d'eau et d'urine par SPE-LC-MS/MS en ligne	In recent years, endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) have been found in rivers that receive significant inputs of wastewater. Among EDCs, natural and synthetic steroid hormones are recognized for their potential to mimic or interfere with normal hormonal functions (development, growth and reproduction), even at ultratrace levels (ng L-1). Although conjugated hormones are less active than free hormones, they can be cleaved and release the unconjugated estrogens through microbial processes before or during the treatment of wastewater. Due to the need to identify and quantify these compounds, a new fully automated method was developed for the simultaneous determination of the two forms of several steroid hormones (free and conjugated) in different water matrixes and in urine. The method is based on online solid phase extraction coupled with liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (SPE-LC-MS/MS). Several parameters were assessed in order to optimize the efficiency of the method, such as the type and flow rate of the mobile phase, the various SPE columns, chromatography as well as different sources and ionization modes for MS. The method shows good linearity (R2 > 0.993) and precision with a coefficient of variance of less than 10%. The quantification limits vary from a minimum of 3 to 15 ng L-1 for an injection volume of 1 mL and 5 mL, respectively, with the recovery values of the compounds varying from 72% to 117%.

713	Postnatal pelvic floor muscle training for preventing and treating urinary incontinence : where do we stand?	Purpose of review: Postnatal pelvic floor muscle training aims to rehabilitate the pelvic floor muscles. To be effective, a certain exercise dosage must be respected. Recent trials evaluated the effect of different programs on prevention/treatment of urinary incontinence immediately after delivery and in treatment of persistent incontinence.       Recent findings: Only three systematic reviews, six trials, and four follow-up studies have been published in the past two decades. High heterogeneity in postnatal pelvic floor muscle training programs is observed throughout the literature, making comparisons difficult. In the prevention/treatment of postnatal urinary incontinence immediately after delivery and in persistent incontinence, supervised intensive programs prove more effective than standard postnatal care. Longer-term results have yet to show advantages for postnatal training programs.       Summary: Although a certain exercise dosage must be respected for a postnatal pelvic floor muscle training program to be effective, a few randomized controlled trials present such dosage. Randomized controlled trials should study the effect of supervised, intensive training protocols with adherence aids. As standard care does not seem to reduce the prevalence of postnatal urinary incontinence, obstetrics services must address delivery of postnatal pelvic floor muscle training.	pelvic floor muscle , physiotherapy , postnatal , stress urinary incontinence	en	15836.0
714	A Study of the Behavioural and Affective Profile of Inpatient Adolescent Girls Presenting a Restrictive Anorexia Nervosa	Eating Disorders (ED) are recognized as the third most common chronic illness among adolescents (Herpertz-Dahlmann, 2015; Rosen, 2003). Evolution of ED is known to be heterogenous in between patients, but prognosis seems more favourable when the disorder appears at adolescence (Steinhausen, 2002; 2009). The study of individual difficulties seems like an interesting avenue to refine our understanding of the psychological functioning of those suffering from ED. This study aimed to: (1) Describe the behavioural and affective profile of inpatient adolescent girls with a restricting type of Anorexia Nervosa (ANR) ; (2) Investigate the presence of a relationship between the behavioural and affective difficulties measured and the intensity of the disorder; (3) Examine the presence of a relationship between the individual problems and weight gain during inpatient treatment. The sample consisted of 52 inpatient adolescent girls presenting an ANR. The Youth Self Report assessed the behavioural and affective difficulties, while the Eating Disorder Risk Composite was used as the indicator of the intensity of the disorder. A ratio between Body Mass Index (BMI) at admission and at the end of hospitalization was calculated to measure weight gain during treatment. The sample was characterized by an average internalized profile of individual difficulties that reached the clinical threshold. Three different profiles of problems were found within the sample: (1) normative, (2) pure internalizing, (3) mixed (with difficulties that differed from norms on both the internalizing and externalizing clusters). Strong positive correlations were found between individual characteristics and intensity of the disorder, whereas a moderate and negative association was found between weight gain and the externalizing features measured. The internalized profile of difficulties found for the sample (particularly elevated for anxious and depressed problems) seems consistent with previous studies on comorbidities for adolescent ED. This description provides information on the heterogeneity of this specific population, which is otherwise quite similar, hence giving strength to the idea of a global assessment of the functioning of the adolescent at admission and an individualized form of treatment that takes into consideration the specific difficulties reported by the patient. Significant correlations were found between results on the YSR and on the EDRC which proposes that the more important the symptoms of the ANR are, the more affected the functioning of the adolescent will be for the emotional and behavioural problems measured. Finally, results show that girls presenting higher levels of externalized difficulties were those who gained less weight during treatment, which seems to demonstrate that certain treatment strategies could benefit more certain types of patients.	anorexie restrictive , adolescence , Youth Self Report , Restrictive anorexia , Emotional and behavioural problems , BMI	en	14130.0
715	L'évaluation des allégations d’agression sexuelle chez les enfants	This internship report pertains to the assessment of sexual abuse allegations in children. Such offenses are by nature committed avoiding prying eyes, thus leaving few witnesses and little physical evidence to corroborate suspicions of abuse and complicates the investigation by making facts difficult to certify. Thus, only the victim and perpetrator are able to provide evidence to the inquiry. Known to deny or minimize his actions, the perpetrator rarely confirms allegations which often leaves the child’s voice as the sole source of evidence, one that needs to be treated with care. The investigative interview is therefore of vital importance for the protection of victims but also to prove the innocence or guilt of the alleged perpetrator. The objective of this work is to identify the narrative practices and characteristics of interviewers that optimize the interview in order to get the full story of the events with sufficient details. A systematic literature review, using specific inclusion criteria was conducted across three databases. Eleven studies were selected from this review. The main results show a positive association between the establishment of a support-based relationship and the amount of details revealed by the child. The analysis of the studies also permitted to highlight general findings and make recommendations for youth protection social workers on how best to conduct an interview. Such recommendations correspond to specific questioning techniques to consider for preserving the quality of the testimony of the child.

716	Political Sophistication and Vote Intention Switching	This article investigates the link between political sophistication and electoral volatility. Showing that there is disagreement in the literature on whether switching party preferences is related to low or high levels of political sophistication, it is then argued that the effect of sophistication on vote switching might differ depending on when switching is measured. The effect of timing on volatility is investigated by means of the Short-term panel of the 2009 German Longitudinal Election Study.  Results indicate that timing indeed matters, while sophistication increases the probability of switching parties before the campaign, the effect of political sophistication becomes more negative as Election Day draws near.

717	Mesure de la performance dans les organisations de réadaptation en déficience physique	This thesis aims to assess the degree of implementation and use of performance measurement systems (PMS) by decision makers in rehabilitation organizations and to understand the contextual factors that influenced their implementation. A multiple case study was conducted using two data sources: individual interviews with senior executives in rehabilitation organizations from the province of Quebec and organizational documents. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research was used to guide the collection and analysis of data. Intra-case analysis and a cross case analysis were conducted.  Our results show that organisational readiness for PMS implementation was high and that the PMS was successfully implemented and used in several ways, based on organizational needs. Organizations used them passively (as an information tool), purposefully (to act on underperforming areas) and politically (for negotiating with government authorities).  This diverse use of PMS is the result of complex interactions between factors from the internal context of each organization, PMS characteristics, the implementation process and the external environment in which these organizations operate.  Within the internal context, the continued commitment and leadership of senior management were decisive in implementing the PMS through their influence on the identification of the need for a PMS, users’ engagement, organizational priority given to the PMS, resources allocation to its implementation, quality of communications and organizational learning climate. However, even if factors such as resources allocated to the implementation, organizational priority of the PMS and the learning climate were found to be barriers to its implementation, ultimately, these barriers were not important enough to hinder PMS use.  This study also confirmed the importance of PMS characteristics, particularly the perception of quality and usefulness of the information. However, by themselves, these characteristics are insufficient to ensure implementation success.  This implementation analysis also revealed that although the implementation process did not follow formal stages, a PMS development plan, participation and commitment of decision makers and the appointment of a project leader all facilitated implementation of the PMS. However, the lack of evaluation and collective reflection on the implementation process limited the potential for organizational learning, a prerequisite for performance improvement.  As for the external context, the support of an external organization proved to be an essential enabler for PMS implementation by rehabilitation organizations despite the absence of governmental policies and incentives to do so.  This study contributes to increasing knowledge about the contextual factors and their interactions in the implementation of innovations such as PMS and confirms the importance of addressing implementation analysis with a systemic perspective.

718	Caractérisation de l’activité Nur77 et de ses complexes en essais BRET par complémentation	In the central nervous system, dopamine plays a critical role in many physiological functions such as learning, voluntary movement, motivation, cognition and hormone production. It was also shown that the dopamine signaling system is altered in many neurological and psychiatric disorders like Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia. Studies conducted in the laboratory of Dr. Daniel Lévesque (host laboratory) have shown that nuclear receptors Nur77 (NR4A1, NGFI-B) and RXRγ (retinoid X receptor γ isoform) are involved in the regulation of dopamine effects. These data suggest that the Nur77/RXR complex plays a crucial role in the effect of antipsychotic and anti-parkinsonian drugs. However, very few drugs targeting Nur77 have been identified to date and drugs acting at RXRγ remain poorly characterized. Furthermore, currently available tests cannot recapitulate the complexity of nuclear receptor activities and generate indirect measures of drug activities. To better understand Nur77/RXRγ complex activity we developed a new and original Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (BRET)-luciferase Protein Complementation Assay (PCA) based on the recruitment of a co-activator motif fused with YFP. The assays have been validated by dose-response curves using different RXR compounds. EC50 obtained were very similar to the values previously reported in the literature. We were also able to identify a compound, SR11237 (BMS649), which appears to have specificity for the complex Nur77/RXRγ compared to Nurr1/RXRγ and RXRγ/RXRγ. Our results indicate that these BRET assays can be used to evaluate the selectivity of compounds at Nur77/RXRγ, Nurr1/RXRγ or RXRγ/RXRγ complexes.  Another aspect of my PhD project was to better understand how Nur77 activity is regulated by post-translational modifications. We were able to highlight the importance of Nur77 SUMOylation in the activity of monomeric, homodimer and heterodimer forms of Nur77 using various BRET assays. We identified that Nur77 preferentially recruits SUMO2 mainly on its lysine 577 residue. It is interesting to note that SUMO2 recruitment by Nur77 is potentiated in the presence of SUMO E3 ligase PIAS4 (PIASγ). Also, the loss of SUMOylation on lysine 577 strongly reduced co-activator motif recruitment by monomeric form of Nur77, but not for homo- and hetero-dimer complexes. However, PIAS4 by itself does not potentiate co-activator recruitment, suggesting that this SUMO E3 ligase is only involved in the recruitment process of SUMO, but not in the co-activator recruitment. Thus, we identified a new post-translational modification on Nur77 that specifically regulates its monomeric activity.  These results provide critical new data that will help to identify new compounds targeting selective nuclear receptor complexes (Nur77/RXR) that may improve the treatment of Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia, as well as to get a better understanding of the mechanisms regulating the activity of Nur77.

719	Le sentiment d'appartenance à l'école : un regard conceptuel, psychométrique et théorique	Since it is tightly linked to a certain number of positive consequences (Creemers & Kyriakides, 2008; Finn, 1989; Roeser & Eccles, 2009; Tinto 1987; Wehlage et al., 1989), school belonging is considered an important element that needs to be developed and maintained by Education professionals (MELS, 2012). This emphasis on school belonging instigated our doctoral research. The purpose of this study was to investigate further the concept of school belonging. We decided that the results obtained ought to be presented in three separate research articles.   This first article outlines a conceptual analysis to clarify the concept of the sense of school belonging. It focusses on Walker and Avant’s (2011) conceptual method. This method is useful to understand fully a concept. Data were collected through a comprehensive review of French and English definitions. The literature review and empirical referents gathered show that the concept is of a multidimensional nature. Data analysis shows four specific features. A student must : (1) feel a positive emotion; (2) interact socially; (3) get involved in his(her) environment; (4) perceive some similarity with members of his(her) group (fit).   After having understood the meaning of school belonging in the article 1, the second article aims at examining the factorial structure and the invariance of the instrument Psychological Sense of School Membership (PSSM) with regards to boys and girls. The PSSM is a tool used to measure students' school belonging. This study was conducted among a sample of 766 girls and 391 boys in 10th grade. Three factors were identified, each representing students’ perceptions of their school environment: (1) quality of social relations students-students; (2) quality of social relations students-teachers and (3) feeling of acceptance. Multi-group confirmatory factor analysis indicated that the PSSM is an invariant instrument with regard to girls and boys.   Finally, the third article was conducted with 4166 (12th grade) high school students to determine the ways school belonging can be connected to academic achievement (Anderman & Freeman, 2004; Connell & et al., 1994; Roeser et al., 1996). To more thoroughly investigate these psychological processes, we applied the Anderman-Freeman model to validate the following hypotheses through path analysis; H1 Positive emotions positively and partially mediate the relationship between school belonging and behavioral engagement; H2 Positive emotions positively and partially mediate the relationship between school belonging and emotional engagement; H3 Positive emotions positively and partially mediate the positive relationship between school belonging and cognitive engagement; H4 Emotional, cognitive and behavioral engagement positively and partially mediate the positive relationship between school belonging and academic achievement. Our results partially support the first hypothesis. Our findings do support hypotheses two, three and four. Specifically, the relationship between school belonging and emotional engagement shows a more direct than an indirect effect (hypothesis two). The study produced similar results for cognitive engagement, i.e., a direct effect (hypothesis three). Finally, the relationship between school belonging and academic achievement indicates a more indirect than direct effect (hypothesis four). To conclude, we suggest some recommendations aimed at Education professionals.	School belonging , Academic achievement , High school students	en	14049.0
720	Développement d’une lentille cornéenne médicamentée	The development of corneal contact lenses initially aimed to correct vision troubles but more recently targets to improve administration of ophthalmic drugs. Eye drops from ophthalmic solutions has a poor administration efficiency of 5% or less and is currently the most used method to deliver drugs to the eye. Such administration technique needs to be improved and contact lenses could be the solution according to many opticians. However, no marketed therapeutic contact lenses has been marketed up to date. In this project we have developed a model of a contact lens made of 2-(hydroxyethyl)methacrylate embedding microgels of poly N-isopropylacrylamide (pNIPAM), encapsulating a model drug. We first developed an analytical method capable to quantify simultaneously seven ophthalmic drugs: Pilocarpine, lidocaine, proparacaine, atropine, triamcinolone acetonide, timolol and prednisolone. This method was developed on a HPLC-MS/MS device and was validated according to FDA and ICH criteria. Using this method, we achieved very low detection and quantitation limits with high precision and accuracy in both simulated lachrymal fluids and in rabbit ocular tissues. Each seven drugs was validated using this method. We proceeded with the synthesis of negatively charged microgels of NIPAM using methacrylic acid (MAA) as comonomer. Resulting size were ranging between 200-600 nm and zeta potential was found to increase (absolute value) with temperature. The microgels were used to encapsulate a model molecule, rhodamine 6G (R6G), in different medium and were loaded in the microgel up to 38% (drug loading, DL%). Using Langmuir isotherms to measure affinity and adsorption of R6G, it was found well correlated to MAA content in microgels, suggesting electrostatic interaction was the main parameter for drug loading. Release kinetics was performed using a model hydrogel of acrylamide embedding the R6G-loaded microgels. The measured release was found to follow an affinity-based mechanism for over 4-24 hours. The release kinetics were then compared to a formulation of liposomes and nanogels of chitosan embedded in hydrogel. All formulations exhibited interesting release profiles making them promising systems for different therapeutic applications. Finally, we changed the acrylamide gels for pHEMA designed to reproduce contact lenses containing drug-loaded microgels. The hydrogel composition, in terms of monomer / cross-linker ratio, was first optimized to fit contact lenses properties of 260-340 µm thick contact lenses. We also made use of semi-interpenetrated polyvinylpirrolidone (PVP) in the pHEMA hydrogel matrix to increase its water content. The highest DL% of negatively charged microgels were obtained using lidocaine and were used for release studies, where the total content of lidocaine was released in approximately 2 hours with and without microgels. In the end, this was a pilot study aiming to evaluate the potential of microgel usability in contact lenses. However, the impact of microgels on release was not fully conclusive. Additional studies should be undertaken to achieve a better comprehension and characterization of the release mechanism such as using more eye relevant physiological models. Such studies would provide further insights on the use of such materials for eye drug delivery and its applicability.

721	La modernisation de Tunis : un urbanisme et une architecture d’État au miroir d’une anthologie de la percée dans la médina (1881-1987)	This thesis deals with some key moments in the modern urban and architectural history of Tunis, in conjunction with the problematic of building a straight avenue through the historical core of the city : the Medina.This intervention in ancient urban fabric has its origins in an urban modernization project launched by the Beys of Tunis during the 19th century, pursued by the French coloniser from 1881 to 1956 and then by the independent government from 1956 to 1987. The research is organised in three time periods with main focus on the project called “la percée de la Casbah” adopted by the first president Habib Bourguiba at the end of 1959. For several reasons, it has been quoted in a sketchy way in the literature despite its importance in understanding the actual urban and architectural face of the Tunisian capital. In order to understand this chapter more thoroughly, we had to go back to the first attempts of urban improvement of the city conducted by the French coloniser since 1887. Studying further, we were able to identify the direct ancestor of what we called “la Percée Bourguibienne” appearing in the master plan of Tunis in 1948. From the first period (1881-1956), we highlighted the colonial strategies in managing the territory and their relationship to the process of valorisation/devalorisation of the Arab-Islamic heritage. The second period (1956-1964), coinciding with the initiation of decolonization conducted by the independent government since 1955, is being marked by an “open International competition for studying the development of the city of Tunis” organized by the Secretariat of State for public works in collaboration with the International Union of architects. Studying this event and the following seminar, the real political and economic reasons could be unveiled, concealed behind the trivial arguments concerning hygiene, traffic and beautification of Tunis. In order to reinforce this conclusion, the third period (1964-1987) has been dedicated to studying the main projects following the competition. The approach of the authorities focusing on the symbols of power and the obsessive desire to take ownership of them, reduced this improvement plan to a simple redistribution of the symbols of national sovereignty in favor of centralization and personification of the political power. This thesis belongs to the postcolonial studies. It projects a critical point of view on the decolonization in relation to what we named “urbanisme d’état” (urbanism of State). Propelled by a certain perception of Modernity, this urbanism is closely related to the political instrumentalization that puts emphasis on the question of identity and heritage, insists on rupture with the past simultaneously and tends to distract the public conscience from the issues related to territory development and preservation of collective memory. By using both of the methods: the contextual analysis of historical facts and the typomorphological analysis, this research draws attention to the magnitude of some governmental decisions regarding the development of urban space and the conservation of the architectural heritage throughout the time. It also informs about the role of communities, the elite and the professionals in channeling these decisions for or against their right to the city.

722	Les débats publics suscités par la création des Expos de Montréal	The 1960’s in Québec were marked by an intense nationalist movement promoting the political and cultural affirmation of the province’s francophone population. Also, the americanization of the territory was accelarating. It’s in this particular historical context that were born the Montreal Expos, in 1968, the team being part of the most important baseball league in the world, The Major League Baseball. The MLB then settled on a land where baseball is centenary. The goal of this master thesis is to study the debates and reactions that were created by the advent of Montreal in major baseball, and to determine the influence that the québécois nationalism, the Québec’s americanization and the long history of baseball in the province had on them. Even though both national communities of Québec are studied, the focus is further more on the francophones than the anglophones. The first ones seemed to be more interpellated by the creation of the Expos. Besides that, for the two linguistic groups, the actors who shared the most clearly and often their positions are the sports journalists, whom are in the center of our analysis. The opinions of baseball fans, politicians, buisness men and regular Quebec’s citizens are also presented and analyzed, but with less attention.

723	Interactions métaboliques entre le bisphénol A et le naproxène dans un modèle de foie de rat isolé et perfusé	Exposure to mixtures of contaminants (environmental, alimentary or therapeutic) poses many questions and concerns about the probability of toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic interactions. Such co-exposure may influence the mode of action of the cocktail of components and therefore their toxicity, as a result of an increase of their internal concentrations. Bisphenol A (2,2-dihydroxy-4 diphenylpropane) is a ubiquitous chemical contaminant  in our environment, widely used in the manufacture of plastics, with one of the largest production volumes globally. It is an endocrine disruptor of oestrogen-mimetic type. This molecule is metabolized into non-toxic metabolites by glucuronidation process. Several factors including the co-exposure to other xenobiotics may reduce the glucuronidation rate of the chemical pollutant of interest, such as a co-exposure with drugs.  Given that the consumption of therapeutic products is a growing phenomenon in the population, simultaneous exposures of pollutants with medicinal drugs are becoming a concern for health risk assessment. Knowing that metabolic inhibition is the most plausible mechanism of interaction that could result in an increase of the internal levels and a modulation of the expected toxicity, the present study aimed at confirming and characterizing this type of metabolic interactions between bisphenol A and naproxen, which is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), on the set of an intact organ using isolated and perfused rat liver system (IPRL). The study also served to determine the enzyme kinetics metabolism of each substance alone and in binary mixture. In a second step, we also evaluated the influence of the presence of albumin on the metabolic kinetics and behavior of the two substances studied using the same in vivo perfusion model of rat liver. Metabolic constants were determined by nonlinear regression. The metabolism of BPA and NAP alone demonstrated saturable kinetics with maximal velocity (Vmax) and affinity constant (Km) equal to 8.9 nmol/min/mg prot liver and 51.6 μM for BPA, and      3 nmol/min/mg prot liver and 149.2 μM for NAP. The analysis of combined exposures suggests a partial competitive inhibition of BPA metabolism by NAP with a Ki value estimated at 0.3542 µM. From these results, it appears that the risk assessment of environmental pollutants must therefore consider the consumption of pharmaceutical products as an important agent that can increase the internal levels for a given exposure. Accordingly, these in vivo data on metabolic interactions can be incorporated into a physiologically based pharmacokinetic models (PBPK) to predict the toxicokinetic consequences (TK) of the exposure by an individual to these chemical mixtures.

724	Biochemical mechanisms involved in pulmonary hypo-alveolarization induced by peroxides contaminating parenteral nutrition in newborn guinea pig	Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a major complication of preterm newborns, affecting nearly 50% of infants born before 29 weeks of gestation. BPD is characterized by an arrest in alveolar development. The onset of BPD is related to oxidative stress. Research has shown that parenteral nutrition (PN), which is given to preterm newborns to bypass an immature gastrointestinal system, is a major source of oxidative stress. Indeed, PN is contaminated with peroxides, including ascorbylperoxide, an oxidized form of dehydroascorbic acid. Ambient light is a catalyst for the generation of peroxides. Photo-protection of PN, although difficult to apply in the clinical situation, is associated with a lower incidence of BPD in premature infants and with better alveolar outcomes in animal models of neonatal PN. We hypothesized that the ascorbylperoxide in PN disrupts alveolar development. The main mechanism of action is an inhibition of the transformation of methionine into cysteine in the liver, leading to a lower glutathione synthesis in the liver as well as in peripheral tissues such as lung. Lower glutathione (GSH) concentrations favour a shift of redox potential to a more oxidized state and consequently, to exaggerated apoptosis. If our hypothesis is correct, the addition of glutathione to PN would help detoxify ascorbylperoxide through the action of glutathione peroxidase and prevent the deleterious impact of PN. Objectives: The aims of my research project were to investigate the biochemical mechanisms linking PN to the development of BPD in premature newborns and to propose a nutritional alternative that would prevent the occurrence of this frequently observed complication. Specific objectives were: 1) to assess the effect of intravenously infused ascorbylperoxide on the metabolic axis redox potential of glutathione in the lung; specifically, apoptosis and the alveolarization index; 2) to study the impact of ascorbylperoxide and the redox potential on the activity of methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT) in the liver; methionine adenosyltransferase is the first enzyme in the metabolic cascade from methionine to cysteine; and 3) to try to prevent the deleterious impact of PN or ascorbylperoxide infusions on the lung by improving glutathione status.  Methods: Through a catheter in the jugular vein, 3-day-old guinea pigs (n = 8 per group) received continuous infusions of PN or a simple solution (dextrose + NaCl) enriched with different molecules for testing. The first objective was achieved by enriching the basic solution with ascorbylperoxide at concentrations of 0, 20, 60 and 180 M. To mimic clinical conditions, these solutions contained, or not, 350 M H2O2. The second objective was achieved by investigating the mechanisms of MAT inhibition in animals infused, or not, with solutions consisting of the basic solution, peroxides, glutathione, and PN (dextrose + amino acids + multivitamins + lipids). The third objective was achieved by adding, or not, 10 M of glutathione (GSSG) to the ascorbylperoxide or PN solution until a normal plasma concentration of glutathione was obtained. After 4 days, the lungs were removed. GSH and GSSG levels in the lungs were determined by capillary electrophoresis. The redox potential was calculated using the Nernst equation. The activation and the concentration of active caspase-3 (marker of apoptosis) were determined by Western blot, and the alveolarization index quantified by the number of intercepts between histological structures and a calibrated straight line. Data were compared by ANOVA; effects were considered significant if p was less than 0.05. Results: The infusion of ascorbylperoxide, independently of H2O2, induced hypoalveolarization, activation of caspase-3, and oxidation of the redox potential, in a dose-dependent manner. These effects were prevented by the addition of GSSG to the ascorbylperoxide (180 M) or PN solutions. Ascorbylperoxide and H2O2 inhibited MAT activity in the liver. Hepatic MAT activity was linearly modulated by the value of the redox potential. Conclusion: Our results suggest that ascorbylperoxide is the active ingredient in PN that leads to the development of BPD. Correcting the low glutathione levels induced by peroxides in PN solutions would promote the detoxification of peroxides and re-establish proper pulmonary redox potentials. Glutathione correction further protects the lungs from the deleterious effects of PN by bypassing hepatic MAT inhibition. This result is of great importance because it gives hope for the possible prevention of BPD.

725	Plasticité du cortex visuel: «homéodynamie» des connexions neuronales et modèle d’effets d’antidépresseurs	Sensory informations are computed in the cortex by networks of co-activated neurons forming functional ensembles. Visual processing in the cortex underlies several aspects of neuronal characteristics such as anatomical, electrophysiological and molecular.  In the primary visual cortex,  neurons  display  selectivity  for  stimulus  features  such  as  orientation,  motion direction and spatial frequency. Each stimulus property elicits a maximal firing rate of specific neuronal populations.  Visual neurons display transient modifications of their response properties following prolonged exposure to an appropriate stimulus using visual learning or visual adaptation to a non-preferred stimulus.  The main objective of this thesis is to investigate the neuronal mechanisms underlying the visual processing during adaptation-induced plasticity in adult animals. These mechanisms are examined through different aspects: the neuronal connectivity, the neuronal selectivity, the electrical properties of neurons, and the effects of drugs (serotonin and fluoxetine). The tested model is the orientation columns of the primary visual cortex.  The present thesis is divided into four main chapters. The first chapter (A) focuses on the cortical reorganization following visual adaptation. The second chapter (B) examines the neuronal connectivity using pair-wise correlations and populational correlations of neuronal activities. The third chapter (C) further relate the previous aspects, i.e. the adaptation effects and the functional connectivity to the properties of neurons (two classes: regular-spiking and   fast-spiking neurons). Finally, the fourth chapter (D) investigates the coupling of visual adaptation with the local administration of drugs (serotonin and fluoxetine).      Methodology Using in vivo extracellular recordings of the neural activity in the primary visual cortex (V1) combined with intrinsic optical brain imaging, we record the spiking activity of neuronal populations and examine, from the multi-unit activity, the activity of individual neurons. The analysis of brain activity uses different algorithms: the electrophysiological distinctions between neurons are based on the trough-to-peak time of each spike (spike-width), the selectivity of neurons is based on the firing rate at different stimuli, and the functional connectivity uses a crosscorrelation computation. The usage of drugs is performed locally on the visual cortex (after craniotomy and removing of the dura). Results and conclusions In the first chapter, we demonstrate the ability of neurons to modify their selectivity to the presented stimuli following visual adaptation, exhibiting a well-organized reprogramming of the orientation columns; we attribute this result to a flexibility of functional units rather than rigid anatomical structures. Indeed, we observe an extensive restructuring of the complete orientation domain in order to refine the columnar organization where every stimulus is equally represented. This is further confirmed in the second chapter where in this case, the connectivity maps are investigated. In concordance with the previous results, the connectivity maps also exhibit restructuring but interestingly, neurons use a summative strategy to stabilize their total connectivity weights. These connectivity dynamics are examined in the third chapter in relation to electrophysiological properties of neurons. Indeed, two differently firing modes dissociate between two classes of neurons. Their distinct correlation dynamics point to the fact that they play different key roles in stimulus encoding within a neuronal population. Finally, in the last chapter, visual adaptation is coupled with the administration of serotonin and fluoxetine. Both drugs produce similar effects by facilitating the acquisition of the imposed stimulus. The non-preferred stimulus when adapted with the presence of the drug results in an increased firing rate of neurons at this particular stimulus. We present a neuronal model based on our findings to explain the fluctuations of firing with and without the drug.        This thesis provides new insights into how visual neurons adapt to change their selectivity in the interplay between their plastic ability and their homeostatic dynamic.

726	Learning representations for Information Retrieval	Information retrieval is generally concerned with answering questions such as: is this document relevant to this query? How similar are two queries or two documents? How query and document similarity can be used to enhance relevance estimation? In order to answer these questions, it is necessary to access computational representations of documents and queries. For example, similarities between documents and queries may correspond to a distance or a divergence defined on the representation space. It is generally assumed that the quality of the representation has a direct impact on the bias with respect to the true similarity, estimated by means of human intervention. Building useful representations for documents and queries has always been central to information retrieval research.  The goal of this thesis is to provide new ways of estimating such representations and the relevance relationship between them. We present four articles that have been published in international conferences and one published in an information retrieval evaluation forum. The first two articles can be categorized as feature engineering approaches, which transduce a priori knowledge about the domain into the features of the representation. We present a novel retrieval model that compares favorably to existing models in terms of both theoretical originality and experimental effectiveness. The remaining two articles mark a significant change in our vision and originate from the widespread interest in deep learning research that took place during the time they were written. Therefore, they naturally belong to the category of representation learning approaches, also known as feature learning. Differently from previous approaches, the learning model discovers alone the most important features for the task at hand, given a considerable amount of labeled data. We propose to model the semantic relationships between documents and queries and between queries themselves. The models presented have also shown improved effectiveness on standard test collections. These last articles are amongst the first applications of representation learning with neural networks for information retrieval. This series of research leads to the following observation: future improvements of information retrieval effectiveness has to rely on representation learning techniques instead of manually defining the representation space.	retrieval models , query suggestion , neural networks , word embeddings , suggestion de requête	en	13966.0
727	Spectroscopie Raman de fibres électrofilées : développement de méthodes et application aux fibres individuelles	Electrospinning is an efficient and versatile technique to produce continuous fibers of typical diameter of a few hundred nanometers from the application of a high voltage on a concentrated and entangled polymer solution. The rapid solvent evaporation and the significant elongational forces involved in the fiber formation process give rise to unusual properties that are interesting for various types of applications, but that are yet to be fully explored. Due to their small size, these materials have been, for a long time, studied into bundles composed of thousands of fibers using conventional techniques such as infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. Our current understanding of their behavior thus relies on a convolution of the properties of the mat and the specific characteristics of each fiber composing it. Recent studies at the individual fiber level have revealed unusual properties, particularly an exponential increase of the modulus with the diameter reduction. The orientation and the molecular structure within the fibers are suspected to be at the origin of these properties, but in a way that is still far from being understood. Establishing clear structure/properties relationships and identifying the parameters that influence them represent significant challenges. However, they are of tremendous importance to fully take advantage of the specific characteristics of electrospun fibers. A key step toward this goal is to develop methodologies that enable fast and in-depth structural analysis on large quantities of individual fibers with a large diameter range.  In this thesis, confocal Raman spectroscopy is used to probe structural characteristics of individual fibers such as their molecular orientation, crystallinity and disentanglement. A new methodology for orientation quantification is first demonstrated theoretically with the objectives of reducing the experimental complexity of the Raman measurements, of extending the variety of materials that can be analysed, and of eliminating recurrent errors brought by the use of the conventional method. The experimental validity and applicability of this new method, referred to as MDP, is then demonstrated. Following this, an efficient protocol enabling the structural study of individual electrospun fibers by confocal Raman spectroscopy is presented, using poly(ethylene therephthalate) as a model system. The limitations of the technique are exposed and experimental strategies to circumvent them are highlighted. Results reveal the large variability of the orientation and of chain conformation from fiber to fiber, showing the importance and the relevance of statistical studies of individual fibers.  Following this, the presence of chains showing a level of entanglement lower in electrospun fibers than in the bulk is demonstrated experimentally for the first time using infrared spectroscopy on bundles of polystyrene fibers. The principal electrospinning conditions promoting this structural phenomenon, which is suspected to influence greatly the properties of the fibers, are identified. Finally, the various methodologies developed in the thesis are combined for an in-depth study of orientation and disentanglement on large quantities of individual polystyrene fibers covering a large diameter range. This last study enables establishing the first structure/properties relationships for these materials, at the individual fiber scale, by clearly exposing the link between orientation, disentanglement and the elastic modulus of the fibers.

728	Strategy-proof choice of acts : a preliminary study	We model social choices as acts mapping states of the world to (social) outcomes. A (social choice) rule assigns an act to every profile of subjective expected utility preferences over acts. A rule is strategy-proof if no agent ever has an incentive to misrepresent her beliefs about the world or her valuation of the outcomes; it is ex-post efficient if the act selected at any given preference profile picks a Pareto-efficient outcome in every state of the world. We show that every two-agent ex-post efficient and strategy-proof rule is a top selection: the chosen act picks the most preferred outcome of some (possibly different) agent in every state of the world. The states in which an agent’s top outcome is selected cannot vary with the reported valuations of the outcomes but may change with the reported beliefs. We give a complete characterization of the ex-post efficient and strategy-proof rules in the two-agent, two-state case, and we identify a rich class of such rules in the two-agent case.

729	Effets de la stimulation magnétique transcrânienne dans la maladie de Parkinson avec déficits cognitifs légers	Cognitive impairment affects many patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) in the early phase of the disease and up to 80% of them will eventually develop dementia. Many studies suggests that these cognitive deficits are mediated by functional alterations in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), possibly in relation with the caudate nucleus. Previous results from our group showed an increase in activity and connectivity within the cognitive cortico-striatal loop when applying transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) using intermittent « theta burst »  (iTBS) parameters over left DLPFC. For this study, 24 idiopathic PD patients with cognitive impairment were recruited and divided into two groups : active iTBS group (N=15) and sham group (simulated stimulation, N=9). Detailed neuropsychological assessment of five cognitive domains (attention, executive functions, language, memory, visuospatial abilities) was performed on day 1, 8, 17 and 37. iTBS protocol over left DLPFC was performed on day 2, 4 and 7. Z scores were calculated for each domain and for the overall cognition performance.  Our results showed a significant increase in overall cognition up to 10 days after receiving active iTBS, improving mainly attention, executive functions and visuospatial abilities. This effect was not replicated in the sham group. Therefore, our results suggest that iTBS can modulate cognitive performance in PD patients with cognitive deficits.	iTBS , Parkinson’s disease , Cognitive impairment , TMS	en	13900.0
730	Impact des cavines sur le phénotype invasif et inflammatoire des cellules souches mésenchymateuses	The evolution of an initiated tumor cell into a solid tumor requires at each stage a favorable microenvironment for its survival and growth. The tumor microenvironment is compared to a chronic inflammation site with a cellular and molecular complex composition. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have important roles in tumor microenvironment. They migrate to tumor sites where they maintain the inflammation, angiogenesis and tumor development by activating multiple signaling pathways. One of the major pathways that contribute to inflammation is the NF-B signaling pathway. The initiation of this pathway comes from the cell membrane and caveolae. Our hypothesis is that one of cavins, proteins associated to caveolae, modulates the inflammatory phenotype and migration in MSC treated with TNF-. We suggest that this process is modulated by a NF-B signaling pathway. Indeed, we observed an up-regulation of the expression of the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and a decrease in the expression of IκB which suggest that activation of the NF-B pathway is involved in the MSC treated with TNF. We found that the TNF- induced migration in the MSC, and the knockout of Cavin-2 significantly increased migration of MSC treated with TNF-. The silencing of Cavin-2 considerably increased tubulogenesis of MSC treated with TNF-. At the molecular level, knockout of Cavin-2 showed a very strong amplification of protein expression of COX-2 in the MSC in response to TNF-. In these same cells where Cavin-2 was repressed and treated with TNF-, the peak of phosphorylation of pIB is more intense and the phosphorylation curve is sustained in time. These observations allow us to assert that Cavin-2 has a repressing role on the expression of COX-2. Collectively, our results show that the gene encoding Cavin-2 can be proposed as tumor suppressor gene. This study allowed us to identify new therapeutic targets: Cavins proteins.

731	Mécanismes d'action des cellules stromales mésenchymateuses dans le traitement de la réaction du greffon contre l'hôte	Graft versus host disease (GvHD) is a very serious side effect of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). This disease results in high mortality and devastating symptoms. Treatments for GvHD include a lot of pharmaceuticals, including corticosteroids, but these are immunosuppressive and their adverse effects cause a lot of damage to the patient and hinder the healing process. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) represent a potential alternative or addition to the GvHD treatment regimen. These cells do not seem to carry the secondary effects associated with classical treatments. A number of studies have been registered concerning MSC. In spite of the spike of interest, the mechanism of immunomodulation deployed by MSC remains to be elucidated. Our objective is to better characterise this mechanism. We have used a simple in vitro model to simulate GvHD. This model is based on the stimulation of CD4+ T cells by allogenic dendritic cells. The measure of the proliferation of the stimulated lymphocytes serves as an indicator of the reactivity. According to the results obtained by CRISPR genetic engineering, MSC exert this immunomodulatory effect on T cells mainly by the secretion of IDO1 enzyme. These MSC are also able to induce T cells to become inhibitory, a process independent of the secretion of IDO1. However, these inhibitory T cells would not correspond to conventional Treg cells.

732	Étude du rôle des régions variables 4 et 5 dans les changements de conformation de la gp120 du VIH-1	HIV infects cells by fusing its membrane with the membrane of the target cell. This fusion is performed by the envelope glycoproteins (Env) which are synthesized as a precursor, gp160, which is later cleaved into gp120 and gp41. The transmembrane protein gp41 anchors the envelope complex to the viral particle whereas the gp120 ensures the binding to the cell receptor CD4 and coreceptor CCR5 or CXCR4. These sequential interactions trigger conformational changes on Env that fuel the viral entry process ultimately leading to the insertion of the gp41-derived-fusion peptide into the target cell membrane. The exterior subunit gp120 contains five variable regions (V1 to V5), of which three (V1, V2 and V3) have been shown to restrain the spontaneous sampling of the CD4-bound conformation by gp120. However, the role of variable regions V4 and V5 in these conformational changes remains unknown. To investigate their effect, mutants of the clade B YU2 primary isolate, comprising a deletion of the V5 or mutating all V4 potential N-linked glycosylation sites (PNGS), have been generated. The effect of mutations on the conformation of the envelope glycoproteins was analyzed by immunoprecipitation with conformation-dependent antibodies and surface plasmon resonance. Neither the removal of the V4 PNGS nor the removal of V5 affected Env conformational changes as measured by these techniques. Thus, suggesting that variable regions V1, V2 and V3 are the major players in preventing Env from spontaneously snapping into the CD4-bound conformation.

733	Optimisation du promoteur CR5 inductible au cumate	Biologics are a very promising therapeutic avenue for the treatment of incurable diseases such as cancer. The market’s demand for these products is very high, so reliable and efficient industrial bioprocesses must be set up in order to answer it. The cumate gene switch (CR5) developed by Bernard Massie’s group allows high and fine-tuned expression of proteins of interest in CHO cells. Optimisation of this system is however a necessary work to maximise the expression and improve the leakiness of the system. For this purpose, promoters with different spacing configurations, transactivators with different activation domains, and a synthetic operator sequence have been assayed to evaluate their ability to drive high protein expression while improving the leakiness of the CR5 system. Thus, a promoter containing three operator sequences with a six base pairs spacing between them has been found to be the most efficient configuration in terms of yield and leakiness in comparison to the current CR5 configuration. Also, a new configuration of the CR5 where the transactivator is regulated by the coumermycin gene regulation system has been studied, showing very tight regulation ability. This optimisation work can only be applied to our specific experimental conditions and its application to other cell lines and promoters needs to be demonstrated.	cumate , CR5 , optimisation , coumermycin , inducible systems , CHO cells	en	13881.0
734	Caractérisation des unités de soins aigus chirurgicaux au sein des départements de chirurgie générale au Canada	Introduction : The acute care surgery (ACS) units are dedicated to the prompt management of surgical emergencies. It is a systemic way of organizing on-call services to diminish conflict between urgent care and elective obligations. The aim of this study was to define the characteristics of an ACS unit and to find common criteria in units with reported good functioning.   Methods : As of July 1st 2014, 22 Canadian hospitals reported having an ACS unit. A survey with questions about the organization of the ACS units, the population it serves, the number of emergencies and trauma cases treated per year, and the satisfaction about the implementation of this ACS unit was sent to those hospitals.  Results : The survey’s response rate was 73%. The majority of hospitals were tertiary or quaternary centers, served a population of more than 200 000 and had their ACS unit for more than three years. The median number of surgeons participating in an  ACS unit was 8.5 and the majority were doing seven day rotations. The median number of operating room days was 2.5 per week. Most ACS units (85%) had an estimated annual volume of more than 2500 emergency consultations (including both trauma and non-trauma) and 80% operated over 1000 cases per year. Nearly all the respondents (94%) were satisfied with the implementation of the ACS unit in their hospital.   Conclusion : Most surgeons felt that the implementation of an ACS unit resulted in positive outcomes. However, there should be a sizeable catchment population and number of surgical emergencies to justify the resulting financial and human resources.

735	Biomarqueurs pronostiques dans le cancer de la prostate : mieux prédire pour mieux traiter	Prostate cancer (PC) is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in North America and is ranked third in terms of mortality. After first line treatments, 20-30% of patients with localized disease will develop biochemical recurrence. Androgen-deprivation therapy is often used as a second line treatment, but some patients unfortunately progress to the castrate-resistant state, for which no curative treatment exists, and which is associated with high morbidity (bone metastasis) and a mean survival of less than two years. PC has a heterogeneous evolution among patients and to date no prognostic markers exist to identify those with a higher risk of biochemical recurrence, bone metastasis or castrate-resistant disease.  Many studies have shown that the inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8 are implicated in PC progression and the development of castration-resistance. In addition, high serum levels of these markers are associated with a worse outcome. Previous work has shown that the kinase IKKε is associated with higher levels of IL-6 and IL-8 in vitro, and that its expression is higher in tissue samples of more advanced disease.  The first objective was to assess the association between IKKε, IL-6 and IL-8 tissular expression levels and clinical parameters. Our results suggest that IKKε has prognostic properties in terms of biochemical recurrence and the development of bone metastasis. No association between IL-6/IL-8 and the clinical parameters was identified. The second objective was to evaluate the coexpression of these molecules within the PC epithelium. Our results confirm previous in vitro observations showing a strong correlation between IKKε, IL-6 and IL-8 expression levels. The third objective was to compare within the same patients the expression levels of IL-6 and IL-8 in the serum and PC tissue samples. No relation was identified suggesting that serum levels of these cytokines are not only of prostatic origin.  In conclusion, the research project presented highlights the potential of IKKε as a prognostic biomarker in tissue samples and validated for the first time its correlation with IL-6 and IL-8, both well-established cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of PC. Further studies can further investigate the IKKε signaling pathways implicated in the stimulation of IL-6 and IL-8 production and by which mechanisms IKKε could contribute to the transition into castration-resistance.

736	Role of E3-ligase parkin in mitochondrial quality control in a cardiotoxicity model to anthracyclines	Mitochondria are becoming the focus of many studies because of their increasingly important role in cellular damage and related myopathies. Their endogenous quality control mechanisms are recognized for their crucial role in mitochondrial health. In our study, we attempted to determine if the deficit of mitophagy in Parkin deficient mice would cause an exacerbation of mitochondrial dysfunctions usually induced by doxorubicin. We have analyzed the impact of the ablation of Parkin in response to treatment with doxorubicin at the level of cardiac functions, mitochondrial functions as well as mitochondrial enzymology. Our results demonstrated that at baseline, the absence of Parkin didn’t induce cardiac pathologies but was associated with many mitochondrial dysfunctions. Doxorubicin induced respiratory dysfunctions, mitochondrial oxidative stress as well as greater susceptibility to permeability transition pore (PTP) opening. Finally, contrary to our hypothesis, the absence of Parkin, didn’t exacerbate mitochondrial dysfunctions induced by doxorubicin and seemed to have a protective effect.	respiration , ROS , mPTP , parkin , mitochondria , cardiac muscle , mitophagy , doxorubicin	en	13809.0
737	Effets d'un programme d'exercices aérobie et en résistance, combinés, chez les patients atteints de fibrose kystique, intolérants au glucose ou diabétiques	Cystic fibrosis (CF) is one of the most common rare diseases in Canada with a median age of survival of 50.9 years. However, the improvement in life expectancy is associated with the emergence of secondary complications such as CF related diabetes (CFRD). Present in 25 to 40 % of adults, CFRD is associated with decreased lung function and weight as well as a 6 times increase in risk of morbidity and mortality. CFRD is primarily caused by insulinopenia, however, insulin resistance contribution remains controversial in CF. Recent studies in type 2 diabetes described an improvement of glycemic control in patients undertaking combined exercise program (aerobic & resistance).  In CF, an improvement in insulin sensitivity may result in improved glucose tolerance. There is currently no study demonstrating that exercise improves glucose tolerance in patients with CF. The aim of this study is to determine, in CF patients, if a combined exercise program is beneficial to improve glucose values at the 2nd hour of the OGTT.  Method: 18 sedentary adults with CF and with abnormal glucose tolerance were recruited for this study (8 men, 10 women, age: 33 ± 9.4 years, FEV1 71.5% pred ± 12.5, BMI 23.57 kg/m2 ± 3.4). Participants were randomly assigned to a control or exercise group. VO2max, OGTT, muscular endurance and strength, and quality of life were measured pre and post intervention. Results: 14 participants completed the protocol.  Participants from exercise group improved their plasmatic glucose at the 2nd hour of OGTT (-2.34 +/- 0.87 mmol/L; p < 0.01; CI 99.22%), at 1st hour of OGTT (-2.0 mmol/L; p<0.05) and presented a reduction of 17.2% (p<0.05) in the total glucose area under the curve. Conclusion: Combined exercise program improves glycemic control in CF patients. This non pharmacological approach could have the potential to delay the onset of CFRD.	cystic fibrosis related diabetes , combined exercise , glucose tolerance	en	13801.0
738	Validation d’une échelle d’observation comportementale du confort d’enfants brûlés lors de procédures douloureuses	An interdisciplinary team of a pediatric university teaching hospital in the Montreal area, who treats  annually a considerable number of child burn victims, developed a behavioral observation scale on the comfort of children of 7 years of age and less during painful procedures «Échelle d’observation comportementale du confort d’enfants brûlés» (OCCEB- BECCO). The goal of this study was to initiate the validation of OCCEB-BECCO, a new tool for evaluation of comfort for child burn victims. With samples of 16 patients and 5 experts, we proceeded to the evaluation of content validity, internal consistency and criterion validity. Results have shown adequate content validity, internal consistency with (T1) r = 0,96 p < 0,0001, (T2) r = 0,95 p < 0,0001, (T3) r = 0,95 p < 0,0001 and criterion validity with Cronbach alpha at 0,82. A future study with a larger sample and on a longer period of time would be required to pursue validation of this new scale.

739	Priv-C : une politique de confidentialité personnalisable	Privacy policies define the way online services collect, use and share users’ data. Although they are the main channel through which users are informed about the use of their private data, privacy policies are generally ignored by them. This is due to their long and vague content, their difficult vocabulary and their no standard format. Privacy policies also confront users to a dilemma. Indeed, they must agree to all their content in order to use the service or reject it, and in this case they do not have access to the service. No other alternative is given to the user. Online services process data collected from users to provide them a service, but they also exploit those data for economic purposes (targeted advertising, resale, etc.). According to various studies, allowing users to benefit from the use of their data could restore their trust towards online services and facilitate data exchanges on the Internet. In this work, we propose a new model of privacy policy, inspired by the P3P (a World Wide Web Consortium - W3C Recommendation) but increasing its functionalities and reducing its complexity. This model defines a specific structure allowing users and online services to define their preferences and needs. Users have the opportunity to decide for each of their private data, specifying how it will be used and shared. A negotiation phase will allow a needs analysis of the online service and preferences of the user to establish a confidentiality agreement. The value of personal data is also an important aspect of our study. While companies have resources allowing them to rate this value, we apply in this thesis, a hierarchical multi-criteria method. This method will allow each user to give value to his personal data according to the importance he attaches to it. In this model, we also integrate a regulation authority. It is in charge of conducting negotiations between users and online services, and generate recommendations to users based on their profile and current trends.

740	Prier à la campagne : art et dévotion dans les chapelles de villas romaines de la Contre-Réforme	The taste for countryside palaces among the Princes of the Church was already well established when the Council of Trent (1545-1563) moved to counter the protestant Reformation. This council asserted catholic dogmas and significantly reformed clerical mores. In this context, villas are seen as the perfect stage to realize spiritual ambitions. This thesis thus studies extra-urban devotional practices by examining three chapels in countryside palaces around Rome decorated after the Council of Trent: Cardinal Alessandro Farnese’s (1520-1589) chapel in his villa at Caprarola; the Villa d’Este chapel at Tivoli built for Cardinal Ippolito II d’Este (1509-1572); and the Villa Mondragone chapel at Frascati, ordered by Cardinal Marco Sittico Altemps (1533-1595) for Pope Gregory XIII (1502-1585). We seek to examine the influence of contemporary devotional practices on the iconographic cycles in the private sphere. The public’s perception and spiritual response to the frescoes will be probed through an anthropological approach to images.

741	De episcopis Hispaniarum : agents of continuity in the long fifth century	In Anno Domini 408, Spain, despite its peninsular location at the ends of Europe, was part of a pan-Mediterranean culture which spread from Portugal to Syria. Christianity had been adopted a mere 28 years prior and the Catholic Church was growing across the Roman world. The following year, Spain entered on a course of irreversible transformation as pagan Germanic speaking 'barbarians' crossed the Pyrenees bringing war and strife to the Hispano-Romans and establishing new kingdoms where the Roman state had once governed. In the turmoil of the fifth century, Catholic bishops laboured to assert their dominance over their communities and over the hearts of their flock. In light of advances in archaeology and quality critical editions of the literary sources, the time has come to identify the traits of the Iberian bishops with attention to regional variation. This thesis characterises the bishops of Spain and Portugal and demonstrates the challenges they faced as intermediaries between natives and newcomers, as proselytizers of pagans, persecutors of heretics and retainers of romanitas at the end of the Antique world.

742	Une littérature du décloisonnement : la construction de la figure de l'écrivain et du littéraire dans Comment faire l'amour avec un Nègre sans se fatiguer et Cette grenade dans la main du jeune Nègre est-elle une arme ou un fruit? de Dany Laferrière	Dany Laferrière, recently admitted to the prestigious Académie française, has produced a considerable work in the past thirty years. Two of his first novels, Comment faire l'amour avec un Nègre sans se fatiguer and Cette grenade dans la main du jeune Nègre est-elle une arme ou un fruit? are characterised by a rich and varied intertextuality. The thread of the narrative of these two novels is built by fragments. In the first text, a fictional writer is working on a novel titled Paradis du dragueur nègre. In the second novel, we find the same writer, but he travels through the United States in order to write a report on America. In both cases, we find staged writing by a fictional writer who has many similarities to Laferrière himself. The reader witnesses the construction of the story he is reading through an original « autobiographical novel ». In fact, there are many resemblances, even correspondences, between the two stories. Both Laferrière's novel themes, style and genre, are part of a « genealogy » of texts that can be grouped into literary « families ». We will then try, in the following research, to define and understand the role of theses « families » and illustrate how the appropriation of these texts allows the author to be inspired and to question these texts from the past. We will therefore study the intertextual references of these literary « families » in the first two chapters of our research and then study more specifically the construction of the figure of the writer and his literary space through these two novels.

743	Cohabitation entre les activités résidentielles et prostitutionnelles du quartier Hochelaga-Maisonneuve	This study aims to explore the universe of the cohabitation of street prostitution and residential activities in the district of Hochelaga-Maisonneuve. The research specifically focusses on the impact of such practices on theresidential environment. Rooted in a phenomenological perspective, the study is based on the speech of 35 key players reporting their cohabitation experiences. These actors are merchants, residents of the area, proximity stakeholders as well as sex workers. Through the analysis of interviews and of a hundred hours of field observation in the company of Montreal Police Service officers, the study outlines the cohabitation-related issues, introduces the idea of anegotiated tolerance and portrays the street narcoprostitution specific to Hochelaga-Maisonneuve district. In the light of our observations, we understand that it is difficult to separate prostitution activities and addiction habits. More precisely, street prostitution, the presence of cracks houses, public consumption and intoxication of individuals as well as gatherings of underground lifestyle people are all elements which are very often inter-connected and pointed out by the interviewed actors. The study highlights the impacts of these elements on theresidential neighborhood.	narcoprostitution , crackhouse , cohabitation , Hochelaga-Maisonneuve , prostitution , street prostitution , methodology qualitative , grounded theory , crack house	en	13704.0
744	Between pragmatism and the defence of a “Sister State”  : the national association for the advancement of colored people and the U.S. occupation of Haiti, 1915-1922	Initially, the news of the U.S. occupation of Haiti in 1915 generated little concern in the United States. Indeed, Haiti’s political instability made it such that a U.S. intervention seemed unavoidable. As of 1915 and especially 1920, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), founded in 1909, denounced the U.S. interference in the Caribbean island. W.E.B. Du Bois and James Weldon Johnson, two of the association’s most influential black members, were deeply invested in condemning the U.S. occupation of Haiti. Historiographical tendencies have long located the NAACP’s engagement with Haiti in a conversation about black solidarity, but have failed to adequately consider the local politics that may have inspired the NAACP’s work. While this thesis does not refute the importance of black solidarity, it does recognise the limits of this conceptual approach in trying to explain the complexity of the NAACP’s work on the behalf of Haiti’s sovereignty. Placing more attention on the social and political context in the United States between 1915 and 1922 reveals that the NAACP utilised the occupation of Haiti as a means of attracting broader attention to domestic issues affecting black Americans, but also as a means of reinforcing the organisation’s own profile in the United States.

745	Documenter les pratiques évaluatives de trois enseignants du primaire au Sénégal au regard de la rétroaction écrite en correction de textes d'élèves du CM1	Our research is part of the adoption by Senegal of the competency-based approach with evaluation practices promoting the success of the greatest number of students. These practices include those related to formative assessment through feedback, which can extend the learning activities (Scallon, 2004; OECD, 2005) and allow control experience. With this in mind, we looked the ways of the formative evaluation of three Senegalese primary school teachers. The goal is to document their ways to practice written feedback before and after experiment annotations according to Rodet (2000) and Lebœuf (1999) models.  In this context, our research derives its foundations from qualitative research related to the naturalistic paradigm (Fortin, 2010; Deslauriers and Kérésit, 1997; Savoie-Zajc and Karsenti, 2011). Specifically, we opted for a research-training through the double approach we have taken. First, the study is covered by a qualitative research approach as Fortin (2010) conceives it and that, for purposes of understanding of targeted teachers’ written feedback practices. Secondly, the researcher follows a training process based on the works of Galvani (1999) and Lafortune (2006), with the goal of the practice of annotations’ experimentation.  As collection instruments , we used semi- structured individual interviews through two interview guides , in addition to two collection grids of annotations .   The data analysis revealed that, upstream of the experiment, the written feedback consists essentially of various signs, encrypted notes and comments in the form of global assessments. Downstream, it mainly consists of positive and constructive formulations cognitive content annotations, and injunctive, verdictive and explanatory comments. Finally, teachers find this new way of doing worthwhile in terms of student success but compelling given its time-consuming nature. This research opens, among others, a study on the link between annotations and student success.	competence-based approach , evaluation practices , formative assessment , written feedback	en	13686.0
746	Effet de stress et compagnie, programme web de prévention du stress chronique, sur le stress et la santé psychologique des intervenants	Occupational stress is a major risk factor of trajectories leading to diseases (Taylor, Repetti, & Seeman, 1997) such as psychosomatic disorders, anxiety, depression and burnout. Moreover, health professionals and social workers seem to be more at risk of chronic stress and associated health problems (Felton, 1998). This seems due to the fact that they are at high risk of being stressed more often, emotionally exhausted and feeling devalued (Evans & al., 2006). In the same line of thought, workers of the Montréal-Centre Jeunesse – Institut universitaire (CJM-IU) represent a particularly vulnerable population. The main goal of this study is to test the implementation and effectiveness of the “Stress et Compagnie” program on chronic stress and associated mental health dimensions (anxiety, depression, burnout) in a sample of the population of CJM-IU workers. The hypothesis measured is that exposure to the program will effectively reduce the level of stress hormones, perceived stress levels, anxiety levels, depression and burnout in workers of the CJM-IU. “Stress et Compagnie”, developed by the Centre for Studies on Human Stress from the Institut Universitaire en Santé Mentale de Montréal, is based on recent discoveries in psychoneuroendocrinology. A quasi-experimental design was used with a control and experimental groups. The measures took place one week before the program, one week after and the last one-month later. Results show that the program tend to reduce chronic stress among the health professionals that haven't been exposed to a potential traumatic event in the last year.

747	La victimisation par les pairs et le développement de l’anxiété sociale au début de l’adolescence : l’effet modérateur des caractéristiques des amis	The aim of this study was to explore to what extent the number of friends and friends’ characteristics interact with peers’ victimization to predict the development of social anxiety over time. More specifically, friends’ characteristics considered by this study were peers’ victimization, peers’ rejection and social anxiety average levels as potential aggravating factors. Data was collected two consecutive years, from 576 adolescents of 13,5 years old average. The data was collected first during the fall semester of 8th grade, and a second time during the spring semester of 9th grade. Participants answered self-reported questionnaires concerning peers’ victimization and social anxiety. They also participated in a sociometric nomination procedure within their school and classroom concerning social status and friends’ identification. Results indicated that peers’ victimization and friends’ characteristics (i.e. social anxiety and rejection levels) have an additive contribution when predicting concurrent social anxiety. Results also showed that peers’ victimization predicted subsequent increase in social anxiety 1.5 year later. However, the number of friends and friends’ characteristics did not show any additive effect in predicting development of ulterior social anxiety. Moreover, friends’ characteristics do not interact with victimization to predict ulterior social anxiety. Nonetheless, exploratory analysis showed that friends’ victimization acts as an aggravating factor for participants with a negative social status: peers’ rejection being positively associated to an increase in social anxiety in students with victimized friends.

748	Contribution de modèle demande-contrôle-soutien à la variation des concentrations de cortisol salivaire	The main objective of this master thesis is to increase the knowledge about the impact of organisational factors on salivary cortisol concentrations. Especially, the models demand-control (Karasek, 1979) and demand-control-support (Karasek and Theorell, 1990) will be studied in relationship to the salivary cortisol. The objectives of this study are to investigate the associations between the main components of each model (psychological demands, decision latitude and social support), but also patterns of interaction effects, i.e. the effect moderator of decision latitude and social support. It has been shown that the HPA axis would be linked to symptoms of mental health (Abelson et al., 2007; Havermans et al. 2011; Vreeburg et al. 2009b, 2010, 2013; Staufenbiel, 2013) as well as stressors in the workplace (Chida and Steptoe, 2009). Currently, salivary cortisol, an indicator of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) or the axis of stress management, would be the most promising for measuring the physiological response to a stressful event or chronic stress (Maïna et al. 2009). The data results come from the SALVEO surveys led by the research team on work and mental health of University of Montreal (ERTSM). Results of multilevel analyses do not support the involvement of the demand - control - support model to changes in cortisol concentration. Indeed, they do not suggest that the main effects as much as the interaction effects of the demand-control-support model, explain the variation in cortisol levels. Tobacco consumption is significantly related to salivary cortisol concentration and must be taken into account in previous studies. Therefore, these results suggest that further research is needed to understand how the occupational stressors are incorporated into the individual at the physiological level. Depth knowledge of these associations would help to understand the associations between long-term stress and health effects or how job strain affects long-term mental health (Karhula et al. 2015).

749	The doing and undoing of global literature : myth, microcosm and atopia in triestine writing	The present study brings the fragmented traditions of Triestine literary culture to bear on contemporary preoccupations with world literature at a time when globalization is widely perceived as the predominant historical paradigm that informs modernity.  What I am calling “global literature” refers to the refashioning of Weltliteratur – envisioned by Goethe and translated as “world literature” or “littérature universelle” – by discourses on global culture and post-nationalism.  However, when literary studies take on questions of global literature they are faced with a problem, navigating the universal idea of Goethe’s paradigm between the Scylla of a relativist, occidental internationalism and the Charybdis of a dehumanized, atopian globalism.  Proponents of world literature who lean towards the former position gain an institutional foothold by working with the implicit hypothesis that nations are based in language, which underwrites the relationship between world literature and national literatures.  The universality of this implicit hypothesis is what Triestine writing disproves.   In this study, I argue that Triestine writing in the first decades of the twentieth century acts as a precursor to thinking about global literary culture for the twenty-first century.  It has its own economy of sense, whereby it doesn’t fit into literary nationalisms, but it doesn’t fall into atopian globalism either.  It is not emphatically opposed to national literature; rather it does not admit national traditions to take root.  Triestine writers expressed a desire for a sense of unity and belonging, as well as a critical conscience that undoes that desire.  It resists the idealization of its particularities, and never successfully coalesces into a unified literary tradition.  Consequently, Trieste has often been thought of as a non-place and its literature as antiliterature.   In bypassing the territorial imperatives of the Italian national tradition – as the case of Italo Svevo illustrates – Triestine writing was later caught up in the literary-cultural parameters of Mitteleuropa, where its literary expression was imagined as a microcosm of the former Habsburg Empire’s supranational plurality.  However, the projected macrocosm of Trieste is not a unified image, like a globe; but instead it is a nebula – as Svevo had imagined it – where no universal idealizations could gain a foothold.  This study interrogates the image of the city as a microcosm and as a nowhere and how that relates to the macrocosm of the atopias of globalization, in order to demonstrate that Triestine writing is global literature ante litteram.  The unresolved dialectics of doing and undoing literary language and identity through the act of writing that animates Triestine literary culture plays out in globalization debates and the questions of culture that arise from it.  Triestine writing offers critical perspectives on the status of canonic literatures in a world of disappearing borders and placeless places, where the nebula is a master image for today’s world.	globalization , Trieste , world literature , national language , antiliterature , Svevo, Italo , Slataper, Scipio , imaginary geography , atopia , cosmopolitics , territorialization , littérature universelle	en	13610.0
750	Social capital and natural hazards : trust and cohesion in the eastern visayas of the Philippines	This thesis analyzes social capital and preparations for natural hazards in the Philippines. The research emphasizes the importance of inequalities, contextualization, and scale. It underlines the significance of historical and political contexts to better understand social dynamics. There is a growing body of scholarly literature that shows the detrimental repercussions of inequality on social capital. Social capital is still a debated concept but it can be useful for thinking about how human societies interact with natural hazards. The thesis thus contributes to the growing scientific inquiries which have begun to address the connections between social capital and “natural” disasters. This dissertation contributes to the links between these two fields of knowledge by analyzing the Filipino situation in general, as well as making a specific case study of a rural municipality in the Eastern Visayas region. The thesis’ central argument is that economic inequality is detrimental to social capital which then has negative repercussions on preparing for natural hazards. In an analysis at several geographical scales, this thesis shows how inequality, via social capital, makes societies more at risk of having natural hazards turn into disasters. The thesis argues that a cautious use of the concept of social capital, which is cognizant of the complexities of the context it is applied to, has the potential to improve the way people collectively prevent hazards from turning into disasters.

751	Maestros de Oaxaca. Ethnographie post-exotique des pratiques et espaces politiques locaux au Mexique	This thesis proposes an analysis of the links between teachers, local populations, and the State within the local context of Oaxaca, Mexico. The « maestros », privileged operators of political mediation, members of a union that represents an important opposition to local government, historical carriers of the State via the school system, occupy a specific crucial and ambivalent position within the Mexican political configuration. From the plantón to the schools, from local cultural festivals to municipal issues, today they are situated at the heart of contemporary negotiations and declinations – liberal and decentralized – of political « modernity ». Through an approach that combines anthropology and political science, this research attaches itself to the places and the concrete framework of political relationships that engage these maestros, it explores the articulations and implications between union spaces and villages, Indian movements and education. This contribution sheds an empirical, historical, and critical light on mediation and contentious politics in Mexico. It examines the reconfiguration of the channels that join the State with the population, and is interested in the process of the redefinition of the contours of the nation and citizenship. Transversely, this work analyzes the ongoing dispute that is at play in the different meanings of the nation and of citizenship during the time of neoliberalism and multiculturalism.  Linking theoretical rigor and epistemological concern, the writing of this descriptive and narrative thesis contributes to ethnographic knowledge and gives access to new aspects of the social and political realities being studied. This research also contributes to work on the cultural and political dimensions of the State. Finally, it shows how the nation remains a symbolic and concrete territory of political contest.

752	Activism and participation among people of migrant background : discourses and practices of inclusiveness in four italian cities	As interest in the processes of integration of immigrants and ethnic minorities grows among European scholars, the role of multiple actors in shaping civic and political participation by people of migrant background needs to be further examined. Building on the literature on migration, this study addresses the following research question: What accounts for differences in forms of civic and political participation by activists of migrant background at the local level? In order to answer this question, I have mapped the forms of participation by activists of migrant background in four Italian cities, and examined the discourses and practices of multiple actors involved in the sphere of immigration under an increasingly hostile national environment.  To understand differences in participation, I argue that it is important to go beyond an exclusive consideration of the state and institutional actors, to look at both institutional and non-institutional actors, and to examine how, through their interaction, they shape opportunities and constraints for participation. This work investigate both conventional and non-conventional channels in four Italian cities and considers immigrant activists as relevant political actors, who are able to mobilize and shape participation through their interaction and alliances with the organizations of the receiving society.  This research presents three main findings. The first is that approaches to integration adopted by local actors matter. This study identified three main approaches to integration: 1) assistance, based on the idea that immigrants are in need and thus focuses on the promotion of delivery of services and advocacy; 2) intercultural, founded on the idea that immigrants are would-be citizens and that integration is reciprocal; and 3) political rights promotion, which focuses on the idea that immigrants are entitled to basic political rights, and thus encourages the opening of channels of participation to immigrants who are denied local voting rights. The empirical analysis shows that while the assistance approach does not encourage participation because it conceives immigrants as passive subjects, the other two approaches encourage civic and political participation respectively. Second, this study demonstrates that left-wing actors matter. It shows that the actors who contribute to opening channels for participation are not only moderate and institutional left-wing actors, such as local authorities, main political parties, and trade unions, but also radical and non-institutional left-wing organizations. Left-wing actors interpret and act differently with respect to immigration and participation and this affects how immigrant activists mobilize. Third, this study underlines the role of perception of the opportunities for participation and shows how activists of migrant background appropriate the discourses and practices of left-wing actors. It documents how immigrant activists respond to the opportunities offered by other actors and how they contribute to the opening of channels for participation by creating alliances with the left-wing organizations and by challenging the discourses and practices of local actors.

753	Role of histone methylation in the regulation of COX-2, iNOS, and mPGES-1 gene expression in human chondrocytes: Implication for Osteoarthritis	Osteoarthritis (OA) is a disabling disease classified as the most common form of arthritis worldwide. It is characterized by cartilage degeneration, synovium inflammation, and subchondral bone remodeling resulting in a loss of joint function. These structural and functional changes are due to numerous factors.  Cytokines, prostaglandins (PG), and reactive oxygen species are the major mediators implicated in the pathophysiology of OA. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a major pro-inflammatory cytokine that plays a crucial role in OA. IL-1 induces the expression of Cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2), microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), as well as their products prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and nitric oxide (NO). These are critical mediators of the inflammatory response during OA causing pain, swelling, and joint tissue destruction.  The activation of these pro-inflammatory genes results from different changes at the level of chromatin known as epigenetic modifications. Epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation and histone modifications play a crucial role in gene expression. Among these modifications, histone methylation/demethylation is the most critical one. Histone methylation/demethylation is mediated by two types of enzymes: histone methyltransferases (HMT) and histone demethylases (HDM) which can either activate or repress transcription. It is therefore necessary to understand the molecular mechanisms which underlie the regulation of COX-2, mPGES-1, and iNOS expression.   The objective of this study is to investigate whether histone methylation/demethylation can modulate COX-2, mPGES-1, and iNOS expression in IL-1 induced OA human chondrocytes.   We demonstrated that histone H3 lysine K4 (H3K4) methylation by SET-1A contributes to IL-1-induced COX-2 and iNOS expression in human OA Chondrocytes. We showed also that LSD1-mediated demethylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) contributes to IL-1β-induced mPGES-1 expression in human OA chondrocytes.  We found that levels of SET-1A and LSD1 expression are elevated in OA cartilage as compared with normal cartilage. Our data demonstrates, for the first time, the implication of histone methylation/demethylation in COX-2, mPGES-1, and iNOS regulation suggesting that these mechanisms could be a potential target for pharmacological intervention in the treatment of the pathophysiology of OA.

755	Mécanismes impliqués dans les effets du récepteur à la (pro)rénine sur le développement de l'obésité et de ses complications cardiométaboliques associées	Obesity is a disease associated with multiple complications such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension and cancer. Nowadays, lifestyle modifications, such as eating habits and physical activity, are simply not enough to counter the deleterious effects of obesity. Pharmacotherapy is used as an alternative treatment although beneficial effects are temporary and cannot be maintained in the long run. The current medical need for a treatment with long term beneficial outcomes devoid of side effects is unmet. Best known for its role in blood pressure regulation, the renin-angiotensin system has recently been attributed a role in favouring fat storage. The prorenin and renin receptor is a component of renin-angiotensin system that amplifies its activation. Thus, the prorenin and renin receptor might play a key role in gaining fat mass. The aim of this thesis is to investigate the role of the prorenin and renin receptor in the development of obesity and its complications in mice using a combination of high-fat and high carbohydrate diet and the handle region peptide, a blocker of the prorenin and renin receptor.   After a period of 10 weeks, we have found that the prorenin and renin receptor is increased specifically in subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue of obese mice. When administered simultaneously with a high-fat and high-carbohydrate diet, the handle region peptide reduced body weight gain in mice with similar decrease in visceral fat mass. Decreased expression of the enzyme catalyzing the last step of lipogenesis could be responsible for the reduction in visceral fat mass. In the same animals, the expressions of several adipokines were also decreased in adipose tissue suggesting reduced insulin resistance, inflammation and macrophage infiltration locally in subcutaneous and visceral fat. Increased expression of a marker of adipogenesis in subcutaneous adipose tissue could suggest higher adipocyte number. This would buffer excess circulating free fatty acid since we have noticed a reduction in the latter in mice on a high-fat and high-carbohydrate diet and treated with the peptide. We hypothesized that a futile cycle could be activated in subcutaneous fat because we have observed increased expression of several enzymes implicated in lipogenesis and lipolysis. « Beiging » is defined as the presence of brown-like adipocytes in adipose tissue which is characterized by high mitochondrial density and thermogenesis. Increased expression of markers for « beiging » and mitochondrial biogenesis in subcutaneous fat suggests that « beiging » could also be activated in this fat pad. Insulin sensitivity in these animals could be improved as suggested in the circulation by decreased insulin, similar glucose, increased glucose on insulin ratio as well as a possible change in the correlation between mouse body weight and circulating adiponectin levels.   Our work suggests that the handle region peptide could increase the capacity of subcutaneous adipose tissue to metabolize circulating lipids with a potential activation of a futile cycle and « beiging ». This would prevent ectopic deposition of fat in visceral compartments as suggested by the reduction in visceral fat mass in mice on high-fat and high-carbohydrate diet and treated with the peptide. Using a mice model, this study demonstrates the pharmacological potential of the handle region peptide as a novel treatment to prevent obesity.

759	"A heuristic algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Synchronized Pick-ups and Drop-offs : a case study for medications delivery and
supervision in DR Congo"	In post-emergency contexts such as in Western Democratic Republic of the Congo, also known as DR Congo, one of the crucial challenges that rural hospitals face is maintaining a pharmacy with essential medications and supplies. There is significant negative humanitarian impact when hospitals do not have essential medications for treatable life-threatening diseases; hospitals also incur financial losses when too much medication is ordered and it expires. Moreover, the cost of transporting medications and providing onsite supervision to remote hospitals is an extremely expensive endeavour. In some cases the transportation costs alone can surpass the cost of the medications. Using the province of Bandundu, DR Congo as a case study, we attempt to determine the feasibility (in terms of both problem complexity and potential savings) of a synchronized routing problem for medication delivery and on-site supervision visits. We propose a Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem formulation that handles several novel requirements including activity-wise synchronization, precedence, and two activity frequencies. We implement a novel cluster-first, route-second heuristic with a geospatially-enabled database to solve the problem. We also present a Web-based tool to visualize the solutions in a map. The preliminary results of the research suggest that a synchronized solution could allow rural hospitals to increase the accessibility of medical services to rural populations with only a modest increase in transportation costs.

760	Theory and numerical integration of subsurface light transport	In image synthesis, reproducing the complex appearance of objects with subsurface light scattering, such as wax, marble and skin, greatly contributes to the realism of an image. Unfortunately, this added realism comes at a high computational cost. Models based on diffusion theory aim to reduce this computational cost by simulating the physical behaviour of subsurface light scattering while imposing smoothness constraints on the incident and outgoing light fields. An important component of these models is how they are employed to hierarchically evaluate the numerical integral of lighting over the surface of an object. This thesis will first review the existing literature on realistic subsurface lighting simulation, before investigating in more depth the application and extension of modern diffusion models in image synthesis. In doing so, we propose and evaluate a new hierarchical numerical integration technique that uses a novel frequency analysis of the incident and outgoing light fields to reliably adapt the sampling rate during integration. We realize our resulting theory in the context of several state-of-the-art diffusion models, providing a marked improvement in their efficiency and accuracy.

761	Surveillance non invasive de la réponse neuroimmunitaire fœtale à l’infection	Introduction. In utero, the infection of maternal and fetal membranes, chorioamnionitis, goes frequently unnoticed and, especially when combined with acidemia due to occlusions of the umbilical cord as they occur during labour, can result in brain damage and long term neurological sequelae peri- and postnatally. Currently, there is no way to early detect these pathological conditions to prevent or limit lasting neurological deficits.  Hypotheses. (1) the fetal electroencephalogram (EEG), obtained from the scalp could serve as a useful ancillary tool to the existing fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring for early detection of fetal acidemia and neurological injury; (2) the sampling rate of fetal ECG has a significant impact on the continuous FHR monitoring in the prediction of fetal acidemia; 3) patterns of FHR variability will reflect fetal baseline and inflammatory states; (4) FHR variability analysis should permit prediction of pH and base excess (BE) at birth. Methods. In a series of studies using the chronically instrumented unanesthetized fetal sheep and clinical cohort, we modeled 1) worsening fetal acidemia with intermittent hypoxia resulting from umbilical cord occlusions (UCO) of increasing severity as experimental model of human labour to test the 1st and 2nd hypotheses; 2) moderate fetal inflammation by administering lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to test the 3rd hypothesis and 3) prediction of pH and BE status at birth using clinically validated FHR variability measures in a clinical cohort of laboring women to test the 4th hypothesis.  Results. Repetitive UCO resulted in marked acidosis (pH arterial 7.35±0.01 to 7.00±0.01), decreased EEG amplitudes synchronized with UCO-induced FHR decelerations and pathological arterial blood pressure decreases; in addition, we detected a significant increase in FHR variability with worsening acidemia when sampled at 1000 but not at 4 Hz, the sampling rate used clinically. LPS administration resulted in systemic fetal inflammation with IL-6 peaking at 3 h and FHR variability changes tracking this temporal cytokine profile precisely. In the clinical cohort, a statistical model based on a matrix of 103 FHR variability measures predicted pH (R2 = 0.90, P < 0.001), but not BE, from one hour of FHR recording prior to pushing stage. Conclusions. The decrease in the EEG amplitude suggests an adaptive and neuroprotective brain shut-down; fetal EEG may complement the FHR monitoring during labour to improve early detection of incipient acidemia. FHR variability changes can detect early developing hypoxic-acidemia when sampled at 1000 Hz, but not when sampled at 4 Hz suggesting that a more sensitive mode of fetal ECG acquisition will improve early acidemia detection. Distinctive subsets of FHR variability measures permit online monitoring of fetal inflammation from ECG opening a new approach to characterizing the fetal inflammatory profile. Clinical bedside prediction of pH and BE monitoring at birth using FHR variability monitoring will allow more accurate decision making in obstetrics during labour	Foetus , EEG , monitoring , asphyxie , inflammation , LPS , Fetus , FHR , HRV , acidosis , asphyxia , hypoxia , sampling rate , clinical study , labour	en	13441.0
762	Saint-Maron : une paroisse diasporique : église et fidèles maronites à Montréal (1969-2015)	Maronite immigration to Montreal started at the end of the 19th century. During the 1970s and 1990s, massive waves of Lebanese immigrants arrived to Montreal due to the wars in Lebanon. The Maronite Church is fully Roman Catholic but has a syriac-antiochean rite. Maronite immigrants did not have their own parish in Montreal and had to go for célébrations in the Oriental Catholic Church which was created by Montreal clerical authorities and served by Greek-Catholics (Melkites) of the Saint-Sauveur order. In 1969, Father Élias Najjar from the Maronite mariamite order, together with Maronites from Egypt, founded the first Maronite parish in Montreal. This thesis aims to study the process behind the constitution of the first parish, its evolution and the life of its parishioners by using a narrative and descriptive approach in the frame of the social and religious history. Results show a national Church and a new model of Maronite diasporic parish, different from the classical one, having subnational, international and inter-confessional diversities.

763	Divination en Gaule du IVe au VIe siècle : études de cas	This Masters’ thesis concerns itself with the continuity of pagan divination rituals within the new context of the Christianized Gaul of the IVth to VIth centuries. It is composed of an introduction detailing our hypothesis, terminology, methodology and sources. Afterwards, we study three cases of divination rituals, the Sortes Sanctorum, the Sortes Sangallenses and the incubations within the cult of St. Martin of Tours. We detail their origins, sources, proceedings, evolution and the similarities linking them to previously existing pagan rites. In conclusion, we synthesize all elements and we were able to draw from our cases to establish the continuity of these rituals by several means, the Gallic acculturation of Greco-Roman rituals, importation of Christianized rituals from the East of the Empire and assimilation of local pagan practices within the Christian religion to answer the popular demand for divination.

764	Discours des plaignantes/victimes : distinction et caractérisation entre les fausses et les vraies allégations de crimes violents	In this exploratory research, the speech of plantiff/victims of violent crimes was obtained through the cognitive interview method developed by Fisher and Geiselman (1992) and were analysed to determine qualitatively and quantitatively whether they are truthful (founded) or deceitful (unfounded). Fifteen interviews were conducted by polygraphists at Sûreté du Québec and were analysed using tools developed by Morgan (2007). Those that were identified in a field study were studied here to see if they could be applied in real life situations to caracterise effectively the allegations. Then, unique words, length of the speech of plaintiff and the TTR ratio were calculated for the three main parts of the cognitive interview (Free recall, the eyes closed and backward recall). The results found that reality seem to corroborate what was determined in Morgan’s writings. Thus, truthful plaintiff/victims seems to use more unique words and have longer speech than deceitful ones. Furthermore, their TTR ratios were lower than the false ones. The results obtained here, therefore match what Morgan (2007) stated in his studies and will probably help determine the type of allegations those presumed victimes are recounting to the interviewer. Parallel to this, some qualitative indicators were identified from the speeches to help classify those allegations such as stereotyped descriptions of the suspect, the presence of superfluous details pre-crime and post-crime, the presence of threats and lies, types of injury to the victim, involuntary omissions and the way in which the weapon was used by the aggressor, if that’s the case. Also, non-verbal communication has been briefly analysed and has highlighted some specific clues associated with false allegations. In short, the preliminary results obtained by this research make it possible to differentiate the type of allegations (claims-based versus unsubstantiated allegations) alleged by the plaintiff/victims. In conclusion, more profound studies must be done before even thinking about using those results concomitantly with the rest of the evidence in real life police investigations. If it’s possible, it might help the police work and thereby enable a more effective administration of justice.

765	Multisite Research Ethics Review: Problems and Potential Solutions	Large scale, multisite clinical research trials have been increasing in frequency. As it stands currently, a research project performed at multiple institutions requires ethics review at each institution. While local (institutional) review may be necessary in some instances, repetitive reviews may require unnecessary changes and not serve to further protect participants. Multiple ethics reviews of a single study have been shown to delay research and require, in some cases, significant resources in order to fulfill the requests of individual ethics boards. This literature review discusses the conceptual issues and outlines empirical research surrounding multisite ethics review from different jurisdictions, as well as alternative methods to streamline the ethics review process including reciprocal review, centralized review, and a proposed modification to the centralized review process.	multisite research , human subject research , research ethics board , institutional review board , reciprocal review , centralized review , multisite ethics review	en	13387.0
766	Ranking by rating	Each item in a given collection is characterized by a set of possible performances. A (ranking) method is a function that assigns an ordering of the items to every performance profile. Ranking by Rating consists in evaluating each item’s performance by using an exogenous rating function, and ranking items according to their performance ratings. Any such method is separable: the ordering of two items does not depend on the performances of the remaining items. We prove that every separable method must be of the ranking-by-rating type if (i) the set of possible performances is the same for all items and the method is anonymous, or (ii) the set of performances of each item is ordered and the method is monotonic. When performances are m-dimensional vectors, a separable, continuous, anonymous, monotonic, and invariant method must rank items according to a weighted geometric mean of their performances along the m dimensions.

767	La modernisation navale chinoise : défense active, ambitions nouvelles et réalisme stratégique	For quite a few years, some analyses have claimed that Beijing has committed China to a naval modernization program. Equipment acquisition, budget increase and especially the deployment of the so-called “String of Pearls” (naval bases from the East and South China Seas to the Persian Gulf) are considered proof of new Chinese ambitions. In our view, this naval modernization does not represent an imminent threat, but rather a tool of the defensive realism strategy practiced by Beijing with the national goal of avoiding naval marginalisation, thereby permitting the United States and other regional competitors to pressure Chinese development.

768	Agendas in legislative decision-making	Despite the wide range of agendas used in legislative decision-making, the literature has focused almost exclusively on two stylized formats, the so-called Euro-Latin and Anglo-American agendas. As emphasized by Ordeshook and Schwartz [1987], this focus leaves a sizable gap in our understanding of the legislative process. To help address the deficiency, I first define a very broad class of agendas (called simple agendas) whose features are common among agendas used in legislative settings. I then characterize the sophisticated (Farquharson [1969]) voting outcomes implemented by agendas in this class. By establishing a clear connection between the structure of simple agendas and the outcomes associated with them, the characterization extends our understanding of legislative decision-making well beyond the very limited scope of Euro-Latin and Anglo-American agendas.

769	Comparaison de la perception de la douleur entre le traitement orthodontique avec Invisalign® et le traitement avec fils et boîtiers fixes	"Introduction : The discomfort caused by the orthodontic appliances can significantly affect patients cooperation during their treatment. Pain and function deterioration (chewing, speech) are recognized as major determinants of patients cooperation treated with removable appliances. Invisalign® is positioned as an aesthetic alternative to the many discomforts observed during treatment with fixed brackets. To date, few studies have compared the pain (quantitatively and qualitatively) between this technique and fixed appliances over a long period.  Objective : The objective of this study is to assess the pain experienced in the first six months with Invisalign® treatment and compare it to the pain felt during conventional orthodontic treatment with fixed self-ligating brackets.  Methods : The study was comprised of 70 patients (29 males,  41 females), with an age mean of 15.7 (range 11 to 30). The three subgroups are Invisalign® (n = 31), Damon (n = 19) and Speed (n = 20). The two bracket groups, Damon (passive) and Speed (active), were treated in the Orthodontic Clinic at the University of Montreal in 2011, and were compared (active vs. passive self-ligating brackets) for the perception of pain during orthodontic treatment. The study was conducted in four phases corresponding to the insertion of the first 4 wires for groups with brackets (Phase 1: 0.016 "" Supercable, Phase 2: 0.016"" CuNiTi, Phase 3: 0.016"" x 0.022"" CuNiTi, and Phase 4: 0.019"" x 0.025"" CuNiTi) and the insertion of aligners 1, 4, 7 and 10 for the Invisalign group. Using a questionnaire, the study evaluates the pain magnitude for each phase (using a visual analogue scale VAS), the duration, and location of the pain in 6 different time points (T1: immediately after insertion, T2: 5h later, T3: 24h later, T4: 3 days later, T5: 1 week later, T6: 2 weeks later). Results: At T1Ph3 the percentage of patients reporting pain was higher with Damon than with Invisalign® (p = 0.032) (Damon = 55.6%, Invisalign® = 23.3%), but there was no difference with Speed (p = 0.114). Patients with Invisalign® reported significantly less irritation of the soft tissues (mucous membranes, gums) than patients with brackets. For the VAS results, the differences were statistically significant at 2 stages: T3Ph1 (median Invisalign® = 33.31, Median Speed = 49.47, p = 0.025) and T3Ph4 (median Invisalign® = 13.15, median Damon = 27.28, p = 0.014). For most patients, the pain does not require medication and there was no significant difference between the groups in this respect. Quality of life was slightly affected during the first phase and less for the Invisalign® group than for the bracket groups. For Invisalign® patients, pain reached its highest level between 5 and 24 hours after insertion of the first aligner, and decreased in intensity and duration at each phase. Conclusion: The pain perception during orthodontic treatment with Invisalign® is lower than the pain experienced during treatment with fixed brackets. This method of treatment is therefore an attractive therapy for patients wishing for an aesthetic and reasonably comfortable treatment."	Invisalign® , Pain , Brackets , Orthodontics	en	13104.0
770	Validité, fiabilité et reproductibilité des modèles digitaux obtenus avec iTero (Align Technology) et Unitek TMP Digital (3M) en comparaison avec les modèles de plâtre	Objective: The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the validity, reliability and reproducibility of dental measurements obtained on digital models produced by iTero (Align Technology, San Jose, California) and by Unitek TMP Digital (3M, Monrovia, California) in comparison with those obtained on plaster models (gold standard). The secondary objective was to compare two different impression materials (alginate and polyvinylsiloxane-PVS) to determine whether the material used affects accuracy of the measurements. Methods: The first part of the study involved Unitek and iTero digital models, which were all obtained from 25 pairs of plaster models randomly selected from one of the co-author's private practice. Alginate and PVS impressions were taken on plaster models and were scanned by the Unitek scanner. The same models were then scanned with the iTero scanner. The second part of the study sought to compare iTero digital models (intraoral scans) with plaster models (alginate and PVS impressions) taken on 25 patients requiring treatment from the Orthodontic clinic of the University of Montreal. In both parts of the study, two authors took the following measurements on the different models: mesio-distal width of each tooth from first molar to the other first molar, intermolar and intercanine distances, overbite and overjet. Bolton 6 and 12 ratios and excesses, maxillary and mandibular space available and required were also calculated in order to determine space differentials. Results: A good to excellent reliability (ICC) was found for all measurements when comparing digital (Unitek and iTero) and plaster models [ICC=0.762–0.998], and excellent reliability when comparing both impression materials [ICC=0.947–0.996]. In the two parts of the study, measurements on iTero models were generally larger than on plaster models. Highest mean differences for iTero-plaster were found for maxillary space available and mandibular space available (systematically larger for that variable): 2.24 mm and 2.02 mm respectively in the first part of the study, 1.17 mm and 1.39 mm respectively in the second part. Differences were considered clinically insignificant for all variables. Intraexaminer reproducibility was good to excellent for plaster and digital models, except for mandibular space differential on Unitek models [ICC=0.690-0.692]. Interexaminer reproducibility was good to excellent for plaster and digital models in both parts of study, but fair to moderate for Unitek models regarding Bolton 6 and 12, and maxillary and mandibular space differentials [ICC=0.362-0.548].  Conclusions: The accuracy and reliability of dental measurements done on Unitek and iTero digital models were clinically acceptable and reproducible when compared with measurements done on traditional plaster models. The choice of impression material between alginate and PVS did not affect accuracy of the measurements. This study tends to indicate that Unitek and iTero digital models examined with their associated software can be reliably used for orthodontic cast analysis and diagnosis.

771	Differences in Standing and Sitting Postures of Youth with Idiopathic Scoliosis from Quantitative Analysis of Digital Photographs	The objective of this study was to explore whether differences in standing and sitting postures of youth with idiopathic scoliosis could be detected from quantitative analysis of digital photographs. Standing and sitting postures of 50 participants aged 10–20-years-old with idiopathic scoliosis (Cobb angle: 15° to 60°) were assessed from digital photographs using a posture evaluation software program. Based on the XY coordinates of markers, 13 angular and linear posture indices were calculated in both positions. Paired t-tests were used to compare values of standing and sitting posture indices. Significant differences between standing and sitting positions (p < 0.05) were found for head protraction, shoulder elevation, scapula asymmetry, trunk list, scoliosis angle, waist angles, and frontal and sagittal plane pelvic tilt. Quantitative analysis of digital photographs is a clinically feasible method to measure standing and sitting postures among youth with scoliosis and to assist in decisions on therapeutic interventions.

772	Noninvasive Clinical Assessment of Trunk Deformities Associated With Scoliosis	Besides the spinal deformity, scoliosis modifies notably the general appearance of the trunk resulting in trunk rotation, imbalance, and asymmetries that constitutes patients' major concern. Existing classifications of scoliosis, based on the type of spinal curve as depicted on radiographs, are currently used to guide treatment strategies. Unfortunately, even though a perfect correction of the spinal curve is achieved, some trunk deformities remain, making patients dissatisfied with the treatment received. The purpose of this study is to identify possible shape patterns of trunk surface deformity associated with scoliosis. First, trunk surface is represented by a multivariate functional trunk shape descriptor based on 3-D clinical measurements computed on cross sections of the trunk. Then, the classical formulation of hierarchical clustering is adapted to the case of multivariate functional data and applied to a set of 236 trunk surface 3-D reconstructions. The highest internal validity is obtained when considering 11 clusters that explain up to 65% of the variance in our dataset. Our clustering result shows a concordance with the radiographic classification of spinal curves in 68% of the cases. As opposed to radiographic evaluation, the trunk descriptor is 3-D and its functional nature offers a compact and elegant description of not only the type, but also the severity and extent of the trunk surface deformity along the trunk length. In future work, new management strategies based on the resulting trunk shape patterns could be thought of in order to improve the esthetic outcome after treatment, and thus patients satisfaction.

773	Analysis of scoliosis trunk deformities using ICA	This paper describes a method for analyzing scoliosis trunk deformities using Independent Component Analysis (ICA). Our hypothesis is that ICA can capture the scoliosis deformities visible on the trunk. Unlike Principal Component Analysis (PCA), ICA gives local shape variation and assumes that the data distribution is not normal. 3D torso images of 56 subjects including 28 patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis and 28 healthy subjects are analyzed using ICA. First, we remark that the independent components capture the local scoliosis deformities as the shoulder variation, the scapula asymmetry and the waist deformation. Second, we note that the different scoliosis curve types are characterized by different combinations of specific independent components.

774	Caractérisation des transcrits antisens chez les rétrovirus HTLV et étude comparative des fonctions des protéines traduites à partir de ces transcrits antisens	The first human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV) family member was discovered in 1980 and it is estimated that approximately 10 million people are infected with HTLV-1 worldwide. After about 40 years, 5% of infected individuals will develop an adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) while another 4% will develop HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). It is believed that two viral proteins, Tax and HBZ, together orchestrate the oncogenic process. The viral proteins are expressed from an alternatively spliced sense transcript except for the HBZ gene. HBZ is translated from an antisense transcript initiated in the long terminal repeat (LTR)’3. This viral protein is capable of inhibiting Tax transactivation of the LTR5’ by dimerizing with cellular transcription factors such as CREB-2 and c-Jun. HBZ also has proliferating capacities and while the molecular mechanisms leading to the disease still need to be elucidated, it is well known that HBZ can modulate a multitude of signal transduction pathways like AP-1. We have recently discovered an antisense transcript termed Antisense Protein of HTLV-2 (APH-2) produced in HTLV-2. HTLV-2 is only associated to myelopathies resembling HAM/TSP. HTLV-3 and HTLV-4 were discovered in 2005 and have not been associated with any type of disease thus far. The first goal of this PhD project was hence to detect and characterize the antisense transcripts produced in HTLV-3 and HTLV-4, to study the functions of these translated proteins and to evaluate their similarities and/or differences shared with HBZ and APH-2. Our localization studies using confocal microscopy demonstrated that APH-3 and APH-4 are found in the nucleus as speckles, and for APH-3, also partially cytoplasmic. These two proteins can also partially colocalize with HBZ. Using a luciferase reporter plasmid bearing the HTLV-1 LTR5’, we demonstrated that APH-3 and APH-4 could inhibit Tax transactivation of the LTR5’. We also used a luciferase reporter plasmid bearing the collagenase promoter, which bears an AP-1 site, and demonstrated that both viral proteins could activate transcription in the presence of any of the Jun family of transcription factors.  We generated several mutants and the atypical leucine zipper (LZ) found in APH-3 and APH-4 is crucial for this regulation. In fact, APH-3 and APH-4 using their atypical LZ dimerize with Jun family members and activate this pathway using a mechanism other than an autonomous activation domain. Our next goal was to investigate the significance of the HBZ nucleolar localization. During this project, we identified two new interacting partners, B23 and nucleolin, which seem to be associated with its nucleolar localization. In fact, these interactions are stronger when HBZ is deleted of its AD and bZIP domains and hence when HBZ demonstrates a stronger nucleolar distribution. Moreover, while APH-3 and APH-4 are also found in the nucleolus, HBZ is the only antisense protein able to interact with B23. Finally, this work clearly demonstrates that HTLV-3 and HTLV-4 can produce an antisense transcript alike other retroviruses. The encoded proteins play an important role in retroviral replication and seem to regulate Jun-dependant transcription differently than HBZ. HBZ also seems to have a unique role in the nucleoli by targeting specific cellular nucleolar proteins. Similarities but also differences are shared between the antisense proteins. Thus, the APH proteins represent a good comparative tool in order to better understand the molecular mechanisms involved in HTLV induced diseases.

775	Role of Nuclear Angiotensin-II Receptor Mediated Signalling in Cardiovascular Remodelling	Cardiac remodelling is the process by which cardiac structure and/or function change in response to pathophysiological imbalances such as hypertension, cardiac disease, prolonged arrhythmia or altered hormonal balance. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is an extensively studied hormonal system involved in numerous processes associated with cardiovascular remodelling. Classically viewed as a circulating and a local tissue system, emerging evidence suggests an independent and functionally active RAS within individual cells. Understanding intracellular RAS actions might lead to new therapeutic avenues that could prevent adverse cardiac remodelling. The purpose of this thesis was to elucidate the role of intracellular RAS in cardiac cells. Recently, G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), G proteins, and their downstream effectors have been detected on intracellular membranes, including the nuclear membrane, and the concept of functional intracellular GPCRs is slowly being accepted as a reality. We therefore hypothesized that nuclear-delimited angiotensin II (Ang-II) signalling is involved in controlling cardiac gene expression. We demonstrated the presence of nuclear angiotensin-type 1 (AT1R) and angiotensin-type 2 (AT2R) receptors in adult ventricular cardiomyocytes and in a purified nuclear preparation from cardiac tissue. Ang-II was detected in cardiomyocyte lysate and microinjected Ang-II-FITC preferentially bound to nuclear sites. Transcriptional analysis demonstrated that Ang-II enhanced de novo RNA synthesis in isolated nuclei and NF-κB mRNA expression was much greater when nuclei were exposed to Ang-II. Nuclear AT1R-stimulation produced Ca2+ mobilization via nuclear inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) Ca2+-channels, and IP3R-blockade attenuated the AT1R-mediated transcriptional responses in isolated nuclei.  Current methods available to study intracrine RAS signalling are limited to indirect methodologies because of a lack of selective intracellularly-acting probes. An aim of this thesis was to synthesize and characterize cell-permeant Ang-II analogues to probe intracellular RAS action with spatial and temporal precision. Using solid-phase peptide technology we synthesized and pharmacologically characterized light-sensitive caged Ang-II analogues. This was achieved by incorporating a photocleavable 4,5-dimethoxy-2-nitrobenzyl (DMNB) moiety on sites of Ang-II responsible for receptor recognition and activation. All of the three synthesized and purified caged-Ang-II analogues: [Tyr(DMNB)4]Ang-II, Ang-II-ODMNB and [Tyr(DMNB)4]Ang-II-ODMNB, showed two-to-three orders of magnitude reduced binding affinity towards the AT1R and AT2R in competition binding assays and reduced potency in contraction assays using thoracic aorta. Photolysis of [Tyr(DMNB)4]Ang-II in HEK cells increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation (via AT1R) and cGMP production (via AT2R) whereas in isolated cardiomyocytes it induced an increase in nucleoplasmic Ca2+ and increased the abundance of 18S rRNA and NF-κB mRNA. Fibroblasts are the main drivers of cardiac structural remodelling. Atrial fibroblasts are more responsive to pro-fibrotic stimuli than ventricular fibroblasts. We hypothesized that intracellular Ang-II and associated nuclear AT1R and AT2R activation control fibroblast gene-expression patterns via discrete signalling systems and thereby play a key role in cardiac fibrosis. Atrial fibroblasts were found to express Ang-II, and nuclear AT1R and AT2R. The nuclear localisation of AT1R was increased in fibroblasts isolated from failing hearts whereas nuclear AT2R showed alterations in glycosylation. Heterotrimeric G protein subunits including Gαq/11, Gαi/3, and Gβ were observed in isolated fibroblast nuclei. AT1R and AT2R increased fibroblast transcription initiation via IP3R and NO signal transduction pathways, respectively. Photolysis of [Tyr(DMNB)4]Ang-II in cultured atrial fibroblasts induced an increase in nucleoplasmic Ca2+, proliferation, collagen synthesis and secretion that was not prevented by extracellular AT1R and/or AT2R blockers.

776	Parental projections of developmental outcome, quality of life and coping in children who require neonatal intensive care	In the neonatal intensive care unit, professionals and parents prognosticate about developmental and quality of life (QOL) outcomes. The purpose of this thesis is to understand how parents predict future QOL for their babies during the neonatal period.   In a qualitative study using grounded theory, ten interviews with parents were conducted. The main findings indicate that developmental prognosis influences parental predictions of QOL but it is not sufficient in defining it, since QOL is a multidimensional construct. Parents use a variety of coping mechanisms in dealing with the adversity arising from the illness and hospitalization. Parents who believed that they and their child would be able to adapt to an eventual poor developmental outcome predicted a re-framed QOL.   Neurodevelopmental prognosis and future QOL are not easily estimated and health professionals should be acutely aware of this. Helping parents identify coping mechanisms might lead to more positive prognosis of future QOL.

777	L’assurance médicaments et son impact sur l’adhésion des patients à leurs médicaments	Drug insurance is one of many factors that can influence medication adherence. The objectives of this thesis were to evaluate the impact of the type of drug insurance (private versus public) on adherence to antihypertensive medications and the cost of medications, and to evaluate the impact of drug reimbursement procedures and out-of pocket expenses on adherence to medications prescribed for chronic diseases. To meet these objectives, two retrospective cohorts were constructed from the RAMQ and reMed databases: a matched cohort of antihypertensive users covered by private or public drug insurance and a cohort of patients covered by private drug insurance who filled at least one prescription for a medication prescribed for a chronic disease. The results have shown that the level of adherence to antihypertensive medications was similar between the two types of drug insurance and that the cost of antihypertensive medications was 28,9% higher for those privately insured. It was also observed that drug reimbursement procedures didn’t affect medication adherence, while the level of out-of-pocket expenses affected it. Patients with the highest out-of-pocket expenses were less adherent (difference: –19.0%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: –24.0 to –13.0), while patients with no out-of-pocket expenses were less adherent (difference: -9.0%; 95% CI: –15.0 to –2.0) than those with low out-of-pocket expenses. The results presented in this thesis have shown that drug insurance affects medication adherence through the characteristics of drug insurance plans.

778	Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) in acute coronary syndrome	Lipoprotein associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) is a biomarker of several inflammatory diseases and syndromes. An elevated Lp-PLA2 level is associated with unstable atherosclerotic plaques. Bound to plasma lipoproteins (LDL and HDL), Lp-PLA2 prevents the formation of biologically active oxidized phospholipids on their surface such as oxidized phosphatidylcholine (oxPC). Nevertheless, the products of Lp-PLA2 action, lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) and non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) are both known to aggravate inflammation. Thus, understanding the metabolism of Lp-PLA2 could help us better understand its role in plaque formation, as studies have shown high expression of Lp-PLA2 and LPCs in unstable plaques. Moreover, studies showed correlation between increased Lp-PLA2 mass and activity and increased risk of coronary artery disease, stroke, and death. The inhibition of Lp-PLA2 with a small molecule, Darapladib, has not demonstrated benefit in reduction of cardiovascular events in two clinical studies. Here, the first chapter will focus on Lp-PLA2 and cardiovascular disease in man, highlighting the latest updates in the literature. The second and third chapters will introduce experimental work on Lp-PLA2 in the setting of acute coronary syndrome.

Indeed it seems that Dibutades, as a founding figure of many artistic practices, can clarify how some bloggers assert their authorship online, playing a significant and leading role in the emergence and in the recognition of a digital literature (a literature designed and published online). The following analyzis intend to emphasize the aesthetic potential of some online writing practices often ignored by literary studies, such as Facebook profiles and erotic or pornographic blogs.

781	Rôle des cellules dendritiques dans la modulation de la réponse immunitaire de l'hôte contre Streptococcus suis	Streptococcus suis is an important swine pathogen and an emerging zoonotic agent of septicemia and meningitis. Knowledge of host immune responses towards S. suis, and strategies used by this pathogen for subversion of these responses is scarce. Increased severity of S. suis infections in humans underscores the critical need to better understand the interactions between S. suis and the immune system to generate an effective immune response against this pathogen. Dendritic cells (DCs) are powerful antigen-presenting cells. Once activated, they stimulate T cells and B cells, linking innate and adaptive immunity. Thus, the main objective of this project was to evaluate the role of different S. suis virulence factors on the modulation of DC functions and the T cell-dependent response. Initially, we investigated the effect of S. suis key virulence factors, including the capsular polysaccharide (CPS), the cell wall modifications (D-alanylation of the lipoteichoic acid and N-deacetylation of the peptidoglycan) and the toxin suilysin, on the activation and maturation of mouse bone-marrow derived DCs (bmDCs). We observed that following S. suis infection, bmDCs are activated and go through a complex maturation process characterized by the up-regulation of the surface expression of costimulatory molecules and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The CPS is the main virulence factor interfering with cytokine production, even if cell wall modifications and suilysin can also modulate the production of cytokines. Finally, CPS, cell wall modifications and suilysin were shown to interfere with complement deposition on S. suis, and consequently with complement-dependent killing. Results were confirmed using porcine bmDCs. We also aimed to identify the cellular receptors involved in S. suis recognition by DCs. Production of cytokines and expression of co-stimulatory molecules by DCs were shown to strongly rely on MyD88-dependent signaling pathways, suggesting that DCs recognize S. suis and become activated mostly through Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling. Supporting this fact, TLR2-/- or double negative TLR2-/- and TLR9-/- DCs were severely impaired in the release of several cytokines and the surface expression of certain costimulatory molecules. In addition, NOD2 receptor also seems to play a partial role in DC activation by S. suis. Finally, we evaluated the consequences of the modulation of DC functions on T cell activation. In response to S. suis infection, total splenocytes readily produced several cytokines ex vivo. Ex vivo and in vivo analysis revealed the involvement of CD4+ T cells and development of a T helper 1 (TH1) response. Nevertheless, levels of TH1-derived cytokines during S. suis infection were very low. The bacterial CPS was shown to interfere with the release of several T cell-derived cytokines in vitro. As a consequence, a clinical infection resulted in low levels of not only anti-S. suis antibodies but also of those directed against ovalbumin, used as reported antigen. This interference was correlated with the presence of severe clinical signs of S. suis disease. These data suggest that S. suis impairs the development of an efficient adaptive immune response, which is required to control the infection progress. Overall, these results will permit a better comprehension of the host immune response during S. suis infection.

782	Addition of exogenous polypeptides on the mammalian reovirus outer capsid using reverse genetics	Addition of exogenous peptide sequences on viral capsids is a powerful approach to study the process of viral infection or to retarget viruses toward defined cell types. Until recently, it was not possible to manipulate the genome of mammalian reovirus and this was an obstacle to the addition of exogenous sequence tags onto the capsid of a replicating virus. This obstacle has now been overcome by the advent of the plasmid-based reverse genetics system. In the present study, reverse genetics was used to introduce different exogenous peptides, up to 40 amino acids long, at the carboxyl-terminal end of the σ1 outer capsid protein. The tagged viruses obtained were infectious, produce plaques of similar size, and could be easily propagated at hight titers. However, attempts to introduce a 750 nucleotides-long sequence failed, even when it was added after the stop codon, suggesting a possible size limitation at the nucleic acid level.

783	"Amino acids substitutions in σ1 and μ1 outer capsid proteins of a Vero cell-adapted
mammalian orthoreovirus are required for optimal virus binding and disassembly"	In a recent study, the serotype 3 Dearing strain of mammalian orthoreovirus was adapted to Vero cells; cells that exhibit a limited ability to support the early steps of reovirus uncoating and are unable to produce interferon as an antiviral response upon infection. The Vero cell-adapted virus (VeroAV) exhibits amino acids substitutions in both the σ1 and μ1 outer capsid proteins but no changes in the σ3 protein. Accordingly, the virus was shown not to behave as a classical uncoating mutant. In the present study, an increased ability of the virus to bind at the Vero cell surface was observed and is likely associated with an increased ability to bind onto cell-surface sialic acid residues. In addition, the kinetics of μ1 disassembly from the virions appears to be altered. The plasmid-based reverse genetics approach confirmed the importance of σ1 amino acids substitutions in VeroAV's ability to efficiently infect Vero cells, although μ1 co-adaptation appears necessary to optimize viral infection. This approach of combining in vitro selection of reoviruses with reverse genetics to identify pertinent amino acids substitutions appears promising in the context of eventual reovirus modification to increase its potential as an oncolytic virus.

784	Une approche fréquentielle pratique pour l'échantillonnage adaptatif en espace image	In realistic image synthesis, a pixel's final intensity is computed by estimating a multi-dimensional shading integral. A large part of the research in this domain is thus aimed at finding new techniques to reduce the computational cost of rendering while preserving the fidelity and correctness of the resulting images. When trying to reduce rendering costs to approach real-time computation, complex realistic effects are often left aside or replaced by clever but mathematically incorrect tricks.  To accelerate rendering, previous directions of work have either addressed the computation of individual pixels by improving the underlying numerical integration routines; or have sought to amortize the computation across regions of an image using adaptive methods based on predictive models of light transport.   This thesis' - and resulting paper's - objective is to build upon the latter of the aforementioned classes of methods[Durand2005], and foray into fast adaptive rendering techniques using frequency-based light transport analysis to efficiently guide and prioritize ray tracing. We thus propose an adaptive sampling and reconstruction approach to render animated scenes lit by environment lighting and faithfully reconstruct all-frequency shading effects such as shadows and reflections while preserving temporal coherency.

785	Les processus de la mise en scène : polyphonie et complexité dans la création scénique	A complex human reality, based on dialogues as well as power relations which are permanently being redefined, is at the heart of the process of performance creation. So as to theorize such processes, several studies have been building a corpus compiling the documents which are produced during meetings or rehearsals. However, such a transfer has proven questionable : as it is made of incomplete traces, such material is necessarily too incomplete to bespeak of the organic and polyphonic life of a performance in gestation. A first solution is to elect a decidedly intermedial approach of a performance’s archives : since various artistic disciplines interact in the process of a performance’s production, one may analyze it by actively comparing and contrasting the different media which are generated during its elaboration. As a complement to the first proposal, a second approach will lead the researcher to get involved into an in vivo observation of meetings and rehearsals so as to have at his disposal a more comprehensive research material. This epistemological clarification paves the way for an attempt to theorize the processes of stage creation. First, it appears that the stage or work space is as much of a physical receptacle for the artists’ research as it is a catalyst : it is in the course of getting to own this space collectively that a group of collaborators gives substance to the production. The creative space thus reveals a polyphonic dimension which is also true regarding time : since it involves an ensemble of artists, a creative process has no uniform chronological linearity ; it comprises a whole array of relations to time which are specific to each of the participants, and one has to bring these temporalities together to give birth to a performance that belongs to all. There is therefore a fundamentally social dimension to any staging process. As it is gathered in a given space and time, the small society which is formed around the stage director has to follow a creative process based on dialogue, where the suggestions of the different individuals coalesce to produce a prolific discourse whose strength and unity are guaranteed by the presence of the director.	dialogisme , process , genetics , performance , rehearsals , genesis , polyphony , dialogism	en	12820.0
786	A single amino acid substitution in the mRNA capping enzyme λ2 of a mammalian orthoreovirus mutant increases interferon sensitivity	In the last few years, the development of a plasmid-based reverse genetics system for mammalian reovirus has allowed the production and characterization of mutant viruses. This could be especially significant in the optimization of reovirus strains for virotherapeutic applications, either as gene vectors or oncolytic viruses. The genome of a mutant virus exhibiting increased sensitivity to interferon was completely sequenced and compared with its parental virus. Viruses corresponding to either the parental or mutant viruses were then rescued by reverse genetics and shown to exhibit the expected phenotypes. Systematic rescue of different viruses harboring either of the four parental genes in a mutant virus backbone, or reciprocally, indicated that a single amino acid substitution in one of λ2 methyltransferase domains is the major determinant of the difference in interferon sensitivity between these two viruses.	reovirus , interferon , reverse genetics , RNA capping , RNA methyltransferase , virus , structure coiffe	en	12761.0
787	Evaluation of mitochondrial function in a model of developmental programming of hypertension associated with transient neonatal oxygen exposure	EVALUATION OF MITOCHONDRIAL FUNCTION IN A MODEL OF DEVELOPMENTAL PROGRAMMING OF HYPERTENSION ASSOCIATED WITH TRANSIENT NEONATAL OXYGEN EXPOSURE Introduction: Rats exposed to oxygen (O2) as newborns suffer complications in adulthood, including: arterial hypertension, vascular dysfunction, nephropenia and indices of oxidative stress. Although the rats are born at term, their organ development is equivalent to that of a preterm fetus, allowing organs of interest such as the kidney to be compared to premature infants. Given that impaired nephrogenesis or reduced nephron numbers has been shown to promote the development of hypertension and mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with increased oxidative stress, we hypothesised that exposure to high oxygen concentrations in the neonatal period would significantly impact the expression and activity of key proteins involved in renal mitochondrial function and lead to an excessive production of reactive oxygen species by the mitochondria.  Methods: Sprague-Dawley rat pups were exposed to 80% O2 (Hyperoxic (H) group; O2 exposed) or 21% O2 (Control (Ctrl) group)  from day 3 to day 10 of life. At 4 and 16 weeks of age, kidneys were rapidly excised and the mitochondria isolated following a standard protocol; with a buffer containing 0.32 M sucrose and differential centrifugations. Expression of mitochondrial proteins was assessed by Western blot, whereas the release of hydrogen peroxide (H202), activities of key citric acid cycle enzymes and mitochondrial swelling were assessed by spectrophotometry. Results are expressed as the means ± SE. Both male and female offspring were studied. Results: In male H rats at 16 weeks of age (n=6), citrate synthase activity (internal standard and measure of relative mitochondrial abundance) was significantly increased (12.4 ± 8.4 vs 4.1 ± 0.5 μmole/mL/min), whereas aconitase activity (sensitive to ROS) was significantly decreased (0.11 ± 0.05 vs 0.20 ± 0.04 μmoles/min/mg mitochondria) and H202 release was significantly increased (7.0 ± 1.3 vs 5.4 ± 0.8 ρmoles/mg mitochondrial protein) compared to the controls (Ctrl, n=6 males and 4 females). The H group (vs Ctrl) also demonstrated a reduction in the expression of peroxiredoxin-3 (Prx3) (H 0.61±0.06 vs. Ctrl 0.78±0.02 relative units, -23%; p<0.05), a protein involved in the elimination of H202 and in the expression of cytochrome C oxidase (Complex IV) (H 1.02±0.04 vs. Ctrl 1.20±0.02 relative units, -15%; p<0.05), a protein in the mitochondrial respiratory chain, whereas the expression of uncoupling protein-2 (UCP2), a protein involved in dissipating the proton gradient, was significantly increased (H 1.05±0.02 vs. Ctrl 0.90±0.03 relative units, +17%; p<0.05). Female H rats (n=6) (vs Ctrl, n=6) at 16 weeks of age demonstrated a significant increase in aconitase activity (0.33±0.03 vs 0.17±0.02 μmoles/min/mg mitochondria), in the expression of ATP synthase β subunit (H 0.73±0.02 vs. Ctrl 0.59±0.02 relative units, +25%; p<0.05) (involved in ATP production) and in the expression of MnSOD (H 0.89±0.02 vs. Ctrl 0.74±0.03 relative units, +20%; p<0.05) (mitochondrial antioxidant involved in scavenging superoxide), whereas Prx3 expression was significantly reduced (H 1.1±0.07 vs. Ctrl 0.85±0.01 relative units, -24%; p<0.05 ).  In male H rats (vs Ctrl) at 4 weeks of age, the expression of Prx3 was significantly increased (H 0.72±0.03 vs. Ctrl 0.56±0.04 relative units, +31%; p<0.05). Female H rats (vs Ctrl) at 4 weeks of age demonstrated a significant increase in the expression of UCP2 (H 1.22±0.05 vs. Ctrl 1.03±0.04 relative units, +18%; p<0.05) and in the expression of MnSOD (H 1.36±0.01 vs. 1.19±0.06 relative units, +14%; p<0.05). Conclusion: The findings of this study demonstrate that transient oxygen exposure in the neonatal rat modifies protein expression, enzymatic activity and leads to indices of mitochondrial dysfunction (increase in ROS) in the adult kidney; these adverse changes in the mitochondria were more pronounced in adult males than in females. Overall, these findings,  suggest that impaired mitochondrial function is associated with and could play a role in the development of arterial hypertension, oxidative stress and cardiovascular disease associated with transient neonatal hyperoxic stress.

788	Effect of knockdown of Giα proteins using antisense oligodeoxynucleotides encapsulated in cationic liposomes on the development of hypertension in spontaneously hypertensive rats	Hypertension is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the world. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the development of hypertension will provide new insights into better control of hypertension. We have previously shown that the levels of Giα-2 and Giα-3 proteins were augmented in SHR before the onset of hypertension. Antihypertensive (ACE) inhibitor is associated with decreased Gi-proteins. In addition, intrapertoneal injection of pertussis toxin (PTX) inactivated both Giα proteins and prevented the development of hypertension in SHR. However, the specific contribution of Giα-2 and Giα-3 proteins in hypertension development is still not known. In the present study, Giα-2 and Giα-3 Antisense oligodeoxynuleotide (AS-ODN) (1 mg/Kg body weight) encapsulated in PEG/DOTAP/DOPE cationic liposomes were administrated intravenously to three-week-old pre-hypertensive SHR and their age-matched WKY while control WKY and SHR were injected with sterile PBS, empty liposomes or sense oligomer. Blood pressure (BP) was monitored weekly using tail-cuff technique. The rats were sacrificed at the age of six weeks and nine weeks. Heart and aorta were used to study Gi proteins expression. The knockdown of Giα-2 protein by Giα-2-AS injection prevented the development of hypertension up to the age of six weeks; thereafter the BP began to increase rapidly and reached the same level found in control groups at the age of nine weeks. On the other hand, the BP of the Giα-3-AS treated group began to increase at the age of four weeks. The SHR Giα-3-AS had augmented BP at six weeks but lower than that of SHR-CTL. The heart and aorta obtained from six week-old SHR Giα-2-AS and Giα-3-AS had significant decrease in Giα-2 and Giα-3 proteins expression respectively. WKY Giα-2-AS and Giα-3-AS had decreased in Giα-2 and Giα-3 protein expression respectively despite having no change in BP compared to CTL WKY. At the age of nine weeks, the SHR Giα-2-AS and Giα-3-AS had the same BP and Gi protein expression as the control SHR. These results suggest that both Giα-2 and Giα-3 proteins are implicated in the development of hypertension in SHR but the knockdown of Giα-2 not Giα-3 has prevented the development of hypertension.

789	Impact de l’expression de l’isoforme p35 de la chaîne invariante humaine chez des souris déficientes en CD74 endogène	The invariant chain (Ii; CD74) is a type II membrane protein which plays a key role in antigen presentation as well as acting as a receptor for the cytokine MIF (macrophage migration inhibitory factor). In the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Ii assists the folding of MHC II and prevents the loading of nascent polypeptides in the peptide-binding groove. Di-leucine-like motifs contained in the Ii cytoplasmic tail target the MHC II-Ii complexes in the endocytic pathway. Once in low pH-endosomes, Ii is degraded allowing the binding of a high affinity peptide which is then presented on cell surface to CD4+ T cells. In Ii deficient mice, MHC II displays a “floppy” conformation typical of empty molecules or is loosely bound with peptides. The transport is aberrant leading to decreased surface expression of MHC II and defective antigenic presentation. Also, the lack of Ii restricts the peptide repertoire and impairs thymic selection of CD4+ T cells. Moreover, Ii regulates B cells maturation and Ii deficient mice display reduced numbers of mature follicular B cells (FO). The human minor p35 isoform (Iip35) does not exist in mice and displays a 16 amino acids N-terminal cytoplasmic extension containing a di-arginine (R-x-R) motif causing ER retention and acting as dominant in heterotrimeric complexes with Iip33. Upon binding to MHC II, the retention motif is masked, which allows the complexes to egress from the ER.  The physiological role of the R-x-R motif is poorly understood. To shed light on Iip35 function, we generated transgenic mice expressing Iip35 and analyzed the conformation and traffic of MHC II, the thymic selection and the development of B cells as well as the antigenic presentation.  Our results showed that Iip35 generates an MHC II in the right conformation and increases MHC II surface expression. Also, Iip35 targets MHC II into endosomes where high affinity peptides bind to the groove. We also showed that Iip35 diversifies the peptide repertoire and fully restores thymic selection of CD4+ T cells as well as the TCR levels on these cells. Then, Iip35 ensures presentation of the Ii-dependent antigen ovalbumin but does not totally rescue the presentation of superantigens. Interestingly, thymic selection of the iNKT cells is fully restored showing that Iip35 assists with lipids presentation by CD1d. Finally, Iip35 allows B cells to develope into FO B cells but does not support marginal zone (MZ) B cells maturation. This result suggests that MIF stimulation is not a prerequisite for FO B cells development. Altogether, these results showed that Iip35 is functional and has most of the CD74 functions. However, it cannot replace the endogenous Ii regarding the MZ B cells maturation suggesting that Iip35 could have regulatory functions by modulating the development of some cells.

790	Antigen and superantigen presentation as defined by the MHCII-accessory proteins and associated-peptides	MHCII molecules expose a weave of antigens, which send survival or activation signals to T lymphocytes. The ongoing process of peptide binding to the MHC class II groove implicates three accessory molecules: the invariant chain, DM and DO. The invariant chain folds and directs the MHCII molecules to the endosomal pathway. Then, DM exchanges the CLIP peptide, which is a remnant of the degraded invariant chain, for peptides of better affinity. Expressed in highly specialized antigen presenting cells, DO competes with MHCII molecules for DM binding and favors the presentation of receptor-internalized antigens. Altogether, these molecules exhibit potential immunomodulatory properties that can be exploited to increase the potency of peptide vaccines. DO requires DM for maturation and to exit the ER. Interestingly, it is possible to monitor this interaction through a conformation change on DOβ that is recognized by the Mags.DO5 monoclonal antibody. Using Mags.DO5, we showed that DM stabilizes the interactions between the DO α1 and β1 chains and that DM influences DO folding in the ER. Thus, the Mags.DO5+ conformation correlates with DO egress from the ER. To further evaluate this conformation change, directed evolution was applied to DO. Of the 41 unique mutants obtained, 25% were localized at the DM-DO binding interface and 12% are at the solvent-exposed β1 domain, which is thought to be the Mags.DO5 epitope. In addition, I used the library to test the ability of HLA-DO to inhibit HLA-DM and sorted for the amount of CLIP. Interestingly, most of the mutants showed a decrease inhibitory effect, supporting the notion that the intrinsic instability of DO is a required for its function. Finally, these results support the model in which DO competes against classical MHCII molecules by sequestering DM chaperone’s function. MHCII molecules are also characterized by their ability to present superantigens, a group of bacterial or viral toxins that coerces MHCII-TCR binding in a less promiscuous fashion than what is observed in a canonical setting. While the mechanism of how bacterial superantigens form trimeric complexes with TCR and MHCII is well understood, the mouse mammary tumor virus superantigens (vSAG) are poorly defined. In the absence of a crystal structure, I chose a functional approach to examine the relation between vSAG, MHCII and TCR with the goal of uncovering the overall trimolecular architecture. I showed that TCR concomitantly binds both the MHCII α chain and the vSAG and that TCR-MHCII docking is almost canonical when coerced by vSAGs. Because many peptides may be tolerated in the MHCII groove, the pressure exerted by vSAG seems to tweak conventional TCR-MHCII interactions. Furthermore, my results demonstrate that vSAG binding to MHCII molecules is conformation-dependent and abrogated by the CLIP amino-terminal residues extending outside the peptide-binding groove. In addition, they also suggest that vSAGs cross-link adjacent MHCIIs and activate T cells via a TGXY motif.	superantigen , HLA-DO , HLA-DM , MHC class II , Antigen presentation , MMTV	en	12741.0
791	Opportunités du REDD+ pour l'aménagement durable des forêts tropicales et obstacles à son implantation en République démocratique du Congo : perspective juridique	"The situation of the rainforest in developing countries in general and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in particular is worrying. Emissions of carbon dioxide from deforestation are about 1.6 GtCO2e/an, or 17% of global emissions of ""greenhouse gases"". Under the auspices of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, REDD+ has been established to fight against the deforestation and degradation of forests. This study examines the different opportunities offered by the program for ecosystem-based management of forest cover in the DRC and contextual barriers to its implementation. For the DRC, REDD+ has a number of opportunities: reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation; work begins afforestation and reforestation for sustainable management of resources leading to job creation and promoting the growth of GDP and exports, increased yield and maintaining greater food needs. The REDD+ can promote the growth of the agricultural gross domestic product. It can contribute to the electrification of households and halve spending dependent on mining and oil and thus generate thousands of jobs in infrastructure. For local and indigenous communities, it can also help to protect and promote the cultures associated with the forest. But, faced with the burdens of legal, political, social, economic, technological and cultural characteristics of the country, these opportunities may be diminished, if not annihilated. Given that most of the deployment of the REDD+ will happen in Congolese rural areas, the major obstacle is the customary law. The solution would be to harmonize the requirements and objectives of REDD+ not only with the Forest Code of 2002 and its implementing rules but also with the customary law which local and indigenous communities identify."

792	Inégalités sociales dans la diffusion d'une innovation en transport actif : le cas des vélos en libre-service à Montréal	Background. Public bicycle share programs (PBSP) are an active transportation innovation. No study has examined lack of awareness of PBSP as a factor limiting accessibility. Objective. Identify factors associated with lack of awareness of a PBSP across time in Montreal. Methods. Within the context of a larger study, a sample of 7,011 Montrealiers aged 18 years and over were recruited to participate in one of three telephone surveys occurring prior to implementation (n=2,000), after season 1 (n=2,502), and after season 2 (n=2,509). Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to investigate associations between survey period, proximity to docking stations, and education with lack of PBSP awareness. Results. There was a greater likelihood of being PBSP-unaware among those with lower education after season 1 implementation in comparison to those with higher education (OR = 1.60, 95 %CI: 1.18, 2.19). There was also greater likelihood of being PBSP-unaware among those with lower education after season 2 implementation in neighbourhoods where the PBSP was available in comparison to those with higher education in neighbourhoods without PBSP docking stations (OR = 1.63, 95 %CI: 1.01, 2.64). Although lack of awareness decreased over time, greater likelihood of being PBSP-unaware was observed among those with lower education. Conclusion. Despite the physical presence of PBSP docking stations in neighbourhoods, socioeconomic inequalities persist.

793	"Stratégies visant à accroître la demande de vaccination infantile dans les pays en
développement : révision systématique et méta-analyse"	Vaccination is one of the most cost effective health interventions known. However, inequalities of the vaccination coverage persist between regions and countries. The interventions to improve the vaccination coverage are usually grouped either as interventions to improve the supply or the delivery of health services, or as interventions to stimulate the demand for immunization services. The objective of this study is to evaluate whether demand-side interventions can increase routine immunization of children in developing countries. We conducted a systematic review and a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials and other types of scientific studies conducted in developing countries. The targeted population consisted of parents and guardians of children under two years of age which are exposed to an intervention designed to increase demand for routine immunization of children. Research studies in different databases were restricted to primary studies published before September 2013 (last update on March 25th, 2014) in 6 languages. Eleven studies were selected and classified into two categories: (1) education and knowledge transfer (7 studies) and (2) incentives (4 studies). The results of the meta-analysis demonstrated a positive impact of demand-side intervention for vaccination of children in developing countries (RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.17, 1.44). These positive impacts were found as well in the interventions that include education and knowledge transfer (RR 1.40, 95% CI1.20, 1.63) that in the interventions using incentives (RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.12, 1.45). The results suggest that strategies to increase demand are effective in improving uptake of childhood vaccines in developing countries.	vaccination , Child , vaccination , immunization program , demand for vaccination , developing countries , review , meta-analysis	en	12708.0
794	Lower Cortisol Activity is Associated with First-Time Driving while Impaired	Driving while impaired (DWI) is a grave and persistent high-risk behavior. Previous work demonstrated that DWI recidivists had attenuated cortisol reactivity compared to non-DWI drivers. This suggests that cortisol is a neurobiological marker of high-risk driving. The present study tested the hypothesis that this initial finding would extend to first-time DWI (fDWI) offenders compared to non-DWI drivers. Male fDWI offenders (n = 139) and non-DWI drivers (n = 31) were exposed to a stress task, and their salivary cortisol activity (total output and reactivity) was measured. Participants also completed questionnaires on sensation seeking, impulsivity, substance use, and engagement in risky and criminal behaviors. As hypothesized, fDWI offenders, compared to non-DWI drivers, had lower cortisol reactivity; fDWI offenders also showed lower total output. In addition, cortisol activity was the most important predictor of group membership, after accounting for alcohol misuse patterns and consequences and other personality and problem behavior characteristics. The findings indicate that attenuated cortisol activity is an independent factor associated with DWI offending risk at an earlier stage in the DWI trajectory than previously detected.

795	Changements climatiques et stratégies de mitigation : Assistons-nous à une décarbonisation de l’économie mondiale ?	At the beginning of June 2015, G7 countries leaders pledged to decarbonize the world economy by the end of the century. The present study aims to determine whether or not such a transition is already under way. Three broad lines of inquiry are systematically explored -- including changes in the energy mix, political dynamics and economic trends -- to reach the conclusion that the much-heralded transition toward decarbonization has yet to really start, even if a few changes can already be observed. An important distinction is thus made between an observable evolution and a broader transition. To conclude, this study investigates the implications of ongoing mitigation efforts for the 2050 economic and political landscape.		en	12667.0
796	Exploration des liens entre les attitudes face à la tristesse, la dépression et le bien-être	Attitudes toward emotions have been linked in theory with psychopathologies, such as depression, and with well-being. Unfortunately, empirical studies on these relations are scarce. We propose that negatives attitudes toward sadness, on the whole, will be positively correlated with depression and negatively with well-being. We also explore the relations between specific attitudes toward sadness, depression and well-being. One hundred and three undergraduate students completed four questionnaires: one for assessing their attitudes toward sadness, another for evaluating the hedonic part of well-being, another for assessing the eudemonic part of well-being and the Brief Symptom Inventory depression scale. Results show that attitudes toward sadness as a whole are correlated coherently with depression and well-being, in concordance with our hypothesis. The individual attitudes toward sadness have specific relations to depression and well-being. The main findings indicate that two non supportive attitudes toward sadness are correlated negatively with well-being and positively with depression (anger against the self if sad and fear of being rejected if sad) and those correlations are reversed for the attitude replacement of sadness with a positive thought. The theoretical and practical implications of this work are double. On the one hand, the findings suggest that attitudes toward sadness can become relevant targets for therapeutic intervention in order to reduce depression and to facilitate well-being. On the other hand, the results justify a closer look at specific attitudes toward sadness because of their possible and differential impact on depression and well-being.

797	Drug-loaded nanocarriers : passive targeting and crossing of biological barriers	Poor bioavailability and poor pharmacokinetic characteristics are some of the leading causes of drug development failure. Therefore, poorly-soluble drugs, fragile proteins or nucleic acid products may benefit from their encapsulation in nanosized vehicles, providing enhanced solubilisation, protection against degradation, and increased access to pathological compartments. A key element for the success of drug-loaded nanocarriers (NC) is their ability to either cross biological barriers themselves or allow loaded drugs to traverse them to achieve optimal pharmacological action at pathological sites. Depending on the mode of administration, NC may have to cross different physiological barriers in their journey towards their target. In this review, the crossing of biological barriers by passive targeting strategies will be presented for intravenous delivery (vascular endothelial lining, particularly for tumour vasculature and blood-brain barrier targeting), oral administration (gastrointestinal lining) and upper airway administration (pulmonary epithelium). For each specific barrier, background information will be provided on the structure and biology of the tissues involved as well as available pathways for nano-objects or loaded drugs (diffusion and convection through fenestration, transcytosis, tight junction crossing, etc.). The determinants of passive targeting − size, shape, surface chemistry, surface patterning of nanovectors − will be discussed in light of current results. Perspectives on each mode of administration will be presented. The focus will be on polymeric nanoparticles and dendrimers although advances in liposome technology will be also reported as they represent the largest body in the drug delivery literature.

soins intensifs : les déterminants influençant la collaboration"	"Teamwork and interprofessional collaboration in critical care are essentials to provide quality of care and patient safety. However, the multiple interactions that require collaboration in the context of acute care are likely to cause tensions, conflicts and inefficient team work. The determinants of this collaboration in critical care are not completely identified. The objective of this research is to identify and evaluate the relative importance of determinants that influence interprofessional collaboration in a critical care team. A survey assessing these determinants was developed and completed by healthcare professionals, working in four intensive care units of an university hospital in Montreal. A total of 312 professionals, including 46 physicians, 187 nurses and 62 respiratory therapists, completed the survey. Various models of multiple hierarchical regression analysis determined that ""clarity of the work and processes"", ""trust and respect"", and especially ""participation in decisions"" are statistically significant determinants which predict collaboration among the critical care team. Analysis of subgroup suggest differences between physicians and nurses perception of these determinants. These results provide new evidences to understand the process of collaboration and teamwork in a critical care team, through the clarification of its determinants. In practical terms, this means that we should : i) promote the development of ""collaborative"" competence among professionals working in the field of critical care ; ii) aim at teaching and educating the various professionals, taking into account the determinants of collaboration identified in this study."

799	La bilittératie chez les jeunes élèves allophones à Montréal : une réflexion en vue d’améliorer l’enseignement-apprentissage du français	This article pursues a double objective. The first one is to report the importance of the concept of biliteracy for research and practice in education. The second one opens the reflection on the different didactic and pedagogical issues related to biliteracy among young allophone students in Montreal. To this end, two complementary models which are part of the theoretical matrix of our research project will be approached. It is about the common underlying proficiency model of Cummins (2008, 1991, 1981, 1979), as well as the continua model of Hornberger (2004, 2003). The text illustrates the necessity to reconsider the practice of teaching French – language of instruction in Quebec – given the sociolinguistic reality in which these allophone students evolve.

800	L’architecture de paysage moderne du campus de l’Université de Montréal	The campus of the University of Montreal is based on a highly significant association of buildings and landscape design that contributes to our understanding of the evolution of the use of space in the campus environment. For a number of historical reasons, the open spaces of the 1960s deserve particular attention. In the context of unprecedented expansion experienced by the university at the time and the simultaneous coming to age in Québec of the disciplines of landscaping and planning, open spaces on the campus became, for the first time in the history of the university, the focus of serious reflection. This article describes the context influencing the planning principles applied by La Haye and Associates, one of Québec’s leading urban planning firms, in designing these open spaces for the campus. We trace the strengths and shortcomings of modern thinking about open spaces – on the one hand, the innovative approaches used in planning and design, and, on the other, the overemphasis placed on car related needs, at the expense of safety and opportunities for social interaction.

801	Trajectoires socioprofessionnelles des immigrants africains subsahariens de Montréal accédant à des fonctions socioéconomiques valorisées	"Immigrants in Montreal, Quebec, Canada are experiencing job integration difficulties. Some racialized groups are experiencing even more problems, and specifically those from sub-Saharan Africa are considerate as ""racialized groups"" which opens the door to greater discrimination and other difficulties (Hadiri 2008; Nikuze, 2011). Drawing from a sociology of ""success trajectories"" through questions and mobilizing the contribution of several disciplines with a view to solving practical problems, I seek to propose possible solutions to various problems of these immigrants.  Field research, based on comprehensive interviews of Kaufmann (1996, 2008), offers a qualitative sociology of ""trajectory of success"" or socio-professional experiences as ""rewarding "" or "" enhanced."" The sample was composed of African immigrants living through such experiences. Through their different paths, the research was based on this primary objective: begin with the central question of the success factors; search for solutions and policy instruments for better socio-economic integration of new immigrants; or even less-recent immigrants’ still experiencing difficulties integrating into employment.  The results suggest three categories of contributing factors to the base of the ""social and professional success,"" all arranged under ""values,"" or ways of seeing the world can contribute to this ""success"" in better harmonizing the Quebec context. This includes personal values, African sociocultural contributions, and Quebec sociocultural resources. If personal values are drawn from an individual’s specific characteristics, African and Quebec sociocultural resources would result from inherent traditions or customs of the cultures of the countries concerned. The analysis and interpretation of these factors conducive to the socio-professional integration of immigrants revealed several tracks that can facilitate employment integration of immigrants as this thesis reported. It remains certain in the face of results that highlight especially the individual factor, the ""success"" and inserting ""successful"" or experienced as such remain a function of the actions of public authorities: whatever the values and provisions of individual immigrants, these positive factors remain without effect if laws and policies in the field of immigration impede in any way."

802	Three works on religious themes : psalmus 150, string quartet on the life of Saint John Paul II and symphony “The Redemption”	In this dissertation, I present three pieces on religious themes composed during my master’s degree as well as their analysis: Psalmus 150 for three-voice youth choir, eight-voice adult choir and organ or piano; String Quartet on the life of Saint John Paul II; and Symphony “The Redemption” for orchestra and choir. Despite the particularities of each one, they present common aspects.  The main compositional idea was to avoid rupture with tradition, whilst bringing new ideas into the pieces, as well as to highlight the importance of my research on beauty. For this purpose, some contemporary techniques as well the medieval sonorities of parallel fifths and octaves were used in consonance with a modal/tonal language, which remains the framework of the three pieces. Gregorian chant is also an important characteristic of these compositions.  In order to better understand the analysis of the pieces, two techniques are explained, the soft web of linear dissonances and the perfect major chord harmony. The analysis of each piece is divided into two parts. The first is an overview and the second a more detailed analysis. At the end, the knowledge obtained from composing these pieces will be summarized, and the timeless importance of beauty will be reaffirmed.

803	La protection du droit de grève : étude comparative des conflits de relations de travail et des conflits étudiants	This study refers to the right to strike and its protection in the workplace and student's environment in Quebec. Following the important and memorable student general strike in spring 2012, also called maple spring and the repercussions it has prompted, it was important to write down an analysis of the right to strike and the protection it offers, not only in the field of labor relations but also in the context of students’ protests.  We will make a retrospective of the organization at the origin of its existence: the union. For a good understanding of workers and students’ associations, we shall remind the history of each one before paying a particular attention to the right to strike and the legal frame that applies to it. Finally, we shall analyze the possible constitutional foundations of the strike as a collective means of expression and action for employees and students’ associations. We emphasize that this study is based on various books concerning trade unionism and students’ organisations as well as the right to strike and its protection, topics treated by eminent professors and lawyers, who have been our inspiration.

804	L'éducation morale des spectateurs face à l'image dans le cinéma de Michael Haneke	Michael Haneke is best known for his stark mise en scène, beginning with his earliest theatrical release. Onscreen, the filmmaker has depicted several characters in violent situations, whom are often in a densely mediatic environment. The following work seeks to identify the evolution of his artistic process concerning the presence of media in his cinematographic universe; to this effect, I have identified three distinct phases in his filmography. Using a different theoretical framework for each one, I will attempt to outline and define all three periods, namely: observation, with the writings of Marshall McLuhan; action, with Erving Goffman’s works on interaction and; assertion, a possible answer to the issue of guiding the viewer in the act of watching images with the writings of Serge Tisseron and Marie-José Mondzain. I will demonstrate, through analyses of Haneke’s films, that these different phases within his filmography ultimately serve the director’s intent to morally educate the viewers.	viewer	en	12568.0
805	Effet de la végétation sur la variabilité de la profondeur de dégel à petite échelle dans un paysage de tourbières en forêt boréale dans les Territoires du Nord-Ouest	In order to better understand the impacts of climate change on permafrost degradation, it is important to understand the influence of abiotic and biotic factors on permafrost dynamics. While studies allude to the effect of broad vegetation groups on permafrost dynamics at landscape-scale, the role vegetation plays in affecting the spatial variability of active-layer development on the scale of metres, as explored here, is largely unknown. The study was carried out in a boreal forest-peatland landscape in the discontinuous permafrost zone in the southern Northwest Territories (N61°18’, W121°18’). We examined the influence of the following vegetation characteristics on the spatial variability of thaw depth: tree density, shrub cover, leaf area index, and cryptogam presence (lichen and bryophyte). We found that greater tree density was associated with shallower thaw depths while shrub cover (<50cm height) had a negligible influence. Furthermore, thaw depth depended on the cryptogam species cover and microform. This research quantifies the impact of vegetation by strata on thaw depth and may ultimately serve to refine vegetation parameters in ecosystem models and land surface schemes as part of climate models.	permafrost , heat transfer , boreal forest , species , plants , vegetation ecology , microtopography , microform	en	12562.0
806	La culture d’entreprise : une comparaison de deux compagnies d’assurances à partir d’une approche interactionnelle	This thesis proposes a comparative study of two insurance companies from an interactional perspective. The analysis of the organizational life in these two insurance companies allowed me to show that the discourse on cultural values contained in these insurance companies’ publications were often at odds with the actions, positions and practices that managers put forward on a daily basis. These differences result from the fact that the administrators seem to conceive of their organizations on the basis of operational modes, processes and business management criteria that are specific to companies focused solely on economic gain. As I try to show in this thesis, the values that are cultivated in an organization are nevertheless as important as the products and services that insurance companies offer to their customers to ensure the proper functioning of a company.

MRIs in prone position and X-rays in standing position are acquired for 14 patients with scoliosis. The 3D reconstructions of the spine are then aligned using an articulated model which calculates intervertebral transformations. Results show significant decrease in regis- tration error when the proposed articulated model is compared with rigid registration. The method can be used as a basis for full body MRI/X-ray registration incorporating soft tissues for surgical simulation.

808	La formation du sujet dans la philosophie féministe de Judith Butler	In Gender Trouble, Judith Butler challenges feminism as identity politics, which, according to her, would produce a new set of potential exclusions, based on the category “woman”. I will not dispute how she articulates that sexuality gives sense to gender, which produces sex. My interest lies in how Butler understands the process of becoming a subject for an individual, and how people tend to belong to a collective identity, via gender performativity. She states that gender is an act and identity a form of practice. I will explain how she understands that human beings are constituted by their acts and criticize, according to two feminist authors, her conception of gender. I will conclude that Butler has to admit that some kind of feminine identity is necessary to feminism, even when we consider her plea for the inclusion of individuals sexually marginalized.

809	La presse française et l’adhésion de la Grande-Bretagne à la CEE : des refus à l’acceptation (1961-1973)	Following the Second World War, Europe was divided and weak. The horrors of war forced Europeans to rethink how to co-exist and the idea of a united Europe with strong economical and political ties grew among them. The ECSC was created in 1951 and then, seven years later, the European Economic Community. When the latter succeeded, some European countries, like Great Britain, asked to join. France, and its president Charles de Gaulle, objected to the British application on two occasions, in 1963 and in 1967. London had to wait for the arrival of a new French president, Georges Pompidou, to be officially accepted in the EEC. The enlargement of the Community was an important event because it had an impact on France’s role in Europe and in the world. It also influenced Europe’s role in the then bipolar world and on its relations with the United States. The national press of the countries involved covered the events surrounding the enlargement with interest. The French daily press commented on them at length. Using both historical studies and primary sources, this thesis thematically analyzes the views of French newspaper of different political horizons on French policy surrounding the three British applications.

810	Les stratégies organisationnelles de gestion des rumeurs sur Internet : une analyse ventriloque	In this thesis, we analyze the strategies organizations develop to manage and fight against rumors through the Internet and the social media. The objective is to mobilize a ventriloquial approach to analyze how various authority figures are used by the organizations and the consumers to lend weight to their respective positions through their online interactions. As we show, organizations use a multitude of authority figures to convince their consumers. At the same time, they position themselves as subjected to agencies that are contextual to the rumor they are facing. Similarly, Internet users stage concerns that are supposed to drive their positions. As we show, dialogues between organizations and Internet users reflect different relations between these two parties. Indeed, organizations do not all interact in the same way with Internet users. This analysis is based on data collected from organization websites and social media such as Facebook and Twitter.

811	Peut-on donner d’une clause et reprendre de l’autre? Essai sur la cause comme instrument de contrôle de la cohérence matérielle du contrat	Can one provision take away what another has given? While two hundred years of contradictory decisions and commentaries renders this question difficult to answer with certainty and confidenc – two things we’ve grown accustomed to from civil law doctrine, we can safely assert that civil law prohibits provisions allowing a contracting party to completely renege on his obligations. By depriving the co-contractor’s undertaking of all reasons, and the contract of its purpose, such “contract-killing” provision runs counter to a fundamental concept of general contract law: “la cause”. This notion, which constitutes the first article of the “Obligations” book and which is said to be one of the most important of French contract law, was imported and kept by Quebec legislature to ensure that contracts providing no benefits to one of the parties would not be validated. Although its role is often fulfilled by other mechanisms, “la cause” remains the “guardian” of synallagmatic contracts. As such, it can not only nullify contracts without valuable consideration, but it can also, and especially, control those whose content can’t form the negotiated benefits. By giving judges the power to ensure that contracts contain the tools needed to achieve its objectives, “la cause” offers them the best way to guarantee the alignment of end and means. In other words, it offers judges a way to control the material coherence of contracts.	cause , synallagmatic contract , cause , immunization by contract , material coherence , exclusion and limitation of obligations , exclusion and limitation of liability , partial nullity , provisions deemed unwritten	en	12458.0

la traite de personnes migrantes au Québec : points de vue des agents de l'ASFC et d'intervenants auprès de victimes migrantes"	Laws are adopted, policies implemented, hundreds of thousands of dollars invested in staff training, then what ? This exploratory research seeks to shed some light on what is actually happening at Canadian borders offices across Quebec and highlight the discrepancies between Canada's engagement toward combating human trafficking and actual practices in the field by border services officers. To do so we interviewed seven Canada Border Services officers working at Montreal's Pierre- Elliott-Trudeau international airport, Canada's fourth biggest international port of entry and Quebec's first, so we could learn about their professional knowledge and experience in regard to human trafficking. We also spoke to four victim services providers so we could learn about the victims' experiences with this law enforcement federal agency and the impacts of those experiences on them. If the interviewed officers seem to have a good idea, albeit very much influenced by the media, of what is transnational human trafficking, few are those who have hands-on experience of the phenomenon. The lack of continuous and substantial information and training, the perceived role of the Canada Border Services Agency by its officers as well as the lack of leadership by its direction, all in regard to transnational human trafficking, seem to be major hindrances to the political willingness of the Canadian government at large, and the Canada Border Services Agency in particular, to fight the global war against transnational human trafficking on its own turf. The hurdles are plenty in the fight against transnational human trafficking at Canadian borders and they represent a sizeable challenge that is both complex and complicated. Since no amount of wishful thinking will stop transnational human trafficking from happening in Canada, an approach that is centred on prevention at the borders and a greater awareness by Canada Border Services officers of the matter might just get Canada a little bit closer to that goal.

813	Le leadership en matière de justice sociale : cas d’une direction d’école primaire francophone de milieu défavorisé de Montréal	This qualitative case study aims at drawing a portrait of an elementary school principal practicing a leadership for social justice in disadvantaged areas of Montreal.  Using the operational framework for the study of transformative leadership (Archambault & Garon, 2011a), we present an emerging portrait from the discourse of the principal, teachers and other members of the school staff and from the shadowing of the principal. This portrait presents first, the knowledge of the leader concerning leadership for social justice and matters related to justice at school. Second, it presents the leader’s attitudes, beliefs and values reflecting her desire to change things towards more justice in her school. Third, the portrait presents reported behaviours (self-reported or reported by other participants) and observed behaviours reflecting strategies implemented by the leader to effect change towards more justice.  This portrait aligns the studied principal with those showing interest for social justice and acting to change things to promote equity and justice in their schools from disadvantaged areas of Montreal as reveled by the study of Archambault & Garon (2013).  The case study presents a portrait built from results obtained from shadowing combined with interviews with the principal herself and with other participants, thus it presents a fairly complete and nuanced picture of the leadership for social justice practiced by the principal. It also shows the utility of the operational framework for the study of transformative leadership (Archambault & Garon, 2011a).  Due to its nature (case study), this research does not aspire to any generalisation of its results; it rather pretends to present an instructive case to meet the interest for studying the leadership for social justice in elementary schools from disadvantaged areas of Montreal	Leadership , École francophone , Leadership for social justice , School principal , Elementary school , Disadvantaged areas , Francophone schools	en	12430.0
814	Le concept de justice et la quête du bonheur chez Thrasymaque de Chalcédoine	"Thrasymachus of Chalcedon, a renowned sophist in the Athens of the fifth century BC, is presented as the main interlocutor of Socrates in Book I of the Republic. As it is mainly a debate on the question of justice and its implications, Socrates and Thrasymachus are obviously not agreeing on the nature of justice. Thrasymachus, driven by the constant questioning of Socrates, comes to formulate different theories about justice, including: ""I support that justice is nothing else than the interest of the stronger"" (Rép. 338c) and ""justice and just are actually another's good."" (Rép. 343c) Meanwhile, he opposes the philosopher a vision of justice difficult to accept, but also hard to refute: one who commits injustice is happier than he who acts according to justice Thus, for Thrasymachus, injustice is better than justice and is happier because injustice is more profitable for yourself. According to this view, what is justice, and why is it not profitable for ourselves? The objective of this thesis is to highlight the positive conception of Thrasymachus about justice, because it is in conflict with the pursuit of happiness. Indeed, if justice represent the interests of the ruler, as argued by the sophist, then being just is nothing else that acting according to the interests of others and not yourself. However, in a city where people are under the guidance of the law, it is not always so easy to act according to its own interests when they are contrary to justice. That is why it is also relevant to dwell on the characteristics and qualities an individual must possess, according to Thrasymachus, to be happy. We will try to identify in Thrasymachus' ideas about justice a life model to follow: the κρείττων. Ultimately, we will highlight the position of Thrasymachus with Plato's critique. For Socrates, the position that injustice is profitable is difficult because he will have to show that this is actually justice that brings happiness, as it is a virtue of the soul."

815	Les facteurs internes et externes ayant un impact sur le retour aux études universitaires des professionnels en transition de carrière	Purpose: In Quebec, as in the rest of Canada, the number of professionals returning to education has increased significantly. Among these professionals, a number is (are) experiencing career transition after several years of work. The objective of this research is to determine what factors do affect the returns to education of these professionals Design/methodology/approach: In total 625 students of the Faculty of continuing education of the University of Montreal were invited to answer to a 64 questions online survey. 170 answers were collected. (27.2% response rate) The data collected allowed for the creation of variables and indices of confidence, motivation, time, etc. This data was subsequently intersected with dispositional, situational, institutional and demographic information in our sample. Findings: it does appear that internal factors: confidence; motivation; and the time factor have the most impact on our sample. Practical implications: maintaining motivation and confidence appears to be key to minimizing the impact of adverse factors on professionals who decide to go back to university after spending years on the job market   Originality/value:  few studies have focused on the problems faced by professionals who opt to go back to school to prepare for career change, this study is a first step in the collection of information on a not so well known population.

816	Effets de l’écriture de textes identitaires, soutenue par des ateliers d’expression théâtrale plurilingues, sur le rapport à l’écrit d’élèves immigrants allophones en situation de grand retard scolaire	This study explores the effects of the writing of multilingual identity texts, supported by multilingual drama expression workshops, on the relationship with writing of French as a second language (FSL) learners. Additionally, we compare these effects with traditional teaching practices for writing. The participants were recent immigrants with limited prior schooling educated at the secondary school level. This multiple case study was performed with both an experimental group and a control group. Participant observations and semi-directed interviews were conducted with each of the eight participants in order to describe their relationship with writing. The main contribution of this research project is that the researcher links a key concept in second language teaching, students’ literacy engagement, to their relationship with writing. Thus a new notion is proposed: the FSL students’ relationship with writing enhanced by literacy engagement (designated with the abbreviation “RÉ+” in French). Results confirm the relevance of this innovative approach which has an influence on the four dimensions of RÉ+: affective, praxeological, conceptual and axiological. The benefits of this approach are that students associate writing with positive feelings. Moreover, they adopt an analytical point of view on language learning, which leads to the development of metacognitive abilities. In essence, the effects on RÉ+ are different from those of traditional writing teaching practices, which, in comparison, seem unable to fully engage students emotionally and cognitively in writing tasks.

817	Expression et effets des WNTs sur l’expansion du cumulus et la maturation de l’ovocyte chez la vache	The Wnts comprise a large family of secreted glycoproteins which, when secreted in the extracellular space, play a key role in embryonic development. In adults, Wnts play a role in homeostasis and their deregulation likely causes several problems including developmental abnormalities with or without deformities, and cancer. The role of Wnts in the ovaries is not clearly defined although studies in humans and mice show the involvement of some Wnts in ovarian development, follicular maturation and in the process of ovulation. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that members of the Wnt family are involved in oocyte maturation in cattle. The specific objectives were to measure the expression of key Wnts (Wnt-2, -2b, -4, -5a and -5b) in cumulus cells during expansion, and to assess the effect of select Wnt proteins on expansion of the cumulus oocyte complex (COC) and oocyte maturation. Bovine COCs were placed into IVM medium for 0, 6, 12 and 22 h and mRNA levels measured by real-time PCR. The abundance of Wnt-2b mRNA in the cumulus cells was significantly higher at 6 h of maturation compared to immature (time 0) COCs, whereas mRNAs encoding Wnt-2, -4, -5a and -5b did not increase until the end of culture. The addition of EGF induced COC expansion and progression of the oocyte to meiosis II (MII) as expected but, unexpectedly, addition of Wnt-2b also induced expansion and (82% and 69%, EGF and Wnt2b, respectively) and progression to MII (62% and 56%, EGF and Wnt2b, respectively); a combination of WNT-2b and EGF did not improve the rates over either alone. Our study provides new evidence for a role for Wnts in the maturation of the COC in cattle. The Wnt signalling pathways are still unknown and more studies are needed.

818	Étude de la distribution de Salmonella comme un descripteur des enjeux de biosécurité dans un réseau de production: élevages et abattoir de porcs	Swine production has been the subject of numerous studies targeting Salmonella prevalence reduction on carcass at slaughter. These studies focused on the farm as a major source of contamination. Despite the numerous risk factors identified by these studies, some steps remains to be investigated in the pig primary production network. In this context, the objective of this project was to describe Salmonella presence at a pig production network interface i.e., between the farm and the slaughterhouse. For this purpose, ten farms and a slaughterhouse, all part of a network (including carriers) were selected. Thirty visits of farms, 36 truck surveys (loading and delivering) and eighteen investigations on backyard of the slaughterhouse were done during thirteen months duration of the field phases of the project. Based on the total of 738 samples, the results showed farm specific profiles with a total of 9 serotypes of Salmonella and 4 different lysotypes of S.Typhimurium. The loading dock at the farm presented 34,21% of the positive samples. Indistinguishable isolates of serotype Derby have contaminated this particular sampling site for 4 distinct farms. On the slaughterhouse backyard, Salmonella was abundantly found on all trucks pathways (67% of contamination, n=144). The existence of circumstances favorable to contamination at farm slaughterhouse interface, related to pig’s delivery, is documented. This interface represents a Salmonella reservoir hence a permanent risk of cross-contamination of the production to the slaughterhouse, but also back to the farm.

819	From Classical to Quantum Secret Sharing	In this thesis, we will focus on a cryptographic primitive known as secret sharing. We will explore both the classical and quantum domains of such schemes culminating our study by presenting a new protocol for sharing a quantum secret using the minimal number of possible quantum shares i.e. one single quantum share per participant. We will start our study by presenting in the preliminary chapter, a brief mathematical survey of quantum information theory (QIT) which has for goal primarily to establish the notation used throughout the manuscript as well as presenting a précis of the mathematical properties of the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)-state, which is used thoroughly in cryptography and in communication games. But as we mentioned above, our main focus will be on cryptography. In chapter two, we will pay a close attention to classical and quantum error corrections codes (QECC) since they will become of extreme importance when we introduce quantum secret sharing schemes in the following chapter. In the first part of chapter three, we will focus on classical secret shearing, presenting a general framework for such a primitive all the while illustrating the abstract concepts with examples presented both for their historical and analytical relevance. This first part (chapters one and two) will pave the way for our exposition of the theory of Quantum Secret Sharing (QSS), which will be the focus of the second part of chapter three. We will present then the most general theorems and definitions known to date for the construction of such primitives putting emphasis on the special case of quantum threshold schemes. We will show how quantum error correction codes are related to QSS schemes and show how this relation leads to a very solid correspondence to the point that QECC’s are closer analogues to QSS schemes than are the classical secret sharing primitives. Finally, we will present one of the three results we have in A. Broadbent, P.-R. Chouha, A. Tapp (2009) in particular, a secure minimal quantum threshold protocol (the other two results deal with communication complexity and the classical simulation of the GHZ-state).

820	Le GABA comme marqueur de récupération suite à une commotion cérébrale dans le sport ?	The recent demonstration of a link between sport concussions and the possible development of neurodegenerative disorders suggests that these injuries could induce long-term alterations in the brain of athletes. In fact, neurophysiological abnormalities have recently been shown via transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in primary motor cortex (M1) of asymptomatic concussed athletes. Specifically, the cortical silent period (CSP), a measure of GABAB-related inhibition, was prolonged and this hyper-inhibition was observed up to 30 years post-concussion. Therefore, the CSP, and possibility abnormal GABA transmission, may become objective markers of lingering effects of sport concussions. However, no study to date has directly assessed GABA levels in concussed athletes.   Therefore, the clinical and methodological studies included in the present thesis comprise two main objectives: (1) to determine whether excessive inhibition (GABA and CSP) is a marker of the persistent effects of concussion; (2) to assess the possibility of non-invasively modulating intracortical inhibition in order to develop future treatments aiming to normalize aberrant inhibition.  Study 1 reveals normal sensorimotor interactions, somatosensory processing and GABAA-related intracortical inhibition in M1 of asymptomatic athletes who sustained multiple concussions in comparison with athletes who never sustained a concussion. However, a specific enhancement of GABAB-related intracortical inhibition is observed in athletes on average 24 months after the last concussion.  In study 2, no alteration of GABAB-related intracortical inhibition is revealed in a group of athletes who sustained 1 to 5 sport concussions on average 41 months after the last concussion, in comparison with control athletes. In addition, while no alterations were present for GABA and glutamate levels in M1 using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), both groups displayed differential correlations between GABA and glutamate, which suggests the presence of a slight metabolic imbalance between the two metabolites in the concussed brain.   Study 3 highlighted, in healthy individuals, a relationship between the CSP and MRS-derived glutamatergic transmission, as well as GABA and glutamate levels. These results reveal a link between excitatory and inhibitory transmission in M1 and suggest that the CSP does not directly reflect GABA concentrations measured with MRS.   Results from study 4 showed that anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can reduce the length of the CSP in healthy individuals, suggesting the existence of a therapeutic potential associated with the use of this technique.   Study 5 thoroughly describes a protocol that aims at assessing the effects of bilateral tDCS on M1 metabolism using MRS. Using this protocol, study 6 reveals, in healthy individuals, no significant modulation of GABAergic inhibition as assessed with MRS. The study also shows, in an additional experiment, that anodal tDCS does not modulate MRS-derived GABA and glutamate levels.   In summary, the six studies included in the present thesis have helped increase our understanding of the neurophysiological and metabolic long-term effects of sport concussions. In addition, these experiments have shed light into the mechanism of action of several methods, including TMS, tDCS and MRS.

821	Soin des corps, soin des âmes : genre et pouvoirs dans les hôpitaux de France et de Nouvelle-France aux XVIIe et XVIIIe siècles	How did Ancien Régime hospitals mark and regulate the bodies of its inhabitants and its officers? From the mid-seventeenth century, the French colonial space was the subject of a hospital reform implemented in collaboration with Church and the State, the latter in the process of absolutism. The creation of the General Hospitals across the kingdom, throughout colonial land, had the effect of gradually clarifying the role of Hôtel-Dieu, and thus contributed to the establishment of a network of health institutions where secular and religious, caregivers and patients, men and women worked alongside each other. In order to capture the primary settings where this process took place, the dissertation analyzes the Parisian establishments under which state and religious wishes were fully expressed, a provincial territory - Auvergne - which, far from the center of royal power adapted the workings of hospital to its territory and colonial space - St. Lawrence Valley in Canada - where the implementation of hospital institutions responded both to the will of the missionary Church and colonial authorities as well as to meet the needs of a particular population. The project demonstrates how the powers of the Church, the caregiver and the dynamics of gender intertwined in hospitals and acting on all those involved in the hospital life from the Earlier this hospital reform until the end of the eighteenth century For this, this thesis brings together various documents from the archives of hospitals and hospital communities. By crossing the prescriptive texts and documents showing hospital practice, this thesis shows that the bodies of the institution's staff and those of the users underwent a process of disciplining relatively similar, especially in the religious sphere. It also shows that the distribution of power between men and women that evolves during the study period for the benefit of mankind as a result of a phenomenon of professional caregivers trades framed by the secular authorities. Comparing the three territories, this thesis, furthermore, shows how institutions adapt to different contexts. It helps to emphasize, in particular through an analysis of hospital space, the similarities between the Auvergne and the Canadian contexts, at least during the decades of peace for the colony. However, the colony is clearly distinguishable from the metropolis by the primacy accorded to religious throughout the period, which ended with the conquest, while the metropolitan institutions, first those of Paris and the Auvergne, testify to the increasingly power given to lay medical issues.

822	La diversité culturelle entre discours et pratique : une analyse multi-niveaux	The thesis is developed in the current “in vogue” speech on cultural diversity.  The main objective of our purpose consists in understanding the orientation of an international organization regarding the management of its cultural diversity. We think that, according to the change that modifies the socio-demographic configurations of the organizational context, it would be interesting to study an organization for which diversity is a tradition of its functioning. Our subject of study is an international organization affiliated to Unesco. The latter is recognized for its position, which values and protects the cultures.  The field of knowledge is bi-disciplinary. The first one is forged in the theories of management on diversity. The second field comes from “Cross-Cultural Studies”.  The methodological approach is also diversified in order to identify three levels of analysis of the cultural diversity in the Organisation. First, we have realized a historic study, based on the analysis of chosen articles from Unesco’s archives. It aims to reveal the evolution of the global discourse on cultural diversity, since its creation. Then, to better understand the internal organisational discourse about its cultural diversity, an analysis of the content of a “halo” of the internal policies takes place. This analysis allows us to understand the value of cultural diversity in a particular period. Finally, the stories of the actors of cultural diversity bring a rich description and complete the analysis with the interpretation of these actors of the management of the cultural diversity in the Organization. Additional elements of search are brought in the thesis and they are a part of the process of the analysis of the global orientation of the Organisation on the cultural diversity. We bring clarifications to the terminology of cultural diversity though an analysis of its use on the organisational literature. Besides, the thesis clarifies the notion of international organisation and proposes a description of the unesquian context defined by its internal cultural diversity.  All the examined levels allowed highlighting a double observation. On one hand the paradox between the three levels; Global-organisational-individual. On the other hand, the neutrality of the practices of management of the cultural diversity and the request of recognition of the cultural identities, implicitly formulated by them.   In conclusion, we provide the contributions and limitations of the thesis and we propose research possibilities.

823	Les azasulfurylpeptides : synthèse, analyse conformationnelle et applications biologiques	The azasulfurylpeptides are peptide mimics in which the alpha carbon and the carbonyl of an amino acid residue are respectively replaced by a nitrogen atom and a sulfonyl group (SO2). The primary goal of this doctorate project was to develop a new effective method for the synthesis of these motifs, also called N-aminosulfamides. Towards this aim, the use of 4-nitrophenyl sulfamidates turned out to be important in the synthesis of azasulfuryltripeptides, allowing hydrazide couplings under micro-wave irradiation (Chapter 2). Side-chain diversity was then added using a stoichiometric amount of base and different alkyl halides to alkylate chemoselectively the azasulfurylglycine (AsG) residue. The conformational properties of the N-aminosulfamides in the solid state were studied using X-Ray crystallography, which showed a tetrahedral geometry about the sulfur atom, features of azapeptides and sulfonamides, as well as potential to favor the formation of gamma turns (Chapter 3). Following the development of the synthesis of these N-aminosulfamides in solution, a combinatorial approach on solid support was elaborated on Rink amide resin to generate a library of azasulfurylpeptides. The study was performed using the Growth Hormone Releasing Peptide 6 (GHRP-6, His-D-Trp-Ala-Trp-D-Phe-Lys-NH2). The latter is a hexapeptide that has affinity for two receptors, the Growth Hormone Secretagogue Receptor 1a (GHS-R1a) and the Cluster of Differenciation 36 (CD36) receptor. Selective binding to the CD36 receptor has therapeutic potential in the treatment of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Six azasulfurylpeptide analogs were synthesized on solid support by replacing tryptophan at the 4th position of GHRP-6 with different N-aminosulfamide residues (Chapter 4). The GHRP-6 analogs were tested for their ability to mediate the effects of receptor-specific ligands on the function and downstream signaling of the Toll-Like Receptor 2 (TLR2), in collaboration with Professor Huy Ong at the department of Pharmacology in the Faculty of Pharmacy at the Université de Montréal. The TLR2-TLR6 complex is known to be co-expressed and modulated by CD36. On binding to CD36, certain GHRP-6 ligands exhibited effects on the signaling of TLR2. For example, the azasulfurylpeptides [4-F-AsF4]- and [4-MeO-AsF4]-GHRP-6 prevented the overproduction of nitric oxide (NO), a reactive oxygen species formed following the induction of signal in macrophages on binding of TLR2-specific ligands, such as the Fibroblast-Stimulating Lipopeptide 1 (R-FSL-1) and lipoteichoic acid (LTA). Furthermore, the secretion of the Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha (TNFa) and Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein 1 (MCP-1), as well as the activation of the Nuclear Factor Kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB), all were reduced. These results offer promise for regulating Toll-like receptor roles in triggering innate immunity and inflammatory responses (Perspectives). Finally, the potential of the azasulfurylpeptides to inhibit metallo-bêta-lactamases, such as the New-Delhi Metallo-β-lactamase 1 (NDM-1), IMP-1 and the Verona Integron-encoded Metallo-bêta-lactamase 2 (VIM-2), has been studied in collaboration with Professor James Spencer at the University of Bristol (United-Kingdom). Some analogs were micromolar inhibitors of IMP-1 (Perspectives). These new approaches for the synthesis of azasulfurylpeptides in solution and on solid support should enable their use in studies of structure-activity relationships with different biologically active peptides. In addition to expanding the application of azasulfurylpeptides as enzyme inhibitors, this thesis has revealed the potential of these N-aminosulfamides to mimic the peptide secondary structures, such as gamma turns. Application of azasulfurylpeptides in this respect has been demonstrated by the synthesis of CD36 ligands exhibiting modulatory effects on the TLR2. Considering their effective synthesis and potential as inhibitors, azasulfurylpeptides should find broad use in peptide science for applications in medicine and chemical biology.

824	Design de nouvelles fonctionnelles en théorie de la fonctionnelle de la densité et conception de polymères pour application à la photovoltaïque organique	This thesis is about calculations using density functional theory (DFT) in order to simulate systems in which long range peoperties are important. Particular emphasis is put on excitation energies, especially in the context of applications in photovoltaics. These effects are adressed in two different ways. In the first place, well-established DFT tools are used to simulate systems of experimental interest. Secondly, DFT’s underlying theory will be explored, its limits will be identified and new theoretical developments will be suggested in reponse to them. For the first part of this thesis, numerical calculations using DFT and time- dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) as implemented in the Gaussian software system [1] are done with known functionals on molecules and polymers of experimental interest. In particular, the project presented in chapter 2 explores the use of lateral chains in order to optimize electronic properties of polymers which are already widely used in organic photovoltaics. The results obtained show that a judicious choice of lateral chains can allow good control of the electronic properties of these polymers and can make photovoltaic cells using these polymers more efficient. The project presented in chapter 3 uses TDDFT in order to explore the optical properties of two polymers, poly-3-hexyl-thiophene (P3HT) and poly- 3-hexyl-selenophene (P3HS) as well as a blend of these two polymers, in order to support experimental observations indicating an exciplex formation in the blend. The numerical calculations in the first part of this thesis allow us to make a few very interesting conclusions, however they also emphasize certain limitations of DFT and TDDFT when treating excited states, due to the approximate treatment of long-range Coulombic interactions. So, the second part of this thesis comes back to the theoretical foundations of DFT. To be more precise, in chapter 4, a series of functionals better modelizing long-range Coulombic interactions based on a non-local approach is elaborated. The functionals expand upon the weighted density approximation (WDA) and impose several exact conditions which should be satisfied by the exchange hole. These functionals are implemented in the Gaussian [1] software system and their performances are evaluated with tests on a series of atoms and molecules. The results obtained show that many of these functionals improve upon the WDA and they also provide some insight on the relative importance of satisfying each of the exact conditions.

825	When glaciers vanish : nature, power and moral order in the indian Himalayas	The dissertation presents an ethnographic study that examines knowledge as a situated practice in Ladakh, in the Indian Himalayas. It analyzes the sociocultural implications of two drivers of change at play in Ladakh: one is of socioeconomic origin and linked to the production of Ladakh as a border area, while the other is environmental and driven by climate change. Ladakh, which remained outside the scope of the bureaucratic state during the British colonial administration, found itself refashioned into a strategic border area following India’s independence and successive wars with Pakistan and China. Independence led to the partition of Indian into India and Pakistan in 1947; the dissertation examines the long-term, traumatic events of the partition in Ladakh, tracing connections to current perceptions of climate change. The independent Indian state has produced itself in the region through the taming of its mountains, primarily through infrastructure development and the co-optation of Ladakhi knowledge of the environment by the military apparatus. Far-reaching militarization has restructured Ladakh’s economy, consequently redefining household structure, contributing to village depopulation, displacing the centrality of agro-pastoralist activities and, as the dissertation argues, significantly altering the local population’s engagement with the environment. The increasing rationalization of the outlook on the environment today contributes to the fragmentation of links between the natural and human realms within the local cosmology and the abandonment of related ritual practices. Concurrently, the region is impacted by distinct effects of climate change, in particular glacier recession. The dissertation juxtaposes both the subjective experience of wide-ranging environmental changes and changes in everyday village life with historical facts, showing that local historical events influence perceptions of glacier recession and the depletion of natural resources. The analysis demonstrates that objective phenomena such as glacier recession are interpreted through local realities. Specifically, in the local worldview, a vanishing glacier is a trope for changes in the human condition. Yet, as the dissertation further argues, such cultural framing does not preclude the objectivity of natural history in local cosmology. Moreover, cultural framing and empirical experience, therefore, are shown to be essential to the vitality of local knowledge about the environment and to the performance of associated landscape practices.

826	La bioéthique et les conflits armés : la réflexion éthique des médecins militaires	The aim of this project is to study the ethical tensions that can be experienced by military physicians who must be, at the same time, healers, soldiers (even if they are non-combatants) and sometimes humanitarian actors. In the literature on the ethics of military medicine, potential ethical dilemmas are often presented as the result of pressures, real or perceived, from the military institution, rules, codes, laws or policies that divert physicians from their primary goal, i.e., the interest of the patient. To better understand the ethical challenges faced by Canadian military physicians and how these are dealt with, this project uses an empirical bioethics approach. Based on a literature review, I examine the ethical dilemmas of military physicians, the concept of profession, and Canadian codes of ethics (medical and military). The ethical experience is then explored through semi-structured interviews with 14 military physicians who participated in operational missions, particularly in Kandahar, Afghanistan between 2006 and 2010.  Both the conceptual and empirical results indicate that nuance is required. First, Canadian military physicians do not experience dilemmas as presented in the literature, in number or in frequency. They are aware that they must take into account both the patient’s interest and the common good but do not experience this as a sense of dual professional loyalty. In addition, they feel that they share the mission objective, which is to maintain the fighting force. Distinctions are also needed between physicians themselves, in the conception they have of their profession, and in the context (training or garrison) and the type of work they do (general practitioner or specialist). The main dilemmas reported concern inequalities in the provision of care between coalition soldiers and locals (soldiers and civilians) as well as the lack of resources that generate challenging clinical decisions. A surprising result of the interviews is the presence of two distinct groups in terms of professional identity. Eight military physicians saw themselves primarily as physicians, while the other six did not give priority to one or the other professions (military or medicine). These two groups differ in other dimensions, such as the number and type of identified ethical challenges and dilemma resolution mechanisms. Despite the ethical training courses offered by the military institution, gaps persist in the ability to identify ethical experiences, the values involved and the appropriate resolution mechanisms. Given the small sample size, these results are difficult to generalize. Nevertheless, these findings provide theoretical insights, highlighting the multidimensional nature of military medicine, and practical considerations, by enabling the identification of aspects to improve training and so facilitate ethical reflection on the part of military physicians.	professional ethics , military physicians , ethical dilemmas , codes of ethics , dual loyalty , empirical bioethics	en	12293.0
827	"Assessment of Tandem Mass Spectrometry and High Resolution Mass Spectrometry for the
Analysis of Bupivacaine in Plasma"	Triple quadrupole mass spectrometers coupled with high performance liquid chromatography are workhorses in quantitative bioanalyses. It provides substantial benefits including reproducibility, sensitivity and selectivity for trace analysis. Selected Reaction Monitoring allows targeted assay development but data sets generated contain very limited information. Data mining and analysis of non-targeted high-resolution mass spectrometry profiles of biological samples offer the opportunity to perform more exhaustive assessments, including quantitative and qualitative analysis. The objectives of this study was to test method precision and accuracy, statistically compare bupivacaine drug concentration in real study samples and verify if high resolution and accurate mass data collected in scan mode can actually permit retrospective data analysis, more specifically, extract metabolite related information. The precision and accuracy data presented using both instruments provided equivalent results. Overall, the accuracy was ranging from 106.2 to 113.2% and the precision observed was from 1.0 to 3.7%. Statistical comparisons using a linear regression between both methods reveal a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.9996 and a slope of 1.02 demonstrating a very strong correlation between both methods. Individual sample comparison showed differences from -4.5% to 1.6% well within the accepted analytical error. Moreover, post acquisition extracted ion chromatograms at m/z 233.1648 ± 5 ppm (M-56) and m/z 305.2224 ± 5 ppm (M+16) revealed the presence of desbutyl-bupivacaine and three distinct hydroxylated bupivacaine metabolites. Post acquisition analysis allowed us to produce semiquantitative evaluations of the concentration-time profiles for bupicavaine metabolites.

828	Le défi de l’intégration de l’approche par compétences lors de la sélection : conception d’un test de jugement situationnel ciblant le rôle CanMEDS de collaborateur pour la sélection au niveau postdoctoral en médecine	Background: Competency-based training is well integrated into postgraduate medical education. A competency-based selection system would also be desirable. Primary objective: To develop a situational judgment test (SJT) targeting the CanMEDS Collaborator Role for the admission process in internal medicine (IM) and family medicine (FM) postgraduate training programs. Methods: Interviews using the critical incident technique were conducted with IM and FM residents in order to create items for the SJT. Three experts revised the content of the items. CanMEDS Collaborator Role key competencies, context and type of team members involved were analysed for each item. Answer key was determined by a panel of experts composed of 11 IM and FM physicians using a rate response format. Five absolute and partial credit scoring methods were compared. Results: Seven interviews were completed. After revision, 33 items were kept in the SJT. CanMEDS Collaborator Role key competencies, contexts and team members involved were well distributed over the items. Mean experts’ scores ranged from 43.4% to 75.6% with the different scoring methods. Pearson’s correlation coefficients between the five scoring methods ranged between 0.80-0.98.  Conclusion: SJT targeting CanMEDS Framework Roles can help integrate competency-based selection into the postgraduate medical education admission process.

830	SAND, un protocole de chiffrement symétrique incompressible à structure simple	We developed a new symmetric-key algorithm that is highly secure. Our algorithm is SPN-like but with two main particularities. First of all, we use very large random incompressible s-boxes. The input size of our s-boxes vary between 256 Kb and 32 Gb.Secondly, for the permutation part of the algorithm, we use a set of random linear functions chosen uniformly and randomly between every possible fonctions. The input of these functions is all the bits of the block of messages to encode. Our system has a very simple structure that guarantees that there are no trap doors in it.   We will explain how our algorithm is resistant to the known attacks, such as linear and differential cryptanalysis. It is also resistant to any attack based on a bias of the s-boxes to a simple function.

831	Inhibition réversible et photomarquage de la transglutaminase tissulaire	Tissue transglutaminase is a calcium-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the formation of isopeptide bonds between the side chains of glutamine and lysine residues, thereby resulting in the crosslinking of proteins in biological systems. It plays a role, among others, in endocytosis, the regulation of cell growth, and even in apoptosis. However, a deregulation of the biological activity of this enzyme can result in various pathologies, such as cataract formation, amyloid plaque formation in Alzheimer’s disease, or the development of celiac disease. Therefore, a better understanding of the mechanism of action of this enzyme and the ability to regulate its action using inhibitors or substrates is necessary. In this context, a method of expression and purification of human transglutaminase has been developed, allowing one to work directly with the desired pharmacological target. In addition, a study of the mode of inhibition and binding mode of a reversible inhibitor class previously discovered in the group, the family of trans-cinnamoyl derivatives, revealed that the potency of these molecules is influenced by the presence of calcium and a time-dependent inhibition is observed, related to a putative slow conformational equilibrium of transglutaminase. On the other hand, the susceptibility of this class of molecules to nucleophilic attack by thiols greatly diminishes their pharmacological potential, and that is why a new family of molecules has been identified, based on a ynone skeleton, with a very promising IC50 value of 2.6 μM, making this molecule one of the best transglutaminase reversible inhibitors developed to date. Finally, a photolabelling strategy combined with a tandem mass spectrometry analysis has been developed for the discovery of the binding site of the lysine derivative substrate, in order to better understand the complex mechanism of this enzyme.

832	Étude de l’attribution de la responsabilité chez des adolescents auteurs d’agression sexuelle : facteurs explicatifs et prise en charge	This research is about blame attribution of 166 juvenile sex offenders between the age of 12 and 19. The first goal is to determine which psychological aspects (age, post-traumatic stress, cognitive distortions, self-esteem, alienation, immaturity) influence the 3 types of blame attribution (culpability, external attribution and internal attribution) as well as to determine the focus level of treatment. The results of the multiple regressions show two models. The model predicting culpability is only composed by post-traumatic stress. This model explains 26% (adjusted) of the culpability variance (R2=0,29, F(6,120)=8,35, p<0,01). The model predicting external attribution is composed by age and cognitive distortions. It explains 25% (adjusted) of variance (R2=0,28, F(6,122)=8,03, p<0,01). Internal attribution hasn’t shown a correlation with the studied variables. The second goal is to estimate the efficiency provided by different services to modify blame attribution according to the care environments, length of treatment and therapeutic approach in order to come up with the best set up. Thanks to ANOVAs, it was possible to find out that none of the modalities have an impact on blame attribution. This research has some limits, especially statistical power. For consideration of future studies, links between blame attribution and recidivism could be investigated.	Blame attribution , Juvenile , Sex offense , Treatment , Psychological factors	en	12261.0
833	Comprendre la mise en œuvre différenciée d'une politique publique : Le cas d'une politique de gouvernance au Québec	In 2001, the Québec government adopted its Politique de reconnaissance et de soutien à l'action communautaire. The implementation of this policy has led to contrasting results depending on the fields of intervention considered. We argue that the different implementation pathways of this policy are directly linked to the structuring of social actors in each field. Using two fields of intervention – the environment and advocacy – as case studies, we show the need to go beyond the usual explanations regarding the implementation of public policies which stress the importance of political actors and policy networks. Without neglecting the role of the latter, the different pathways in the implementation processes of this policy are also largely due to the autonomous action of social actors.		en	12257.0
834	Divided Over Internationalism : The Canadian Public and Development Assistance	This analysis of public opinion towards foreign aid shows that Canadians are divided over internationalism. First, while most citizens agree that development assistance is important, their support often remains shallow, unmatched by a commitment to undertake concrete actions. Second, the attitudes Canadians hold toward development assistance indicate that there is a clear division in the country’s public between liberal and conservative internationalists, a cleavage that is anchored in domestic ideological and partisan differences. In many ways comparable to what is found in other countries, the internationalism of Canadians does not appear as vigorous and as consensual as is often suggested.

835	The New Global Politics of Poverty	In recent years, governments, international institutions, and a broad array of social movements have converged around what an OECD report has described as an emerging “global anti-poverty consensus.” This new global social policy agenda has changed the terms of the debate between the left and the right, and redefined the world of policy possibilities, in global but also in domestic politics. This article proposes a constructivist interpretation of this multi-scale shift in discourse, and discusses the political and policy implications of the new global politics of poverty.

836	Mieux estimer la consommation de substances illicites dans une communauté ; comment allier analyses des eaux usées et données traditionnelles	The development of wastewater analysis for purposes of estimating the consumption of illegal substances in the past decade is a promising technological advance. However, the intrinsic shortcomings of this new approach highlight the relevance of an integration with traditional epidemiological data in order to be able to estimate accurately the extent of consumption in specific populations and to monitor it. The objective of this work was to include wastewater analysis with other related data  in order to compare them and determine which indicators, or which combination of indicators, provide the best estimate of illicit substances in Lausanne. To do so, two aspects were studied; the order of importance of substances and temporal trends reported by the various indicators. In terms of order of importance of substances, some consistency between wastewater analysis and data from the three different surveys seemed to be established. However, there appears to be little correlation between the police data and other indicators, with the police data seemingly reflecting policing priorities over real illicit drug consumption. Regarding temporal trends, indicators reported seasonal patterns and trends during special events (festival and major sport event) somewhat different from wastewater analysis. Finally, a concrete example involving cocaine allowed an eloquent integration done with prevalence data from surveys in the general population. This integration seems to show an average annual estimate of cocaine use in the wastewater more than seven times greater than what can be extrapolated from surveys.	illicit drugs , drug abuse , wastewater analysis , community consumption , epidemiological data , surveys , integration , forensic science	en	12234.0
837	Facteurs associés à l’alliance thérapeutique chez les patients ayant des troubles psychotiques	This internship report examines the factors associated in therapeutic alliance with patients with psychotic disorders. A literature review based on the factors related to therapeutic alliance and psychotic disorders was performed. Thereafter, a description of the training environment, le Centre d’Hébergement l’Entre-Toit, was performed. A presentation of the methodology used to carry out the five case studies precedes the presentation of the data and the analysis along with the interpretation of those aforementioned data. In the analysis, collected data points out that some dimensions seem to play a role of moderate importance in the creation and maintenance of a therapeutic alliance. On the other hand, some dimensions studied did not provide conclusive results. In addition, it turns out that factors associated with therapeutic alliance do not seem to have the same impact for all persons with psychotic disorders. Based on the results, recommendations are formulated to guide professionals working with clients who have psychotic disorders. These recommendations emphasize important elements in order to achieve the maximum efficiency level of therapeutic alliance between the client and the counsellor. The aim of a better therapeutic alliance is part of an effort to increase treatment adherence and reduce risk of relapse and the risk to commit a violent act .	comportements violents , therapeutic alliance , psychotic disorders , compliance , violent behavior , forensic psychiatry , working alliance	en	12228.0
838	Correlates of protective immunity against hepatitis C virus	Hepatitis C virus (HCV) currently infects ~185 million individuals worldwide. Despite the development of new effective antivirals against HCV, it is estimated that two million new infections occur annually, especially among marginalized populations and in developing countries. As with many chronic viral infections, the development of an effective prophylactic vaccine is hampered by the limited knowledge of determinants of a protective immune response in humans upon natural exposure to the virus. HCV represents a unique model to study protective immunity in chronic viruses, since ~30% of the patients are able to clear the primary infection spontaneously. In this thesis, we proceeded to study protective immunity against HCV in cohorts of injection drug users (IDUs) who are continuously at risk of infection and reinfection by HCV. We hypothesized that the majority of spontaneous resolvers of a primary HCV infection are protected against chronicity of infection upon re-exposure. Protective immunity would likely be associated with the highest breadth, frequency and functional avidity of HCV-specific polyfunctional CD4 and CD8 memory T cells. The protective capacity of memory T cells upon infection with novel HCV variants will depend on the diversity and flexibility of the T cell repertoire that can recognize these viral variants and/or the capacity to generate de novo T cell responses specific for these variants.  The first aim of the project was to define and dissect correlates of protective immunity conferred by HCV-specific T cells in reinfected individuals. Our results showed that protection from chronicity upon reinfection was associated with an increased magnitude and breadth of the HCV-specific polyfunctional CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses, as well as the appearance of a CD127lo tetramer+ CD8+ effector T-cell population at the peak of the response. Individuals who developed persistent viremia upon HCV reinfection demonstrated very limited or no expansion of HCV-specific T cells. Sequencing of the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes targeted by the memory immune response in unprotected individuals revealed that the sequence of the autologous reinfecting virus was different from the reference sequence used in our immunological assays.  The second aim was to analyse the dynamics of the T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire of HCV-specific CD8 T-cells in protected versus unprotected patients and in relation to infection with variant viral sequences. Our results demonstrate that for epitope-specific CD8 T cells a more focused TCR-repertoire of distinct clonotypes was associated with protection. These T-cell populations showed higher functional avidity and polyfunctionality compared to their counterparts in non-protected patients. The clonotypes forming the effector T-cell population during reinfection were recruited from the memory pool, rather being de novo responses generated from the naïve pool. In conclusion, our results suggest that protection from persistence upon HCV reinfection is associated with an enhanced magnitude, breadth and quality of the HCV-specific T-cell response, as well as a more focused TCR-repertoire of distinct clonotypes with high functional avidity. The degree of homology between viral strains causing the consecutive episodes of infection is a critical determinant for protection. These findings provide a first insight into the correlates of protective immunity against HCV and have important implications for the rational design of effective prophylactic vaccines against HCV and other chronic viruses.

839	Les potentielles sources d’erreurs au niveau des preuves d’ordre scientifique	Several causes can be listed to explain a miscarriage of justice. The present work focuses on the mistakes made in the scientific expertise admitted in court. For the literature review, we present an overview of the various errors that can occur throughout the legal process; from of the crime scene to the presentation of scientific evidence in court. Secondly, the analysis is based on actual cases where several convicts were acquitted following the discovery of errors made by a forensic pathologist. The latter made serious mistakes during the autopsy, in his analyzes and his testimony. We focus on how medical expertise is presented by the expert, on the way the value of the scientific evidence is ruled and also how the lawyers deal with this scientific expertise. We find that many errors could have been avoided by using a probabilistic approach. Some responsibility also goes to criminal justice system players who must be vigilant towards the scientific evidence and not see it as an absolute truth.

840	In vivo effect of deoxynivalenol (DON) naturally contaminated feed on porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection	Deoxynivalenol (DON), also known as vomitoxin, is the most prevalent type B trichothecene mycotoxin worldwide. Pigs show a great sensitivity to DON, and because of the high proportion of grains in their diets, they are frequently exposed to this mycotoxin. The objective of this study was to determine the impact of DON naturally contaminated feed on porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection, the most important porcine viral pathogen in swine. Experimental infections were performed with 30 animals. Piglets were randomly divided into three groups of 10 animals based on DON content of diets (0, 2.5 and 3.5 mg/kg DON). All experimental groups were further divided into subgroups of 6 pigs and were inoculated with PRRSV. The remaining pigs (control) were sham-inoculated with PBS. Pigs were daily monitored for temperature, weight and clinical signs for 21 days. Blood samples were collected and tested for PRRSV RNA and for virus specific antibodies. Results of PRRSV infection showed that ingestion of diet highly contaminated with DON greatly increases the effect of PRRSV infection on weight gain, lung lesions and mortality, without increasing significantly viral replication, for which the tendency is rather directed toward a decrease of replication. These results suggest that PRRSV infection could exacerbate anorectic effect of DON, when ingested in large doses. Results also demonstrate a DON negative effect on PRRSV-specific humoral responses. This study demonstrate that high concentrations of DON naturally contaminated feed decreased the immune response against PRRSV and influenced the course of PRRSV infection in pigs.

841	Identification of a novel herpesvirus associated with a penile proliferative lesion in a beluga (Delphinapterus leucas)	The carcass of an adult male beluga (Delphinapterus leucas) was found beach cast in 2008 on the shore of the St. Lawrence Estuary at Rivière-Ouelle, Quebec, Canada. The carcass was transported to the Faculté de médecine vétérinaire of the Université de Montréal for postmortem examination. Aspiration pneumonia was the probable cause of death. Necropsy revealed a focal papilloma-like penile lesion, characterized by focal mucosal thickening with disorganization of the epithelial layers and lymphoplasmacytic infiltration. A pan-herpesvirus nested PCR assay on frozen tissue from the penile lesion was positive. The PCR product sequencing revealed a partial herpesvirus DNA polymerase (DPOL) gene sequence of 600 nucleotides. Its nearest nucleotide identity was with the partial DPOL gene of an alphaherpesvirus, bovine herpesvirus 5 (79.5% identity). It also shared high identity with several other marine mammal herpesviruses (50.2 to 77.3% identity). This new herpesvirus was tentatively named beluga whale herpesvirus (BWHV). Virus isolation was unsuccessful. The pathogenic potential of BWHV is unknown, but the evaluation of archived tissues suggests that the virus is endemic in the St. Lawrence Estuary beluga population.

842	Anatomic and molecular characterization of the 1 endocrine pancreas of a teleostean fish: Atlantic wolffish (Anarhichas lupus)	Background: The biologic attributes of the endocrine pancreas and the comparative endocrinology of islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) of fish are not well described in the literature. This study describes the endocrine pancreas of one teleostean fish. Ten captive Atlantic wolffish (Anarhichas lupus) from the Montreal Biodome were submitted for necropsy and their pancreata were collected. Results: Grossly, all the fish pancreata examined contained 1-3 nodules of variable diameter (1-8 mm). Microscopically, the nodules were uniform, highly cellular, and composed of polygonal to elongated cells. Immunofluorescence for pancreatic hormones was performed. The nodules were immunoreactive for insulin most prominent centrally, but with IAPP and glucagon only in the periphery of the nodules. Exocrine pancreas was positive for chromogranin A. Not previously recognized in fish, IAPP immunoreactivity occurred in α, glucagon-containing, cells and did not co-localize with insulin in β cells. The islet tissues were devoid of amyloid deposits. IAPP DNA sequencing was performed to compare the sequence among teleost fish and the potency to form amyloid fibrils. In silico analysis of the amino acid sequences 19-34 revealed that it was not amyloidogenic. Conclusions: Amyloidosis of pancreatic islets would not be expected as a spontaneous disease in the Atlantic wolffish. Our study underlines that this teleost fish is a potential candidate for pancreatic xenograft research.

844	"Treating delusional disorder : a comparison of cognitive-behavioural therapy and
attention placebo control"	Objective: Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) has proved effective in treating delusions, both in schizophrenia and delusional disorder (DD). Clinical trials of DD have mostly compared CBT with either treatment as usual, no treatment, or a wait-list control. This current study aimed to assess patients with DD who received CBT, compared with an attention placebo control (APC) group. Method: Twenty-four individuals with DD were randomly allocated into either CBT or APC groups for a 24-week treatment period. Patients were diagnosed on the basis of structured clinical interviews for mental disorders and the Maudsley Assessment of Delusion Schedule (MADS). Results: Completers in both groups (n = 11 for CBT; n = 6 for APC) showed clinical improvement on the MADS dimensions of Strength of Conviction, Insight, Preoccupation, Systematization, Affect Relating to Belief, Belief Maintenance Factors, and Idiosyncrasy of Belief. Conclusion: When compared with APC, CBT produced more impact on the MADS dimensions for Affect Relating to Belief, Strength of Conviction, and Positive Actions on Beliefs.

845	Effets de l’utilisation d’un chien d’assistance sur les efforts aux membres supérieurs lors de la montée d’une pente en fauteuil roulant chez les individus ayant une lésion médullaire	Problematic. The use of a mobility assistance dog (ADMob) represents an innovative option to preserve upper limb (U/Ls) integrity in manual wheelchair (MWC) user population. No biomechanical studies have quantified the effects of ADMob on U/Ls efforts when climbing an incline. Objective. This quasi-experimental study compares the U/Ls efforts when climbing an incline with and without the assistance of an ADMob for MWC traction. Methodology. Ten participants with spinal cord injury (SCI) using a MWC and owning an ADMob climbed an incline 3 times with and without the use of an ADMob. The forces applied to the handrims, captured with instrumented wheel and movements of the MWC and the U/Ls, recorded with a three-dimensional motion analysis system, were used to measure the U/Ls mechanical efforts. Simultaneously, the electromyographic (EMG) activity of the pectoralis major muscle, anterior deltoid, biceps and triceps were recorded during the tasks and normalized with its maximum value to measure the U/Ls muscular efforts. Results. Typically, ADMob significantly reduces the mean and peak values of the total force applied to the rings and the tangential component, the mean and peak values of flexion, internal rotation and adduction net joint moments at the shoulder and the mean and peak values of muscular utilization ratio of anterior deltoid, pectoralis major, biceps and triceps. Conclusion. The assistance of an ADMob for MWC traction when climbing an incline reduces the effort to U/Ls among MWC users with a SCI.

846	"Dynamic magnetic resonance spectroscopy of phosphate energetics during muscle
exercise and recovery"	Entailing of phosphorus exchanges in most bio-chemicals as a key factor in disease, increases researcher’s interest to develop the technologies capable of detecting this metabolite. Phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy is able to detect key metabolites in a non-invasive manner. Particularly, it offers the ability to measure the dynamic rate of phosphocreatine(PCr) degeneration through the exercise and recovery. This metric as a valid indication of mitochondrial oxidative metabolism in muscle, differentiate between normal and pathological state. To do magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy, clinical research tools provide a wide variety of anatomical and functional contrasts, however they are typically restricted to the tissues containing water or hydrogen atoms and they are still blind to the biochemicals of other atoms of interests. Through this project we intended to obtain the phosphorus spectrum in human body – specificadenerativelly in muscle – using 31P spectroscopy. To do so a double loop RF surface coil, tuned to phosphorus frequency, is designed and fabricated using bench work facilities and then validated through in vitro spectroscopy using 3 Tesla Siemens scanner. We acquired in vitro as well as in vivo phosphorus spectrum in a 100 mM potassium phosphate phantom and human calf muscle in rest-exercise-recovery phase in a 3T MR scanner. The spectrum demonstrates the main constituent in high-energy phosphate metabolism. We also observed the dynamic variation of PCr for five young healthy subjects who performed planter flexions using resistance band during exercise and recovery. The took steps in this project pave the way for future application of spectroscopic quantification of phosphate metabolism in patients affected by carotid artery disease as well as in age-matched control subjects.

847	Développement de la sensibilité des neurones du collicule supérieur à la durée de la stimulation auditive	In many species, duration-sensitive neurons which could possibly analyse species-specific vocalizations are encountered in the inferior colliculus. However, their postnatal development is unknown. Since the superior colliculus is one of the most important subcortical relay implicated in the audiovisual integration, we sought to gain insight on whether the SC of the rat contains such neurons and, if so, whether they are sensitive and selective to duration. Furthermore, the originality of this study is to determine their fonctional maturation. Extracellular single-unit recordings were assessed in the deep layers of the superior colliculus of anesthetized rats throughout postnatal days (P15 – P18, P21 – P24, P27 – P30) and at adulthood. Gaussian noises of different durations (3-100 ms) were presented in free-field in pseudo-random order (2 – 10 dB SPL above threshold). Only few neurons are band-pass: about 3 – 9% across the different age groups (P15 – P30) and 20 % in adults. Thus, in terms of categories of duration-sensitive neurons profiles, a significant difference was evident across postnatal development: long-pass (63-75%) neurons were mostly encountered in the different groups of pups relative to all-pass (43%) in adult rats. These results demonstrate that a large population of neurons in the superior colliculus of the rat is sensitive to noise durations and that important development changes occur during postnatal maturation.

848	A longitudinal study of overweight during childhood :  etiology, mental health outcomes and mediating factors	Child overweight and obesity has challenged the field of public health for several decades. While its direct underpinnings may be physiological, its development and outcome are intertwined with an array of psychosocial factors. This dissertation has sought to answer questions relating to the perinatal and early life risk factors associated with overweight development, as well as its potential psychological correlates during middle childhood and early adolescence.   Specifically, this project had three research goals:  1) To model the developmental pattern of BMI or weight status throughout childhood and estimate population heterogeneity.  2) To identify the perinatal and early childhood risk factors that may increase the likelihood that a child follows a path leading to overweight by adolescence. 3) To examine whether being overweight in middle childhood is associated with internalizing mental health symptoms in early adolescence, and whether such an association is mediated by the experience of peer victimization and body dissatisfaction.  This work takes a developmental life-course perspective in that it considers both the accumulation of risk factors over time as well as risk factors occurring during critical periods of development.1,2 We examined data drawn from the Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child Development (QLSCD), a population-based birth-cohort study in the province of Quebec, Canada. The initial sample consisted of 2120 families with a 5-month old baby born in Quebec in 1997. These families were monitored yearly or biennially until children were 13 years of age.  For our first research goal, we modeled group-based developmental trajectories of child BMI and child weight status (overweight vs. not overweight). For our second goal, multinomial logistic regression analyses were conducted in order to identify the perinatal and early risk factors associated with the different developmental groups of weight status. Putative risk factors were chosen from the literature and represent the perinatal environment, child behavioral characteristics, as well as the family home environment. These were analyzed longitudinally when possible, and factors that could be targeted for intervention, such as maternal smoking during pregnancy, child sleep times or television viewing were selected for analysis.    In order to complete our third research goal, we examined the longitudinal associations (from age 6 to 12) between BMI z-score (CDC 2000 reference) and internalizing and externalizing problems by way of cross-lag panel models in the Mplus program.  Our results indicating sparse cross-lagged links, we then examined whether peer victimization and body dissatisfaction during childhood mediate the association between early overweight development and self-reported internalizing symptoms in early adolescence.   Important scientific contributions stemming from this project include the identification of distinct weight status trajectories during childhood (i.e. early onset, late onset, never overweight) and the identification of perinatal and early life risk factors and mental health outcomes that may differ depending on a child’s developmental trajectory. Additionally, we identified two important mechanisms of the association between overweight and internalizing problems: peer victimization and low body satisfaction.

849	La collaboration interprofessionnelle au sein de communautés de pratique œuvrant auprès de patients atteints de maladies chroniques : synthèse des expériences rapportées dans la littérature	Today’s health system is increasingly complex due to the growth of chronic illnesses. The anticipated increase in the prevalence of chronic illnesses means there is an urgent need for a different type of organization and approach to providing services to the patient. This adjustment in health care delivery calls for a paradigm shift based on inter-professional collaboration and openness to uncertainty, which will in turn facilitate knowledge sharing. In this regard, communities of Practice (CoP) appear to be a way to facilitate the development of inter-professional collaboration and the sharing of knowledge, and therefore merit further investigation in order to determine whether or not they can foster such collaboration and facilitate the co-construction of knowledge leading to an evolving practice that is patient oriented and adapted to complexity. Our research is consistent with this view and is driven by an interest in the interprofessional collaboration experiences, as reported in litterature, that have taken place as part of communities of practice and have centred on patients suffering from chronic illnesses.   In order to achieve this, we first developed a conceptual framework with the aim of identifying the theoretical and conceptual foundations of communities of practice. This has led us to 1) analyze the evolution of the concept of communities of practice in the major works of Wenger and of his collaborators; 2) position communities of practice by comparing them to other forms of collaborative work with which they are frequently associated and even substituted or mistaken for in the literature (such as community, learning community, learning organization, epistemic community); 3) compare the concept of collaboration with other similar concepts (including collaboration), as well as the notions of interdisciplinarity and inter-professionalism often associated with communities of practice; 4) support the cognitive and collaborative dimensions inherent to communitied of practice; and 5) identify the advances and limitations attributed to the implementation of the concept of communities of practice in the health field. Metasynthesis (Beaucher et Jutras, 2007) ), as part of a ‘‘comprehensive interpretative’’ approach, was determined to be the most appropriate research method for understanding the experiences of interprofessional collaboration as part of communities of Practice in the health field.. Metasynthesis provided us with an overview of the literature on the subject of CoP in the health field and allowed us to create a topology of the 194 collected articles. This overview led to the selection of 13 articles describing real experiences of CoPs. As such, in terms of contribution, this metasynthesis enabled us to 1) identify the reported conceptual vagueness associated with the implementation of CoPs; 2) identify the benefits and challenges of their implementation in the field of health; and 3) demonstrate that further research on the development process of communities of practice in the field of care practice, including but not limited to situations involving chronic illnesses, is necessary.

850	Development and plasticity of locomotor circuits in the zebrafish spinal cord	A fundamental goal in neurobiology is to understand the development and organization of neural circuits that drive behavior. In the embryonic spinal cord, the first motor activity is a slow coiling of the trunk that is sensory-independent and therefore appears to be centrally driven. Embryos later become responsive to sensory stimuli and eventually locomote, behaviors that are shaped by the integration of central patterns and sensory feedback. In this thesis I used a simple vertebrate model, the zebrafish, to investigate in three manners how developing spinal networks control these earliest locomotor behaviors. For the first part of this thesis, I characterized the rapid transition of the spinal cord from a purely electrical circuit to a hybrid network that relies on both chemical and electrical synapses. Using genetics, lesions and pharmacology we identified a transient embryonic behavior preceding swimming, termed double coiling. I used electrophysiology to reveal that spinal motoneurons had glutamate-dependent activity patterns that correlated with double coiling as did a population of descending ipsilateral glutamatergic interneurons that also innervated motoneurons at this time. This work (Knogler et al., Journal of Neuroscience, 2014) suggests that double coiling is a discrete step in the transition of the motor network from an electrically coupled circuit that can only produce simple coils to a spinal network driven by descending chemical neurotransmission that can generate more complex behaviors. In the second part of my thesis, I studied how spinal networks filter sensory information during self-generated movement. In the zebrafish embryo, mechanosensitive sensory neurons fire in response to light touch and excite downstream commissural glutamatergic interneurons to produce a flexion response, but spontaneous coiling does not trigger this reflex. I performed electrophysiological recordings to show that these interneurons received glycinergic inputs during spontaneous fictive coiling that prevented them from firing action potentials. Glycinergic inhibition specifically of these interneurons and not other spinal neurons was due to the expression of a unique glycine receptor subtype that enhanced the inhibitory current. This work (Knogler & Drapeau, Frontiers in Neural Circuits, 2014) suggests that glycinergic signaling onto sensory interneurons acts as a corollary discharge signal for reflex inhibition during movement. v In the final part of my thesis I describe work begun during my masters and completed during my doctoral degree studying how homeostatic plasticity is expressed in vivo at central synapses following chronic changes in network activity. I performed whole-cell recordings from spinal motoneurons to show that excitatory synaptic strength scaled up in response to decreased network activity, in accordance with previous in vitro studies. At the network level, I showed that homeostatic plasticity mechanisms were not necessary to maintain the timing of spinal circuits driving behavior, which appeared to be hardwired in the developing zebrafish. This study (Knogler et al., Journal of Neuroscience, 2010) provided for the first time important in vivo results showing that synaptic patterning is less plastic than synaptic strength during development in the intact animal. In conclusion, the findings presented in this thesis contribute widely to our understanding of the neural circuits underlying simple motor behaviors in the vertebrate spinal cord.

851	Activité physique et insatisfaction de l'image corporelle chez un groupe d'adolescentes	Body image dissatisfaction (BID) is common among adolescent girls and is associated with the development of various psychological disorders. Physical activity (PA) is correlated with several psychological benefits and appears to be a promising variable that could change the BID. However, research findings show contradictory links between PA practice and BID during adolescence. The main objective of this study is to measure the relationship between PA and BID in teenage girls, aged between 12 and 19 (n=173), from Montreal. The secondary objective is to test the potential moderating effect of the reasons which underlie the practice of the PA on this relationship. Variables such as age, ethnicity and body mass index were controlled. The results suggest an absence of association between the duration of physical activity and the level of BID obtained by two instruments (Body Shape Questionnaire and body dissatisfaction scale of Eating Disorder Inventory-2; EDI-2). The relationship between duration of physical activity and the BID score on the EDI-2 is, however, moderated by one of the reasons underlying the practice of physical activity. For teenagers who engage in PA to lose weight, a higher level of PA is linked to a higher level of BID. We found no relationship between teenagers who do not engage in PA for this reason. This study highlights the importance of considering the reasons underlying the practice of PA when the link between the duration of physical activity and the BID is examined.	adolescence , clinical psychology , body image dissatisfaction , physical activity	en	12078.0
852	How do social interactions with a significant other affect PTSD symptoms? An empirical investigation with a clinical sample	Social support and coping are both related to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, but the mechanisms underlying their relationships remain unclear. This study explores these relationships by examining the perceived frequency of supportive and countersupportive interactions with a significant other in PTSD patients. Ninety-six participants with PTSD were recruited and completed questionnaires assessing social interactions, ways of coping, and PTSD symptoms. Associations of social interactions (r2 = 4.1%–7.9%, p < .05) and coping (r2 = 15.9%– 16.5%, p < .001) with symptoms were independent, and suggested a direct association between social interactions and PTSD. Countersupportive interactions were more associated to symptoms than supportive interactions. Our findings suggest the development of psychotherapies that integrate social support interventions.

853	Objective neuropsychological deficits in post-traumatic stress disorder and mild traumatic brain injury: what remains beyond symptom similarity?	This exploratory study intends to characterize the neuropsychological profile in persons with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) using objective measures of cognitive performance. A neuropsychological battery of tests for attention, memory and executive functions was administered to four groups: PTSD (n = 25), mTBI (n = 19), subjects with two formal diagnoses: Post-traumatic Stress Disorder and Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI/PTSD) (n = 6) and controls (n = 25). Confounding variables, such as medical, developmental or neurological antecedents, were controlled and measures of co-morbid conditions, such as depression and anxiety, were considered. The PTSD and mTBI/PTSD groups reported more anxiety and depressive symptoms. They also presented more cognitive deficits than the mTBI group. Since the two PTSD groups differ in severity of PTSD symptoms but not in severity of depression and anxiety symptoms, the PTSD condition could not be considered as the unique factor affecting the results. The findings underline the importance of controlling for confounding medical and psychological co-morbidities in the evaluation and treatment of PTSD populations, especially when a concomitant mTBI is also suspected.

854	Asymmetric cell division intersects with cell geometry : a method to extrapolate and quantify geometrical parameters of sensory organ precursors	Asymmetric cell division (ACD) consists in a cellular division during which specific cell fate determinants are distributed preferentially in one daughter cell, which then differentiate from its sibling. Hence, ACD is important to generate cell diversity and is used to regulate stem cells homeostasis. For proper asymmetric distribution of cell fate determinants, the positioning of the mitotic spindle has to be tightly controlled. Frequently, this induces a cell size asymmetry, since the spindle is then not centered during mitosis, leading to an asymmetric positioning of the cleavage furrow.   Although small small GTPases have been shown to act directly on the spindle, the exact mechanism controlling spindle positioning during ACD is not understood. Recent studies suggest that an independent, yet uncharacterized pathway is involved in spindle positioning, which is likely to involve an asymmetric regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Indeed, actin enables spindle anchoring to the cortex. Hence we hypothesize that asymmetric actin contractions during cytokinesis might displace the mitotic spindle and the cleavage furrow, leading to cell size asymmetry. Interestingly, from our preliminary results we observed that cortical blebbing, which is a read-out of cortical tension/contraction, preferentially occurs on the anterior side of the dividing sensory organ precursor (SOP) cells at telophase.  Our preliminary data support the idea that Rho small GTPases might be implicated in regulation of the mitotic spindle hence controlling asymmetric cell division of SOP cells. The experimental settings developed for this thesis, for studying regulation of the mitotic spindle orientation and positioning will serve as proof of concept of how geneticist and biochemist experts could design ways to control such process by different means in cancerous cells.  The preliminary results from this project open novel insights on how the Rho small GTPases might be implicated in controlling asymmetric cell division hence their dynamics in vivo of such process during SOP development. Furthermore, the assays and the theoretical model developed in this study can be used as background that could serve to design improved quantitative experimental methods for cell biology synchronizing sub-networks of ACD mechanism.

855	Le travail sociologique en contexte révolutionnaire : l’ambiguïté entre science et politique dans la vie et l’oeuvre de Pitirim A. Sorokin en Russie	Pitirim Aleksandrovich Sorokin is one of the greatest American sociologists of the XXth century. His contributions to sociology are not only numerous but, more importantly, diversified. The majority of his writings have been translated and most of the languages of the world have at least access to one of his books. Nonetheless, in the Western world, his career before his emigration to the United-States has been neglected for a long time, because his critics were mostly interested in his writings post-Russia. Furthermore, very few French writings exist on this classic of American sociology. Solving this situation, this memoir revisit the life and work of Sorokin in Russia and presents to contemporary readers the eclipsed part of his career. More to the point, this research focuses on the Russian career of Pitirim A. Sorokin from a biographical and sociological point of view. The question at the center of it is as follow : How can one explain the sociological production of Pitirim A. Sorokin in Russia? In the first part, his biography from 1889 to 1923 will be presented. The objective is to describe the development of his ''habitus'' and the diverse positions that he occupied. The second part summarizes the researches produced by the sociologist before his exile and explain his scientific positions.	Pitirim A.

856	"Auto-reflexividad, erografía y leitmotivs liminales en la producción narrativa de Mayra
Santos-Febres (1995-2009)"	For a long time, the construction and revision of national identity constituted the driving forces of literary and intellectual production in Puerto Rico. Around the mid 90s, however, a new consensus emerges among writers, which on a massive scale claims the end of literature as a space for forging national consciousness and rejects the intellectual leadership that had defined literary work until that time. At this point, emerging writers lose interest in nationalism as a literary theme. Political militancy and the desire for confrontation, representational modes that were typical of the previous generation, collapse to give way to exploratory writing, centered on its own processes, and apparently apolitical. This loss of territorial markers explains the heightened perception that those writers have of the complex cultural dynamics that govern the postmodern and globalized world, and of the “value” and “marginal” position that is attributed to them in the current mass-media cultural ecology.   The narrative production of Mayra Santos-Febres is paradigmatic of these changes. I approach a series of meta-literary, self-reflexive, “erographic,” and historiographical devices in her writing, which, although they resist homogeneous categorization, share a concern for interstitial phenomena. Basing myself on the concepts of liminality, primarily from the perspective of Victor Turner, and of self-reflexive writing (Patricia Waugh, Linda Hutcheon), I analyse the liminal positioning that Santos-Febres adopts within the globalized cultural structure and the way in which her stance is equally liminal. In other words, her speech and commitment become a narcissistic approach to the practice of writing both in terms of the forms that it creates and with regard to semantics, narrative, and discourse.  The first chapter analyses the stories, “Dilcia M.” and “Acto de Fe” (Pez de vidrio), as testimonies of the erosion of earlier forms of patriotism and feminist militancy; “La escritora” (Pez de vidrio), which for the author marks a transition toward an aesthetic centred on her own creative processes; and the novel Cualquier miércoles soy tuya, which dramatizes the stance adopted by writers in the current globalized cultural chain. The second chapter deals with the configuration of bodies, urban spaces, and writing in El cuerpo correcto, which, through a sexual/textual exuberance, project updated versions of the traditional body/writing binary. The third chapter focuses on the configuration of the transvestite in Sirena Selena vestida de pena and suggests viewing transvestism, the bolero, and writing as a triple meta-literary practice. The final chapter deals with the literary re-signification of the “sedimented” images of subordinated “black” subjects. Nuestra Señora de la Noche focuses on the re-signification of hyper-sexualization and exoticization, which cemented the construction of black women’s “immorality”. Fe en disfraz discusses sadomasochism as a space of re-signification of the dominant/submissive configuration inscribed in Puerto Rican slave history, and of the trauma that originates and survives in this hierarchy.

857	Social movements and environmentalism, a Luhmannian view	Since the fifties sociology has been concerned with the phenomenon of social movements. Various theories tried to explain them. From collective behaviour to resource mobilization, through political processes and framing perspective all the way to the theory of new social movements, sociology found ways to explain these phenomena. Although all these perspectives cover and capture important facets and angles of collective action, they do so in disparate ways, looking at one side and neglecting the other. The differences between the perspectives come, on the one hand, from a change in the social, historical and scientific contexts, and on the other hand from the fact that the various approaches don’t ask the same questions, even though some questions overlap. Asking different questions leads to looking at different things. Thus, it is not only a matter of giving a different answer to the same question, but also a matter of looking at the same object of study from a different angle.  This situation resides at the root of the first part of my main thesis: the field of social movement theory is not sufficient nor integrated enough to explain collective action and we need a more comprehensive theory in order to obtain a better understanding of movements and the way in which they fulfill their role of promoters of change in society. Hence, I consider that we need a theory that is able to look at all facets of the movements at the same time and furthermore, is able to look beyond the form of the object in order to focus on the object itself. This brings me to the second part of the argument, which is the claim that the general systems theory as formulated by Niklas Luhmann can contribute to a better understanding of collective action. It is a comprehensive theory that can supplement the field of social movement theory by providing us with the necessary tools to look dynamically at social movements and understand them within the shifting social context. An analysis of environmentalism will be used to show how the tools provided by this communication theory help us to better understand not only social movements but also the context in which they function, how they fulfill their role, how they are changed and in turn change society as well.

858	Les relations franco-japonaises de 1859 à 1895	The history of Franco-Japanese relations is a source of surprise to many historians, both countries having a few reason to become closer. France's Second Empire is one of the first powers to go to Japan and quickly showed a keen interest in the development of Japan. From the first treaties signed in 1859, the French presence grows to reach the top a few years later. Despite the regimes changes in Japan and France, this presence has remained strong until the early 1880s before declining.  What explains this interest? And most importantly, what explains the lack of interest in France after the 1880s? There are only a few authors who have attempted to find an answer, and their results are, in our view, inconclusive: either France acts to increase its prestige, or it acts according to its representatives.  We try in this paper to identify and, if possible, to find other causes explaining the French position in Japan. Would it be the trade of some resources that motivated France to go to Japan, partly because of the crisis of the silkworm? Could it be the religion with the whole issue of persecution of Christians? Or is it a larger issue related to the colonization of Indochina?  To answer this question, we have studied the archives of the French government and the economic data of the time, to identify the importance that had certain reasons, such as the crisis of silk, religious persecution and French presence in Indochina, in the decisions of the French government.

859	La figure de l’auteur comme producteur : littérature et connaissance chez Walter Benjamin, Georg Lukács et Theodor W. Adorno	This memoir examine the problem of what philosophers such as Georg Lukács and Walter Benjamin call the truth content of literary works. My purpose is to show how such a truth content be sought neither in the extra-literary reality of which literature seems to be a representation, in the authorial intention imposed from without, nor in the work’s reception by its reading public, but directly in the sphere of its production. From a comparative reading of the different positions held in the 1930s debate between Georg Lukács, Walter Benjamin, Bertolt Brecht and Ernst Bloch, literary production is defined as a phenomenon by which the mind, through its objectivation, transcends the reality in which it inscribes itself. On this basis, literature appears as a process in which the epistemological relation between subject and object is apprehended in a way that is irreducible to other forms of knowledge.

860	Rôle essentiel des cellules dendritiques dans l'immunité innée face a des streptocoques encapsulés	Group B Streptococcus (GBS) and Streptococcus suis are two encapsulated pathogens that induce similar pathologies, including septicemia and meningitis in animals and/or humans. Serotypes III and V of GBS and serotypes 2 and 14 of S. suis  (evaluated in this study) are the most prevalent and/or virulent types. The capsular polysaccharide (CPS) defines the serotype and is considered as a key virulence factor for both bacterial species.  Although several studies have addressed the interactions of these streptococci and various cells of the innate immune system, no information is available on the regulation of the immune response against these pathogens by dendritic cells (DCs), and their interactions with other cells, including natural killer (NK) cells. In this study, different approaches (in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo) in mice were developed to characterize the interactions between DCs, NK cells and GBS or S. suis. Non-encapsulated mutants were used to evaluate the importance of the CPS in these interactions.  In vitro results with GBS- or S. suis-infected DCs showed that these two pathogens differently interact with these cells. GBS is largely internalized by DCs through multiple endocytosis mechanisms, mainly involving lipid rafts and clathrin. The use of a specific endocytosis pathway might help GBS to survive intracellularly. In contrast, S. suis is poorly internalized and, if the case, rapidly eliminated within the DCs. GBS and S. suis activate DCs through different receptors leading to the release of cytokines and chemokines and increased expression of co-stimulatory molecules. This activation allows the production of IFN- by NK cells. Yet, S. suis capacity to activate DCs and NK cells is lower than that observed for GBS. IFN- release in response to bacterial stimulation was mainly mediated by direct DC-NK cell contact and only partially dependant on soluble factors. In addition, our in vivo results showed that these two streptococcal species rapidly induce the release of IFN- by NK cells during the acute phase of the infection. This suggests that the DC-NK crosstalk might play a role in the development of a T helper 1 (Th1) response. Yet, S. suis capacity to activate the in vivo immune response was also lower than that observed for GBS. In fact, GBS and S. suis CPSs play different roles in this response. S. suis CPS prevents optimal activation of DCs and NK cells whereas it is the opposite for GBS, independently of the serotype tested.   In summary, this study addresses for the first time the contribution of DCs and NK cells to the innate immune response against GBS and S. suis infections, and by extension, to the development of a Th1 response. Our results further highlight the central role of DCs in the effective control of infections caused by encapsulated bacteria.

861	L’expérience d’acquisition de ressources en enseignement à la clientèle et de leur utilisation en situation clinique telle que perçue par des infirmiers ayant suivi un cours        e-learning : étude qualitative descriptive	All nurses must maintain their knowledge and skills up to date. However, in the current context, due to lack of nurses, continuing education represents a great challenge for nurses. Therefore e-learning seems to have a great potential to take over this challenge. A qualitative study based on the critical incidents method was meant to describe clinical nursing experiences (n=4) after an e-learning course on patient teaching. This 45 hours long course was led on a competency based approach. Individual interviews allowed us to document the use of their acquired knowledge in different clinical contexts. The results reveal that nurses (n=4) acquired different resources (knowledge, skills) that they used in clinical patient teaching. According to the results, discussion forums about clinical cases and a learning project in real clinical context turned out to be useful educational strategies to sustain professional nursing skills. Finally, e-learning based on the competency-based approach reveals itself as an educational strategy of great promise.

862	Localization and function of the endocannabinoid system throughout the retinogeniculate pathway of vervet monkeys	The endocannabinoid (eCB) system is present in the mammalian central nervous system, including the retina, and is responsible for the regulation of many physiological processes. Anatomical and functional data collected in the retina indicate that cannabinoid receptors are important mediators of retinal function. Although the presence of the cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1R) has been documented in the rodent and primate retina, there is still some controversy regarding the presence of the CB2 receptor (CB2R) within the central nervous system. By using confocal microscopy, we are the first to report the distribution patterns of CB2R in the monkey retina. Our results show that CB2R is expressed exclusively in the Müller cells of the primate retina. Furthermore, we compared the eCB system distribution patterns in the retinas of mice, tree shrews, and vervet and macaque monkeys. We report that CB1R, FAAH, MAGL, and DAGLα distributions are highly conserved among these 3 species whereas CB2R and NAPE-PLD exhibit different expression patterns. CB2R was not detected in the neuroretinal cells of primates. NAPE-PLD immunoreactivity was present in the retinal layers of mice and tree shrews but was restricted to the photoreceptor layer in both species of primates studied.  To study the neural correlates and the role of eCB signaling in the retina, we first established a standard protocol for electroretinography (ERG) and then recorded the ERG response of the retina after blocking receptors with specific antagonists for CB1R (AM251) and CB2R (AM630). Compare to control, in photopic conditions, at certain low flash intensities, only the blockade of CB1R decreases the amplitude of the a-wave and b-wave, while at some high flash intensities, blockade of CB2R increase the amplitude of both a- and b-waves. Also the blockade of the cannabinoid receptors causes an increase in the latency of both a- and b-waves. In dark-adapted eyes, blockade of the CB1R and CB2R reduces the a-wave only amplitudes in the higher intensities and decrease the b-wave in lower intensities. Some significant increases in latency were observed in both cases. These results indicate that CB1 and CB2 receptors in primates are involved in retinal function under photopic and scotopic conditions.   In addition, we assessed the expression pattern of eCB components CB1R, FAAH, and NAPE-PLD beyond the retina in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) of primates and report for the first time that while CB1R and FAAH are more abundantly expressed in the magnocellular layer, NAPE-PLD is distributed throughout both the magno- and parvocellular layers. None of these components are expressed in the koniocellular layer.  These findings augment our understanding of the effects of cannabinoids on the visual system and may lead to novel therapeutics targeted to eCB signaling.

863	Le dialogue des juges entre la Cour européenne des droits de l’homme et la Cour interaméricaine des droits de l’homme	This research aims to present the dialogue between judges of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) and the Inter-American Court of Human rights (IAHR). These two supranational regional courts both aim at ensuring respect for fundamental rights within their jurisdiction. The dialogue between them is analysed through the study of disputes regarding the integrity of human being and the protection of economic and social rights. This subject is greatly linked to the context of power shifts induced by globalization and reveals how judges are emancipating themselves through transgovernemental regulatory networks. In conclusion, this thesis demonstrates the dialogue’s objective to establish a certain coherence between the systems and to allow a common vision of human rights to be brought forward through the constitution of an informal exchange network now known as the Euro-American interspace. However, the dialogue is restricted by many contextual factors and the contrasted realities of the two regional systems, as well as the will of state actors.

864	Le soutien au développement de la pratique des infirmières praticiennes spécialisées de première ligne au Québec	Although there is an abundant literature on primary health care nurse practitioners (PHCNP), the optimal structures and practices to support PHCNPs remain largely unexplored. In Quebec, this issue needs particular attention because of practice settings diversity and physical distance between major key players. Furthermore, the supervision role that seems to be shared by multiple professionals and the legal framework add to the complexity of the implementation of support structures and practices. Through a multiple case study, this paper aimed to explore the managerial structures in place and to analyze the mechanisms deployed to support the development of PHCNP practice. Issuing from a larger scale multicenter research, this study analyzed three separate cases, totaling 18 interviews with health professionals and managers. Based on a three levels model built on the central concept of support, the needs of PHCNP and their teams have been identified. The main results of this research demonstrate the relevance of supervision by the key players of the Department of Nursing. In addition, the coordination between professionals seems enhanced when some organizational structures are implemented. Finally, decision-making committees linked to the implementation of PHCNP appear to be more useful when the environment and experience of the organizations are taken into consideration.

865	Étude des conceptions alternatives et des processus de raisonnement des étudiants de chimie du niveau collégial sur la molécule, la polarité et les phénomènes macroscopiques	The difficulties found in learning Chemistry are mostly ascribed to the fact that it comprises many complex and counter-intuitive concepts. But beyond these epistemological challenges, learning chemistry can be in jeopardy when it relies on learners’ unstable foundations mixed with alternative conceptions. Alternative conceptions are tacit internal representations that students hold in disagreement with scientifically accepted theories. The presence of alternative conceptions in students’ minds might harm their conceptual understanding leading them to wrongly explain the behaviour of matter and to make incorrect predictions in chemistry. Alternative conceptions are recognised as widespread and difficult to identify in a traditional educational setting. Many alternative conceptions in chemistry have been identified by different groups of researchers in international settings, but such an operation has never been carried out with Quebec college students. As Quebec’s post-secondary education system represents a unique context, a study of the particular difficulties of students in this system was necessary to draw an accurate picture of the situation. Furthermore, researchers presently suggest not only to list such alternative conceptions, but also to explore by what processes they lead to wrong predictions or explanations. Researchers indeed argue that mere lists of alternative conceptions cannot be easily used by teachers, who should be the target audience for these results if they are to take into account alternative conceptions in their teaching. However, no satisfactory typology of reasoning processes and alternative conceptions in chemistry exists today in the research literature. Several researchers in chemistry education suggest that such a typology is needed and should render explicit the reasoning processes involving these alternative conceptions. Explicitation of the reasoning used by the students while performing a task in chemistry would be the way to identify the alternative conception on which this reasoning is based.  Reasoning is viewed as the process that proceeds from implicit ideas to explicit answers. Not all wrong answers in chemistry come from alternative conceptions: some come from a lack of knowledge, other from logical errors. Since all types of wrong answers from students are problematic during teaching, it is relevant to consider them all. Thus, these concerns have inspired the following research question:  What alternative conceptions and modes of reasoning lead students to make poor predictions in chemistry or to give wrong explanations of the behavior of matter?  This doctoral research was conducted to provide an answer to this question. In total, 2,413 students enrolled in Science programmes in Québec’s college (postsecondary pre-university) system were involved in this research, which was divided into three phases: preliminary phase, pilot phase and main phase. Clinical interviews were conducted in the preliminary phase to explore chemistry students’ alternative conceptions. During the pilot phase, multiple-choice questions with open-ended justification were used to delimit the chemistry topics to be studied and to highlight ways of reasoning that students use. The main phase, for its part, used the two-tier “Molecules, Polarity and Phenomena” questionnaire (MPP) developed specifically for this research. The questionnaire was distributed to students via an adaptation of the Consol Web platform, developed by the research group of the principal investigator of this doctoral study. The results show that Science students hold several alternative designs, some of which are quite widespread among the population. In particular, a high proportion of students believe that evaporation causes the breaking of covalent bonds of the molecules (61.1 %), that all atom groups are molecules (78.9 %) and that atoms have similar macroscopic properties as the element (66.0 %). On the other hand, not all bad answers in the MPP show alternative conceptions. Some of them are rather explained by a deficiency in prior knowledge (for example, when students show a lack of knowledge of common chemical elements, 21.8 %) or an incomplete logical reasoning (when they believe the mere possession of polar bonds necessarily makes a molecule polar, which is observed in 24.1% of them). Alternative conceptions and reasoning that lead to incorrect answers are found among first-year and second-year students in the Science program, in some cases with decreasing frequency between the two years, and in others, at the same frequency in both subpopulations. These results mitigate the statement generally found in the research literature, that alternative conceptions are resistant to traditional teaching: according to the results of this research, some of them seem to actually be resolved through such a teaching context. The fact remains, however, that several alternative conceptions, deficiencies in basic prior knowledge and reasoning errors have been highlighted by this research. These learning problems lead college students to make incorrect predictions about the behaviour of matter, or to explain this behaviour incorrectly. In view of these results, a reflection on the teaching of chemistry at the college level, placing a greater emphasis on conceptual thinking and the use of reasoning for the prediction and explanation of the studied phenomena, should be considered.

866	Catholicisme et postmodernité : analyses philosophiques à partir de débats publics québécois	"Due to the secularisation, laicité and the growing religious diversity of Quebec society, the place of religion and Catholicism has been questioned. This situation has led to the creation of two commissions: one on the place of religion in school (1999) and the other on Accommodation practices related to cultural differences (2008). These commissions gave a lot of information about the relationship between Quebecers and Catholicism.  This research aims to understand certain aspects of Catholicism in Quebec with a perspective using texts signed ""Jacques Derrida"". To do so, we will use the works of Groupe de travail sur la religion à l’école, of General Consultation on the Place of Religion in School, and of Consultation Commission on Accommodation Practices Related to Cultural Differences. Our research hypothesis is that generally Quebecers have an ‘archival’ relationship towards Catholicism. Meaning, past perceptions of Catholicism as opposed to present ones condition this relationship. Moreover, these perceptions of Catholicism, that probably developed either just prior to or during the Quiet Revolution in the sixties, would feed the existence of ""specters,"" or ""ghosts,"" that haunt the relationship between Quebecers and everything related to religious and cultural diversity. This would be a fundamental dimension of what we would call the Quebec religious ""postmodernity"". To illustrate this statement, we will first analyse hundreds of documents deposed to these commissions. The software QDA Miner will help to perform a documentary analysis by identifying key passages related to this research. Then, we will analyse more accurately, the selected passages using philosophical perspectives mainly from Jacques Derrida."	archive , Derrida , commission Bouchard-Taylor , archive , specter , Derrida , Bouchard-Taylor commission , Commission on Education	en	11913.0
867	Preuves empiriques des liens entre des indicateurs de performance processuels et les résultats sensibles aux soins infirmiers	Problematic : For several years, nursing performance has been the subject of particular attention around the research fields and for nursing administrators. Performance indicators sensitive to nursing, that compose the analysis systems of nursing performance, have not been the subject of a deep analysis, especially concerning the empirical bases. The objective of this work is to find and analyze the empirical evidence that illustrate cause and effect links be-tween structural elements, process and the results of four process of care indicators: evaluation and care planning, symptoms management, discharge planning and health promotion.    Method : The literature review was conducted with different databases such as CI-NAHL©, EMBASE©, PUBMED©, WEB OF SCIENCES©, COCHRANE database of Sys-tematic Review© and GOOGLE SCHOLAR©. The articles selection has been done accord-ing to the empirical evidence ranking method from the University of Duke (2014).    Results: Following the literature review, 42 synthesis studies relating empirical links between nursing interventions and care process indicators were identified    Conclusion : Empirical links were established between indicators of symptoms control, discharge planning, illness prevention, health promotion and clinical pathways. Some nursing interventions were also linked with these indicators. Recommendations for the use of these indicators were then suggested.

868	Étude rétrospective évaluant le VEGF comme biomarqueur d’athérosclérose mesurée par coronarographie quantitative et ultrason intra-vasculaire	Background: The role of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF) in atherogenesis remains controversial.  By promoting inflammation and neovascularization of the atherosclerotic plaque, VEGF is hypothesized to partake in the development of atherosclerotic plaques.  However, clinical data linking VEGF to coronary atherosclerosis have been controversial. We investigated the association between vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) serum levels and coronary artery disease (CAD).   Methods: We performed a retrospective cross-sectional study on data collected from 56 patients that presented with stable CAD and 112 that presented with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS).  We investigated the relationship between coronary atherosclerosis burden and serum VEGF concentration using Quantitative Coronary Angiography (QCA), and assessed plaque morphology with Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS).    Results: We found that stable CAD patients had significantly higher VEGF levels than patients with ACS. We observed a positive correlation between serum VEGF levels and the extent and severity of atherosclerotic disease measured by QCA Cumulative Coronary Stenosis Score (Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.423 and p=0.001).  In a multivariate analysis, serum VEGF levels remained a valid predictor of QCA CCSS score (p=0.003) in patients with stable CAD, with age being the only other predictor of QCA CCSS (p=0.007). Finally, using IVUS, we observed a significant positive correlation between serum VEGF levels and plaque volume (Spearman correlation coefficient = 0.381, p=0.035) as well as percent atheroma volume (Spearman correlation coefficient = 0.466, p=0.008).  Conclusion: Our findings suggest that serum VEGF could be used as a potential biomarker of atherosclerosis.

869	Problèmes respiratoires et exposition aux émissions d’industries au Saguenay	Most studies performed to date that assessed the respiratory effects of short term exposure to air pollutants have been performed in urban environments. Air pollutant mixtures in urban environments may differ than those originating from industrial settings. The first objective of this thesis was a literature revue of all studies published to date on the respiratory effects of exposure to industrial emissions in children. Studies published to date usually report, that exposure to industrial emissions of air pollutants are associated with respiratory effects. In these studies, effects of short-term exposure have rarely been studied. The second objective of this thesis was to estimate the association between daily exposure to emissions of atmospheric pollution coming from an industrial complex (with two smelters and an alumina refining plant) in Saguenay, Quebec, and hospitalizations for respiratory problems in children aged 0 to 4 years living near nearby (<7.5 km) with an epidemiologic case-crossover design. The percentage of hours when the residence of the children was downwind from the industrial complex and the daily average and peak concentrations of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and particulate matter (PM2.5), measured from January 1st 2001 to December 31th 2010, were used to estimate the exposure of children. Conditional logistic regressions were used to estimate the associations with odds ratios (OR) and the 95% confidence intervals. Hospitalizations for asthma and bronchiolitis in young children living near the aluminum/industrial complex increased with the daily exposure, estimated by the percentage of hours downwind. Results from this thesis suggest that exposure to industrial emissions of air pollutants is associated with respiratory effects in children.	epidemiology , short-term exposure , industrial environment , children , respiratory problem , asthma	en	11891.0
870	Regard sur la sécurité du processus dans les organisations utilisant ou non les TIC lors de l’évaluation	Academic dishonesty in assessments presents important issues regarding its integrity. The presence of ICT being increasingly important in the examinations, it is important with this method of data collection to ensure a level of safety equal to or even higher than the one present when the traditional method of collecting data, the paper and pencil, is used. There are several studies on the use of ICT in assessment, but few of them talks about the security arrangements in the use of ICT. In this study, thirteen Quebec’s organizations were encountered, six of them who used ICT in the assessment, five who used paper and pencil in the assessment but who wished to use ICT and two who used paper and pencil and did not wish to use ICT. The organizations are educational institutions (elementary, high school, college, university), private companies, government or municipal agencies and professional associations. Semi-structured interviews and a qualitative analysis by the presence or absence of different characteristics documented the security arrangements related to data collection for the assessment using ICT. These modalities were compared with those used when there is utilization of paper and pencil in the collection of data to see how they vary when using ICT.  The results show that the use of ICT in the assessment makes it more complex and adds steps to the preparation of the examination to ensure an adequate level of security. However, it also allows new features regarding the type of questions, the integration of multimedia, the use of adaptive questions and random generation of test that can counter some forms of academic dishonesty already present with the use of paper and pencil in the assessment and for which it was difficult to act. However, the use of ICT in assessment can also bring new opportunities for academic dishonesty. If these are taken into consideration, the use of ICT allows a higher security level than the assessment where the data were collected with traditional paper-and-pencil.

871	Influence de la testostérone sur les paramètres électrocardiographiques des hommes et des femmes	The incidence of various cardiac arythmias subtypes differs between men and women. Indeed, atrial fibrillation or Brugada syndrome are more prevalent in men, while women are more susceptible to Torsades de Pointe. The development of various arrhythmias may be affected by sexual disparities in the normal electrical cardiac activity. Sex differences have been described in the electrocardiographic parameters of men and women, particularly in the parameters representing the ventricular repolarisation phase. Besides, the results obtained in several clinical and experimental studies suggested that androgens could contribute to explain differences in ventricular repolarization of men and women. However the effects of this hormone on other electrocardiographic parameters have received little attention. In this context, the aim of the current study was to better understand the implication of testosterone in the sex differences observed in the electrocardiogram. We examined the electrocardiograms of a cohort of healthy volunteers, and first confirmed sex differences in parameters, that had been previously described in the literature. While P wave and PR interval showed no significant differences, we did note a longer PR segment in men compared to women. Secondly, we evaluated the association of circulating levels of testosterone with the human electrocardiographic parameters. The correlation was the strongest with QRS complex, ST segment and QTc interval. Therefore, we assessed the mediating role of testosterone in the relationship between sex and these three parameters. However, the results showed that this androgen did not seem to explain these sex-related differences. In conclusion, this study suggests that testosterone is not responsible for the differences observed in QRS complex, ST segment and QTc interval of our cohort of men and women. Additional mediators may be involved in these sex-related electrocardiographic differences, alone or in conjunction with testosterone.	ECG , Arrhythmias , Sex differences , Testosterone	en	11867.0
872	Screening for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis: an information statement by the scoliosis research society international task force	Background: Routine screening of scoliosis is a controversial subject and screening efforts vary greatly around the world. METHODS: Consensus was sought among an international group of experts (seven spine surgeons and one clinical epidemiologist) using a modified Delphi approach. The consensus achieved was based on careful analysis of a recent critical review of the literature on scoliosis screening, performed using a conceptual framework of analysis focusing on five main dimensions: technical, clinical, program, cost and treatment effectiveness. FINDINGS: A consensus was obtained in all five dimensions of analysis, resulting in 10 statements and recommendations. In summary, there is scientific evidence to support the value of scoliosis screening with respect to technical efficacy, clinical, program and treatment effectiveness, but there insufficient evidence to make a statement with respect to cost effectiveness. Scoliosis screening should be aimed at identifying suspected cases of scoliosis that will be referred for diagnostic evaluation and confirmed, or ruled out, with a clinically significant scoliosis. The scoliometer is currently the best tool available for scoliosis screening and there is moderate evidence to recommend referral with values between 5 degrees and 7 degrees. There is moderate evidence that scoliosis screening allows for detection and referral of patients at an earlier stage of the clinical course, and there is low evidence suggesting that scoliosis patients detected by screening are less likely to need surgery than those who did not have screening. There is strong evidence to support treatment by bracing. INTERPRETATION: This information statement by an expert panel supports scoliosis screening in 4 of the 5 domains studied, using a framework of analysis which includes all of the World Health Organisation criteria for a valid screening procedure.

873	Découverte de cellules souches potentielles de l’épithélium thymique	The thymus undergoes a rapid degeneration with age termed thymic involution that causes a loss of function of the thymus with age. To this day, mechanisms of thymic maintenance are still unknown. This is why we aimed to identify thymic epithelial stem cells. Since stem cells are quiescent in many tissues in adults, our main objectives were to determine whether the thymic epithelium contains quiescent cells and study the proliferation kinetics of thymic epithelial cells in neonatal and adult mice. To this end, we used the transgenic mouse model H2B-GFP Tet-On, a label-retaining assay allowing us to identify cells that have not divided for a prolonged period of time, which are called label-retaining cells (LRC). First, we showed that in the adult thymus, females’ thymic epithelial cells (TECs) proliferated more actively than males’ TECs. We observed three main differences between neonatal and adult thymi: (1) cTECs and mTECs have similar proliferation rates in young, but mTECs cycled more actively in adult mice; (2) neonatal TECs have a higher turnover rate than adult’s TECs, and (3) we were able to detect LRC in adult mice, but not in neonatal mice. These LRC are contained in the cTEC compartment and express very low levels of senescence-associated proteins and show a high expression of genes important for thymic development and. These results show that the LRC identified in adult thymi are not senescent cells and therefore might represent the elusive thymic progenitor cells responsible for thymic maintenance and regeneration in adult mice.

874	Fiabilité et changement minimal détectable de mesures obtenues à partir d'images enregistrées par ultrasonographie afin de caractériser l'intégrité du tendon d'Achille	Background: Quantifying the integrity of the Achilles tendon (AT) represents a challenge in rehabilitation. The adoption of quantitative measurements of the AT, extracted from an ultrasound image (QUS) could remedy this shortcoming. Objectives: 1) To assess the test-retest reliability and accuracy of QUS measurements of the AT; 2) To determine the best protocol of QUS measurements to use in clinical practice. Methods: A total of 23 ATs with symptoms of mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy and 63 asymptomatic ATs were evaluated. For each AT, 8 images were recorded (2visits* 2 evaluators* 2 images). Different types of QUS measurements were taken: geometric (thickness, width, area), derived from a gray-level histogram and derived from a co-occurrence marix. A generalizability study quantified the reliability and accuracy of each QUS measurement whereas a decision study highlighted the best protocols for measuring use. Results: The geometric measurements showed excellent reliability and accuracy. The measures derived from the gray-level histogram showed poor reliability and accuracy. The measurements derived from a co-occurrence matrix have shown moderate to excellent reliability and a variable precision. In clinical practice, it is recommended averaging the results of three images collected by an assessor during a single visit. Conclusions: The use of geometric QUS measures allows to quantify the integrity of the AT in clinical practice and in research. Further studies on QUS measurements derived from a matrix of co-occurrence are needed.

Yet, a distinctive subset of obese patients seems protected from insulin resistance. Such insulin-sensitive obese subpopulation (ISO) offers a unique opportunity to investigate factors underlying the development of insulin resistance in humans without the confounding effect of major differences in adiposity. Adipose tissue fibrosis has been directly linked to the development of obesity-associated insulin resistance in rodents. Therefore, we quantified total fibrosis and examined the expression of fibrosis-related genes in subcutaneous (SAT) and visceral (VAT) adipose tissue biopsies of diabetic (T2D) and non diabetic obese patients stratified into ISO or insulin-resistant obese (IRO) based on the OGTT-derived ISIMatsuda index, before and six months after bariatric surgery. Despite similar age, BMI, and percent fat mass, ISO had lower insulin resistance than IRO subjects (p<0.05) at baseline. No difference was found between ISO, IRO and T2D, neither in terms of total fibrosis, nor in the expression of fibrosis-related genes in the adipose tissues before surgery. However, log SAT fibrosis positively correlated with log HOMA-IR at baseline (r = 0.3847, p < 0.05). Six months after surgery, fibrosis levels remained unchanged in SAT, but insulin resistance was significantly reduced in all groups, especially in T2D patients. No correlation was found between SAT fibrosis and HOMA-IR after surgery. These results show a significant, yet ephemeral association between SAT fibrosis and insulin resistance in obese humans.

876	Facteurs contextuels dans l'évaluation d'une politique de santé maternelle au Burkina Faso	This thesis focuses on the influence of contextual factors on the implementation and the effects of a maternal health policy in Burkina Faso. The policy – called the subsidy EMOC – aims to increase the coverage of facility based-deliveries in public health facilities by acting on the economic accessibility of households. A process evaluation of this maternal health policy has been conducted. The analytical framework is based on theoretical propositions emanating form health policy approach (actors and power relations) and critical medical anthropology (representations).  The study has taken place in Djibo district in the Sahel region. A multiple case study was undertaken. Each public health facility represents a case. The methodological approach is qualitative. Several methods of data collection were mobilized: a long immersion on the field, in-depth interviews, discussion groups, non- participant observations and documentary analysis. The preliminary results of the study were presented to stakeholders.  The first article analyzes the implementation of the policy at the district and primary care levels. It describes the influence of power relations on the implementation process of the policy. The results indicate that all components of the policy have been implemented except for the grant for the worst-off and some components related to the technical quality of care such as surveys for the beneficiaries. Health workers and managers have perceived difficulties in implementing the policy due to a lack of clarity of the official guidelines.   Power relations have an influence on the implementation of the policy. Relations between staff managers and health workers are based on formal authority and hierarchy. The district managers control health workers and they impose changes over implementation of the policy. The perceptions of the relationship between health workers and patients are mixed. In some health facilities, the relation is perceived positively, while in others is perceived negatively. The perceptions of the relationship between health workers and traditional birth attendants are also ambivalent. On the one hand, traditional birth attendants are seen as an obstacle to the policy because they continue to perform deliveries in villages against the aim of the policy. On the other hand, they are considered as a potential ally in inciting women to use maternal health services. The lack of understanding the modality of reimbursement between health workers and management committee members has strained the relationship between the two groups.   The second article aims to understand the variation observed on the coverage of facility-based deliveries between primary health care centers after the implementation of the policy. Contextual factors especially human have an important influence on the coverage of facility-based deliveries. Health worker’s leadership which is characterized by personal initiatives, professional ethics and the building a trust relation between the population and the health teams explain the difference observed on the coverage of facility-based deliveries.  The objective of the third article is to show how health workers use ethno-cultural factors to justify the partial failure of this policy. The reference to these factors essentially seeks to normalize and legitimize the lack of effect of the policy on the coverage of facility-based deliveries. The results show that the reference to ethno-cultural factors was also used to blame communities. Finally the use of these factors tends to eliminate the socioeconomic and political interpretations that underlie the problem of facility –based deliveries.   This thesis provides insight into the process of implementing a maternal health policy. It shows that the dimensions of equity and quality of care were neglected during this process. This research shows the difficulties faced by health workers on the implementation of this policy. It also highlights the factors that explain the heterogeneity observed on the coverage of facility –based deliveries after the implementation of this policy.   This thesis shows the importance of identifying power relations exerted between the actors involved in health policies. This research shows the importance of taking into consideration the context in which health policies are implemented. Finally, this research reveals the importance of social representations of the actors for understanding the effects of policies. This thesis contributes to the development of knowledge in the field of public health policies in terms of the topics covered (implementation, power relations) and the methodological approach (fieldwork) used. It also participates in theoretical reflections on the concept of leadership for health professionals in Africa.

877	Comparative costs and outcomes of traumatic brain injury from biking accidents with or without helmet use	Rationale: Establishing determinants of preventable disease and their societal costs are necessary in the context of publicly funded healthcare. With recent increases in Québec bicyclists, it is an opportune time to evaluate the impact of cycling traumatic brain injuries (TBI).  Objective: Compare demographic and medical characteristics and social costs of cycling TBIs according to helmet status. Methods: Retrospective study of 128 cyclists with TBI, from a trauma database, admitted to the Montreal University Health Center - Montreal General Hospital (MUHC-MGH) between 2007 and 2011. The independent variables were sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, as well as helmet status. The dependant variables were LOS, GOS-E, ISS, discharge destination, deaths and societal costs, using a bottom up costing approach. Results: The helmet group tended to be older, more educated, retired and married; from a medical perspective, they had reduced probabilities of severe TBIs on imaging, had shorter intensive care hospitalizations and less neurosurgeries. Median societal costs of TBI were significantly lower when a helmet was used. Conclusion: In this study, helmets seemed to confer protective effects against certain TBI complications and decreased median overall costs to society. Helmet promotion is recommended.

878	Effets électrophysiologiques d’une thérapie cognitivo-comportementale pour traiter le syndrome de Gilles de la Tourette et le trouble de tics chroniques	Gilles de la Tourette syndrome and chronic tic disorder are two neuropsychiatric condition involving motor and/or phonic tics. In the DSM, these two conditions are characterized as “tic disorders”. Patients with such diagnoses face numerous comorbidities, and also show multiple neuropsychological impairments, especially concerning inhibition and motor processing. Tic symptoms, as well as general condition, can be improved with a cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT). To this end, we recorded, during a stimulus-response compatibility task, event-related potentials and lateralized readiness potentials in 20 patients with tic disorder and 20 healthy controls. Patients and controls were paired on age, sex and hand dominance. Our result revealed a delay in stimulus-locked lateralized readiness potential (LRP) onset latency, higher response-locked LRP peak amplitude and a frontal overactivation related to stimulus inhibition in GTS and CTD patients. Following CBT, stimulus-locked LRP onset latency and response-locked LRP peak amplitude were normalized, but the frontal overactivation related to inhibition processing remained unchanged. These results suggest that CBT induces a modification of pre-motor processes such as response selection and preparation, as well as motor processes like response execution, but does not affect cortical activation related to stimulus inhibition. Since we found a reduction in tic symptoms, as well as a normalization of stimulus-locked LRP onset latency and response-locked LRP peak amplitude, and because LRPs are partly generated by the supplementary motor area, we suggest that CBT leads to a modification of this structure’s functioning.

879	Les bénéfices du chant dans la réadaptation de l’aphasie	People with aphasia, an acquired disorder of language caused by brain injury, can temporarily better pronounce words when they sing them as part of familiar songs or in choral singing with a model they can imitate. In this thesis, we examine how singing can lead to lasting benefits on the linguistic and communicative abilities of these people. Two contexts are considered: (1) an aphasia therapy based on singing, the Melodic Intonation Therapy (MIT), and (2) a recreational choir activity for people with aphasia. Our first study (Chapter 2) presents a critical review of studies having centered on MIT. We argue that several treatment protocols subsumed under the rubric of MIT do not in fact correspond well to the original MIT specification and that immediate effects of singing studied in cross-sectional studies should not be confused with the lasting effects observed in longitudinal studies. This interpretative framework makes it possible to reconcile the findings of contradictory studies concerning the mechanisms of MIT and highlights yet unresolved research questions, including the relative contribution of rhythm and pitch to the effects of this therapy. This latter question forms the central topic of our third chapter in which we report a study with three chronic Broca's aphasia patients. Three treatments were compared in a Latin square design: a therapy using sung speech (i.e., with both rhythm and pitch) closely resembling that of the original MIT, an equivalent therapy using only rhythmic speech, and a therapy with normal speech. Since only the full singing therapy improved the natural speech of participants, we argue that the rhythm and pitch combination in singing is most effective for MIT. Finally, in the fourth chapter we present the first randomized, controlled, and single-blinded group study aiming to determine if recreational singing can also be beneficial in the rehabilitation of aphasia. We evaluated the progress in functional communication for 17 people with different types of chronic aphasia during six months of weekly activity in either a choir group, a drama group, or a waiting list group that participated in neither of these activities. Our results showed a positive correlation between improvement in functional communication and attendance to any and all social events in which participants were involved, but we did not find any specific effect of choir activity. Thus, the practice of choral singing may have a general therapeutic potential, but not one specific to singing. Further studies are needed to confirm this. Thus, this thesis maintains that in the rehabilitation of aphasia, singing brings specific benefits to language when integrated into a therapy such as MIT and benefits comparable to other social activities when it is practiced as a leisure activity in a choir.	communication , aphasia , rehabilitation , therapy , speech-language pathology , music-therapy , singing , language , communication	en	11789.0
880	Projet de dépistage du VIH au sein des communautés caribéennes et africaines de Montréal : leçons apprises d’un exercice d’évaluation mettant en exergue des visions contrastées	Despite a significant reduction in new infections, sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean remain strongly affected by the HIV/aids pandemic. Caribbean and African diaspora communities living elsewhere in the West are also strongly impacted. There is an overrepresentation of individuals originating from these countries in the cohorts of people living with HIV. Moreover, individuals in these communities face specific challenges when trying to access voluntary counseling and testing services for HIV. These services are essential in trying to fight the HIV pandemic, thus, getting a better understanding of the issues at stake is crucial. Based on these observations, the “Moi je fais le test” project whose main objective was to increase HIV counseling and testing, was conducted in Montreal in 2010. Few interventions specifically addressing the needs of these communities in accessing voluntary counseling and testing for HIV have been reported, as such, the current evaluation has a double mandate: documenting the project and evaluating its implementation.  The evaluation is conducted as a case study and is structured around two axes:  the theory of change underlying the project and the implementation process.  Key elements in the implementation process as well as the perspectives of the partners demonstrate how complex it is to conduct a project collaboratively, even modest in size. Insofar as combination HIV prevention strategies have been promoted, the evaluation demonstrates the many challenges that could be encountered in developing similar projects in national and international settings.	marketing social , immigration , HIV , voluntary counseling and testing HIV , social marketing , migrants , evaluation	en	11786.0
881	Processus d'acquisition de nouvelles connaissances en urbanisme : le cas de l'îlot de chaleur urbain	In the context of current debates on climate change, heat has become a growing concern since the early 2000s, as it impacts people’s health and quality of life. As an element of urban climatology, the concept of urban heat islands emerged as a standard reference used by a number of Quebec scholars and practitioners in environmental management. However, there appears to be certain discrepancies between our current scientific knowledge and its interpretation by urban planners. The objective of this thesis is to better understand the factors that explain this discrepancy, through a study of knowledge acquisition among Quebec urban planners. Using a series of interviews with key actors in the emerging field of UHI’s in Quebec, it has been possible to identify the elements that caused distortions in knowledge transfer. Generally, the lack of interdisciplinarity in the areas of urban climatology and planning throughout the knowledge acquisition process, as well as a partial understanding of the surface temperature maps, help explain the nature of these discrepancies.

882	Structure de fonctionnement des charrettes en design urbain	This paper rejoins worldwide concerns for the future of cities in the XXlth century. It questions the practices, which contribute to the development of environmental qualities in the living environment. The collective creative efforts deployed in charrettes and workshops are considered to be relevant to the mobilization and reconciliation of values; principles necessary for sustainable development. The specific problematic concerns the adaptation of different operating structures of charrettes from one local context to another in order to insure desired outcomes. A comparative analysis of three case studies reveals that the creative processes of charrettes are adapted to the modes of communication required to advance the project planning process and confirms that their performance relies on their capacity to gather consensus in the actors concerned. Finally we supply a preliminary toolkit to help the future implementation of the charrette’s creative processes locally.	design urbain , collaboration , concertation , dialogue , communication , analyse structurale , urban design , local project , design process , collaboration , conciliation , structural analysis , case study	en	11774.0
883	Les fluctuations glycémiques et l'inflammation dans le diabète secondaire à la fibrose kystique	Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common autosomal recessive genetic disease among Caucasians and it is cause by a mutation in the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Regulator (CFTR) gene. With the emergence of more aggressive therapies to treat CF, the median life expectancy of patients with CF has increased and new complications, such as CF-related diabetes (CFRD), have emerged. CFRD is associated with increased mortality. The physiopathology of this complication is not fully understood. For instance, the reason why people with CF have an accelerated decline in lung functions years before the diagnosis of CFRD is not known.   Patients with CF, even those without CFRD, have increased hyperglycemia and glucose fluctuations. In addition, a study has reported that hyperglycemia affected immune reactivity in a mouse model of the disease. Furthermore, studies have shown that lymphocytes without a functional CFTR or that have increased uptake of glucose have abnormal immune responses. Therefore, we hypothesized that patients with CF, specifically those with normal and impaired glucose tolerance, would have increased proportions of Th17 and Treg lymphocytes producing the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-17A and that the increase in IL-17A levels would contribute to the accelerated decline of lung functions before the onset of CFRD. Increased levels of IL-17A have been found in the lungs of patients with CF and the peripheral blood of patients with type 1 (T1D) and 2 diabetes (T2D). Dysfunctional Treg lymphocytes can also produce IL-17A. These lymphocytes usually attenuate excessive immune responses but, in certain cases, can be dysfunctional and produce the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-17A. Moreover, we hypothesized that the proportions of these cells producing IL-17A would be associated to lung functions in patients with CF and that nutrition, physical activity and body composition could influence the relationship between inflammation and glucose fluctuations.   Although an association between the proportion of lymphocytes in the peripheral blood of participants and glucose fluctuations was observed, glucose fluctuations did not affect the proportions of Th17 and Treg lymphocytes producing IL-17A stimulated with PHA and PMA or not stimulated in media containing either 5 or 25 mM of glucose for 24 or 48 hours. Furthermore, these proportions were similar between healthy individuals and patients with CF with the exception of the proportion of stimulated Treg lymphocytes producing IL-17A of healthy individuals that was greater than the proportions of non-stimulated Treg lymphocytes producing IL-17A of all participants (patients with CF and healthy individuals). This suggests that Treg lymphocytes of healthy individuals and CF patients do not respond in the same manner to stimulation by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and phytohemagglutinin (PHA). Also, the duration of incubation affected the proportions of Th17 cells producing IL-17A but did not affect the proportion of Treg producing this cytokine. Therefore, these two types of lymphocytes are differently affected in the same culture media. Also, only the proportion of calories from carbohydrates affected modestly glucose fluctuations and the proportions of Th17 and Treg lymphocytes producing IL-17A were not associated to lung functions in CF patients.   To conclude, patients with CF had increased hyperglycemia and glucose flucutations when compared to healthy individuals but this glucose variability did not affect the proportions of Th17 and Treg lymphocytes producing IL-17A ex vivo. Future studies are needed to explore the role of IL-17A in the lungs of patients with CFRD and a prospective study would be important in order to determine if an increase in IL-17A in patients without CFRD is associated to an accelerated decrease in lung functions before the onset of this complication.

884	The influence of primary care clinic characteristics on the quality of care for depression in patients with different comorbidity profiles	In primary care settings, most patients presenting with major depression also suffer from comorbid chronic mental and/or physical conditions.  Delivering high quality depression care to these patients represents an important challenge for primary care providers and for health care systems.  There are reasons to believe that the organizational contexts in which providers practice have an important influence on the care they provide to patients with depression and comorbid chronic conditions.  However, few studies have directly examined how primary care organizational characteristics facilitate or impede care for these patients.  The main objective of this thesis was to better understand how different primary care organizational characteristics influence the quality of depression care provided to patients with different profiles of comorbid chronic conditions.    The thesis has two components.  First, we conducted a systematic review examining relationships between chronic physical comorbidity and the quality of depression recognition and treatment in primary care in order to clarify the nature of these relationships and identify factors associated with observed differences in these relationships across studies.  Next, we carried out a mixed-methods study conducted in two sequential phases: (a) a quantitative phase examining relationships between depression care quality, patients’ comorbidity profiles, and primary care clinic characteristics using multilevel regression analyses of data collected from two inter-related surveys, and (b) a qualitative phase relying on a case study approach that examines primary care professionals’ perceptions of the organizational factors that influence the quality of care they provide to patients living with depression and other comorbid chronic diseases.  Results of these studies revealed that while the quality of depression care in primary care is suboptimal, some patient subgroups are more at risk of receiving low quality of care than others.  Specifically, depressed patients with chronic physical comorbidity only were more at risk of receiving suboptimal care than patients presenting only with psychiatric comorbidity.  However, several characteristics of primary care organizations facilitated the delivery of high quality care to patients with depression and comorbid chronic conditions.  These included norms and values related to teamwork and mutual support, access to supports from professionals with expertise in mental health, use of decision support tools for depression treatment, and a lack of barriers due to inadequate payment models.  One of the ways these characteristics support quality is by facilitating the flow of knowledge in primary care organizations.   Our findings suggest that targeted organizational interventions are needed to improve the quality of depression care delivered to patients with depression and comorbid chronic conditions. Interventions could target multiple organizational domains (e.g. structural/strategic, social, informational and epistemic characteristics) and should consider how elements in each domain interact and how they might impact patients with different comorbidity profiles.

885	Rat protease-activated receptor–1 (rPAR1) expression and characterization in Sf9 cells	Thrombin’s serine protease activity allows for it to have a role in both the coagulation cascade as well as through a GTP- binding protein coupled receptor (GPCR) known as the protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR1). Thrombin binds to PAR1 at the N-terminal, cleaving between Arg41 and Ser42, and unmasking a new N-terminal which acts as a tethered ligand. Thrombin and a five amino acid peptide composed of the sequence of residues Ser42 to Arg46, known as PAR 1-AP, has been shown to mediate a number of signalling mechanisms in mammalian cells, including a calcium signalling pathway.    In the present study, the Sf9-baculovirus system allowed us to express the rat PAR1 (rPAR1-Sf9) on the cell surface and study its intracellular signalling.  The calcium (Ca2+) signal was studied using the fluorescent probe Fura-2, and several Ca2+ channel inhibitors and calcium signal modulators were used to study the signal induced by PAR1-AP.    In the presence of extracellular calcium [Ca2+]e, thrombin and PAR1-AP produced a Ca2+ signal which consisted of an initial spike in [Ca2+]i followed by a relatively maintained plateau and a slow return towards baseline.  In the absence of Ca2+ in the extracellular space, the initial Ca2+ increase is followed by a quick return to baseline [Ca2+]i.  Ca2+ channel inhibitors, lanthanum, nifedipine and D-600, inhibited the entry of Ca2+ from the extracellular space and abolished the plateau phase of the response to PAR1-AP. Inhibition of the Ca2+-ATPase with thapsigargin abolished the response to PAR1-AP after having depleted the Ca2+ stores involved in the initial spike in [Ca2+]i. TMB-8, expected to inhibit the release of Ca2+ from internal stores, inconsistently inhibited the [Ca2+]i  response to PAR1-AP. The response elicited by PAR1-AP was not affected by D-609, an inhibitor of phospholipase Cβ. Inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC) with bisindolylmaleimide induced oscillations in the [Ca2+]i levels in the presence of extracellular Ca2+ while it significantly blunted the response in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. PDBu activation of PKC truncated the [Ca2+]i surge in Ca2+-rich conditions while abolishing it altogether in the absence of extracellular Ca2+.  H-89 inhibition of protein kinase A (PKA) prolonged the plateau duration in Ca2+-rich medium while inhibiting the response to PAR1-AP in a Ca2+-deficient environment.   Taken together, our results suggest that PKC and possibly PKA play a critical role in the mobilisation of Ca2+ in rPAR1-Sf9 by PAR1-AP.	baculovirus , Fura-2 , thrombin , protease-activated receptor , calcium channel , calcium signalling , Sf9 cell	en	11761.0
886	La diffamation sur Internet : actualiser la responsabilité en droit civil et en common law au Canada	In this era often called « Web 2.0 », users have jumped with enthousiasm on the functions of communications and sharing on the Internet, this medium becoming a new platform for issues relating to privacy and reputation. Defamation is one of the main concerns about electronic content, more specificially regarding user generated content (UGC). Dealing with this tool which enables an unprecedented dissemination and interactivity in communications, how should we treat Internet with regards to the legal rules applicable in matters of defamation in Canada? Does the traditionnal legal analysis fit the new reality introduced by this medium?   Because of Canada’s bijuralism, we will study separately the civil law and common law regimes with a comparative method in order to understand the concepts and the functionning specific to each of the legal approaches cohabiting in Canada. It will allow us to identify the special features of the electronic media which stand out when confronted with matters of defamation and which caracterize the specificity of the online context and users, therefore distinguishing it from the traditionnal means of communication known by the law.  This comparative analysis aims to take a citical look at each of the law regimes in effect in Canada, considering the reality of Internet and its user generated content. Mainly, this study aims to foster the development of analytical methods truly entrenched in the functionning of the medium concerned and likely to evolve therewith.

887	Les effets de dialogue interne sur le processus de décision chez les jeunes joueurs élites de hockey sur glace	Self-talk (S-T) is a mental skill which is used more and more by elite athletes but there is a lack of research on its effect in team sports. Its impact deserves to be evaluated as much during team contexts and real competitions as it does in individual sports because self-talk can affect a team sport athlete's ability to perform mental skills such as good tactical decision-making and focusing on the proper stimuli. Therefore, with the participation of 10 elite hockey players varying from 16 to 20 years old, this study examines the effect of two distinct self-talk treatments, a motivational one and an instructional one. The analysis, evaluating the efficiency of the subjects' ability to accomplish collective tactics (effect on decision process) during the regular season games, has shown that all athletes showed some improvement in their performances. Generally, the group associated with the instructional self-talk treatment has proven to be considerably more effective in decision-making than the motivational group. However, the athletes from the motivational self-talk group generated better results than expected. It seems also that, in the short term, the instructional self-talk treatment was more difficult to assimilate than the motivational one but its positive impact appears to have lasted longer. Furthermore, the more experienced players did not display a better progression in their decision process compared to the less experienced ones. Also, motivational self-talk appears to have produced better effects than the instructional one when used during periods of fatigue and stress.

888	Convergences/divergences : le dialogue intermédial dans Vues et visions de Claude Cahun	This dissertation studies the relationship between text and image in Claude Cahun’s Vues et visions, her first project realized in collaboration with the visual artist Marcel Moore. This heterogeneous object of art belongs to the iconotext genre (Alain Montandon) and establishes a dialogue between Cahun’s prose poems and Moore’s drawings to the point of deconstructing the reader’s horizon of expectation : he is induced to read and behold alternatively the texts and the images so that the boundary line that defines the literary’s and pictorial’s spaces appears porous.   Subdivided in two chapters, our work becomes attached in the first place to bring to light the role of the written word which incorporates some graphics of Marcel Moore. Inspired by a reading method called « iconolecture » by Emmanuelle Pelard, we will try to link the plasticity and the literal signification of the linguistic signs illustrated by those hybrid drawings while studying the formal and thematic similarities they share with Cahun’s prose poems. Using an intermedial perspective, the second chapter will study how the visual arts influence the poet’s writing style. After having broached the figure of the double, we will analyze the figure of allusion as a writing strategy to introduce the pictorial register in the literary texts that will lead us to study « l’image-en-texte » (Liliane Louvel). « L’effet-tableau » and the anamorphosis will be explored as frame of reference to conceive how links are tied between visual arts and poetry in Vues et visions.

889	Die Alraune als künstliches Geschöpf in der deutschen phantastischen Literatur : Eine Studie zu Achim von Arnim, E.T.A. Hoffmann und Hanns Heinz Ewers	The fascination with the mandrake for thousands of years originates, without a doubt, from the human form of the plant root. Many supernatural qualities are linked to the mandrake. It is believed, among other things, to be able to make its owner rich. The gloomy details surrounding the mandrake myth make it a theme of predilection for fantastic literature. The aim of this thesis is to analyse the legend of the mandrake in three works of German fantastic literature — Achim von Arnim’s Isabella of Egypt (1812), E.T.A. Hoffmann’s Little Zaches, Surnamed Zinnober (1819) and Hanns Heinz Ewers’ Alraune (1911). These authors also combine the mandrake motif with another theme, much appreciated by the fantastic genre: the artificial man. In an intertextual perspective, I will examine how each author adapts the mandrake myth and represents his mandrake character. Then, I will analyze the new qualities created by their artificial creature status and the relationship of the character with its creator. Finally, I will bring to light the role of the mandrake character in each work in regards to the historical context. It will be proven that the mandrake characters do own qualities that refer to the mandrake mythos, but that their nature as artificial creatures puts them, in their story, in the antagonist role that is similar to the trickster’s one. In the end, I will explain how the authors use the mandrake motif and the fantastic literature to respectively denounce corruption, criticize the Enlightenment advocates and create a decadent atmosphere that justifies the use of the femme fatale theme. 	femme fatale , trickster , mandrake , artificial man , fantastic literature , German literature , Romanticism , intertextuality	en	11721.0
890	Diaspora arménienne de Montréal : comparaison intergénérationnelle du contenu des imaginaires nationaux et des sources de (re)production culturelle	The Armenian genocide of 1915 has had substantial identity impacts on different generations of Armenians in the diaspora, creating, for diasporic Armenian communities, a responsibility to perpetuate the traumatic collective memory. However, differences can be observed between these generations in the definition of Armenianness and in the identity supplies. Thus, our research question seeks to understand how the content of the national imaginary and the sources of cultural (re)production change between the second, third and fourth generations of Armenians settled in Montreal. The aim of the present study is to combine the emerging scientific literature on diasporic nationalism, as well as the role of cyberspace. Through interviews with Armenians – exiled since the Armenian genocide of 1915 and settled in Montreal – we will show, firstly, how the content of the national imaginary changes from a traditional identity to a symbolic one. Secondly, we will demonstrate how the sources of cultural (re)production are transformed by the transition from traditional sources to digital ones with the advent of cyberspace.

891	Les centres de travailleurs : un moyen d’élargir le champ d’action syndical? : études de cas	The labor market is undergoing major changes. The north-american model of union organization seems to not allow the labor movement to respond effectively to these changes, which have contributed to the development of several union renewal initiatives. To evaluate the impacts of union renewal initiatives, we have developped a model based on the concept of union zone (Haiven 2003, 2006). We had to determine the factors defining the union zone, as the litterature was silent about that subject. Using at first the theory of the determinants of the union density (Schnabel, 2003), we have integrated elements of the theory of union power resources (Lévesque and Murray, 2010) to the model to consider the internal factors for the unions that can influence the union zone. The integration of these three theories in one unified model constitute a significant theoritical innovation. The model was applied to two workers centers : the Vermont Workers Center and the St-Rémi Workers Center. In both cases, these union renewal initiatives have enlarged the union zone. On the other side, the Vermont center applies the principles of community unionism, seeking to develop leadership among its members (Cranford and Ladd, 2003), while the St-Rémi center applies the principles of mobilization unionism, in which leadership is exercised rather by union organizers (Camfield, 2007). This difference and their different mandates made the impacts in the two studied cases different. Further studies are needed to improve the proposed model. It remains a tool that can be useful for researchers or unions who want to evaluate the impacts of union initiatives or practices and, eventually, increase the influence of the labor movement on the labor market and society.	workers center , union renewal , union power , union density , union zone , atypical workers , unions , trade union , labor movement , migrant workers	en	11702.0
892	La nazification de l'Allemagne perçue à travers la presse alsacienne francophone (1933-1939)	At the dawn of 1930s, Alsace shares a troubled past with France and Germany. While the region came again under French rule after the First World War in 1919, Paris has difficulty integrating Alsace in the Republic, because it does not understand that forty years of German control upset the region's life at the political, cultural, religious and linguistic levels. France does not perceive the sense of identity of the population and its will to preserve its values. The Alsatian separatism of the 1920s and the repression of the movement by the French authorities damage the relations between Paris and Strasbourg.  Along with the tension of the 1930s, Adolf Hitler's arrival to power in 1933 in Germany radically modified the situation. The thesis examines how the French-speaking Alsatian press perceived the rise of Nazism in Germany from 1933 to 1939. Did Alsace question its allegiance to France, a country that demonstrated signs of weaknesses, and did not clearly understand Alsace? Or did it prefer a strong and stable Germany? By consulting newspapers of various political and religious orientations, such as Les dernières nouvelles de Strasbourg, Le nouvelliste d'Alsace, Le Lorrain et L'éclair de l'Est, the thesis analyzes the opinion of the Alsatian press on the German events in the 1930s.  The French-speaking press was not in favour returning to the Reich. Nevertheless, the allegiance to France was not as clear as the historiography leads us to believe on this matter. Until March 1938, the French-speaking Alsatian press did not claim particular status, even if it was dissatisfied with the options available, as much on the side of France as on the side of Germany. The region's point of view changed regularly. While Hitler caught everyone's attention in 1933, the unstable political situation in France as well as the choices of the Popular Front are the target for the French-speaking Alsatian press from 1936. It was only when the war seemed inevitable that it lined up behind the French Republic.	Alsace , France , Alsace , France , Germany , nazism , press	en	11698.0
893	Émergence de la websérie au Québec : ses origines et ses influences	This research seeks to illustrate a new genre present on the Web, the webseries. Its goal is to analyse Quebec webseries in order to understand its influences, particularly those of television. In the first chapter, theories of intermediality, remediation and convergence are explained to clarify the actual context of exchanges between media. In the second chapter, a quick historical panorama of quebec webseries is set. Then, four caracteristics of television are explained: watching context, schedule, aesthetics and seriality. In addition, this work demonstrates that those four caracteristics are present in the webseries and it explains how they are developped. Finally, in the last chapter, we analyse webseries to exemplify different existing links between TV shows and webseries.	Webseries , Web , Seriality , Intermediality	en	11689.0
894	«Grandir comme aidant» : pour mieux comprendre la réalité des adolescents qui sont des aidants naturels auprès d'un parent dépendant	This research deals with adolescents that have become the young caregivers of a parent who suffers from a chronic illness in a context where increasing care needs have to be assumed by the individuals and their families (Guberman et coll., 2005), while, on the other hand, the services provided to caregivers still have difficulty in identifying the children or teenagers as carers. (Charles, Stainton et Marshall, 2012). Young carers adopt tasks and roles that are not always adapted to their age (Earley et Cushway, 2002) and which can compromise their psychosocial development (Sieh et coll., 2010, Davey et coll., 2005, Pedersen et Revenson, 2005). When talking about young caregivers, it is important to consider the caregiving on a continuum where all youth is implicated, in one way or another, in aspects related to the care of the ill parent. However, it is also important to consider that a smaller proportion adopts the role of young caregiver which results in an exaggerated implication of the teenager, as the time spent on helping as well as the nature of this help do not correspond to their age or their given developmental stage and there are important restrictions that have a negative impact in their life (Becker, 2007).  The aim of our research is therefore to investigate how this reality is experienced by the adolescents and how it is perceived and interpreted by practitioners from different professional fields in a Quebec context.  This research project is based on the theoretical framework of recognition as proposed by Honneth. In fact, based on the available literature we can assume that the attention given to young caregivers is central in their lives. Consequently, we believe that it is important to understand the various issues surrounding the recognition that most researchers talk about but that are seldom studied in relation to young caregivers. This conceptual framework will serve as a gateway to analyse four semi-structured interviews with teenagers aged 15 to 19 years, as well as seven semi-structured interviews with practitioners from diverse professional fields.  Findings from this study suggest there are three different dynamics of recognition describing the diverse challenges and issues surrounding the realities of young caregivers. These highlight that the consequences that young carers may face come not only from the caretaker role, but also from the relational dimension in regards to their reality. Furthermore, at the intersection of perspectives between teenagers and practitioners, a divergence point is made apparent and seems to impede in our way of conceptualizing the help that should be provided in regards to this phenomena. It seems that for practitioners, the improvement of the young caregivers’s situation occurs, among others, through support that should be provided to parents, while teenagers put a special emphasis in the particular ways in which their contribution is not only valued in the family sphere but also supported by the practitioners surrounding the family.

895	Deep learning of representations and its application to computer vision	The goal of this thesis is to present a few small steps along the road to solving general artificial intelligence. This is a thesis by articles containing four articles. Each of these articles presents a new method for performing perceptual inference using machine learning and deep architectures. Each of these papers demonstrates the utility of the proposed method in the context of a computer vision task. The methods are more generally applicable and in some cases have been applied to other kinds of tasks, but this thesis does not explore such applications. In the first article, we present two fast new variational inference algorithms for a generative model of images known as spike-and-slab sparse coding (S3C). These faster inference algorithms allow us to scale spike-and-slab sparse coding to unprecedented problem sizes and show that it is a superior feature extractor for object recognition tasks when very few labeled examples are available. We then build a new deep architecture, the partially-directed deep Boltzmann machine (PD- DBM) on top of the S3C model. This model was designed to simplify the training procedure for deep Boltzmann machines, which previously required a greedy layer-wise pretraining procedure. This model partially succeeds at solving this problem, but the cost of inference in the new model is high enough that it makes scaling the model to serious applications difficult. In the second article, we revisit the problem of jointly training deep Boltzmann machines. This time, rather than changing the model family, we present a new training criterion, resulting in multi-prediction deep Boltzmann machines (MP- DBMs). MP-DBMs may be trained in a single stage and obtain better classification accuracy than traditional DBMs. They also are able to classify well using standard variational inference techniques, rather than requiring a separate, specialized, discriminatively trained classifier to obtain good classification performance. However, this comes at the cost of the model not being able to generate good samples. The classification performance of deep Boltzmann machines is no longer especially interesting following recent advances in supervised learning, but the MP-DBM remains interesting because it can perform tasks that purely supervised models cannot, such as classification in the presence of missing inputs and imputation of missing inputs. The general zeitgeist of deep learning research changed dramatically during the midst of the work on this thesis with the introduction of Geoffrey Hinton’s dropout algorithm. Dropout permits purely supervised training of feedforward architectures with little overfitting. The third paper in this thesis presents a new activation function for feedforward neural networks which was explicitly designed to work well with dropout. This activation function, called maxout, makes it possible to learn architectures that leverage the benefits of cross-channel pooling in a purely ￼supervised manner. We demonstrate improvements on several object recognition tasks using this activation function. Finally, we solve a real world task: transcription of photos of multi-digit house numbers for geo-coding. Using maxout units and a new kind of output layer for convolutional neural networks, we demonstrate human level accuracy (with limited coverage) on a challenging real-world dataset. This system has been deployed at Google and successfully used to transcribe nearly 100 million house numbers.

896	On the design of customized risk measures in insurance, the problem of capital allocation and the theory of fluctuations for Lévy processes	The aim of this thesis is to study fundamental problems in financial and insurance mathematics particularly the problem of measuring risk and its application within financial and insurance frameworks. The main contributions of this thesis can be classified in three main axes: the theory of risk measures, the problem of capital allocation and the theory of fluctuation. In Chapter 2, we design new coherent risk measures and study the associated capital allocation in the context of collective risk theory. We introduce the family of Cumulative Entropic Risk Measures. In Chapter 3, we study the optimal portfolio problem for the Entropic Value at Risk coherent risk measure for particular return models which are based on relevant cases of Jump-Diffusion models. In Chapter 4, we extending the notion of natural risk statistics to the multivariate setting. This non-trivial extension will endow us with multivariate data-based risk measures that are bound to have applications in finance and insurance. In Chapter 5, we introduce the concepts of drawdown and speed of depletion to the ruin theory literature and study them for the class of spectrally negative Lévy risk processes.

897	Études de l’effet tunnel des spins quantiques macroscopiques	This thesis presents recent theoretical analyses together with experimental observa- tions on macroscopic quantum tunneling and quantum-classical phase transitions of the escape rate in large spin systems. We consider biaxial ferromagnetic spin systems. Using the coordinate dependent spin coherent state path integral, we obtain the quantum phase interference and the energy splitting of these systems. We also present a lucid exposition of tunneling in antiferromagnetic exchange-coupled dimer, with easy-axis anisotropy. Indeed, we obtain the ground state, the first excited state, and the energy splitting, for both integer and half-odd integer spins. These results are then corroborated using per- turbation theory and the coordinate independent spin coherent state path integral. We further present a lucid explication of the effective potential method, which enables one to map a spin Hamiltonian onto a particle Hamiltonian; we employ this method to our models, however, in the presence of an applied magnetic field. This method enables us to investigate quantum-classical phase transitions of the escape rate of these systems. We obtain the phase boundaries, as well as the crossover temperatures of these phase transi- tions. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to one-dimensional anisotropic Heisenberg antiferromagnet, with N periodic sites. For even N, we show that the ground state is non-degenerate and given by the coherent superposition of the two Neél states. For odd N, however, the Neél state contains a soliton; as the soliton can be placed anywhere along the ring, the ground state is, indeed, N-fold degenerate. In the perturbative limit (weak exchange interaction), quantum fluctuation stemming from the interaction term lifts this degeneracy and reorganizes the states into a band. We show that this occurs at order 2s in (degenerate) perturbation theory. The ground state is non-degenerate for inte- ger spin, but degenerate for half-odd integer spin, in accordance with Kramers’ theorem	Instanton , Soliton , Perturbation theory , Effective potential , Antiferromagnet , Single molecule magnets , Energy splitting , Phase transition , Path integral	en	11666.0
898	Création interactive de mondes virtuels : combiner génération procédurale et contrôle utilisateur intuitif	The complexity required for virtual worlds is always increasing. Conventional modeling tech- niques are struggling to meet the constraints and efficiency required for the production of such scenes. Procedural generation techniques use algorithms for the automated creation of virtual worlds, but are often non-intuitive and therefore reserved to experienced programmers. Indeed, these methods offer fewer controls to users and are rarely interactive. Moreover, the user often needs to find values for several parameters. The user only gets indirect control through a series of trials and errors, which makes modeling tasks long and tedious.  The objective of this thesis is to combine the power of procedural modeling techniques with intuitive user control towards interactive methods for designing virtual worlds. First, we present a technique for procedural modeling of villages over arbitrary terrains, where elements are subjected to strong environmental constraints. Second, we propose an interactive technique for the procedural modeling of waterfall sceneries, combining intuitive user control with the automated generation of consistent content, in regard of hydrology and terrain constraints. Then, we describe an interactive sketch-based technique for editing terrains, where terrain features are extracted and deformed to fit the user sketches. Finally, we present a painting metaphor for virtual world creation and editing, where methods for example-based synthesis of vectorial elements are used to automate deformation and editing of the scene while maintaining its consistency.

899	Postdramatisme et esthétique de l’indécidabilité dans Cleansed et Phaedra’s Love de Sarah Kane	"Faced with the interpretive opacity and failure of language in the analysis of Sarah Kane’s violent plays, what approach could allow us to review the forms and means used by the playwright in order to leave her mark in the mind of the contemporary viewer? The paradigm of the post-dramatic theater, proposed by Hans-Thies Lehmann, constitutes an appropriate device for highlighting the contemporary issues at stake in the work of Kane. Since it strongly depends on the interpretation and the engagement of the viewer, the meaning of the plays are not univocal. Their spectral political nature proves essential here. This political spectrum reveals itself through the prism of violence. The necessity of shock appears to be its bias to redefine the role of theater in modern societies characterized by the flow of images through mass media. A link of co-responsibility between artist and viewer is created. Indeed as viewers/readers, Kane’s plays lead us to question ourselves on the mysterious and intimate depths of human cruelty and our complicity with the omnipresence of violence through consumption of its products. By focusing on the transgressive characteristics of Kane’s dramatic art that shake viewers out of their affective complacency through the references to ""culture from below"" and through the use of an obscene language and imagery, and through the diversion of pornography’s codes, this postdramatic reading of Cleansed and Phaedra's love intends to restore the energy inherent in Kane’s work. It is an energy that aims for radical change by awakening our senses."

900	Transhumanisme et Cellules Souches : travail à la frontière de la gériatrie biomédicale	Biomedical research in the field of stem cells and regenerative medicine promise a wide array of revolutionary therapeutic applications for many diseases. Yet for some those advances could serve other purposes, particularly in regards to the biological improvement of humans, means of control and even the reversing of aging process. Many of those who share these ideas belong to a movement called transhumanism. Some of these actors are actively involved in scientific research and steer it in accord with their personal values. Up to a point were they reach the outer limits of science into what we can only describe as pseudoscience. Based on the concepts of confined research / research in the wild, hybrid forum and boundary work, this master thesis explores the role of transhumanist researchers involved in institutional scientific research by questioning their ways and means. For this analysis, we produced a transhumanist documentary corpus on stem cells and studied the relations of transhumanist researchers as a network. This study provides a new perspective on the transhumanist movement. We agrue that transhumanist researchers are not confined to the representations of their ideas and values through discourse, but actively partake in the achievement of transhumanist’s objectives by conducting research within institutional scientific research structures.

901	Théorie du langage et esthétique totalisante dans l’œuvre poétique de Christophe Tarkos	This dissertation takes as its object the tie between self-reflexivity and aesthetic form in the poetry of Christophe Tarkos, produced in the 1990s. It highlights the relationship between the development of a theory of language within his poetic oeuvre and aims to illustrate its “totalizing” aesthetics. “Theory” is understood as the combination of reflections, meditations and concepts about language and poetry. This thesis endeavors to identify the generating principles in his poetic oeuvre, which are inscribed within the crisis of representation often seen as originating in the mid- nineteenth century. By revisiting this crisis of representation, Tarkos’s poetry can been seen as being located in a historicity. My thesis attempts to interpret this revisiting process through an analysis of a poetic form that gives shape to the world and to individual memory. My assumption is that the theory of language facilitates the intelligibility of his poetry because it provides a reflexive medium. My thesis, which favors a method based on textual analysis, is divided into three parts. The first provides a review of the critical reception of the work, in which I track major lines of interpretation, ranging from Christian Prigent to Jean-Michel Espitallier. Placing Tarkos within the French poetic field allows me to position my research within the commonplace of criticism. The second part investigates the theory of language in his manifestos (Le Signe =, Manifeste chou, Ma langue est poétique et La poésie est une intelligence) that reveal several principles, powers and limits of language and poetry. In order to demonstrate the specificity of the concept of « pâte- mot » (a dough of words) developed by Tarkos, I compare it to the poet Danielle Collobert’s figurative representation of « dough », as « paste ». The third part offers a study of the will and “totalizing” aesthetic present in the work of Tarkos, which seeks to shape the real. Indeed, poetry answers to the excess of the real by various strategies. While wanting to represent his brimming nature through a language akin to logorrhea or by using methods such as repetition, it also seeks to control it in stable textual forms such as « squared » fragments of prose (Carrés, Caisses), in enumerative lists (Anachronisme) or in networks of figures. Tarkos’s willingness to “totalize” also seems to be rooted in a sense of urgency concerning, ultimately, a battle against finitude.

902	L'Aufklärung kantienne : une quête d'autonomie	"Michel Foucault pointed out that there is in the design of the European Enlightenment a tension between the ""growing autonomy"" and ""growth capacity"" by science and technology (Foucault, 1994, p. 83). Now, in ""What is Enlightenment?"" Kant clearly favors the first part, autonomy, as evidenced by its definition: ""out of man's status as such, where he maintains through his own fault."" It is bound to admit, however, that autonomy as expressed in the ""think for yourself"" requires access to public space, because freedom of thought implies the possibility of publishing one’s opinions and to think with others. Kant's text evokes the political conditions for free access to the ""reading public"". It is therefore important that the enlightened despot, namely Frederick the Great, ruled at least in a republican spirit by holding a public space free of censorship. It is also important that he should refrain from interfering in religious matters. It is no coincidence that the theme of freedom of religious conscience occupies a large place in Kant's text, because the temptation is great for political authority to violate this freedom and exploit religion for political purposes."

903	Imaginaire sécuritaire et alliances militaires	"Does NATO membership shape the security imaginary? Through a discourse analysis of Australian and French authorized speakers on the subject of the war in Afghanistan (2001-2012) this dissertation compares the security imaginary of these two states in terms of their relationship with NATO. Accounting for the narrative surrounding the operating framework (Chapter 1), the representation of the enemy (Chapter 2) as well as the designation of the threat (Chapter 3), security imaginary allows a better understanding of foreign policy decisions. Comparing France’s security imaginary, which is a NATO member, with Australia’s, which is not, reveals that Australia shares a security imaginary similar to France’s. Thus, NATO membership does not seem to have an impact on security imaginary. The analysis suggests that both governments (re)produce a discourse in which they seek to increase the discursive space between a barbaric ""them"" and a magnified ""us""."

904	La genèse et le développement des partis politiques au Bas-Canada (1791-1840)	This thesis investigates the development of political parties and the origin of party loyalty in the legislative Assembly in Lower-Canada between 1791 and 1840. To do so, this thesis conducts a systemic analysis of the legislative behaviour of the Members of Parliament (MPs) with the loyalty index and the Optimal classification developed by Poole (2005). It demonstrates that language is the most salient issue of division among MPs in the first Parliaments, and that constitutional issues (reformists against conservatives) are the primary causes of conflict in the two last Parliaments. Moreover, we found that there is no clear divide between MPs according to their social status, the type of district in which they are elected, their occupation or their parliamentary experience. Finally, we also hypothesize that Members of Parliament do not tend to organize along party lines; instead they vote according to their individual preferences.

905	Quel sens faut-il donner à l’universalité de l’herméneutique chez Gadamer? : sa légitimité face aux critiques de Jürgen Habermas	The historical distance that separates us from the publication of Truth and Method allows a better understanding of the universal aspect of hermeneutics defended by Hans-Georg Gadamer and which sparked so much debate immediately after the publication of his book. The hermeneut has indeed had the opportunity, in several texts he has written over the past decades, to specify his conception and better establish this universality, particularly by associating it with the universality of rhetoric itself. A survey of the various debates surrounding this universality claim of hermeneutics also helps to get a better picture of what is at stake. This essay looks at the meaning of universality of hermeneutics by considering the decisive sections of Truth and Method devoted to it, the later writings of Gadamer on the issue and the secondary literature to see if this claim to universality can be upheld against the criticism raised by Jürgen Habermas. We will argue in this paper that this is the case, but also that Habermas's criticism has helped Gadamer to better formulate and defend the universality of hermeneutics. It is precisely by taking into account the contribution of those who think differently that this universality of hermeneutics is demonstrated.

906	Séparation, détection et caractérisation de nanoparticules manufacturées dans des eaux naturelles et usées avec la chromatographie hydrodynamique et de multiples détecteurs	Due to the widespread use of engineered nanoparticles (ENP), regulatory agencies are very concerned about their fate and their impacts on the environment and on human health. The development of analytical techniques, which will allow the detection, characterization and quantification of ENP in environmental matrices, is therefore critical in order to properly evaluate the exposure associated with these emerging pollutants.  One promising approach to detect and quantify the nanoparticles is to couple a chromatographic technique to a sensitive detector in order to: (i) reduce matrix effects; (ii) identify nanoparticles from their retention times and (iii) quantify the ENP at environmentally relevant concentrations. Consequently, the coupling of hydrodynamic chromatography (HDC) was performed with both on-line and off-line detectors (light scattering detectors, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer in its single particle mode (SP-ICPMS) and an analytical ultracentrifuge).  HDC was first used for the characterization of ENP standards. Separation conditions were optimized for standard nanoparticle suspensions of polystyrene, gold and silver, which allowed us to confirm that the separation was occurring, based on hydrodynamic size, as predicted by theory. By coupling the HDC column to the ICPMS detector in its ‘‘single particle’’ mode, it was possible to separate an ENP mixture and to detect the nanoparticles at environmental concentrations, i.e., in the μg L-1 to ng L-1 range. For example, in a wastewater sample (effluent wastewater), a mixture of two silver nanoparticles (nAg) of 40 and 80 nm were separated and the nAg were detected by SP-ICPMS at retention times of 25.2 and 25.6 minutes. Diameters of 71.4 nm and 52.0 nm were found. HDC-SP-ICPMS analysis carried out on different non-spiked wastewater samples allowed us to conclude that nAg was below the detection limit of 0.1 µg L-1.

907	Asymétries fonctionnelles du cortex visuel observées par spectroscopie proche de l’infrarouge fonctionnelle	The present study aimed to further investigate retinotopic mapping and functional asymmetries within the human visual cortex using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), as well as the reliability of this technique. As expected, results showed a  stronger visual cortical activation in the controlateral hemisphere and in the inverse upper/lower quadrant to the stimulation. We also measured significant stronger activations in the upper visual cortex (when lower hemifield stimuli were presented) compared to activations in the lower visual cortex (when upper hemifield stimuli were showed), especially when the visual stimulation was presented in the right visual field. This is the first study to confirm the vertical and horizontal asymmetries of the visual cortex with fNIRS technique. The present work also settles the reliability of this technique for functional mapping of the human brain.	retinotopic mapping , primary visual cortex , functional asymmetries , vertical asymmetry , horizontal asymmetry , fnirs , optical imaging	en	11588.0
908	Favoriser le transfert de connaissance des infirmières par des dîners-causeries de formation continue	Despite the advancements seen in nursing knowledge, there still remains a large gap between available scientific evidence and clinical practice (Marzuki, Hassan, Wichaikhum & Nantsupawat, 2011). In collaboration with trainers, this internship was dedicated to the development of continuing education luncheons for nurses and nursing assistants. These were held on a trial basis in the pnemology unit of Cité-de-la-Santé Laval hospital. These luncheon sessions were collaborative and integrative of the staff. The objective of these was to promote the amelioration and augmentation of both the knowledge and clinical skill set of the nurses working in the pnemology unit. In these sessions, participants were introduced to the concept of knowledge transfer. This was made in an attempt to encourage the clinicians to make a change in their clinical practice; guided by the Knowledge to Action framework written by Graham, Tetroe and Straus (2009). Those caregivers have shown appreciation for the opportunity to have been part of this project.

909	Stratégie organisationnelle à l'attention des gestionnaires visant la promotion de la santé des infirmières en contexte de décès périnatal	The death of a child during pregnancy or in the days after birth is an event that affects nurses. Exposed to the intense emotions of parents, nurses in perinatal settings may find themselves simultaneously providing care for the family while managing their own emotional responses. This particular work environment can affect the mental health of nurses working there. The existing literature also recognizes that perinatal death is demanding and stressful for nurses who care for these families. Yet, few interventions aimed to improve the work environment have so far been put forward. This manuscript aims to review what is known about the psychosocial factors of the work environment when a perinatal loss occurs in perinatal setting and their effects on the health of the nurses in order to provide a strategy that can contribute to the mitigation of these stressors. Karasek and Theorell (1990) Demands Control Support model guided the entire reflection with its central concepts, namely: job demands, control and support of the organization and colleagues. Findings revealed that Organizations should improve their support and better prepare nurses so they can face the challenges of perinatal death and the care of the bereaved families. In order to prevent the adverse consequences of workplace stressors a strategy at Organizational level is proposed. With regard to the manuscript, our learning objectives were the integration of acquired knowledge and skills developed in the Master's program. In particular, we sought to increase and diversify our ability to show clinical leadership and to consolidate our skills related to nursing research, such as our capabilities for critical analysis of scientific research.

910	Programme de suivi de deuil pour des parents ayant un enfant décédé dans une unité de soins intensifs pédiatriques	Many child deaths occur each year in pediatric intensive care units in Quebec. Deaths in intensive care are sudden and unexpected and this brings very significant consequences for the parents and the child's family. Very little support is offered to bereaved families, even if it seems to be a concern for many professionals. The nurse can act in different ways to the bereaved parents. To provide a better understanding of parental grief and needs of bereaved parents in intensive care and expose the different possible interventions, a review of theoretical and empirical literature was conducted. An integrative literature review, based on the framework and Knalf Whittemore (2005) has identified interventions during the mourning period that inspired the development of a bereavement follow-up program for a period of one year for parents who lose a child to pediatric intensive care. The framework consists of two models: the dual process model (Stroebe and Schult, 1999) and family systems approach (Wright and Leahey, 2013). Tools are proposed for the implementation of interventions in nursing practice.

912	"Dialogues des cultures et esthétiques dans les ""musiques improvisées"""	This memoire treat about a specific musical practice which is free improvisation, and which appeared during the second half of the twentieth century in western art music and with the free jazz wave/trend. Frequently referred by the term « improvised music », we will first go through some definitions from authors in musicology to show the different underlying problematic of the term. We will return to the duality of the origins of free improvisation practice in order to explain why such duality caused confusion in musicology studies. We will then look at some specific aspects concerning multicultural and esthetic pluralism in free improvisation. We will try to bring forth some explanations from our analysis of the cultural roots of free improvisation. Furthermore, we will address the question of transculturation, a recent concept frequently used during the last fifteen years in improvised music studies and which had never been deeply studied.

913	Modulation de l'expression de Sirt-1 induite par l'endothéline-1 dans les cellules musculaires lisses vasculaires	Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are associated with several vascular dysfunctions such as heart failure and hypertension. These phenomena cause increased synthesis of endothelin-1 (ET-1), a neuropeptide, synthesized by endothelial cells which has vasoconstrictor action on vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). Overexpression of this vasopeptide leads eventually to hypertension (HTA). This usually happen after atherosclerosis or restenosis, leading to proliferation and migration of VSMC from media to intima.  It was shown that during atherosclerosis, the protein sirtuin-1 (Sirt-1), a member of protein histone deacetylases (HDAC), has an anti-atherosclerotic effect due to its ability to diminish proliferation and migration of VSMC. It has also been observed that during hypertension, Sirt-1 was poorly expressed in VSMC. Its role in vascular pathophysiology remains sparsely studied, therefore it’s essential to explore it. In the present study we investigated the expression of Sirt-1 in VSMC isolated from the ascending aorta of rats, in response to ET-1 stimulation. We observed that Sirt-1 expression decreases after 1 hour of stimulation by ET-1 via ETA receptors. In summary, these results suggest that the ability of ET-1 to attenuate Sirt-1 expression in VSMC, may be a potential mechanism for promoting CVD.

914	Approches thérapeutiques de la carcinose péritonéale d’origine appendiculaire récidivante	Background: Additional treatment in patients presenting recurrent peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) has been much overlooked in the literature. The aim of this study is to assess the effects of additional treatment in patients with recurrent disease despite a first CRS with HIPEC. Methods: Since 2003, data from all patients with PC arising from the appendix treated in our center were prospectively collected. Treatment of primary disease consisted in CRS followed by hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) with oxaliplatin. When recurrent disease occurred, second CRS followed by HIPEC with mitomycin C were offered to patients meeting some selection criteria. Results: A total of 58 patients underwent CRS followed by HIPEC with oxaliplatin. During follow-up, 22 patients developed recurrent disease (39%). Peritoneum was the most common site of treatment failure. In the entire series, histologic grades and completeness of CRS were significant independent predictors of disease-free survival. Among patients with recurrent disease (n=22), eight patients underwent second CRS followed by HIPEC with mitomycin C, one patient received a CRS alone, and thirteen patients had unresectable disease. Mean overall survival for patients who received a second treatment (n=8) was 28 months. Morbidity and mortality rates following second CRS and HIPEC were 25% and 0%, respectively. Conclusions: CRS followed by HIPEC remains a possible intervention in patients with recurrent disease, but some selection criteria should be applied in order to maximise survival and minimise morbidity and mortality of this approach.

915	L'impact de la commotion cérébrale d'origine sportive sur la capacité d'imagerie mentale visuelle d'athlètes	The research is mitigated on the cognitive after-effects of a concussion. Some studies suggest the effects disappear rapidly whereas others observe a continuation in their manifestation. However, no research has been done to indicate whether a cognitive task like mental imagery brings out these effects following a concussion. This study will evaluate the effects of sport-related concussions on object and spatial visual mental imagery of athletes. To achieve this goal, we compare the mental imagery capacity between two groups of male football athletes of University level. The first group (n=15) with no history of concussions and the second group (n=15) with one or more concussions. We hypothesize that the non-concussed athletes visualize better than the concussed athletes. Our results invalidate our hypothesis. Both groups have similar results on the three following measures: Paper Folding Test (PFT), Visual Object Identification Task (VOIT) and Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire (VVIQ). Furthermore, the quantity of concussions and the time past since the last concussion seems to have no impact on the visual mental imagery performance of concussed athletes.

916	Le téléroman, un mode de connaissance du social : l’entrée dans la vie adulte de quatre jeunes personnages de Yamaska	Inspired by the epistemological approach of Gilles-Gaston Granger and the sociological approach of Howard Becker, this thesis focuses on Quebec’s téléroman as a mean of social knowledge. Based on the theoretical conception of entry into adult life elaborated by various researchers such as the French sociologist Olivier Galland, this research aims to assess the sociological value of the Quebec’s téléroman as a form of representation of this phenomenon. To achieve this goal, we describe the entry into adult life of four characters from the téléroman Yamaska : Geoffroy Carpentier, Olivier Brabant, Théo Carpentier and Ingrid Harrisson. By applying the theories proposed by the French sociologist Olivier Galland to these characters, our goal is to study and describe the adequacy, or inadequacy, of such a theory when applied to the experiences of young adults today broadcast in the chosen téléroman. Through the characters of Yamaska, the study aims to see how the theory fits, or not, to the television series, and investigates whether it provides additional knowledge about the phenomenon of entry into adult life. This will help us determine the type of knowledge broadcast through this TV fiction, and focus on the influence exerted on the content and the way it is broadcast by the téléroman’s structure.	téléroman , Entry into adult life , television series , Quebec , epistemology , sociology , mode of social knowledge , young adults representation	en	11541.0
917	L'influence de la sélection fréquence-dépendante sur le choix de partenaire chez le diamant mandarin (Taeniopygia guttata)	Frequency-dependant selection is an evolution mechanism in which the fitness of a type depend of its frequency in the population.  This mechanism play an important role in several interspecific (parasitism, predation, competition) and intraspecific interactions within different phenotypes of a same species. Frequency-dependant selection can be positive or negative and favor, respectively, either common or rare phenotype. This selection has been found in context of mated choice of several species, especially in insects (damselfly, drosophila, soldier beetle) and fishes (guppy, swordtail) and it has even been recently discover in humans. The significance of frequency-dependent selection in mated choice of monogamous species is still less explored and this study used the zebra finches (a monogamous passerine) in order to explored this field. We studied the significance of this mechanism when a character is neutral and when it is rather a quality cue. Also, we attempt to establish if rivals' presence affect or modify the initial preference of females for common or rare phenotypes.

918	Capital humain et différentiel de revenu chez les artistes canadiens	The essence of human capital theory (Becker, 1964) predicts that investing in activities that aim at strenghtening the productive potential of individuals will result by an increase of their labor income all along their careers (Benjamin, Gunderson and Riddell, 2002 : 245). For the occupational group constituted by artists, the literature agrees nevertheless that investing in human capital stays lucrative but at a lower level than for other occupations (Snooks, 1983; Filer, 1990; Rengers, 2002; Alper and Wassall, 2006).     We expose human capital theory along with compensating wage differentials theory (Smith, 1776) and hedonic theory of wage (Rosen, 1974; Rosen and Thaler, 1975) with two objectives. In an empirical matter, we wish to verify the effect of human capital on the self-employment income of canadiens artists. On the other hand, we are looking to evaluate the nature and size of the wage differential between artists and the other occupations, along with investigate on what grounds this one lies. This project fills an important void in canadian literature dedicated to culture, as no studies have been interested in identifying the actual determinants of artists’ labor income, even though it gives an important input about what factors are the most in demand on the cultural labor market.    We use a multivariated regression analysis on human capital variables by using canadian census data of 2006. More precisely, we tend to measure the associative effect between self-employment income expressed by the logarithm of artists’ weekly income and the following variables : the highest diploma, certificate or degree obtained, the sex, the experience on the labor market, the marital status, the occupation/artistic specialty (using the CNPS-2006) the status of immigrant, the status of visible minority, the zone of residence and the primary household provider.    The results show that education is generally associated with a higher labor income for artists, but that particular education profiles depending on the artistic specialty will generate even higher income. The yield of experience on labor income is less important for artists than for the other occupations, along with the fact that it is less profitable for performative artists for whom careers end earlier. Concerning the effect of sociodemographics on self-employment income, we find that being a male is associated with higher income but to a lower level than for other occupations. On a similar note, the effects of immigrant and visible minority statutes are less penalizing on artists’ labor income than for other occupations’ labor income. This suggests that cultural labor market is less discriminating than the traditional labor market.	capital , canadiens , human , earnings , differential , canadian , artists	en	11524.0
919	Étude et caractérisation de détecteurs à liquide en surchauffe	Experimental measurements show that only 4\% of the mass-energy density of the universe is made of atomic matter. Dark matter and dark energy are responsible for 24\% and 71\% of the mass-energy density. The theory of supersymmetry predicts a new set of particles. The neutralino, which is the lightest stable particle, is one of the favorite candidates for dark matter. The Project in Canada to Search for Supersymmetric Objects (PICASSO) seeks dark matter using superheated droplets detectors (SDD). A phase transition occurs when a particle interact with a C$_4$F$_{10}$ droplet and deposits enough energy within a certain critical radius. An acoustic wave is created during this phase transition and piezoelectric sensors transform this acoustic signal into an electrical signal. This signal is then amplified, digitised and recorded for further analysis. In this work is presented a study on superheated droplets detectors aiming in particular at an improvement of the alpha background discrimination. The data acquisition system has been tested in order to check the coupling between the piezoelectric sensors and the acrylic wall of the detector, the efficiency of the amplifier gain of the piezoelectric sensors and the effect of the gain on the quality of the signal. The SIMPLE (Superheated Instrument for Massive ParticLe Experiments) experiment stated that they could obtain a 97\% discrimination of the alpha background using superheated droplets detectors and electric microphones. This work concludes that PICASSO detectors are not sensitive to this effect. Finally, a small droplet detector has been studied and it has been concluded that a small droplets site does not improve the alpha background discrimination.

920	Détection de protéines par diffusion Raman exaltée par effet de pointe (TERS)	Measurement of the local concentration of chemical messengers secreted by cells may give a better understanding of molecular mechanisms related to different diseases, such as cancer metastasis. Current techniques are not suited to perform such measurements and thus, new analytical techniques must be developed. This Master’s thesis reports the development of a new technique based on the plasmonic response of atomic force microscopy (AFM) tips, which will ultimately allow monitoring of chemical and biological molecules on the surface of a cantilever by use of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and tip-enhanced Raman scattering (TERS). Indeed, it is possible to localize the enhancement of the Raman signal on the AFM tip using principles associated to surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), based on the absorption of light by nanometer-sized metal particles, resulting in a large enhancement of the Raman signal. The AFM tip was constructed by the deposition of a nanometer-size gold layer, followed by the assembly of a biosensor with a biomolecular receptor. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) conjugated with a secondary antibody served as the secondary detection step. In addition, the use of the gold nanoparticles for antigen detection allows an amplification of the SPR and Raman signals. This Master’s thesis will demonstrate the development and validation of a biosensor for immunoglobuline G (IgG) at the tip of an AFM cantilever.This thesis sets the basis for future projects, where this new imaging technique will be developed for monitoring cellular communication by exploiting the plasmonic signal at the AFM tip. Different biosensors will then be developed and coupled to an AFM probe for scanning the chemical environment and detect in real-time chemical messengers secreted in the extracellular matrix in cellular communication.

921	L'excision comme révélateur identitaire : l'expérience des Égyptiens ayant migré à Montréal	Excision is a widespread practice in Egypt; it is considered one of the highest places of prevalence of excised women in the world (DHS, 2009). Since 1940, many Egyptians migrate to Canada (Hayani, 1999) and choose Montreal as their host city (Gouvernement du Québec, 2014). This exploratory research concerns evolution, or not, in Egyptian’s conceptions of excision, before and after their migration in Montreal. In a context of semi-structured interview, four Egyptian men and four Egyptian women shared their migratory journey and relative experience of excision. We can notice different point of view according to their socio demographic profiles and relations with their native country. They use cleavage to protect their religious or socioeconomics groups against any association with the practice of excision. Their use of French language, in Egypt, influences their choice of migratory destination and illustrates some differences between them and other Egyptians.

922	L’universalité des émotions humaines de base : une analyse multidisciplinaire	Researchers interested in the study of emotions are generally divided into two groups - each of which possesses a different way of perceiving the emotional experience and understanding its foundations. These two groups are at the basis of two distinct schools of thoughts: that of discreet emotions and that of dimensional emotions. The former, phylogenetically inclusive, focuses on the similarities between our species and other mammals in order to find proof of the existence of universal emotional components. The latter, more phylogenetically exclusive, finds interest in the variants of emotional states, principally in our own species. The following memoir will focus on these two theoretical families and its aim will be to confront previously made hypotheses in order to answer the following question: are emotions culturally variable or are they universal?	universal emotions , transculturelle , transculturel , psychological construction , basic emotions , neuroimaging , interspecific	en	11453.0
923	Évaluation objective de la douleur chronique secondaire à l’arthrose chez le chat	Feline osteoarthritis prevalence increases with age, up to 80% in cats aged 11 years old and more. Osteoarthritis is associated with chronic pain expressing as altered behaviour and a decrease in mobility. Currently, there is no validated technique to evaluate osteoarthritis-associated chronic pain in cats. This situation leads to an absence of approved medication for the treatment of OA-associated chronic pain in cats.  Our hypothesis states that osteoarthritis-associated pain in cats is expressed as physical disabilities, neurophysiologic changes, hypersensibility, which need to be assessed to quantify adequately this pain and its impact on quality of life. Our objectives were 1) to develop a cat adapted method to assess physical disabilities using kinematics, kinetics and motor activity evaluations; 2) to describe functional and neurophysiologic changes related to osteoarthritis-associated pain, and to test a non steroidal anti-inflammatory based analgesic treatment; 3) to develop a cat adapted method to detect central sensitisation using mechanical temporal summation; 4) to test the feasibility of measuring carbohydrate brain metabolism using positron emission tomography as a marker of supraspinal changes-associated with pain chronicity.  Using objective chronic pain evaluation tools determined as sensitive and repeatable, we characterized feline osteoarthritis-associated pain. Cats afflicted with osteoarthritis presented lameness characterised by decreased joint amplitude, or decreased peak ground reaction vertical force, and decreased motor activity. Using the two latter tools, we demonstrated the efficacy of a non steroidal anti-inflammatory (meloxicam) to alleviate osteoarthritis-associated pain after four weeks of administration. Moreover, using quantitative sensory testing and brain functional imaging, we demonstrated for the first time, that osteoarthritis-associated pain in cats led to central nervous system changes. Specially, cats afflicted with osteoarthritis developed central sensitisation as indicated by a decreased von Frey withdrawal threshold (a reflex evaluation), and also by a facilitated mechanical temporal summation (an approach allowing to take into account affective and cognitive dimensions of pain). The increase of brain metabolism in the secondary somatosensory cortex, thalamus and periaqueductal grey matter also highlighted the importance of pain chronicity related changes.  Using an analgesic treatment built to alleviate osteoarthritis-associated pain will improve cats quality of life, will help veterinarians, and will benefit owners who will retrieve an active and social cat. Demonstrating both the importance of central sensitisation and assessment of brain changes related to osteoarthritis-associated chronic pain using brain functional imaging opens new research opportunities in cats (development and/or validation of hypersensitivity related treatments), and humans (potential natural model of osteoarthritis-associated pain).

924	Analyse cinématique 3D de la coordination des articulations de l'épaule par l'entremise du rythme scapulo-huméral	The shoulder is often afflicted by musculo-skeletal diseases.  However, shoulder evaluation is limited to qualitative measures affecting the specificity and accuracy of diagnosis.  Three-dimensional motion analysis could complement conventional treatment with quantitative functional measures.  The interaction between shoulder joints is estimated by the scapulo-humeral rhythm, but its pronounced variability of measurement ampers appropriate clinical use.  Hence, the main objective of the thesis was to reduce the variability in the measure of the scapulo-humeral rhythm.  The effect of the calculation method and conditions of motion (arm axial rotation, load, velocity, muscular activity) were tested on healthy subjects.  Shoulder joints kinematics were obtained with an optoelectronic system using a kinematical chain and an extended Kalman filter.     The common method of scapulo-humeral rhythm calculation extracts the angles of gleno-humeral elevation and scapulo-thoracic lateral rotation.  Since these angles are not co-planar, their sum does not correspond to the arm elevation angle.  A novel approach of joint contribution including all the rotations of each joint was developed and compared to the common method.  The common method systematically overestimated gleno-humeral contribution in comparison to the proposed method.  The new scapulo-humeral rhythm calculation allows a dynamic functional evaluation of the shoulder and reduces inter-subject variability.    Shoulder coordination was compared on typical supraspinatus rehabilitation exercises contrasting in arm axial rotation, and the effect of adding external load was tested.  The ''full-can'' exercise increased the scapulo-humeral rhythm and gleno-humeral contribution, which correspond to supraspinatus function.  In contrast, the ''empty-can'' exercise increased scapulo-thoracic contribution, which is associated to compensation to avoid gleno-humeral contribution.  The use of external load in supraspinatus rehabilitation seems justified by a similar scapulo-humeral rhythm and superior gleno-humeral elevation.    Shoulder motion is often measured or evaluated in static or dynamic and passive or active conditions.  However, the effect of these conditions on shoulder coordination remains uncertain.  The comparison of these conditions revealed significant differences on shoulder kinematics showing the importance to consider conditions of motion for acquisition or comparison of data.

925	"Impact des troubles musculosquelettiques sur les mécanismes du contrôle postural chez
les adolescents-hockeyeurs de niveau élite et intervention en Reconstruction Posturale®"	Adolescent hockey players can suffer from musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) resulting from excess muscle tension that can lead to dysmorphisms, muscle imbalances as well as inadequate standing posture. The consequences of these changes often lead to unnecessary overload of the musculoskeletal system (MSS), disturbances in postural control mechanisms and eventually the development of muscular and joint pain. Very few interventions are design to address MSD by rebalancing muscle tension. One of the clinically tested interventions is Postural Reconstruction® (PR). Our first objective was to identify the characteristics of postural control among a population of elite adolescent-hockey players when the somatosensory system is disturbed while standing in a quasi static position barefoot and on skates. Secondly, we assessed the impact of an intervention in PR on various clinical and biomechanical variables among a population of elite adolescent hockey players suffering from MSD. Sixty seven elite adolescent hockey players, 15 to 18 years of age participated in the study. The postural control of fifty seven players was assessed in standing using two force platforms, in eyes open (EO) and eyes closed (EC) conditions barefoot on hard surface and on foam. From that group, thirty five players were also assessed on skates, EO and EC. Then, nine players suffering from MSD were selected to participate in the intervention protocol in RP consisting in the application of six therapeutic sessions held once a week for six consecutive weeks. Center of pressure (COP) movements under the feet was calculated in the antero-posterior (AP) and medio-lateral (ML) directions. To account for the performance of the postural control system, mean COP velocity and displacements as well COP range were used. The variables retained to account for the strategies used to maintain balance in the upright position were weight baring asymmetry, concordance of the COP trajectory as well as COPc for the contribution of the ankle strategy and COPv for the contribution of the hip strategy. Finally, the impact of PR intervention was assessed on pain level, functional capacity and postural biomechanical variables. Our results show that among elite adolescent hockey players, the performance of the postural control in standing in a quasi static position is more disturbed by changes somatosensory information in ML direction while in AP, the absence of visual information as well as changes in somatosensory information significantly affect the performance. In all experimental conditions, and in both directions, we observed a remarkably high mean velocity, ranging between 18 to 22 mm/sec. As for the strategies, independent of the experimental condition, we observed total dominance of the ankle strategy in AP while in ML, the hip strategy dominated with a 25 % contribution for the ankle strategy. On skates, in ML direction, no significant changes were observed in the performance. However, in AP, we observed a significant increase in the mean COP velocity, EO and EC, and significant increase in COP range, EO only. As for the strategies, we observed the same dominance but the contribution on the ankle strategy in ML was more modest, that is less than 12 %. For players suffering from MSD, our results show that six sessions of PR significantly improved the level of pain, functional capacity and body alignment in standing. Pre intervention in ML, we observed a significantly higher contribution of the ankle strategy to the control of the COPnet and post-intervention, a return to normal values. The impact of the PR intervention on postural control performance was not significant in ML and AP. In conclusion, our results show that in the early stage, a PR intervention has a greater impact on postural control stratégies rather than performance.

926	Relations entre la mobilité, la condition physique et les fonctions cognitives dans une perspective de vieillissement sain	Introduction – Aging is characterized by an increase in the energy cost of locomotion (ECL) and a decrease in maximal oxygen uptake (V ̇O2max). It also appears that neuromuscular performances are jeopardized in older adults. Taken together, these phenomena contribute to a slower gait speed, which could reduce quality of life. Moreover, it was shown that cognition was also a key determinant of mobility performances. Indeed, the ability to execute simultaneously two tasks (motor and cognitive) was associated with a lower risk of falling. Objective – The objective of this thesis was to specify the relationships between mobility, physical fitness and cognition in a perspective of healthy aging. Results – A study was conducted to clarify the ECL testing methods. Results demonstrate a higher ECL when testing occurs on a treadmill in comparison to an overground measure. Moreover, it was shown that the association level was unsatisfying between the two testing modes. It was concluded that, when a treadmill testing is necessary, a complementary functional walking test should be implemented to increase external validity in data interpretation. Afterwards, a cross-sectional analysis was used to determine the physical fitness factors associated with better cognitive and mobility performances. Along with V ̇O2max, higher levels of strength were related to the fastest individuals both in mobility and in cognitive flexibility. Also, it was shown that clinical tests like the Timed up and go and the maximal walking speed over 10 meters were able to distinguish individuals with poorer physical fitness and cognitive performances. Finally, an intervention study was proposed to verify the effects of a combined aerobic and strength training program on physical fitness and cognition. It was hypothesized that reducing the ECL and increasing V ̇O2max would induce better cognitive performances during a dual-task (motor and cognitive). Results showed that this intervention improved inhibition performances. However, data also suggested that a training program aiming for gross motor abilities development was as efficient as the fitness training intervention to improve inhibition. Conclusion – Taken together, these results confirm the relevance of a complete physical fitness assessment in an healthy aging perspective including both aerobic and neuromuscular components. Convenient clinical tests are also proposed to establish a first physical and cognitive diagnosis, which will be confirmed by subsequent more exhaustive tests. Moreover, it was suggested that many interventions were leading to better cognitive performances. Along with aerobic and strength training which is a privileged method to improve physical fitness, programs aiming for gross motor abilities development could also be implemented, especially in a context where individuals are particularly sedentary.

927	Étude qualitative sur l'intégration en milieu de garde d'enfants adoptés de l'international : points de vue des parents et des éducatrices	Research on internationally adopted children is often directed toward catch-up after adoption, attachment security and over representation of adopted children in special needs education. These are quantitative studies which focus on school aged children. Few studies have considered preschoolers and to our knowledge no attention has been given to the daycare environment. Within an exploratory framework, the current thesis investigates the integration of adopted children in daycare through the subjective experience of parents and child care educators. Twelve adoptive families and their current child care educators were recruited through various adoptive parent associations, the Montréal pour enfants newspaper, daycare administrators and a blog on international adoption. Semi-structured individual interviews were conducted with each family and child care educator. Qualitative inductive analysis using grounded theory coding techniques was first used to uncover critical themes discussed by the parent-educator dyads and then through their respective groups. The following themes on integrating an adopted child in daycare emerged from the data: conditions prior to the arrival of the child in daycare, parent’s apprehensions, first contacts, special requests, daycare routine, adopted child development and particularities, child in crisis, new perspectives for the educator, elements of parent satisfaction and dissatisfaction. The analysis shows that most educators do not consider the adopted child to be different from the other children in the group; and thus the child’s integration does not necessitate special attention or consideration. Adoptive parents along with a small group of educators experienced with the realities of adoption do not share this view. By exploring the experiences of parents and educators of internationally adopted children in daycare, this thesis broadens our knowledge of better practices in daycare centers for integrating an internationally adopted child.

928	Propriétés géométriques des surfaces associées aux solutions des modèles sigma grassmanniens en deux dimensions	In this Ph. D. thesis, we analyze the geometric properties of surfaces obtained from the classical solutions of the two-dimensional bosonic and supersymmetric sigma models which has Grassmann manifolds G(m,n) as target space. In particular, we consider the metric, the fundamental forms and the gaussian curvature induced by these surfaces which naturally live in the su(n) Lie algebra.   The first chapter presents some preliminary tools to understand the elements of the following chapters. We present non-abelian gauge theories and bosonic grassmannian sigma models as well as its supersymmetric counterpart. Another section presents a construction of surfaces in the Lie algebra su(n) from the solutions of the bosonic sigma models.  The three last chapters contained in this thesis presents the constraints that have to be imposed on the solutions of the models in order to generate constant gaussian curvature surfaces. From these constraints, we can give a classification of the solutions depending on the possible values of the curvature. The first two papers presents an investigation of these surfaces and of their associated solutions for the bosonic grassmannian sigma models. In the third paper, we generalize our approach to a supersymmetric extension of the bosonic CP^(n-1)= G(1,n) sigma model including some results for the general Grassmann manifold G(m,n).  In chapter 2, we study the geometric properties of surfaces associated to holomorphic solutions of the grassmannian sigma models. We give a complete classification of these constant curvature solutions for the particular models G(2,n) with n=3,4,5. Furthermore, we establish two conjectures on the possible values of the gaussian curvature. We also give some elements of proof for these conjectures in terms of Plücker coordinates and immersions as well as Veronese curves. These results are published in the Journal of Geometry and Physics.  The third chapter presents a similar analysis as in the second chapter in the case of non-holomorphic solutions of the bosonic grassmannian sigma models. This work generalizes the results obtained in the first paper and give a systematic algorithm to obtain such surfaces from the known solutions of the models. These results are published in the Journal of Geometry and Physics.  In the last chapter of this thesis, we consider a N=2 supersymmetric extension of the bosonic sigma model which has the CP^(n-1)=G(1,n) manifold as target space. This chapter presents a geometric description of the surfaces obtained from the solutions of the model and shows, in the holomorphic case, that they have constant gaussian curvature if and only if the solutions consists of a generalization of the Veronese curve. Furthermore, using a gauge invariant formulation of the model in terms of orthogonal projectors, we obtain explicit non-holomorphic solutions and study the geometry of their associated surfaces. These results are submitted to Communications in Mathematical Physics.

929	La modification des pratiques journalistiques et du contenu des nouvelles télévisées, du quotidien à la situation de crise : analyse France/Québec	"This thesis focuses on the news coverage during abrupt and unexpected events, due to ""a very difficult situation, even dangerous, for an individual, an organization, a social body, an economic system or a country""  and aims to determine in what ways journalistic practices and media contents in a crisis situation differ from ordinary daily practices. The assumption on which this thesis rests is that in a crisis situation, journalistic practices will be affected by emotions, the spur of the moment and the search for exclusivity. Regarding content, there will be saturation of certain issues related to the crisis, while many daily topics will be removed and the risk of errors or inaccuracies will be exacerbated. This doctoral work follows the path of a comparison between France and Quebec, as both countries share a language and similar TV channel structure, which allows us to establish valid comparison bases. To answer the question of the research, a triple methodological strategy was adopted and the results of these analyses are presented in subsequent chapters of the thesis. First are presented the results of semi-structured interviews we conducted, in the form of professional life stories, with different actors from the information sector. These are followed by the results of a quantitative content analysis of television news which is based on a corpus formed of reports presented during three types of crises in France and in Quebec: ""social"" crises, ""natural"" crises and ""mixed"" crises. These reports were submitted to the grid analysis from George Gerbner’s project ""Television Around the World"". Finally, a content analysis of 1,676 decisions from the jurisprudence of the Quebec Press Council was conducted. This analysis offered the opportunity to examine a certain amount of complaints relating to crisis situations, to observe the objections raised in these complaints and to analyze the different trends with respect to the complainants, the respondents and the decisions of the Quebec media self-regulatory body. The complexity of the definition and understanding of crises results from these various analyzes and poses many challenges to the news professionals who regularly face this type of situations, since they play a major role in media programming.  In the two countries analyzed, crisis coverage is presented in a very self centric way, while the main elements that attract the attention of journalists are those related to their country of origin. Nevertheless, the choice of themes and the angle of treatment are quite similar from one country to another and journalists tend to focus on the same issues and to put forward the same type of elements in the situations we observed. There are therefore very clear practices that appear when it comes to address crises in the media. By identifying these, this thesis lays the foundations of a critical reflection on the place made to crises in the information world and reveals an insufficient number of ethical tools essential to the work of journalists as well as a lack of reflection and perspective on the emphasis given to some topics in the news."

930	Quelle transparence pour le commerce équitable ?	According to different opinion polls, French consumers lack information on fair trade products, albeit certification and labels existing on these products. Labelled fair trade products can be considered as credence goods. Moreover, the impacts of fair trade on the welfare of small producers remain controversial among researchers. Fair trade products are thus also prone to shared uncertainty regarding the global impacts on small producers, and fair trade products can also be considered as indeterminate goods. Faced with this important quality uncertainty, this paper questions the necessity to develop more transparency of fair trade towards consumers.	philosophy , ethics , economics , fair trade labels , information asymmetry , shared uncertainty , transparency , philosophy , ethics , economics	en	11357.0
931	Déterminants moléculaires de la scoliose idiopathique de l'adolescent	Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is the most common form of scoliosis that affects 3-4% of the global pediatric population. In more than 85% of cases, no specific cause can be identified. Such cases are called idiopathic and occur mostly during adolescence. AIS affects mainly females in number and severity. Over the past years, many hypotheses were proposed to explain the etiology of AIS, including genetic, biochemical, mechanics, neurological, muscular and hormonal factors. Several studies have reported a high incidence of scoliosis in some families, which argues for a genetic cause of this disease. We demonstrated that AIS patients have a Gi protein signaling defect and exhibit high levels of circulating Osteopontin (OPN). The goal of this thesis is to identify the mechanisms regulating OPN signaling activity in AIS patients. We have used a candidate gene driven approach and discovered that protein tyrosine phosphatase μ (PTP μ) regulates α5β1 integrin (a known OPN receptor) through phosphate kinase type 1 gamma (PIPK1γ). To achieve our goal, we have used primary osteoblast cell cultures derived from AIS patients and biopsies from control subjects. Bone specimens were obtained intraoperatively from vertebras (varying from T3 to L4 according to the surgical procedure performed) while with trauma cases used as non-scoliotic controls, bone specimens were obtained from other anatomical sites (tibia, femur or iliac crest). Expression profiles of the RPTPM gene (encoding for PTPμ) were studied by qPCR. On the other hand, PTPμ protein levels were determined by immunoprecipitation followed by western blot. To evaluate the role of this protein in AIS etiopathogenesis, we took advantage of an animal model exhibiting a higher scoliosis incidence when maintained in a bipedal state. [1], [2] Bipedal surgeries were performed on C57Bl/6 mice after weaning (5-weeks after birth) by amputation of the forelimbs and tail under anesthesia as reported by Oyama et al. (2006). [1] We used the same approach with PTPμ knockout mice and primary osteoblast culture were derived from the spine of these mice to assess Gi protein signaling through a functional assay termed Cellular Dielectric Spectroscopy (CDS). Bipedal PTPμ knockout mice develop scoliosis more often (85%) in number and severity, than control C57Bl/6 bipedal mice (55%). Interestingly, functional analysis of osteoblasts derived from PTPμ KO mice by CDS method showed a flaw in the transmission of Gi protein coupled receptor signaling similar to a specific AIS patient subgroup. Furthermore, the clinical relevance of PTPμ was strengthened by the fact that a decrease in the gene expression level of PTPμ was observed in 34 AIS patients when compared to 17 control subjects. Such a decrease was also confirmed at the protein level. We demonstrated that genetic deletion of PTPμ enhances the incidence and severity of scoliosis without affecting plasma levels of OPN or the expression of its receptors. In contrast, increased interaction of OPN with β1 integrin was noticed in cells depleted of PTPμ. Furthermore, reduction of Gi- protein coupled receptor GiPCR signaling by OPN was also enhanced in these cells, while their response to GiPCR stimulation was improved with siRNA of phosphatidylinositol-phosphate kinase type 1 gamma (PIPK1γ), a PTPμ substrate that favours ligand binding to integrins. These studies provide the first indication that the loss of PTPμ influences the nature of idiopathic scoliosis, possibly by amplifying the inhibitory effect of OPN on GiPCR signaling. This study allows a better understanding of AIS etiology and could have an impact for the future development of innovative diagnostic methods and eventual pharmacological approaches in order to prevent AIS and stop its progression in affected children.

932	Évaluation économique des services écosystémiques dans la région de Montréal : analyse spatiale et préférences exprimées	Ecosystem services (ES) refer to benefits produced and sustained by biodiversity and ecosystems that benefit humans. In many cases, they are not considered in the economic system. This externalization of SE generates decisions on land use and natural resources that ignore their contribution to the well-being of communities. In order to raise awareness of the importance of ES and better integrate them into decision-making processes, economic approaches to value ES have been developed. In this thesis, we sought to understand both how the past and current land use in the Montreal area affects the value of ES and how these natural amenities are perceived and valued by the population in a future planning and management perspective. To accomplish this, we used two approaches: spatial analysis using geographic information systems and analysis of stated preferences by survey techniques. In the spatial analysis approach, we combined cartographic analyzes to monetary values associated to ES published in the literature. We then estimated the value of ecosystems using benefit transfer, direct market prices and avoided costs methods. This approach has allowed us to understand the relationship between the current land use in the Greater Montreal and the economic value of the services provided by ecosystems, which we estimated at 2.2 billion dollars per year. It also allowed us to estimate the effects of land use changes between 1960 and 2010 on the value of ES. We showed that despite different land use planning policies implemented to manage urban sprawl during this period, non-market economic losses related to ES have reached 236 million dollars per year.  In the stated preferences approach, we used two methods, contingent valuation and choice experiment, with the aim of measuring the willingness to pay of respondents for proposed changes in their environment. In a first study, we showed that respondents significantly value the impact of agri-environmental practices on the quality of the environment and landscapes and are willing to pay between 159 and 333 dollars per household per year on improving the diversity of agricultural landscape. In a second study, their willingness to pay on improving the status of wetlands in Quebec is estimated at between 389 and 455 dollars per household per year. The combined use of the two methods allowed us to compare the results. We also demonstrated that the choice of valuation question format in contingent valuation affects the convergence of the results. Finally, we propose directions for future research related to the integration of ecological, economic and political analyzes of ES that would lead to better assessments of the dynamics of ecosystems, biodiversity and human communities.

933	Role Clarification Processes for Better Integration of Nurse Practitioners into Primary Healthcare Teams: A Multiple-Case Study	Role clarity is a crucial issue for effective interprofessional collaboration. Poorly defined roles can become a source of conflict in clinical teams and reduce the effectiveness of care and services delivered to the population. Our objective in this paper is to outline processes for clarifying professional roles when a new role is introduced into clinical teams, that of the primary healthcare nurse practitioner (PHCNP). To support our empirical analysis we used the Canadian National Interprofessional Competency Framework, which defines the essential components for role clarification among professionals. A qualitative multiple-case study was conducted on six cases in which the PHCNP role was introduced into primary care teams. Data collection included 34 semistructured interviews with key informants involved in the implementation of the PHCNP role. Our results revealed that the best performing primary care teams were those that used a variety of organizational and individual strategies to carry out role clarification processes. From this study, we conclude that role clarification is both an organizational process to be developed and a competency that each member of the primary care team must mobilize to ensure effective interprofessional collaboration.

934	Phylogéographie comparée de la souris à pattes blanches et de la souris sylvestre, deux vecteurs de la maladie de Lyme au Québec	My study aims to assess the spread of an emerging zoonosis in Québec, Lyme disease, as a consequence of global warming. The pathogen responsible for this infection, Borrelia burgdorferi, is transmitted through a tick parasite, Ixodes scapularis, increasingly common in Québec due to the elevation of the average temperature of the atmosphere over the past decades. Since the tick has a very limited dispersal capacity, it is expected that its dispersion is linked to that of its primary host, the white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus). I first described the species involved, their ecology and role in this three-level system (host / pathogen / vector). Then, using mitochondrial DNA sequences, I compared the phylogeography of the two main mouse species in Québec, the white-footed mouse and the deer mouse (P. maniculatus). Analyses of trees and haplotype networks revealed significant differences in the genetic structure, and thus showed that populations of P. leucopus are expanding in southern Québec. This study finally allowed making assumptions on the pattern of establishment of Lyme disease in Québec.

935	Destins des S-RNases et interactions moléculaires dans le tube pollinique dans le cadre de l’auto-incompatibilité gamétophytique chez Solanum chacoense	Self-incompatibility (SI) is a prezygotic reproductive barrier that allows the pistil of a flower to specifically reject their own (self-) pollen. SI systems can help prevent self-fertilization and avoid inbreeding. In gametophytic SI (GSI), the genotype of the pollen determines its breeding behaviour and in this system both female and male specificity determinants of SI are under the control of a multigenic and multiallelic locus called the S-locus. In Solanaceae, the female determinant of SI is a highly polymorphic stylar-expressed extracellular glycoprotein with RNase activity called the S-RNase. S-RNases show a distinct pattern of two hypervariable (HVa and HVb) regions, responsible for their allelic specificity, and five highly conserved regions (C1 to C5) thought to be involved in either the catalytic activity or the structural stabilization of the protein. In this work, we analyzed and characterized several conserved features of the S-RNases and also identified a potential novel S-RNase interactant in Solanum chacoense.  The aim of our first study was to investigate the role of the C4 region of S-RNases. To test the hypothesis that the C4 region may be involved in S-RNase folding or stability, we examined a mutant in which the four charged residues in the C4 region were replaced with glycine. This mutant did not accumulate to detectable levels in styles, supporting a structural role for C4. To test the possibility that C4 might be involved in binding another protein, we prepared an R115G mutant, in which a charged amino acid was eliminated to reduce any potential binding to this region. This mutant had no effect on the pollen rejection phenotype of the protein, and thus C4 is likely not involved in either ligand binding or S-RNase entry inside pollen tubes. Finally, a K113R mutant, in which the only conserved lysine residue in all the S-RNases was replaced with arginine, was generated to test if this residue was an S-RNase ubiquitination site. However, S-RNase degradation was not disrupted in this mutant. Taken together, these results indicate that the C4 region likely plays a structural role.  In a second study, we analyzed the role of S-RNase glycosylation. All S-RNases share a conserved glycosylation site in the C2 region. To test the possibility that the sugar residues might be a target for ubiquitination, a transgenic S11-RNase lacking its single glycosylation site was examined. This construct behaved similarly to a wild type S11-RNase, demonstrating that the lack of glycosylation does not confer constitutive pollen rejection. To determine if the introduction of an N-linked glycan in the HVa region would affect pollen rejection, a construct containing a second N-glycosylation site inside the HVa region of the S11-RNase and a construct containing only that N-glycosylation site inside the HVa region were prepared. The first construct rejected S11 pollen normally, but surprisingly, plants expressing the construct lacking the C2 glycosylation site rejected both S11 and S13 pollen. We propose that the non-glycosylated form is a dual specific allele, similar to a previously described dual-specific allele that also had amino acid replacements in the HV regions. Interestingly, this phenotype is not observed in the mutant containing two glycosylation sites, which suggests that the sugar residues are not removed during S-RNase entry into the pollen.  In the final study, S-RNase-binding assays were performed with pollen extracts to detect potential interacting proteins. We found that concanavalin A-immobilized S11-RNase bound eEF1A, a component of the eukaryotic translational machinery. This interaction was validated by pull-down experiments using a GST-tagged S. chacoense eEF1A. We also found that a previously documented actin binding to eEF1A was markedly increased in the presence of S-RNases, although S-RNases alone do not bind actin. Lastly, we observed that actin in incompatible pollen tubes has an unusual aggregated form which also co-labels with S-RNases. This suggests that binding between S-RNases and eEF1A could provide a potential functional link between the S-RNase and the alteration of the actin cytoskeleton that occurs during the SI reaction. Furthermore, if eEF1A binding to S-RNases acted to titrate the amount of free S-RNase in the pollen tube, this binding may help explain the threshold phenomenon, where a minimum quantity of S-RNase in the style is required to trigger the SI reaction.

936	L’exploration des incitatifs et des obstacles à entreprendre des études universitaires dans le cadre d’un cursus intégré DEC-BAC en sciences infirmières	Quebec nurses do not require a bachelor’s degree in order to obtain their license to practice. Choosing the college diploma entitles nurses to obtain a bachelor’s degree in two years instead of three by doing a DEC-BAC in nursing. Although many studies have shown the positive impact of having a greater number of baccalaureate-level nurses in the health care system, (Aiken, Clarke, Cheung, Sloane & Silber, 2003 ; Kane, Shamliyan, Mueller, Duval & Wilt, 2007 ; Tourangeau, Cranley & Jeffs, 2006 ; Aiken et al., 2014) the majority of nursing students choose not to enroll in university studies. The goal of the present study was to explore the incentives and obstacles to engage in university studies in the context of an integrated DEC-BAC curriculum.  Fifty-six new CEGEP graduates completed a self-administered open-ended questions survey on the Internet. The theoretical framework used to guide this exploratory study was the transition middle-range theory of Meleis, Sawyer, Im, Hilfinger Messias and Schumacher (2010). Following this theory, data was collected and grouped into two themes, « incentives » and « obstacles », which were then analysed in order to see if they were determined by personal, community or societal conditions. The major incentives to engaging in university studies in the context of a DEC-BAC curriculum were related to the community conditions and were found to be better anticipated working conditions and the possibility of professional development. The major obstacles found were related to personal conditions and, particularly, to an unfavorable financial or family situation. We also found that Quebec’s context influences the decision to engage in university studies. Recommendations were provided for nursing practice and education, as well as for research.	obstacles , nursing education , incentives , barriers , undergraduate studies , integrated DEC-BAC education , transition theory , Quebec	en	11264.0
937	L’analyse d’indicateurs de la qualité des soins infirmiers aux personnes ayant subi un AVC en Catalogne	Abstract Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Recovery and reduced disability after stroke depend among others factors on early diagnosis and treatment and on highly specialized care services. Clinical practice guidelines (CPG) for stroke care management were published and distributed throughout Catalonia’s health care system in 2005 to promote evidence-based good clinical practice in stroke care. In addition, three audits exploring in-hospital acute stroke care were carried out in 2005, 2007 and 2010 to assess and improve implementation of guideline-based recommendations. Adherence to these recommendations --some of which refer to nursing care-- was measured using a limited number of quality indicators or performance measures. However, analysis of these indicators did not identify factors influencing adherence to nursing recommendations or the impact of adherence on patient health outcome. Thus, the purpose of this study is to analyse indicators of the quality of nursing care for stroke patients in Catalonia. More specifically, it aims to: 1) describe adherence to nursing care recommendations in people who suffered from stroke in 2010 in Catalonia using six specific nursing care quality indicators; 2) analyse the evolution of the adherence to nursing care recommendations in the audits carried out in Catalonia in 2005, 2007 and 2010; 3) identify factors that may have influenced adherence to selected recommendations in 2010; and 4) determine the relationship between adherence to pre-specified recommendations and clinical outcome.  We performed a secondary analysis using data from the 2010 audit on stroke. This audit was conducted in 46 of the 49 public hospitals in Catalonia and included a sample of 2,190 stroke cases representing a stroke population of 10,842. The analyses show high adherence to recommendations related to completion of baseline ECG, baseline determination of blood sugar and early mobilization. Compliance with dysphagia screening improved throughout audit editions but remained sub-optimal. Adherence to mood assessment and patient/carer education were very low. High admission rates in neurology wards and in large hospitals (over 300 stroke admissions/year) are factors influencing high adherence to dysphagia screening in the analyses adjusted by patient characteristics and stroke severity. Moreover, high compliance with dysphagia screening was observed in patients at high risk of pneumonia. In addition, length of hospital stay was longer in patients who received mood assessments and shorter in patients mobilized early and in those without dysphagia. Although, adherence to certain recommendations remains very low, these results indicate progressive improvement in nursing recommendations adherence and consequently in quality of stroke care, and serve to highlight the usefulness of audits to monitor and improve stroke care quality.	stroke indicators , quality of nursing care , pneumonia , length of stay	en	11261.0
938	Interventions infirmières en regard du phénomène de l’automutilation en milieu pédopsychiatrique : étude qualitative exploratoire	Nurses in the field of child psychiatry are familiar with the phenomenon of self-harm among adolescents because, when the situation arises, they are often called upon to intervene. However, sometimes misunderstandings, misperceptions and negatives attitudes in regard to self-harm may impair their ability to work with the patients involved.  This study seeks to explore self-harm from the standpoint of nurses in child psychiatry, describe recommended nursing interventions and outline organizational-context factors that may affect the way these interventions are executed.   An exploratory qualitative research approach was adopted, and several data-gathering methods were used, including interviews with participants and a period of observation in the unit in which the study was conducted. Analysis of the verbatim records in accordance with the procedure developed by Tesch (1990) elicited seven categories of nursing interventions: helping relationships, guidance, evaluation, safety, teaching, emotions and perceptions of self-harm, and prevention of social contamination. Three categories of factors that influence these interventions also emerged: interpersonal team work, nurses’ duties in child psychiatry, and the organizational culture in which members of the care team operate.   The results of this study will help nurses better understand adolescent self-harm. The study further suggests possible approaches that might help nurses in child psychiatry improve their interventions. The findings may also make it possible for the management of institutions to bring about changes, particularly in terms of work organization and training for nurses in the field.	étude qualitative , self-mutilation , self-harm , self-injurious behaviors , psychiatry , nursing interventions , organizational context factors , adolescents , qualitative study	en	11258.0
939	Transforaminal versus intra-articular facet steroid injections for the treatment of cervical radiculopathy : a randomized, double-blinded, controlled study	Transforaminal corticosteroid injections can be performed in the management of cervical radiculopathy but carry the risk of catastrophic complications. This study compares the efficacy of transforaminal and facet corticosteroid injections at 4 weeks post treatment. We randomly assigned 56 subjects to receive CT-guided transforaminal (15 men, 13 women; mean age 52 years; range 28 – 72 years) or facet (8 men, 20 women; mean 44 years; range 26 – 60 years) injections. The primary outcome was pain severity rated on a visual analog scale (0-100). Secondary outcome measures were the Neck Disability Index and the Medication Quantitative Scale.  In the intention-to-treat and as-treated analyses, for a mean baseline score, facet injections demonstrated a significant pain score reduction of 45.3% (95%CI: 21.4; 69.2) and 37.0% (95%CI: 9.2; 64.7), while transforaminal injections showed nonsignificant pain score reduction of 9.8% (95%CI: +11.5; 31.2) and 17.8% (95%CI: +6.6; 42.2). While facet injections demonstrated an improvement in Neck Disability Index score of [24.3% (95%CI: +2.9; 51.5); 20.7% (95%CI: +6.2; 47.6),] as opposed to transforaminal injections [9.6% (95%CI: +15.2; 34.4); 12.8% (95%CI: +11.2; 36.7)], the results did not reach statistical significance. Noninferiority of facet to transforaminal injections was demonstrated for baseline pain score ≤ 60, while noninferiority analysis was inconclusive for baseline pain score ≥ 80 and for the Neck Disability Index score. Neither intervention showed a significant medication intake score reduction over time. Facet injections are effective for the treatment of cervical radiculopathy and represent a valid and safer alternative to transforaminal injections.

940	Analysis of the esophagogastric junction using the 3D high resolution manometry	Background & Aims:  Conventional water-perfused manometry and high resolution manometry permitted the development of a variety of manometric methodologies and metrics to understand the motility of the esophagus and to quantify esophagogastric junction (EGJ) characteristics.  However, the anatomy in the area of the EGJ is complex and intraluminal manometry recordings detect pressure signals referable both to intrinsic esophageal structures and to adjacent extrinsic structures impinging on the esophagus.  Both have distinct sphincteric mechanisms within the EGJ.  The dominant pressure signals detected near the EGJ are attributable to the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and the crural diaphragm (CD).  However, neither of these technologies were able to distinguish between the different components of the EGJ. When analyzing EGJ characteristics as a reflection of its competence against reflux, the more widely used manometric parameters are the EGJ length and the respiratory inversion point (RIP), defined as the location at which inspiratory pressure deflections change from positive (abdomen) to negative (chest).  However, the significance of these metrics has not gained wide acceptance in the gastroenterology community as evident in a recent American Gastroenterology Association Institute (AGAI) Position Statement (1) concluding that ‘The current role of manometry in gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is to exclude motor disorders as a cause of the continued symptoms’. During deglutition, the objective quantitative measurement of EGJ relaxation, the integrative relaxation pressure (IRP), permits one to distinguish between normal and abnormal EGJ relaxation.  However, comparison between spatial pressure variation plots and relaxation pressures derived from circumferentially averaged pressures suggest a persistent high pressure at the hiatal center during a period that flow is known to be occurring whereas this was not seen using nadir radial pressure data. Recently, a 3D-high resolution manometry (3D-HRM) assembly (Given Imaging, Duluth, GA) has been developed with the potential to simplify the assessment of EGJ pressure morphology and physiology.  The 3D segment of the array permits high resolution recording both axially and radially while maintaining a stationary sensor position.  Consequently, 3D-HRM should allow for the measurement of important EGJ parameters such as length and RIP.  Data extracted from the 3D-HRM recording may also allow differentiating pressure signals within the EGJ attributable to the intrinsic sphincter and to the surrounding elements.  Moreover, 3D-HRM preserves the individual pressure values of each radially dispersed sensor within the array, permitting one to overcome the apparent persistent high pressure during the deglutitive relaxation. Thus, the aims of this work were 1) to describe the EGJ pressure morphology at rest, comparing measures made with real time 3D-HRM to simulations of a conventional pull-through protocol and to define the pressure signatures attributable to the diaphragmatic and LES pressure components within the 3D-HRM recording; 2) to assess deglutitive EGJ relaxation by testing the hypothesis that the 3D-HRM array using an analysis paradigm based on finding the minimal radial pressure at each axial level (3D-eSleeve) should provide a representation of the luminal pressure gradient across the EGJ that is more relevant to predicting periods of trans-sphincteric flow using barium transit on fluoroscopy as the comparator.  We also sought to adapt the IRP metric to the 3D-HRM array using the 3D-eSleeve principle (3D-IRP) and compare normative values obtained with this new paradigm to standard IRP calculations. Methods:  Patients were studied with a 3D-HRM assembly.  The 3D-HRM assembly incorporated a 9 cm 3D-HRM segment into an otherwise standard HRM assembly; the 3D segment was comprised of 12 rings of 8 radially dispersed independent pressure sensors, spaced 7.5mm apart. At rest, 9 volunteers were studied and recordings were done during a station pull-through of the 3D-HRM segment withdrawing it across the EGJ at 5 mm increments with each position held for 30s (sufficient to capture several respiratory cycles).  Conventional measures of ‘LES length’ were made using 4 radially dispersed sensors within the 3D-HRM array, defining the margins of the sphincter by a 2 mmHg pressure increase relative to gastric or esophageal pressure.  In the 3D-HRM, the proximal and distal limits of the EGJ were defined as the axial locations first detecting a 360° circumferential pressure increase of 2 mmHg relative to the stomach.  RIP was determined, A) in the tracing mode: using the pull-through of 4 single sensors spaced 7.5 mm apart [RIP is the average value of 4 radially dispersed sensors] and B) in a stationary position using the software pressure inversion point (PIP) tool.  In the esophageal pressure topography (EPT) mode, the tracing changed progressively from a thoracic pattern to an abdominal pattern, and the RIP was localized within the inversion zone with the PIP tool tracing. For the study of the EGJ deglutitive relaxation, 25 volunteers underwent 3 consecutive 10-swallows protocols of 5 ml of water in the supine position with both the standard (once) and 3D-HRM (twice) devices in random sequence.  During the 3D-HRM studies, the EGJ was measured once with the 3D-sleeve segment and once with a proximal (non-3D sleeve portion) of the device incorporating standard HRM sensors.  For each subject, the IRP was calculated in four ways: 1) conventional method with the standard HRM device, 2) conventional method with a standard HRM segment of the 3D-HRM device, 3) conventional method using the 3D-HRM sleeve segment, and 4) a novel 3D-HRM eSleeve paradigm (3D-IRP) localizing the radial pressure minimum at each locus along the eSleeve.  Fourteen additional subjects then underwent synchronized simultaneous videofluoroscopy and 3D-HRM (including two 5-ml barium swallows).  Pressure data were exported to MATLAB™ and four pressures were measured simultaneously: 1) esophageal body pressure 2cm above EGJ, 2) intragastric pressure, 3) radially average eSleeve pressure and 4) 3D-eSleeve pressure.  Data were plotted to determine the flow permissive time (FPT) characterized as periods during which a pressure gradient through the EGJ is present (esophageal pressure > EGJ relaxation pressure (radial average or 3D-eSleeve paradigm) > gastric pressure).  FPT was calculated during a 10s time window after upper sphincter relaxation.  The presence or absence of bolus transit or FPT was coded with dichotomous values for each 0.1 s.  We calculated the corresponding sensitivity and specificity for both radial average and 3D-eSleeve analyses of FPT with bolus transit evident on fluoroscopy being the reference. Results:  3D-HRM recordings suggested that sphincter length assessed by a pull-through method greatly exaggerated the estimate of LES length by failing to discriminate among circumferential contractile pressure and asymmetric extrinsic pressure signals attributable to diaphragmatic and vascular structures.  Real-time 3D EGJ recordings found that the dominant constituents of EGJ pressure at rest were attributable to the diaphragm. The 3D-IRP was significantly less than all other calculations of IRP with the upper limit of normal being 12 mmHg vs. 17 mmHg for the standard IRP.  The sensitivity (0.78) and the specificity (0.88) of the 3D-eSleeve were also better than the standard eSleeve (0.55 and 0.85, respectively) for predicting flow permissive time verified fluoroscopically. Discussion & Conclusion:  Our observations suggest that the 3D-HRM permits real-time recording of EGJ pressure morphology facilitating analysis of the EGJ constituents responsible for its function as a reflux barrier at rest.  The axial and radial spatial resolution of the 9 cm 3D-HRM segment may permit further studies to differentiate pressure signals within the EGJ attributable to the LES and to extrinsic structures (diaphragm and vascular artifacts).  These attributes of the 3D-HRM device suggest it to be a promising new tool in the study of GERD pathophysiology. During deglutition, we evaluated the feasibility of improving the measurement of IRP utilizing a novel 3D-HRM assembly and a novel 3D-eSleeve concept based on finding the axial maximum of the radial minimum pressures at each sensor ring along the sleeve segment.  Our findings suggest that this approach is more accurate than standard HRM and other methods that utilize a radially averaged pressure within the EGJ.  Although we can only speculate on how much this will improve clinical management, 3D-HRM will certainly improve the accuracy of EGJ relaxation measurements and this will certainly impact research endeavors focused on modeling EGJ function during swallowing and reflux.

941	Implanter et pérenniser un système de gestion de la performance des services infirmiers	Background: Due to current economic pressure many projects have emerged in Europe to conceive, evaluate and install performance management systems and tools in health care facilities. Unfortunately, nursing input into the broader clinical care of hospitalized patients remains often under-utilized or sometimes even invisible. The capacity and capability of nursing personnel to enable favorable and improved health care outcomes for patients due to quality and efficiency measurement concepts, systems and tools would have the potential to generate significant benefits, both to the patients and to the overall increase in workplace performance. The objective of this supervised study is to identify the different strategies employed to obtain a sustainable implementation of nursing performance management systems (SGPSI) within health care institutions, and to provide recommendations and guidance to nursing management.  Methodology: The review of literature, including those obtained from CINAHL, Embase, Medline, Google Scholar, as well as various gray literature data, and based on the overall framework of large-scale changes within the health care environment of Perla et al. (2013).  Result: This written analysis identified four areas relating to the framework of Perla et al. (2013), and also proposed 26 strategies for a sustainable implementation of an NPMS.  Conclusion: This review establishes propositions and recommendations that will allow nursing management to implement an SGPSI in a sustainable, cohesive and  efficient manner, through a context-based synergy of the various actors and expertise available within each organization.	innovation , innovation , nurse , nursing administration , nursing staff , performance measurement systems , quality improvement , performance evaluation	en	11238.0
942	La problématique des enfants de la rue à Port-au-Prince et les stratégies d'interventions des institutions de prise en charge	Street children are a real problem all over the world. In Port au Prince, it is all a real social problem. Haiti is well-known for a general crisis for a long time. In this way, poor families are more and more vulnerable, and also are more and more living in poverty. Consequences of this families’ poverty are that a lot of children need to live their family and go to streets. In streets, children live in parks, cemetery. They used survival strategies, like, sex work, theft, and panhandling. To protect about violence in street, they live in gang and develop their own world. They are also exposed to the HIV and others contagious diseases. That is why, a lot of organizations work with street children in order to exit them out streets.  Objectives of this study are to understand representations of the phenomenon of street children and to understand social interventions from the social workers point of view. We have realized nine interviews of social workers working in three different organisations, with different structures (opened, semi-opened and closed).  Results show that social workers depicted street children as victims, delinquents, or actors. But, structure of intervention is leading by the delinquent perspective, sometimes by the victim perspective and a few as actors of their life. That is why objectives of intervention are most about familial reintegration, school reintegration, and learning working skills. In this way, philosophy of intervention is guideline by changing youth in order to integrate them in society.	intervention sociale , street youth , intervention , Haiti , social representation , policy , timoun lari , entevansyon sosyal	en	11217.0
943	Las intervenciones del sujeto traductor en la Gaceta de Caracas (1808-1822)	The Spanish-American colonial press played a significant role in the spread of foreign ideas in the American colonies. This press became the speaker of certain ideologies, which have been strengthened through the translation of news coming mainly from Europe and the United States. Our thesis studies the translator interventions in the Gaceta de Caracas (GdC). Published from 1808 to 1822, this periodical is the most emblematic of the Venezuelan emancipation period. Established to disseminate pro-monarchy news and ideas in the Venezuelan province, the GdC exceeds its primary objectives and witness the political, economic and social changes during the process of independence of the country which, in fourteen years, has successively royalists and republican periods. Like other periodical of the Province, the GdC brings up an important translational activity by the use of foreign sources (periodicals published in Europe, the United States and the Caribbean). Translation in the GdC is part of a political project, and translators do not hesitate to use it to communicate their ideologies. However, the translation serves two distinct projects depending on the political stage of the country: during the royalist period, it seeks to maintain the power of the Spanish monarchy in the colony, while during the patriotic period, it seeks emancipation. Previous studies show that the translator of the GdC employs a strategy of appropriation for political reasons and intervene in the translation process (Bastin, Navarro & Iturriza, 2010; Iturriza, 2011; Navarro, 2008, 2010, 2011). Within the approach of Descriptive Translation Studies - DTS (Toury, 1995), we study the translational editors’ choices. We examine specifically the reasons, the manifestations and the effects of these choices to determine the role of translation in the independence process in Venezuela.

944	Caractérisation de la fonction de la protéine cellulaire p80/UAF1 dans la réplication du génome du virus du papillome humain	Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are the etiological agents of cervical cancers, as well as multiple other anogenital and oropharyngeal neoplesias. The viral proteins E1 and E2, in concert with the host DNA replication machinery, mediate the replication of the double-stranded DNA genome of HPV. E1 exploits its helicase activity to unwind DNA ahead of the replication fork and orchestrates synthesis of the viral genome. Our previous work demonstrated that E1 contains in its N-terminus a binding motif for the host protein p80/UAF1, a domain that is highly conserved amongst anogenital HPVs. The integrity of this region was essential for the maintenance of the viral episome.  The research presented here first demonstrated that the UAF1-binding motif is not required for the assembly of the E1-E2-Origin pre-replisome, but important for the following viral DNA replication. We have determined that UAF1 is relocalized, in presence of E1 and E2, in nuclear foci reminiscent of viral DNA synthesis sites. UAF1 also physically interacted, through E1-binding, with the viral origin of replication. Moreover, we have shown that inhibition of E1-UAF1 interaction through the overexpression of an E1-derived and UAF1-binding peptide, N40, interferes with HPV DNA replication. This is in agreement with the model according to which E1 recruits UAF1 to the replisome to promote viral DNA replication.  UAF1 is a WD40-containing protein with no enzymatic activity and presumed to function through interactions with other cellular factors. We have investigated the UAF1 interaction network in cervical cells and discovered that UAF1 associates with the deubiquitinating enzymes USP1, USP12 and USP46, as well as with the phosphatase PHLPP1. E1 was found to assemble as a ternary complex with UAF1 and any of the associated USPs: USP1, USP12 or USP46. These USPs were also relocalized by E1 to the nucleus and they associated with the viral origin in presence of E2. Moreover, their enzymatic function was essential for optimal viral genome replication. In contrast, PHLPP1 did not associate with E1, and the interactions of the latter proteins with UAF1 were shown to be mutually exclusive. PHLPP1 contains a UAF1-binding motif homologous to the one encoded within E1. This PHLPP1-derived peptide, P1, interacts with the UAF1-USP complex and, similarly to N40, competes with E1-UAF1 interaction. Accordingly, P1 overexpression leads to inhibition of HPV DNA replication. The fusion of the peptide P1 to an E1 protein (E1Δ) defective for UAF1-binding restored its capacity to interact with UAF1 and USP46, as well as to relocalize UAF1 into E1-E2-containing nuclear foci. This artificial recruitment of UAF1 and of the associated USPs increased viral DNA replication, a process that involved the enzymatic activity of the USPs.  Collectively, our work suggests that HPV E1 interacts with UAF1 in order to recruit to the replisome a deubiquitinating complex whose activity is required for optimal viral DNA replication.

945	Synthèse totale du méthyl ester de la zincophorine et étude DFT du transfert d’hydrogène diastéréosélectif impliquant des intermédiaires radicalaires vicinaux à un ester	The focus of this thesis is the use of free radical chemistry for the introduction of stereogenic centres in propionate motifs and application of this methodology to the total synthesis of zincophorin methyl ester. This ionophore, with interesting biological properties, displays several synthetic challenges including an anti, anti, anti, anti polypropionate sequence and a trisubstituted trans tetrahydropyran. Recently, the renewed interest for polyether compounds as anticancer agents emphasizes the significance of versatile strategies to access these targets, as well as analogues thereof.  Over the last few years, our research group has been interested in the synthesis of acyclic polypropionates via a substrate-based strategy relying on two key reactions. The first one consists of a Mukaiyama aldol reaction between an alpha-chiral aldehyde and a tetrasubstituted enoxysilane bearing a carbon-halogen bond, where the stereochemical outcome depends on the monodentate or bidentate nature of the Lewis acid. The second key step involves the generation of a tertiary free radical, vicinal to an ester, which can be reduced diastereoselectively in presence of trialkyl tin hydride.  The first section illustrates the elaboration of trisubstituted tetrahydropyran motifs and the induction of vicinal stereogenic centres via a radical reduction. We discovered that the diastereoselective outcome of the iodoetherification cyclization reaction was dictated by the gamma-methyl group of alpha,beta-unsaturated esters. Moreover, we showed that both anti and syn reduction products could be accessed from a common radical intermediate, respectively by relying on the exocyclic or endocyclic effect during the reduction reaction.  Using a complementary strategy, we also revealed that the radical precursor could be accessed via a cycloetherification reaction in presence of a tetrasubstituted enoxysilane. A systematic investigation of the substituents on the ring indicated that certain stereochemical relationships led to a decrease in anti-selectivity.  The second section presents a DFT study, at the BHandHLYP/TZVP level of theory, of radical intermediates involved in hydrogen transfer. Using an energy decomposition analysis, we were able to rationalize the diastereoselective outcome of the reaction on the basis of the distortion energy (∆Ed‡) and interaction energy (∆Eint‡) required to access pro anti and pro syn transition states. Moreover, we have demonstrated that a Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) analysis can be used to interpret stereoelectronic interactions. Subsequently, an evaluation of radical intermediates bearing a borinate or an aluminate revealed that steric hindrance of the propionate chain was mainly responsible for the selective formation of anti and syn reduction products in the presence of a Lewis acid.  The last section describes the elaboration of the polypropionate sequence of zincophorin, and analogues thereof, from the substituted tetrahydropyran fragment. In our analysis, we have highlighted the necessity to limit the number of potential chelation sites to three during the aldol step under Cram-chelate conditions. Moreover, we demonstrated that the different aldol acetate motifs are accessible using a bulky enoxysilane. Finally, we showed that a similar reaction sequence can be used to access the C17–C25 fragment of its natural analogue CP-78,545 and have completed the most recent total synthesis of zincophorin methyl ester.

946	Transcriptional regulation of effector CD8+ T cell differentiation and molecular dysfunction during HIV-1 infection	CD8+ T cells play a fundamental role in controlling viral replication and dissemination by killing virus-infected cells. However during chronic HIV infection HIV-specific CD8+ T cells fail to differentiate to functional cytotoxic effector cells and develop functional defects such as loss of IL-2 secretion, decreased proliferation and express high levels of PD-1. Persistent expression of PD-1 and triggering by its ligand results in immune dysfunction; it is not known how PD-1 signaling influences transcriptional events involved in T cell differentiation and effector function.  We found that the transcriptional regulator Id2 was downregulated in PD-1hi HIV-specific CD8+ T cells when compared to PD-1low CMV-specific CD8+ T cells from the same HIV-infected donors. Since Id2 has been shown to play a central role during differentiation of effector CD8+T cells, we hypothesized that skewed maturation of the PD-1hi HIV-specific CD8+ T during chronic HIV infection could result from decreased levels of Id2. We found that signals transduction pathways downstream of PD-1 ligation inhibited the expression of Id2; transfection of PD-1hi effector cells from HIV infected individuals with a Tat-Id2 construct could reverse an apoptotic fate associated with the exhausted phenotype. Finally, overexpression of Id2 restored expression of Granzyme-B and Bcl-2 and led to a decreased expression of the T cell maturation marker CD27. Although the extrinsic signals and costimulation needed to activate cell proliferation and effector function are well known, signal-transduction pathways that regulate differentiation of memory cells to effector cells are beginning to be understood. Thechain family of cytokines is essential for the survival and homeostasis of T cells; they have pleiotropic effects on the differentiation of effector and memory virus-specific CD8+ T cells. IL-15 was unique among gamma-chain cytokines in upregulating the expression of Id2 and promoting the survival and differentiation of effector memory CD8+ T cells.  IL-15 induced proliferation of all memory subsets from healthy subjects but only induced differentiation, Granzyme-B production, and cytotoxic effector function in CD8+ Ttm and Tem cells. Stimulation of Tcm with IL-15 failed to induce their differentiation; this was associated with their decreased ex vivo levels of IL-15R when compared to Tem and Ttm subsets. Finally, we developed a single cell flow-cytometry cytotoxicity assay, and found that stimulation of CD8+T cells from HIV chronically infected subjects with peptide plus IL-15 induced the differentiation of tetramer+ CD8+ Ttm cells and restored Id2 expression and their cytotoxic activity .  Overall, we illustrate in this thesis, for the first time, the molecular mechanisms of effector T cell differentiation mediated by IL-15 and its downstream transcriptional regulator Id2; we reveal how PD-1 engagement leads to alteration of the Id2 pathway leading to decreased effector function of the HIV-specific CD8+ T cells.  Immunotherapy with agents such as IL-15  or PD-1 blocking antibody that increase levels of Id2 expression , in combination with HAART, should   trigger the functional re-activation of HIV-specific CD8+ T cells and the killing of latently HIV-infected CD4+ T cells.

947	Modification des propriétés optiques de nanofils à base de GaN par plasma N2/O2	A cylindrical electrostatic Langmuir probe was used to characterize the flowing afterglow of a N2-O2 surface wave plasma. The spatial distribution of the number density of positive and electrons as well as the EEDF were measured. A maximum of the number density of electrons in the mid 1013 m-3 was obtained in the center of the early afterglow, while it decreased at 1011 m-3 early in the late afterglow, thus indicating non-macroscopically neutral media all along the flowing afterglow. It is characterized by an EEDF close to a Maxwellian with an electron temperature of 0.5±0.1 eV, while it increased at 1.1±0.2 eV in the early afterglow due to the contribution of important vibration-electron collisions. After addition of small amounts of O2 in the main N2 microwave discharge, the charged particles densities and electron temperature first strongly increased then decreased with increasing O2 concentration. A change in the charged population in the afterglow by the creation of NO+ to the detriment of the N2+ ions is responsible of this phenomenon. This N2 flowing afterglow was later used for plasma-induced modification of pure GaN nanowires and InGaN/GaN dot-in-a-wire heterostructures and characterized by PL. While the band edge emission from GaN nanowires and the GaN matrix of the InGaN/GaN nanowires strongly decreased due to the creation of non-radiative recombination centers in the near-surface region, the emission from the InGaN inclusions strongly increased. PL excitation measurements show that this increase cannot be explained by a plasma-induced shift of the GaN absorption edge. Instead a dynamical annealing process induced by the desexcitation of N2 metastables following their collision with the nanowire surface and the passivation of surface defects such as nitrogen vacancies by the highly reactive nitrogen atoms in the afterglow are responsible of the increase of the PL intensity. The addition of O2 gives the same results as the pure N2 treatment, but a redshift of the emission band related to the InGaN inclusions is also observed, suggesting an important contribution of the oxygen species.	plasma micro-onde , interactions plasma-surface , flowing afterglow , microwave plasma , Langmuir probe , emission spectroscopy , nitride semiconductors , nanowires , plasma-surface interactions	en	11160.0
948	Réorganisation neurofonctionnelle permettant le maintien des habiletés d’évocation lexicale lors du vieillissement	The maintenance of optimal cognitive performance in aging has been associated with adaptive changes in cerebral activation patterns for various abilities that tend to decline with age. Yet, few studies have investigated this neurofunctional reorganization based on communication abilities, particularly with regard to the expressive side of language.  Considering that a number of language components usually remain well preserved in older adults, it is, however, necessary to further explore the underlying cerebral mechanisms to better understand the determinants of successful cognitive aging.  The objective of this thesis is to examine in detail the effects of aging on activation patterns and functional interactions among neural substrates contributing to expressive communication abilities. Two functional neuroimaging studies, using distinct methodological approaches, have been conducted by means of an innovative mixed design and an overt self-paced semantic and orthographic verbal fluency task, performed by well-educated young and older adults.  Specifically focusing of cerebral activation patterns associated with high levels of verbal fluency performance, the first study shows that the relative preservation of lexical speech production abilities in aging is characterized by marginal neurofunctional changes in high-performing older adults. Yet, the second study indicates that functional interactions between cortical areas contributing to speech productions significantly decrease with age, without, however, having an impact at the behavioral level. In addition, this effect of aging on the functional integration of the network engaged during semantic and orthographic verbal fluency was found to be exacerbated by task demands, which is expressed by local functional connectivity disruptions.  In sum, this thesis demonstrates that a neurofunctional reorganization to maintain lexical speech production abilities in aging is unnecessary in well-educated and high-performing older adults, despite an age-related decrease in functional networks integration. These results may reflect a loss of neural efficiency with age, although insufficient to have behavioral outcomes in individuals who benefited from protective factors known to promote successful aging, which is discussed in light of the concept of cognitive reserve.	functional magnetic resonance imaging , neurofunctional reorganization , normal aging , expressive language , communication abilities , lexical speech productions , verbal fluency , functional connectivity , language networks	en	11154.0
949	Special functions of Weyl groups and their continuous and discrete orthogonality	This thesis presents several properties and applications of four families of Weyl group orbit functions called $C$-, $S$-, $S^s$- and $S^l$-functions. These functions may be viewed as generalizations of the well-known Chebyshev polynomials. They are related to orthogonal polynomials associated with simple Lie algebras, e.g. the multivariate Jacobi and Macdonald polynomials. They have numerous remarkable properties such as continuous and discrete orthogonality. In particular, it is shown that the $S^s$- and $S^l$-functions characterized by certain parameters are mutually orthogonal with respect to a discrete measure. Their discrete orthogonality allows to deduce two types of Fourier-like discrete transforms for each simple Lie algebra with two different lengths of roots. Similarly to the Chebyshev polynomials, these four families of functions have applications in numerical integration. We obtain in this thesis various cubature formulas, for functions of several variables, arising from $C$-, $S^s$- and $S^l$-functions. We also provide a~complete description of discrete multivariate cosine transforms of types V--VIII involving the Weyl group orbit functions arising from simple Lie algebras $C_n$ and $B_n$, called antisymmetric and symmetric cosine functions. Furthermore, we study four families of multivariate Chebyshev-like orthogonal polynomials introduced via (anti)symmetric cosine functions.

950	The Transnational Diffusion of Contemporary Violent Resistance : The Case of New Insurrectionalism	This thesis aims at understanding the transnational diffusion of the contemporary phenomenon of 'new insurrectionalism'. It is a novel form of contestatory violence, based in the anarchist philosophy, and in opposition to the domination of the State and capitalist systems. This subject is particularly interesting due to its innovative understanding and organization of revolutionary struggle, and because of its novel forms and interpretations of violent action. The study is situated within the contemporary context of globalization, since it is the growth of this phenomenon that is said to have contributed to the emergence of new insurrectionalism. In order to demonstrate this link, we will examine several types of literature: authorship concerning transnational diffusion of politics and struggles; analyses about the use of terrorist and insurrectionary violence; and, finally, communiqués and statements published by insurrectionalist actors and thinkers.   The methodology employed here is that of a qualitative study of a transnational phenomenon, in the form of a comparative study of new insurrectionalism in five countries (Greece, Italy, Mexico, Chile, and Indonesia). The analytical frame is that of the 'comprehensive approach', placed in the context of transnational diffusion, which seeks to understand a social movement from the inside, giving voice to those who participate in it.  New insurrectionalism is a transnational struggle, an opposite reflection of economic and political globalization, and it is diffused more easily due to its flexibility, the primacy of local struggles, decentralization, horizontal relations, and a struggle against hierarchy, domination and exploitation.	insurrection , diffusion , transnational , violence , terrorism , anarchism , insurrectionalism , globalization , ideology	en	11136.0
951	Étude longitudinale des liens prédictifs entre les traits de personnalité et les comportements antisociaux à l’adolescence	The goal of this longitudinal study was to evaluate if personality traits in early adolescence can predict future antisocial behavior, after controlling for initial level of antisocial behavior and the influence of various known risk factors. The sample includes 1036 adolescents from eight high schools in the province of Quebec. The adolescents were evaluated twice, once during the first year of high school (12-13 years old) and once during the second year of high school (14-15 years old). Adolescents filled a self-reported questionnaire. Structural equation models first confirmed that the covariation among different antisocial behaviors can be explained by a latent variable. The results confirmed that adolescents’ personality traits at ages 12 and 13 predict their antisocial behaviors at ages 14 and 15. In accordance with previous studies, Extraversion, Conscientiousness and Emotional Stability predict future antisocial behavior. However, the effect of Agreeableness disappeared once initial level of antisocial behavior was controlled for. Finally, multiple-group structural equation models showed significant gender-specific predictive relations. The results of this study support the relevance of personality traits for both theory of antisocial behavior and clinical practice.	adolescence , personality traits , antisocial behavior , adolescence , predictive relations , risk factors , gender	en	11104.0
952	La coédition franco-québécoise et ses conséquences sur les oeuvres de fiction publiées en traduction	The copublishing of the translated version of literary books in Quebec and then distributed under a French publishing brand, is a practice used by editors to broaden the outreach of their books. The process of copublishing is carried out through various methods which tend to evolve in an unpredictable way : editors and translators make compromises about the target language in order to reach their cross-Atlantic markets. What is the nature of these compromises? Are they terminological, lexicographical, cultural or merely subjective? How are they perceived by translators and publishers? This essay explores these questions through the study of four cases of literary works copublished by publishers and literary translators from Quebec.  The analysis demonstrates that these compromises, be they cultural or not, have little impact on the quality of French in the copublishing market, which is often in France. But they sometimes create a feeling of cultural dominance on the part of France. This discourse is however nuanced by the type of copublishing practice and the position occupied by translators within the publishing structure. A clearer framework for copublishing practices and a better status for the translator of literary works would contribute to mitigate some of the tensions related to copublishing.

953	Gouverner le monde désenchanté : le parlement du Reich et l’émergence d’hommes d’État dans la pensée politique de Max Weber	Initiated by Wolfgang J. Mommsen (1930-2004), the dominant understanding of Max Weber’s (1864-1920) political thought concludes that it ultimately led to German fascism. This master’s thesis reflects upon Weber’s political texts, written between 1895 and 1919, in order to grasp the meaning their author intended to give them, notwithstanding the historical role these texts may have played after his passing. We will therefore reconstitute the Weberian political thought in the social context that witnessed its coming and understand the political origin of Weberian theory on social actions. To that end, we must review history. Only by establishing a relationship, as described as early as Chapter I, between political writings and Wilhelmine Germany’s specific historical configuration is it possible to reconcile two dimensions, as either is often disregarded in Weberian studies: the study of specific historical characters (Max Weber, the man and his contemporaries) et Weberian thought itself (Weber’s writings). We will see that Weber fears that the bureaucratization process inherent to the modern political sphere as it may well petrify human existence. Chapter II reviews Weber’s opposition to such an objective possibility in order to preserve the basis to a true individual liberty. According to Weber, it is through the political direction of a charismatic leader, a figure initially developed his scientific works and presented in Chapter III, that the direst consequences of the bureaucratization process can be averted. An environment favorable to such political men will then have to be institutionalized. The last chapter (IV) of this master’s thesis will demonstrate how Weber tries to use caesarization, the second constitutive process of the modern political sphere, as a means against such a bureaucratization. Under the monarchy, he intends to succeed by strengthening the parliamentary powers. However, the Weimar Republic forces him to adapt his constitutional project: hence his suggestion of a plebiscitary leader democracy. Because of the focus on the leader one might be surprised by Weber’s conception of democracy. What Weber proposes is a democratic political system nonetheless. Far from abandoning his political project, as some critics may conclude, Weber remained true to his ideals, despite the major social changes that occurred at the end of his life.

954	"Autonomie personnelle et socialisation : l’approche hiérarchique de Frankfurt et la
critique féministe"	The present study is about Frankfurt’s hierarchical approach, which gives an explanation of autonomous action by means of its two-level theoretical framework. According to Frankfurt, an action is autonomous when it is caused or guided by a desire that is itself caused or guided by a second-order desire, the latter being formed by a process of identification that realizes the evaluation of the first-order desire. As a first step, I study the development of Frankfurt’s approach and I show that it undergoes a significant change: if Frankfurt first gives a causal explanation of autonomous action, he will give later on a structural explanation of this kind of action. As a second step, I review different versions of a critique of Frankfurt’s approach made by some feminists, that is, the critique of the autonomous status of the process of identification. In the third part, I defend Frankfurt’s approach regarding this critique. This defense is based on an interpretation of the process of identification: I claim, with the help of the interpretation I suggest in the first chapter, that the evaluation intrinsic to the process of identification consists in the evaluation of the conformity of a desire with a motivational model, and that this interpretation avoids the feminist critique.

955	L’alchimie de l’État : la construction de la différence dans le processus de sélection des immigrants au Québec	Most people who immigrate to Canada do so through an administrative process that aims at selecting those who would be most able to integrate into Quebec society and whose professional skills are most likely to be economically profitable to the country. At the end of this process, these selected persons are given permanent resident status. Before even arriving in Quebec, they exchange documents with the Canadian and Quebecer migration authorities and go through an interview with a government officer, among other steps. Once in Quebec, they continue the immigration process through courses about Quebec’s culture and values. Following an ethnographic path, this thesis digs into the experience of these newcomers to understand the complex shapes taken by the state through the interactions with migrants. If the administrative proceedings are always developed in a climate of hospitality, the granting of the “permanent residence”, as well as the face-to-face interactions, produces a bureaucratic space in which culture is central. Indeed, through the administrative process, it becomes clear that the selected migrants are made the “them” of a Quebec or Canadian “us”. Integrating these migrants has a price: constructing them as Others.	immigration , interaction , State , ethnic boundaries , bureaucracy , permanent resident , Quebec , economic immigration , ethnography , interaction	en	11091.0
956	Dynamiques de constitution de la communauté antiautoritaire au Québec, 2000-2010	This thesis by articles is a case study of the development process of the anti-authoritarian social movement community in Quebec between the years 2000 and 2010. The study questions the factors that have contributed to the evolution of this political actor during this period and allowed for its heterogeneous character to be unveiled by the end of the decade. While the anti-authoritarian community’s components encompassed numerous issues of struggle, there was convergence around the adoption of political positions, action strategies and organizational methods that form a contemporary anti-authoritarian ideal-type. Although the overall political environment of the anti-authoritarian community in Quebec did have an influence on its development, this thesis by articles demonstrates that it was the movement’s internal dynamics that ensured its survival by allowing for the accommodation of the diversity expressed within the movement during that period. Understanding the anti-authoritarian movement through the conceptual lens of the social movement community allows us to observe and analyse the development of this political actor well beyond its public interactions with authorities. In doing so, this approach also highlights the role of the internal factors that have contributed to its development.   In line with previous work on social movements that put forth a synthetic theoretical perspective linking structural and cultural aspects, this analysis of the anti-authoritarian community in Quebec highlights the role of organizational and identity factors, while contributing to this perspective by applying a mechanistic approach.  By doing so, the thesis highlights, on the one hand, the interaction of these dimensions in the development of the antiauthoritarian community and, on the other, the dynamics that are inherent to them. The gradual transition towards a social movement community structure was noted first as a process of organizational development that interacted with the process of boundary formation within the movement. On another hand, the anti-authoritarian community was able to sustain itself between 2000 and 2010 due to the identity work undertaken by its activists, through a process of identity reconciliation. These processes have contributed to the formation of a collective identity built around the struggle against various forms of oppression, simultaneously expressed in the political discourse and practices of anti-authoritarian activists.  The findings proposed in this thesis rely on a participative action research methodology and combine participant observation, the analysis of interviews and the study of documentary sources. The empirical interpretation of the anti-authoritarian community is based on a project carried out with the Research Collective on Collective Autonomy (CRAC) at Concordia University in Montreal.

957	Régulation de la fonction vasculaire pendant le vieillissement : rôles de l’environnement post-natal et du gène suppresseur de tumeurs p53	Endothelial dysfunction is an early marker of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases. Cardiovascular risk factors generate a chronic stress, challenging endogenous defense mechanisms that are critical to maintain endothelial function, such as antioxidant enzymes. The vascular environment impacts the integrity and long-term function of endothelial cells. Thus, a healthy lifestyle is beneficial for cardiovascular health: regular physical training and/or a Mediterranean diet are associated with the maintenance of endothelial function and a lower incidence of cardiovascular diseases. On the other hand, some key genes such as tumor suppressor gene p53, are known to regulate numerous cellular functions that are necessary to maintain endothelial cells integrity. We hypothesized that the post-natal vascular environment impacts the development of endogenous cellular defense mechanisms such as antioxidant enzymes, in order to protect against vascular stress that will occur later in life.  Our major goal was to evaluate the impact of post-natal interventions and endogenous reduction of p53 expression on vascular endothelial function and its capacity to resist against a metabolic stress. In our first study, healthy C57Bl/6 mice were exposed from weaning to the age of 9 months to physical voluntary training (running wheel) or to the antioxidant catechin, and were compared to physically inactive mice that did not receive catechin. Then, exercise and catechin were stopped and mice were subjected to a regular or a high fat diet for 3 months; mice were sacrificed either at the age of 9 or 12 months. In trained mice, we observed that exercise prevented endothelial dysfunction and inflammation induced by the high fat diet. In catechin-treated mice, aortic endothelial function was maintained despite exposure to the high fat diet, but an inflammatory profile was observed. In physically inactive mice, the high fat diet induced endothelial dysfunction without inflammation.  In our second study, mice partially deficient in p53 (p53+/-) were exposed to the same high fat diet from 3 to 6 months of age. Our rationale was based on the discovery that in vitro, p53 regulates antioxidant enzymes gene expression. In p53+/- mice, endothelial cells were protected from the stress of hypercholesterolemia induced by the high fat diet. However, this endothelial protection could be linked with an unexpected enhanced bile acid metabolism in p53+/- mice: low endogenous expression of p53 prevents the rise in plasma total cholesterol when fed a high fat diet, indirectly protecting the endothelium.  In summary, we were able to demonstrate the importance of the vascular environment on endothelial function. The pro-atherosclerotic environment induced by the high fat diet stimulated vascular defense mechanisms, as observed by the activation of the compensatory EDHF pathway and superoxide dismutase activity, to maintain an adequate endothelial function. We observed that exercise and catechin had a different impact on the endothelium despite their antioxidant properties. These studies demonstrate the sensitivity of the endothelium to changes within the vascular environment. As the population is aging and the incidence of cardiovascular diseases is increasing, endothelial dysfunction will be more frequent. Therefore, a better comprehension of mechanisms or interventions that can protect endothelial function can only be beneficial.	p53 , Hormesis , Endothelial function , Exercise , Catechin , Physical inactivity , High fat diet , Cardiovascular risk factors , Oxidative stress , Bile acids , Hormesis	en	11065.0
958	Les dispositifs d’aide à la consommation : une analyse qui prend compte des obstacles à la rationalité dans l’évaluation des biens de consommation	This research project aims at exploring the role of design within the act of purchasing and rating products. This premise is based on the fact that design is an obstacle to an individual’s rationality when choosing goods because they are multidimensional and of uncertain quality, as proposed by Lucien Karpik. This creates a difficulty faced by consumers when trying to find comparable products on the market. The research hypothesis of this project suggests that design is an obstacle to reason by offering multidimensional products to consumers. It then becomes harder for them to evaluate singular products available on the market, and to make wise consumption choices. One of the aims of design is to offer users freedom of choice, but this dynamic and economic role of design can also lead to confusion, where consumers become blinded by the abundance of choices. In this sense, design would be the keystone of a singularity-based economy. Five product rating projects were observed on a two-year period within two agencies involved in producing consumption aid devices by using an ethnological approach. The conclusion of this study has shown that some improvements could be made to the product rating processes, particularly for the facts that have not been accounted for in the actual consumption aid devices, such as user-centered product ratings based on user scenarios instead of object-centered product ratings, as well as considering user experience in product evaluation.	economics of singular goods , design economy , consumption , product evaluation , product rating , confidence , trust , user-centered design (UCD) , user experience design (UX) , consumption aid device	en	11061.0
959	Un Dieu se dévoile : herméneutique processuelle d'Éz 16	Hermeneutic thinkers of the twentieth century have essentially redefined man as a being who is in search of meaning, constantly interpreting the 'world' through 'his own world', with this transformative understanding contributing to his future. Is it therefore relevant, in the search for meaning that characterizes a journey of faith, to read the Scriptures in ways that open new possibilities other than those currently offered by the Christian tradition? This essay proposes an affirmative answer to this challenge by applying a Process Approach to the text of Chapter 16 of the Book of Ezekiel, a prophet whom Jewish tradition has historically treated with suspicion and a particularly bold text that the Christians disregarded. After setting the parameters of the study (Chapter 1), a literal translation of the Hebrew text is presented, highlighting the nuances suggested by language choice as well as particular elements revealed by macro-syntax analysis (Chapter 2). The process analysis method chosen to interpret the text is unprecedented in the Francophone world, as is the process context of the study outlined in Chapters 3 and 4. The conclusions identify original theological concepts, most notably redefining God as a stubborn will that seeks to convince, and inscribing his forgiveness deeply in human liberty and responsibility.

960	Réponse métabolique du saumon Atlantique (Salmo salar) aux fluctuations journalières de température : rôles de la température d’acclimatation et de l’historique thermique	Usually, fish metabolism is evaluated under constant values of temperature, but the effects of daily temperature fluctuations similar to those found in natural environment on metabolism seems to be much less understood. The goals of this study are to quantify the effects of the mean acclimation temperature and to assess the effects of the thermal history on the metabolic response of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) parr to daily fluctuations of water temperature. Atlantic salmon parr originating from two rivers, one cool and one relatively warm, were acclimated to up to four thermal regimes (constant 15 °C or 20 °C, daily fluctuating 15 °C ± 2.5 °C or 20 °C ± 2.5 °C) and their standard metabolic rate was estimated using intermittent-flow respirometry. Daily temperature fluctuations (15 °C ± 2.5 °C) near this species’ thermal optimum (16 °C) do not influence standard metabolic rate. In contrast, daily fluctuations of higher temperature (20 °C ± 2.5 °C) do increase standard metabolic rate by 35.4% for fish from the warmer river, but not for fish from the cooler river. Therefore, the mean temperature to which fish are acclimated may affect their responses to daily fluctuations of water temperature, but this response may vary between populations originating from rivers having different thermal regimes. Using standard metabolic rates previously estimated, a standard metabolic rate model was developed for Atlantic salmon parr exposed to daily fluctuations of temperature.

961	ApoB et résistance à l'insuline : association avec l'activation du système IL-1β	INTRODUCTION: The number of plasma apolipoprotein B lipoproteins (apoB) is reported to predict the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D); however the underlying mechanism is unknown. Insulin resistance (IR) and compensatory hyperinsulinemia (HI) are believed to promote β-cell exhaustion and progression to T2D. Moreover, the activation of the interleukin-1β (IL-1β) system is implicated in the pathophysiology of T2D. Our aim was thus to investigate whether plasma apoB associates with IR and HI in humans and whether this is mediated through the IL-1β system. METHODOLOGY: 47 non-diabetic overweight and obese postmenopausal women and 28 men, 45-74 years old were recruited. Insulin secretion (IS) and insulin sensitivity were examined by a modified Botnia clamp. 1st and 2nd  phase IS were measured during a 1 hour intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT), followed by a 3 hour hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (HEIC, insulin infusion rate of 75 mU/m2/min) to measure insulin sensitivity during the last 30 minutes of the clamp (steady state). Insulin sensitivity was expressed as steady state glucose infusion rate (GIR) alone or divided over steady state plasma insulin (M/I). RESULTS: In women, fasting plasma apoB correlated positively with increased 2nd phase and total IS and with total C-peptide secretion (r=0.202; r=0.168; r=0.204 respectively) and negatively with insulin sensitivity (r: GIR= -0.299 and M/I =-0.180) independent of adiposity.  Similar to plasma apoB, fasting plasma IL-Ra (indicator of activated IL-1β system) correlated positively with 2nd phase and total IS and with total C-peptide secretion (r=0.217; r=0.154; r=0.198 respectively) and negatively with insulin sensitivity (GIR r=-0.304; M/I r=-0.214). Fasting plasma IL-Ra also correlated with apoB r=0.352). Once corrected for IL-1Ra, the associations between apoB and the indexes of insulin sensitivity and IS were all lost. Despite similar fasting glucose, plasma apoB did not correlate with any indices of insulin secretion or sensitivity in men. CONCLUSION: ApoB is associated with HI and IR in non-diabetic overweight and obese women, which may be mediated through activation of the IL-1β system. Gender differences may need to be considered in exploring the pathophysiology of T2D in humans.	IL-1Ra , IL-1β , apoB-lipoproteins , insulin secretion , insulin sensitivity	en	10980.0
962	Rôle de l'AmtB dans la régulation de la nitrogénase et la production d'hydrogène chez la bactérie Rhodobacter capsulatus	Nitrogen is the most abundant element in the Earth's atmosphere with a percentage of 78 %. This element is essential for the biosynthesis of cellular organic material and is unusable in its stable diatomic form (N2) by most organisms. Only bacteria called diazotrophs such as Rhodobacter capsulatus are able to fix molecular nitrogen N2 through the synthesis of the nitrogenase enzyme. The latter catalyzes the reduction of N2 to NH4 which can then be absorbed by other organisms. The synthesis and activity of nitrogenase consumes a lot of energy and therefore implies a strict regulation and its inhibition when a sufficient amount of ammonium is available. Among the proteins involved in this regulation, is the membrane transporter AmtB which is responsible for the sensing and transportation of ammonia. In R. capsulatus, it was shown that following the addition of ammonium, AmtB reversibly inhibits (switch off / switch on) nitrogenase activity by sequestering the PII protein GlnK accompanied by the addition of an ADP ribose group onto the Fe subunit of the enzyme by DraT. In addition, the formation of this complex alone would not be sufficient for this inactivation, suggesting the sequestration of a third protein, DraG is required to inhibit its action of removing the ADP ribose from the nitrogenase and therefore its reactivation. To better understand the role of the AmtB in the fixation of nitrogen, regulation and transport of ammonium at the molecular level, the first part of this study was to introduce a point mutation by directed mutagenesis in the conserved residue W237 of AmtB . Hydrogen production is another property of R. capsulatus that has been studied for a long time. This bacterium is capable of producing hydrogen from organic compounds following photofermentation and the exclusive enzymatic intervention of nitrogenase. Several studies have been undertaken to improve the production of hydrogen. Some of them were involved in determining the optimum conditions that give maximum gas production while others were interested in improving the growth of the bacterium itself. Thus, since the bio-production of H2 by fermentation is catalyzed by the nitrogenase, it is important to study the regulation of the activity of this enzyme by different mechanisms such as the switch off by ADP ribosylation. Therefore, a mutant of R. capsulatus (DG9) lacking AmtB was studied in the second part of this thesis for its nitrogenase activity, its modification by GlnK-DraG, and to see the effects of different amino acids used in the growth medium on the regulation and therefore the future use of this strain for the production of H2. The results showed a continuous and uninterrupted activity of the nitrogenase when AmtB was absent with a maximum activity when proline was used as a nitrogen source for bacterial growth. In addition, Western blots were used to demonstrate the effect of ADP ribosylation on regulation and that the expression of GlnK and DraG were unchanged between the wild –type and mutant R. capsulatus. In conclusion, nitrogenase is not modified or inhibited when mutated amtB what makes the R. capsulatus strain DG9 an ideal candidate for biohydrogen production especially when glucose and proline are respectively used as source carbon and nitrogen for growth.

963	Entre ville complexe et projet urbain durable, l’exemple de l’Agence d’Écologie Urbaine de Barcelone	An urban project is an opportunity to locally and globally revitalize under certain conditions. That is, the project must encompass a sustainable ecosystem outlook, be forward thinking and consider the complex equilibrium and resiliency of social and ecological structures. In practice, the demand for clear and quantitative guidelines leave little room for uncertainty. How, then, can one operationalize urban ecology without applying reductionist simplifications nor feel overwhelmed by the enormity of such a task? In connecting the pieces between sustainable development, complexity, urban ecology and sustainable city, we put into perspective the broader process of a sustainable urban project. Considering a study case of Barcelona’s Urban Ecology Agency, we suggest that an ecosystemic outlook of an urban context can be used as an intentional model. It can also be partitioned into indicators of sustainability and operationalized through an iterative, integrative and multidisciplinary process of a sustainable urban project.

964	"Intervention éducative auprès de parents quant à l’observation et l’interprétation 
des comportements spécifiques de leur nouveau-né prématuré
afin d’améliorer leur confiance parentale"	Parents of preterm infants may feel confused by their infant’s behaviors which are different from those born at term (Als et al., 1979; Vanderberg, 2000), and, in return, may undermine their parental confidence (Kenner & Lott, 1990; May & Hu, 2000). Consequently, it is suggested that neonatal nurses support parents in the observation and interpretation of the preterm infant’s behaviors (White-Traut, Dols, & McGrath, 2010), to promote their parental confidence. Indeed, parental confidence may have an impact on the establishment of parent-child attachment, and thus on the well-being of preterm infants (Raines & Brustad, 2012). An educative intervention was developed and implemented with five families of preterm infants born between 28 to 32 weeks of gestation. Through the intervention, parents learned to interpret and respond appropriately to their infant’s behavior in order to improve their parental confidence. The educational intervention seems to have improved the parental confidence of all mothers who participated in the intervention. The mothers were also satisfied with the content of the educative intervention, as well as with the documentation which was given to them. Enlighten by the benefits of the educational intervention, recommendations for the clinical practice and research were made. Finally, the internship goals and personal learning goals have been achieved.	Parents , Signs of stress , Signs of adaptation , Preterm infant , Educative intervention , Hand containment	en	10967.0
965	High-amylose carboxymethyl starch matrices for oral sustained drug-release : in vitro and in vivo evaluation	Unmodified and modified starches represent a particularly interesting group of biodegradable and abundant excipients. They have been widely used as excipients for various purposes in tablet formulations, such as binders and/or disintegrants. Spray-dried high-amylose sodium carboxymethyl starch (SD HASCA) was recently proposed as an innovating hydrophilic excipient for sustained-release (SR) in solid oral dosage forms. Amorphous high-amylose sodium carboxymethyl starch (HASCA) was first produced by the etherification of high-amylose corn starch with chloroacetate. HASCA was then spray dried to obtain SD HASCA. This new excipient has shown advantageous and effective properties in the production of SR delivery systems. SR matrix tablets prepared from SD HASCA are inexpensive, simple to formulate and easy to produce by direct compression.  The main objective of the present research was to continue the development and optimization of matrix tablets using SD HASCA as the retarding excipient in view of their ultimate application as sustained drug-release delivery systems for oral administration. For this purpose, dissolution tests simulating some of the most relevant physiological conditions of the gastrointestinal tract, taking into account the nature of the polymer under investigation, were employed to evaluate the drug-release characteristics and demonstrate the performance of SD HASCA SR formulations. An exploratory clinical study was also carried out to evaluate the SR properties of this new drug delivery system in the gastrointestinal tract.  The first article presented in this thesis evaluated the drug-release characteristics and the physical integrity of formulations containing a compressed blend of drug, sodium chloride and SD HASCA in biorelevant media. The influence of different acidic pH values and residence times was investigated. The SR profile from an optimized SD HASCA formulation was not significantly affected by both the acidic pH value and the residence time in the acidic medium. These results suggest a limited influence of intra- and inter-subject variability of gastric pH on the release kinetics from SD HASCA matrices. In addition, the optimized formulation maintained its integrity throughout the duration of the dissolution tests. The exploratory in vivo study demonstrated extended drug absorption after oral administration of SD HASCA matrix tablets and that the matrix tablets did not disintegrate while passing through the stomach and resisted hydrolysis by α-amylase in the intestine. The second article reports the development of once-daily and twice-daily SD HASCA tablets containing tramadol hydrochloride (100 mg and 200 mg). These SR formulations presented high crushing strengths without requiring the addition of binders, which facilitates tablet processing and handling. The compression force (CF) applied to produce the tablets did not significantly affect the drug-release profiles. The total release time from SD HASCA tablets increased significantly in function of the tablet weight and can be used to modulate the total release time from theses formulations. When exposed to a pH gradient and to a 40% ethanol medium, a very rigid gel formed progressively on the surface of the tablets providing controlled drug-release properties. These properties indicated that SD HASCA is a robust excipient for oral, sustained drug-release, likely to minimize the possibility of dose dumping and consequent adverse effects, even when co-administered with high doses of alcohol. The third article investigated the effect of α-amylase on drug-release from previously developed SD HASCA tablets containing acetaminophen and tramadol hydrochloride (Acetaminophen SR and Tramadol SR). Mathematical modeling showed that an increase in α-amylase concentration resulted in an increase of polymer erosion over drug diffusion as the main mechanism controlling drug-release, for both formulations and both residence times in acidic medium. However, even if the mechanism of release was affected, α-amylase concentrations ranging from 0 IU/L to 20000 IU/L did not significantly affect the drug-release profiles from SD HASCA SR tablets, regardless of the residence time in acidic medium, the drug used, the polymer content and the different composition of each formulation. The work presented in this thesis clearly demonstrates the value of SD HASCA as an efficient SR excipient.

966	Role of the ASPP Family in the Regulation of p53-Mediated Apoptotic Death of Retinal Ganglion Cells after Optic Nerve Injury	Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. At present, there is no cure for glaucoma, and current therapies are often inadequate. Loss of vision in glaucoma results from the death of retinal ganglion cells, the neurons that send visual information from the retina to the brain. The principal mechanism leading to retinal ganglion cell damage during glaucoma is not well understood, however, putative culprits have been proposed including excitotoxicity, neurotrophin deprivation, mechanical compression, ischemia, reactive astrocytes and oxidative stress. It is well established that retinal ganglion cell loss during glaucoma is caused by apoptotic programmed cell death, however, the precise mechanisms that lead to apoptotic death of adult retinal ganglion cells are poorly defined. To address this point, I put forth the central hypothesis that the identification of signaling pathways involved in apoptotic retinal ganglion cell death would offer therapeutic avenues to slow or prevent retinal ganglion cell death during ocular neuropathies such as glaucoma.   In the first part of my thesis, I characterised the role of Apoptosis Stimulating Protein of p53 family (ASPP) proteins, which are regulators of p53, in the apoptotic death of retinal ganglion cells. p53 is a nuclear transcription factor implicated in cellular functions ranging from transcription to apoptosis. ASPP family members ASPP1, ASPP2 and iASPP are p53 binding proteins that belong to a family of protein regulators of p53-dependent apoptotic death. However, the role of ASPP family members in retinal ganglion cell death is unknown. As ASPP1 and ASPP2 are pro-apoptotic, the hypothesis of our first study was that the knockdown of ASPP1 and ASPP2 gene expression would lead to retinal ganglion cell survival after an optic nerve lesion. We used a well-characterized experimental model of neuronal apoptosis induced by optic nerve axotomy in Sprague Dawley rats. The results of this study (Wilson et al. Journal of Neuroscience, 2013) demonstrated that p53 is implicated in retinal ganglion cell death, and that targeted knockdown of ASPP1 and ASPP2 by short interference ribonucleic acid promotes retinal ganglion cell survival. The knockdown of ASPP2 correlates with a reduction in the levels of pro-apoptotic p53 regulated targets PUMA and Fas/CD95.   In the second part of my thesis, I characterized the role of the anti-apoptotic member of the ASPP family, iASPP, in the apoptotic death of retinal ganglion cells. The hypothesis of this second study is that the overexpression of iASPP would promote retinal ganglion cell survival after axotomy. The data (Wilson et al. PLoS ONE, 2014) demonstrate that the targeted knockdown of iASPP by short interference ribonucleic acid exacerbates retinal ganglion cell death, and that the overexpression of iASPP by adeno-associated virus promotes retinal ganglion cell survival. The overexpression of iASPP correlates with a reduction in protein levels of PUMA and Fas/CD95.  In conclusion, the findings presented in this thesis contribute to a better understanding of the pathological mechanisms underlying retinal ganglion cell loss by apoptosis and might provide insights into the design of novel neuroprotective treatments for neurodegenerative diseases such as glaucoma.	retinal ganglion cell , neuronal death , apoptosis-stimulating protein of p53 , axotomy	en	10904.0
967	Modulation of nociception and pain by attention and stress	Psychological factors such as hypnosis, emotion, stress, and attention produce powerful modulatory effects on nociception and pain.  However, the influence of attention on nociception and pain and the underlying neural mechanism responsible are unclear. The current literature on attentional modulation of spinal nociceptive responses, as measured by the RIII reflex, and pain perception (pain intensity) is inconsistent and often contradictory. The present thesis provides a new component-based framework for the examination of attentional modulation of the RIII reflex and pain. A delayed-discrimination task was decomposed into the three components of attention – namely alerting, orienting, and executive control (sensory working memory). Previously, the multidimensional nature of attention was largely ignored in the pain literature. We show that each component of attention exerts a distinct modulatory effect on nociception and pain and suggest that this accounts for some of the confusion in the literature. By considering stress separately, we demonstrate for the first time that stress blocks attentional modulation of the RIII reflex, indicating an interaction and dissociation of attention- and stress-mediated modulation of spinal nociceptive responses. This important finding clarifies much of the disagreement in the literature, since cognitive tasks often induce increases in stress that consequently confound interpretation. Additionally, both visual and somatosensory stimuli were included in the discrimination task, revealing that the influence of attention on pain intensity is spatially-specific whereas attentional modulation of nociception is modality-specific, at least for the modalities investigated. From these findings a component-based model for the attentional modulation of pain processes is proposed. This model is substantially supported by the literature and provides a meaningful and cohesive explanation of the seemingly contradictory results across studies. Moreover, this model suggests potential neural mechanisms underlying the attentional modulation of pain.

968	Systems biology of the human MHC class I immunopeptidome	The self/nonself discrimination system of vertebrates allows detection and rejection of pathogens and allogeneic cells. It requires the surveillance of short peptides presented by major histocompatibility class I (MHC I) molecules on the cell surface. MHC I molecules are heterodimers that consist of a heavy chain produced by MHC genes and a light chain encoded by the β2-microglobulin gene. The peptides presented by MHC I molecules are collectively referred to as the MHC I immunopeptidome. We employed systems biology approaches to define the composition and cellular origin of the self MHC I immunopeptidome presented by B lymphoblastoid cells derived from two pairs of MHC-identical siblings. We found that the MHC I immunopeptidome is subject- and cell-specific, derives preferentially from abundant transcripts, is enriched in transcripts bearing microRNA response elements and shows no bias toward invariant vs. polymorphic genomic sequences. We also developed a novel personalized approach combining mass-spectrometry, next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics for high-throughput identification of MHC I peptides including those caused by nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (ns-SNPs), termed minor histocompatibility antigens (MiHAs), which are the targets of allo-immune responses. Comparison of the genomic landscape of the immunopeptidome of MHC-identical siblings revealed that 0.5% of ns-SNPs were represented in the immunopeptidome and that 0.3% of the MHC I-peptide repertoire would be immunogenic for one of the siblings. We discovered new factors that shape the self MHC I immunopeptidome and present a novel strategy for the identification of MHC I-associated peptides that could greatly accelerate the development of MiHA-targeted immunotherapy.

969	Évolution moléculaire : un modèle Markov-modulé pour les processus de substitution	Time-continuous Markovian process are widely used to understand the mechanism of nucleotidic acids and proteins evolution along phylogeny. Already existing probabilistic models based on such hypothesis are designed to satisfy the non-homogeneity of functional and environmental constraints acting across those biological sequences. Recently, Markov-modulated models have been introduced to describe site-specific temporal rate variation (heterotachy). Moreover, studies have demonstrated that not only strength but also the nature of the constraint acting on a specific site can vary over time. Here we propose to accommodate this evolutionary reality with a Markov-modulated model for proteins under which sites are authorized to change their amino acids propensities across time. Posterior estimation of the stochastic kernel hidden parameters with Monte Carlo methods is a challenging approach that we partially overcome with parallel computing. Fine-tuning are otherwise planned to accelerate convergence toward the target posterior stationnary distribution. Qualitatively, our model seems to be able to capture temporal heterogeneity from real sequences data sets whose evolutionary history is assumed to be rich in substitutional switch events. Furthermore, evaluation of the model performance suggest that he provides a better fit to the data set than the time-homogeneous equivalent model. Nonetheless, substitutional histories sampled from the posterior distribution are quite noisy and remain difficult to interpret biologically.

970	Exploration du rôle du fragment LG3 sur les cellules souches mésenchymateuses dans le contexte du rejet vasculaire	Graft vasculopathy is diseases characterized by a progressive and obliterate narrowing of the blood vessels leading to ischemia and loss of graft function. This vascular narrowing is due to an accumulation of extracellular matrix and mononuclear cells positive for alpha smooth muscle actin (alphaSMA) including mesenchymal stem cells, thus forming an occlusive neointima. This condition is the leading cause of long term loss of kidney and heart transplants. Acute vascular rejection is a predictor of graft vasculopathy. Dr. Hébert’s team has demonstrated that endothelial apoptosis, which plays an important role in the development of vascular rejection, initiates the release of LG3, a fragment of the proteoglycan perlecan. Blood and urine levels of LG3 are increased in renal allograft recipients with vascular rejection and graft vasculopathy. The results obtained in the laboratory during my Master have helped to better characterize the impact of LG3 on an important cell type involved in neointima formation: the mesenchymal stem cells. My work has shown that the LG3 induces both the horizontal migration and the transmigration of MSC. This migration is ERK1/2-dependent, previously identified as a key molecule involved in neointima formation. In addition, our results demonstrate that Src kinase is activated by upstream activation of the MAPK pathway. Horizontal migration and transmigration induced by LG3 are also dependent on alpha2beta1 integrins, and the activation of the MAPK pathway. In a murine transplantation model, we also demonstrated that intravenous injection of recombinant LG3 promotes the accumulation of alphaSMA positive cells in the neointima. In addition, when the recipient is deficient for the alpha2 integrin but the graft is wild type, LG3 fails to induce neointima formation in the graft suggesting that recipient cells play an important role in the neointima formation. Finally, we demonstrated that intravenous injection of LG3 also increases the number of positive cells for the phosphorylated form of ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2) in the neointima. This accumulation is dependent on the presence of alpha2beta1 integrins on recipient cells: when the recipient is wild type, there is an increase in the number of cells positive for p-ERK1/2.The investigation of these mechanisms in vascular remodeling presents new opportunities to inhibit the cellular response that leads to inadequate remodeling during chronic vascular damage and prolong graft survival.

971	Rôle de la ghréline dans la régulation du coactivateur transcriptionnel PGC-1alpha	The adaptation of an organism to its environment is essential to its survival. Energy homeostasis is defined as the balance between intakes, expenses and storage of energy. An excess of calories disrupts this process and leads to the development of the metabolic syndrome that is characterized by obesity, type II diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and dyslipidemia. During fasting, ghrelin participates in the maintenance of energy balance by stimulating hepatic production of glucose and lipid storage in adipose tissue. The transcriptional coactivator PGC-1alpha is overexpressed in the liver during fasting and is involves in the induction of the hepatic glucose production and fatty acid oxidation. Our hypothesis is that these two key performers in the energy metabolism constitute a common axis control. In this study, we show that ghrelin plays a role in the regulation of PGC-1alpha. The ghrelin receptor GHS-R1a is also involved because of its strong constitutive activity in absence of ligand. We found that GHS-R1a inhibited PGC-1alpha transcriptional activity whereas adding ghrelin to cells moderated this effect. PGC-1alpha activation by GHS-R1a correlated with a dose-dependent increase of PGC-1alpha acetylation. The stability of PGC-1alpha was also increased by ghrelin receptor in a manner involving the ubiquitin-independent proteasome pathway. Ghrelin decreased the ability of PGC-1alpha to bind to PPARbeta, one of its nuclear receptor partners. Furthermore, ghrelin decreased the ability of PGC-1alpha to coactivate PPARbeta in a ligand-dependent manner in hepatocytes. Together, these results identify PGC-1alpha as a metabolic target of GHSR-1a signaling and defines a new regulatory axis involving ghrelin/PGC-1alpha/PPARbeta in hepatocytes. A better understanding of this regulation axis will provide novel aspects in therapeutic targeting of diseases associated with the metabolic syndrome.

972	Sélection de gènes de référence pour la normalisation des expériences de PCR quantitative dans un modèle de dysfonction diastolique de lapin	Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (LVDD) is characterized by the diminution of ventricle’s performance, its incapacity to relax normally and an increase of blood filling pressure. LVDD is considered as a main cause of heart failure in approximately 50% of patients suffering from this disease. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying LVDD remain unclear. Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) is widely used in gene-expression studies. In this study we attempt to establish normalization genes for gene expression analysis in a rabbit model of LVDD. Eighteen New-Zealand white rabbits were exposed to normal (n=7) or 0.5% hypercholesterolemic (n=11) diet supplied by vitamin D2; an LVDD animal model previously characterized in our Laboratory. LVDD was assessed by echocardiography. RT-qPCR was performed using cDNA from left ventricle samples and measuring the stability of 10 candidate genes as normalisers (Gapdh, Hprt1, Ppia, Sdha, Rpl5, Actb, Eef1e1, Ywhaz, Pgk1, and G6pd).  We found that Sdha and Gapdh are the most stable genes using geNorm analysis with very high stability average M <0.2. By contrast, Hprt1 and Rpl5 were found to be the best combination for normalization with a stability value of 0.042 when using Normfinder. Comparison of both normalization strategies highlighted an increase of Anp, Bnp, Mcp-1 and Nox-2 mRNA expression in the hypercholesterolemic rabbits (p<0.05) compared to normal controls. This increase correlates with different DD parameters and validates the development of the disease in our model. To our knowledge, this is the first study highlighting stable reference genes for RT-qPCR normalization in a validated rabbit model of LVDD.

973	Ὁ ἐν οὐρανῷ Ἅιδης : la naissance du purgatoire dans l'Antiquité	The aim of the present dissertation is to study the testimonies concerning the doctrine of the “Celestial Hades” from the 4th century BCE to the 6th century CE and to uncover its essential elements. The “Celestial Hades”, translation of the Greek expression ὁ ἐν τῷ οὐρανῷ ᾍδης, is a pattern of thought that characterizes a millenary of the philosophy and the religion of Pagan Antiquity. In analysing this historico-religious motif, we try to be as exhaustive as possible, though we are very prudent towards our sources, which are in most cases fragmentary and originate from the Platonico-Aristotelian tradition. Hence, an effort has been made to show that the celestial Hades is a place of purification for the soul and thus a Purgatory. Generally speaking, our investigation is the first to be entirely dedicated to the study of the doctrine of the Celestial Hades and to its development during Antiquity. To achieve this aim, and following a contextualist approach, we have tried to distinguish three places where the Celestial Hades has been situated: it has been situated either in the Milky Way (Heraclides of Pontus); or between the Moon and the Earth or around the Moon (the Academicians, the Stoics, Cicero, Virgil, Plutarch, the Hermetical writings); finally, it has been situated, according to Numenius and the Latin Neoplatonists, between the sphere of the fixed stars and the Earth. As regarding its development, our study shows that the Platonist and Neoplatonist traditions have provided a favourable milieu for the propagation of this doctrine in Antiquity. Moreover, certain characteristics regarding our theme will be established: the ascension of the soul, the doctrine of physical allegory and the division, ontological et physical, between the sublunary and the supralunary worlds. In the first part of our research, we analyse the doctrine of the Celestial Hades on the Early Academy of Plato (Heraclides, Xenocrates, Philip of Opus) and in the Stoic school.  The second part is dedicated to Plutarch’s doctrine of Purgatory. Thirdly, the same doctrine will be analysed in Cicero and Virgil, and their exegetes, as well as in the Hermetic treatises and Gnosticism. The fourth and last part will explore the celestial Purgatory in the Chaldaean Oracles and in the writings of Proclus, particularly his Commentary on the Republic.

974	Étude de la variation de phase des fimbriae F1651, Pap et CS31A et de l'impact des régulateurs homologues de PapI	Escherichia coli extra-intestinal pathogenic (ExPEC) are responsible for a wide variety of diseases. Particularly ExPEC strains from the subset called uropathogenic E.coli (UPEC) are carrying fimbriae type P. This adhesin family is subject to transcriptional regulation called phase variation, an all or nothing mechanism. It is a competition between two regulatory proteins: the Dam methylase and the nucleoprotein Lrp. This mechanism is also under the influence of the local regulators PapB and PapI. These two regulators are essential to the phase variation. We therefore sought to investigate PapI and its homologs and their impact on the phase variation of fimbriae F1651, Pap, and CS31A. By means of a chromosomal fusion between the regulatory region of clp gene and lacZYA, we studied the effect in trans of PapI and FooI which could restore the phase variation with a strong tendency to phase OFF. To study the action of PapI and FooI, we used a system with gfp as a reporter gene in operons pap and foo. This allowed the observation of the phase variation at the cellular level by flow cytometry and real-time fluorescence microscopy. These experiments confirmed that the population of F165 positive cells have a partial expression state whereas Pap cells mostly have an OFF expression state. We also confirmed that FooI and PapI do not have the same influence on phase variation and that FooI promotes greater frequency of phase variation.

975	Sensibilisation aux émotions et formation de représentations par biofeedback social - Une révision du modèle et ses implications cliniques	Undifferentiated at birth, emotions would become intelligible by being raised to consciousness through the development of sensitivity to the inner sensations accompanying the emotion, their representation and symbolization (Gergely & Watson, 1996). The social biofeedback theory of parental affect-mirroring of Gergely and Watson (1996), furthered by Fonagy, Gergely, Jurist and Target (2002), explains how these somatosensory signals are so important that a complex, probably implicit, and possibly innate social biofeedback interaction exists between caregiver and infant, where the latter learns to differentiate between emotions through the parent’s mirroring of his emotion expression. The aim of this thesis is to revise this theory, and more precisely the ‘markedness’ hypothesis, which would be necessary to dissociate the parental mirroring from the parent and allow appropriation of its informational content as pertaining to the infant. The process of sensitization to these sensations is conceived to be integral to the symbolization of emotions in children and adults. However, ‘motherese’, the singsong prosody of markedness hypothesized to be necessary to foster successful social biofeedback interactions between caregivers and infants, requires that therapists use ‘therapese’ in the clinical setting (Fonagy, 2010), a proposition difficult to reconcile with the therapy of adults. The revision investigates whether the sensitization and symbolization of an emotion is accomplished through an internalization mechanism requiring the ‘markedness’ hypothesis, or solely through social biofeedback mechanisms based on infant contingency detection. It demonstrates that the infant’s contingency detector (similarly to biofeedback training in adults) mediates the iv functions of sensitization, representation, and symbolization of an emotion through its processes of covariance-invariance detection, maximization, and the contingent control of the parental mirroring. It allows the emotion to be raised to consciousness, with the help of the parental mirror, whether it is ‘marked’ or not. The revised model thus becomes applicable to the therapy of adults. A clinical vignette analyzed with the Boston Change Process Study Group’s perspective on change is used to contrast and illustrate the processes of sensitization and representations of emotions, and their application in adult psychotherapy. The thesis considers the clinical implications of the new model and speculates on the consequences of parental difficulties with surrendering to the social biofeedback needs of the infant, and on the consequences of emotional trauma disconnecting sensitive emotion sensations from their representations. Finally, it suggest that both kinds of difficulties can be repaired through sensitive mirroring of emotions in therapy, and that the model might be used concurrently with other models of change, by facilitating the generation of felt and symbolized inner states that can be used for self and other communication in the repair of emotional and relational difficulties in children and adults.

976	Développement de nouveaux matériaux conjugués aux propriétés opto-électroniques modulables : de l’électrochromisme à la fluorescence	Conjugated materials have received much attention lately owing to their photophysical and electrochemical properties that make them suitable for use in plastic electronics applications. The challenges for the creation of new materials are to have reproducible synthetic methods that lead to easily purified products, as well as the intelligent design of molecules that have the desired properties. It is important do develop a synthetic method to created conjugated materials that doesn’t require harsh reaction conditions or expensive metal catalysts. Azomethine bonds are a good way to resolve this problem, since they are formed by a simple condensation between an amine and an aldehyde with water as the only by-product. They can also be synthetised with little to no purification steps and they are isoelectronic to vinyl bonds that are well-known and understood. It is also of crucial importance to understand clearly the effet of adding electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups in the conjugated backbones of such materials. The main objective of this project is to better comprehend the effect of the added 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) electron-donnating group on the opto-electronic properties of azomthine triads for the incorporation of these materials in stable and efficient electrochromic devices. Therefore, the photophysical and electrochemical properties of these materials will be presented. A series of vinyl analogs will be synthesized to confirm their isoelectronic behavior to azomethines in an opto-electronic point of view. These new vinyl compounds lead to the synthesis of a new amino-thiophene derivative that will be used as a building block for on-surface polymerization of azomethines. These polyazomethines will be incorporated in electrochromic devices and their performances will be discussed. Finally, since the azomethines are known not to be highly fluorescent, the fluorescence enhancement of push-pull bithiophene systems will be presented. The knowledge obtained about fluorescence can be used to enhance the fluorescence quantum yields of azomtehines.This thesis will therefore explore diverse tuning of material’s properties to better understand how to cleverly design conjugated materials.

977	New stimuli-responsive block random copolymers and their aggregation	Stimuli-responsive polymers and their use in biomedical applications have been widely investigated in recent years. These polymers change their physical properties such as water-solubility, when subjected to certain stimuli, for example change in temperature or pH. The main purpose of this work is to study new diblock copolymers consisting of two random copolymers, i.e., diblock random copolymers. Polymers with well-defined structures and tunable properties have been made using reversible addition−fragmentation chain-transfer (RAFT) polymerization, one of the controlled radical polymerization techniques. The blocks are made of acrylamide- and/or methacrylate-based monomers, which commonly show thermo-responsiveness and hence, double stimuli-responsive behavior is shown. First, a diblock random copolymer in the form of AnBm-b-ApBq was synthesized with N-n-propylacrylamide (nPA) and N-ethylacrylamide (EA) as A and B using RAFT polymerization. Kinetic study of the copolymerization process confirmed the controlled character of the copolymerization. The diblock random copolymers with the compositions of poly(nPAx-co-EA1-x)-block-poly(nPAy-co-EA1-y) and low polydispersity were obtained. With UV-visible spectroscopy and dynamic light scattering (DLS) we investigate their thermoresponsive characteristics in aqueous solutions. Individual blocks showed tunable cloud points, and the diblock copolymer exhibited a well-separated two-step phase transition upon heating.  Macromolecules in nature can often respond to a combination of external stimuli, most commonly temperature and pH, rather than a single stimulus. Therefore, a second type of diblock random copolymer in the form of AnBm-b-ApCq was synthesized by combining a pH- and temperature-responsive block with another, only temperature-responsive block, producing responsiveness to multiple stimuli. This polymer with the composition of poly(nPAx-co-DEAEMA1-x)-block-poly(nPAy-co-EA1-y) where DEAEMA stands for 2-diethylaminoethyl methacrylate with well-defined structure and tunable properties has also been made using sequential RAFT polymerization. The resulting diblock random copolymer changes its physico-chemical properties, such as water-solubility, in a quite controlled manner when subjected to the changes in temperature or pH.  What happens when blocks of different lengths change their relative hydrophilicity? It is known that the relative length of the blocks in amphiphilic diblock copolymers affects the aggregation mechanism. We compared three diblock copolymers with different block and chain lengths in aqueous solution when they change their relative hydrophilicity due to the change in the external stimuli. The variation of the length and chemical composition of the blocks allows the tuning of the responsiveness of the block copolymers toward both pH and temperature and determines the formation of either micelles or vesicles during the aggregation.

978	Homo Managerialis : une ethnographie des gestionnaires de ressources humaines	"As a device of power for contemporary capitalism, human resources management is a multifaceted paradigm: it is omnipresent and in constant expansion within North American organizations. For over a century, in its triple capacity as provider of practical assistance to the business world, font of therapeutic workplace control and body of psycho-administrative knowledge, human resources management has been busy reshaping the human worker to conform to liberal capitalistic imperatives.  The goal of this dissertation is to further comprehend the power and durability of the human resources paradigm, using ethnography to delve into the experience of the professionals, experts and managers who are its protagonists. The political nature of the managerial phenomenon can be discerned in the meaning these players give to their roles, in their aspirations and rationalizations. Its political stance is embodied in human resources managers' paradoxical use of the power of conflict: at the same time as they position themselves as experts in eliminating conflictuality in the workplace, their discourses, knowledge, legitimations, practices and logics fan the flames of the dissonances they propose to eliminate. As a ""humanizing"" force in the workplace, and as a guardian of the established order, the human resources paradigm serves contemporary capitalism by absorbing, confusing and blurring the outlines of its fundamental contradictions.  And, because the managerial apparatus's power resides precisely in its capacity to dissolve opposition to itself, this dissertation also becomes a reflection on the conditions, limits and possibilities of critique in the anthropology of contemporary subjectivations."	critique , subjectivation , human resources management , work , neoliberalism , critique , conflict , subjectivation , history of human resources management , Quebec	en	10786.0
979	Associations entre des polymorphismes génétiques des gènes CHRN et l'étourdissement ressenti lors de l'initiation à la nicotine	Background: Numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in multiple nicotinic receptor genes (CHRN) are associated with smoking. However few studies have examined the association between CHRN SNPs and subjective responses to smoking which may relate to sustained smoking, such as dizziness at first inhalation. The objective of this study was to investigate the association between 61 SNPs in eight CHRN genes (CHRNA3 CHRNA4 CHRNA5, CHRNA6, CHRNA7, CHRNB2, CHRNB3, CHRNB4) and dizziness at first inhalation. Methods: Data were available in a longitudinal cohort investigation of 1293 students 12-13 years old at baseline. Students completed self-report questionnaires at-school every 3 months for 5 years during secondary school, and a mailed self-report questionnaire three years later. DNA extracted from blood or saliva was genotyped for 61 CHRN SNPs selected using a gene tagging approach. Associations were modeled using logistic regression controlling for sex, race and age at first cigarette. Results: The minor alleles of three SNPs in CHRNA6 (rs7812298, rs2304297, rs7828365) were associated a decreased probability of dizziness (OR (95% CI)=0.54(0.36, 0.81), 0.59(0.40,0.86) and 0.58(0.36,0.95, respectively), while one SNP in each of three other genes (rs3743077 (CHRNA3), rs755204 (CHRNA4), rs7178176 (CHRNA7)) was associated with an increased probability of dizziness (OR(95% CI)=1.40 (1.02,1.90), 1.85(1.05,3.27) and 1.51(1.06,2.15), respectively). Conclusion: Thus, several SNPs located in CHRN genes are associated with dizziness at first inhalation, a smoking initiation phenotype that may relate to sustained smoking.	adolescents , SNP , genetic association , nicotinic cholinergic receptors	en	10779.0
980	Contribution des isoformes de la myosine à l'obstruction respiratoire dans le souffle chez le cheval	Myosin is a motor protein implicated in smooth muscle contraction. The (+)insert isoform doubles smooth muscle velocity. The aim of the study was to evaluate the contribution of the fast contracting myosin isoform to bronchospasm in heaves-affected horses as model of human asthma.  Gene expression analysis of the (+)insert myosin isoform in equine airways was performed in three different cohorts to evaluate 1) its presence and anatomical location in heaves-affected horses; 2) the reversibility of its expression with two common therapies (inhaled corticosteroids and antigen avoidance); and 3) its kinetics of reappearance following a chronic antigen exposure.   Results showed 1) a significantly increased expression of the (+)insert isoform at all levels of the bronchial tree of horses with heaves in clinical exacerbation when compared to control horses and heaves-affected horses in clinical remission; 2) both treatments reduced the fast isoform expression in horses’ lower airways, but the administration of corticosteroids led to a faster response; and 3) (+)insert isoform does not increase in airways of all horses with heaves within 30 days of antigen exposure.  The study shows for the first time a modulation of the fast contracting myosin isoform with the disease status. Data also suggest that (+)insert isoform is part of a protective mechanism enhanced in response to a prolonged antigen exposure.	smooth muscle , heaves , horse , bronchospasm , asthma , myosin heavy chain	en	10777.0

It aims to elucidate the practical features of this field through analysis of its historical roots, various trends, modes of diffusion, and compositional strategies. Starting from this framework, the description and analysis of the compositional methodology for the project Tempêtes are constructed. This audiovisual composition is based on a free interpretation of the late works of the painter, Joseph Mallord William Turner. It unfolds as a journey to the interior of multiple, chaotic landscapes in constant flux. Organized in the form of a sequence of tableaux, Tempêtes brings together synthetic visual representations of cloud particles with an electroacoustic composition derived from the sounds of the violoncellist, Soizic Lebrat.

982	Le Canada et l’article 1F de la Convention relative au statut des réfugiés : une application large en réponse aux menaces à la sécurité nationale	International refugee law emerged in 1951 with the adoption of the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. This instrument, along with its Protocol, defined the contemporary notion of “refugee” and established the rights of these individuals as well as State obligations towards them. However, this international protection was not absolute. Suspecting that many oppressors would attempt to use this mechanism to escape prosecution by finding refuge abroad, the authors of the 1951 Convention introduced a derogation to the definition of refugee by way of the exclusion clause. As such, this article allows States to refuse to extend refugee protection to individuals responsible for the most serious international and national crimes.  Canada, which ratified the 1951 Convention and its 1969 Protocol, incorporated the exclusion clause in its national legislation through article 98 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. The present thesis wishes to examine the application of this exclusion clause in Canadian law. In doing so, we will analyze the understanding of this provision in domestic law. Our objective is to demonstrate that our judicial courts favor a large interpretation of this clause, thus straying from its exceptional nature. This approach results in overweighing the importance of national security against the humanitarian nature of the refugee protection system.

In this context, the protection of incapacitated and vulnerable individuals will be increasingly important in the coming years and they should benefit adequate protection from the institution of protective supervision.   Considering that the institution of protective supervision is always the result of a court order, the clerk of the Superior Court of Quebec has a fundamental role to play during the judicial process. The judicial officer has jurisdiction to pronounce the judgment of institution of protective supervision.   The following study will attempt to verify whether the proven inapt persons are well protected under the actual system whereby the judicial officer has the function and the powers to decide. To do this, a two way analysis will be used. First, the legal framework within which the clerk shall perform its functions will be studied and second, the results and analysis of an empirical survey of clerks of the Superior Court of Quebec will be discussed. This approach should reveal the existing gap between theory and practice.	protection , inaptitude , tutelle , curatelle , judicial officer , clerk , role and powers , person , incapacity , tutorship , curatorship	en	10749.0
984	Modes de conceptualisation métaphoriques et théorie de l’évolution : analyse textuelle et traduction	In 1859, prominent British naturalist Charles Darwin published On the origin of species by means of natural selection, or the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life (OS). In this book, Darwin introduces his theory of evolution. Since its inception, however, the Darwinian theory of evolution has been shrouded in controversy, rejected outright by some (proponents of creationism, intelligent design, etc.) or highjacked by others (proponents of eugenics, social Darwinism, etc.). Yet the profound impact of the theory extends well beyond the English-speaking world. Despite this, the French translations of this important book have rarely been studied. Therefore, in the current study, we have chosen to fill this gap and study the French translations of the OS. Our study is conducted within a framework that is mainly concerned with conceptual metaphors in biomedical discourse, as well as the problems they cause in the process of translation. We have thus chosen to focus on the identification of conceptual metaphors in the OS, and the ways in which they were translated into French. For this project, we developed a methodology involving the electronic annotation and interrogation of our corpus, namely the OS and its French translation. It also involves the creation of electronic links between a translation and its source text. This methodology is based on a previous one, already used successfully in other studies. Due to its complexity, its development constitutes one of the major objectives of our study. The results thus obtained have made it possible to confirm two of our three hypotheses: 1) all conceptual metaphors identified in the original English text of the OS can be found in each of the French translations, and 2) no conceptual metaphor can be found in any of the French translations that is not already present in the original English text. The results obtained allowed us to compare each translation to the original text, but also to compare the translation amongst themselves. This Master’s thesis includes six chapters, which correspond in turn to our: theoretical framework, literature review, hypotheses and objectives, methodology, results, and discussion.

985	Étude de la cinétique et des dommages de gravure par plasma de couches minces de nitrure d’aluminium	A crucial step in the fabrication of high-frequency MEMS is the etching of the columnar AlN thin film acting as the piezoelectric material.  Realized in close collaboration with researchers from Teledyne Dalsa, the objective of this master thesis is to better understand the physico-chemical mechanisms driving the etching kinetics and damage formation dynamics during etching of AlN in Ar/Cl2/BCl3 plasmas.  In the first set of experiments, we have studied the influence of the operating parameters of an inductively coupled plasma on the number density of the main etching species in such plasmas, namely positive ions and Cl atoms.  These measurements were then correlated with the etching characteristics, in particular the etching rate, the surface roughness, and the chemical properties of the AlN layer after etching.  In Ar/Cl2 plasmas, our work has highlighted the inhibition effect of AlO, a compound formed during the AlN growth by reactive magnetron sputtering and not from plasma-wall interactions or from the incorporation of moisture in the columnar nanostructure of AlN.  In presence of small amounts of BCl3 in the Ar/Cl2 plasma, we have observed a significant increase of the etching yield of AlN due to the formation of volatile BOCl compounds.  Furthermore, our work has demonstrated that there are two levels of roughness following etching: a lower roughness produced by the presence of AlO in Ar/Cl2 plasmas which is independent of the etching rate and a larger roughness due to preferential desorption of Al in Ar/Cl2/BCl3 plasmas which increases linearly with the etching rate.

986	Le désir d'éternité : réflexion autour de la notion de plénitude chez Charles Taylor	This M.A. thesis unfolds a reflexion upon the concept of fullness as developed by Charles Taylor, especially in his book A Secular Age, in which the idea of fullness is intrinsically connected with modernity, belief and unbelief. For Taylor, the understanding of modernity implies a grasping of the change that allowed the transition from a context where unbelief in God was considered inconceivable to a context where belief remains only an option. That change consists essentially in a modification of our very representation of fullness. What is fullness for Charles Taylor? It is the condition to which any human being tends towards, and which implies an answer, unspoken or not, to the question of the meaning of life. My main goal will be the understanding of the nature of fullness as conceived by Charles Taylor. I shall show that the twofold definition of fullness in A Secular Age generates a tension between fullness conceived as a unique event, and fullness conceived as a constant aspiration towards meaning (which identifies with goodness). I shall suggest a resolution of this tension through an understanding of fullness which aims to restore its fundamental unity – the idea being to grasp the notion of fullness as a unique event and as the constant aspiration to meaning not separately, but in their relationship with one other. This interpretation model, provided by the idea of eternity, which is also present in A Secular Age, will allow me to establish a coincidence between the pursuit of fullness and the desire of eternity. Both of them share the same fundamental aim: through the inscription of qualitatively privileged and unique moments, constituents of life, in the very totality of this life, they aim to reveal its meaning and to bestow permanence to it. Moreover, I will argue from this coincidence between fullness and eternity that the quest for fullness doesn’t necessarily imply a religious perspective as unfolded in A Secular Age, but can lead rather to a form of transcendence that one can qualify as « temporal ».

987	Introduction à quelques aspects de quantification géométrique	We review some differential geometric prerequisite needed for an initial approach of the geometric quantization theory, i.e. basic notions in symplectic geometry, Lie group, Lie group action, principal G-bundle, connection, associated bundle, almost-complex structure. This leads to an in-depth study of Hermitian line bundles that leads to an existence condition for a prequantum line bundle over a symplectic manifold. With these tools, we start a study of geometric quantization, step by step. We introduce the prequantization theory, which is the construction of operators associated to classical observables and construction of a Hilbert space. Some major problems arise when applying prequantization in concrete examples : the obtained operators are not exactly those expected by first quantization and the constructed Hilbert space is too big. A first correction, polarization, corrects some problems, but greatly limits the set of classical observables that we can quantize.  This dissertation is not a complete survey of geometric quantization, which is not its goal. It's not covering metaplectic correction, neither BKS kernel. It's a side lecture for those introducing themselves to geometric quantization. First, it's introducing differential geometric concepts taken for granted in (Woodhouse [21]) and (Sniatycki [18]), i.e. principal G-bundles and associated bundles. Secondly, it adds details to some brisk proofs given in these two last references.	symplectic geometry , geometric quantization , prequantization , polarization	en	10704.0
988	Etude comparative de l'acte d'invitation dans les cartes d'invitation au mariage en français et en vietnamien	This research on the act of invitation to marriage aims to find out the characteristics of this act in invitation cards in French and Vietnamese, then to reveal the resemblances and the differences which are culturally determined. For this purpose, we described the formulation and the pragmatic functioning of invitation cards to marriage in the view of linguistic politeness.  The analysis result allowed us then to exploit the particularities in the formulation of cards as well as the strategies of politeness privileged in French and Vietnamese communities. We concluded that unlike the individuality that characterises Occidental cultures including French culture, Vietnamese people of rice culture attach more importance to the respect of honor and are afraid of losing face, making others lose face, being different from others, or not being in common with them. As a consequence, they often choose traditional models of invitation cards without insisting too much on the personalisation and they privilege the positive politeness.

To do this, a theoretical analysis of specific aspects processed in the structural and temporal integration of linguistic or musical elements when being processed on-line is essential. Our goal is to question whether a musical training would benefit the aphasic population (Broca) with agrammatism, especially on processing syntactic structures.	agrammatism , Broca's aphasia , music , semantic , musical training	en	10690.0
990	Projection multilingue d'annotations pour dialogues avancés	For a few years now, there has been an increasing number of applications allowing advanced dialog interactions with the user. However, the universalization of those systems quickly becomes painful : since they are highly dependent on the original development language, each new language to integrate requires an additionnal and significative time investment. A matter that only gets worse considering quality usually rests on the size of training set. This project tries to speed up the overall process. It presents various methods to generate multilingual versions of a first functionnal system, using statistical machine translation. Information from the source data is projected to another language in order to create similar target data, which then reduces the upcoming development time. Many approaches were tested and analysed. In particular, a method that regroups data in clusters before reordering the associated translation candidates shows promising results.

991	El habla de la comunidad paisa de Medellín en Montreal	In this study we describe the current state of the Spanish spoken by the Paisa community from Medellin (Colombia) in Montreal, whose dialect or language variant is also known as Paisa. To carry out this research, we conducted fieldwork with a questionnaire and semi-structured oral interviews. The data collected allowed us to establish the first set of comparisons between Paisa spoken in Montreal and that of Medellin and to identify some of the main linguistic changes in this community of speakers, especially interferences from French in spoken Spanish, factors that favour them, as well as changes at a socio-cultural level: Paisa’s linguistic attitudes towards their variation, towards Spanish in general and towards the French of Quebecois in Montreal’s Metropolitan Area. Finally, it is also possible to identify some of the differences and similarities in regards to the current linguistic situation in Medellin. Although the studied community represents a low percentage of Spanish speakers in the city, this research contributes knowledge about the Spanish spoken in Montreal, since its results combined with those from other studies will facilitate a better understanding of the linguistic reality facing this language.

992	El habla de la comunidad cubana en Montreal	This paper presents a first general characterization of the speech of the Cuban community in Montreal, with special attention to two aspects: the behavior of some of the characterizing features of Cuban Spanish in migrant speakers, and the possible contact-induced variations. To do this, we use data from a corpus collected by the researcher through recorded conversations (colloquial speech) with 19 Cubans: ten men and nine women currently living in Montreal. After analyzing the data, we have found that the characterizing features are preserved in the speech of Cuban residents in the city. The data also show some variations induced by the contact with the dominant languages (French-Spanish and, to a lesser extent, English-Spanish) band other varieties of Spanish, as well as with a new reality that is socio-economically, politically and culturally very different from the Cuban one. The detected variations at the morphosyntactic level are mainly in invariable words (prepositions).At the lexical-semantic level, we have found predominantly loanwords. There are also semantic loans, calques and frequency changes of some words. Concerning the pragmatic level, a slower rhythm of speech, possibly due to the condition of functional bilingualism, has been observed. In sum, the speech of the Cuban participants in this study shows some of the characteristic features of any language contact situation, but also has peculiarities relating to the characteristics of the community under study (language attitudes, for example), the typological distance between the languages involved (Spanish-French) and the contrast between the societies, among other factors.

993	Une sociologie du nationalisme vécu en Flandre	This master thesis, in contrast to most studies concerning the nation and its various phenomena, does not focus on the emergence of a form of community or the effects of nationalism on our political institutions. It rather studies the experienced meanings, the feelings of national belonging and how they can be expressed and experienced. By focusing on how people live and talk about their national affiliation, the aim of this research is to understand how citizens of a given community represent their national belonging and build themselves as national subjects.  Using semi-structured interviews and exploring family memory, it has been possible to observe and understand everyday nationalism in Flanders. This form of nationalism is not necessarily strongly asserted or even noticeable; it is integrated in the lives of individuals. Studying this specific form of nationalism allows the researcher to identify and explain how people make sense of those so-called national elements integrated into everyday life. It also gives a glimpse of what the national imagination is in the experienced meanings of a specific population and how it can be projected by the holders of this identity. By studying this aspect of national belonging, it has been possible to sketch out a portrait of representations of the nation in a way that has been so far little explored. Hence, a most unusual form of socialization to a national community has been identified in Flanders: socialization to a discourse of victimisation and oppression. By deliberately considering themselves as part of a line whose ascendants were dominated and despised, the Flemishs make sense of the genuine qualities and specificities that they identified as properly Flemish, but most of all, it allows them to refer themselves as the “best Belgians”.	nation , lived nationalism , Flanders , Belgium , families' memory , national belonging	en	10648.0
994	Médiation urbaine à Montréal : étude sur les cercles de résolution de conflits	In Quebec, community mediation is a newly developed practice which has started to be used during the last decade.  Studies on the practice of social mediation in the Province are very rare and that’s why our discussion will review the conflict resolution process of one community mediation team in Montreal. Moreover, the literature on this subject shows that social mediation is used and defined in numerous ways. It is also linked to multiple functions and while some authors will emphasize the urgency of more precisely defining the theoretical nature of social mediation, others will focus on the multiplicity of practices as a main challenge. For this reason, our study is all the more relevant since it aims at clarifying both the theoretical and practical aspects of this practice in order to enhance it. Among other things, we have analysed the processes of community mediation in Montreal and the experiences and views of the parties involved. To do this, we conducted unguided self-directed interviews and complemented them with participation observations, as part of our qualitative method approach. Community mediation in Montreal is a very innovative practice which has become more complex because of the political challenges within the community. However, given its positive effects and its huge potential it is worth developing further.	Cohabitation , Community mediation , Conflict resolution , Living together , Urban space	en	10646.0
995	Services aux adultes handicapés physiques : enquête auprès des bibliothèques publiques québécoises	Services offered to library users are important to librarianship. However, users form an heterogeneous group and the same services should be offered or, at least, be made available to all members of the community. Unfortunately, public libraries sometimes are experiencing difficulties to provide adequate and adapted services to people have disabilities those, often, are not aware of the services they could benefit from. In addition, these individuals are often not aware pf the services that are offered to them. However, people with disabilities are part of the community and their number is increasing due to the aging of the population and better diagnostic capabilities. We should also mention that those people claim their autonomy more than before as well as the right to be able to enjoy the same services as the rest of the population. This has become even more true since the introduction of different technical and technological aids and services that allow them to live their lives to the fullest. For all these reasons, library managers must ensure that the reception of these users with special needs will be adequately insured, thus enabling them to become users “like the others”.  As there is a lack of studies on the subject, we have decided to examine the situation through an electronic questionnaire sent to public library employees responsible for user services. The results collected have enabled us to draw a picture of the current state of disability services in public libraries in Quebec and to provide certain recommendations. The results should help library managers to establish where and how to focus their efforts to make their institutions more welcoming to this category of users. Specifically, the research objectives were: 1. Identify services offered by public libraries in Quebec to adult users with disabilities. 2. Identify current accessibility elements present in Quebec public libraries’ infrastructure. 3. Avaluate the impact of the presence or absence of accessibility measures on the supply of services for adult users with disabilities and items related to accessibility. 4. Compare the results with those of previous surveys (Bibliothèque nationale du Canada 1976 ; Bergeron 1987) to highlight the recommendations that have been applied and those that have not.

996	L'économie criminelle de la Camorra et la pratique discursive des différents points de vue dans Gomorra de Roberto Saviano	This thesis will study the Italian literary phenomenon Gomorra, viaggi nell'impero economico e nel sogno di dominio della Camorra. First, the focus will be on the text's hybrid nature and implications and also on its literary and intellectual inspirations (such as Truman Capote, Pier Paolo Pasolini and Leonardo Sciascia). Secondly, we will take a closer look at the structure of the novel's narrative and its literary details, in order to reveal the different processes used by Roberto Saviano to convince the reader. Interwoven in this book's central plot, we will find a main obsession: the need to understand.    Lastly, we will discuss the question of the great power treated in this novel, the one of a criminal organisation transformed by the revelations made throughout the story. These revelations will allow us to draw interesting comparisons between organized crime and merchant capitalism. For this part, we will refer to Guy Debord's La société du spectacle, and to Hannah Arendt's work on the question of totalitarianism. All of these elements will allow us to discuss the different perspectives within the narrative's framework, and more precisely, the figure of the narrator/author/character that gives Saviano's novel anthropological qualities, in the form of an ethnofiction (Augé).

Hearing aids disturb all of the acoustic cues necessary for accurate sound localization and thus negate some of their benefits. This study addressed behavioral adaptation to changes in auditory spatial cues caused by changes similar to those induced by hearing aids. Spectral cues (HRTFs) were distorted by changing the shape of the outer ear with silicon molds. The present experiment was aimed at determining the perceptual modalities (visual, spectral or tactile) that might enable the switch from the modified to the original HRTFs once the molds were removed. Results indicate that participants were able to adapt within four training sessions. Participants immediately showed accurate sound localization when ear molds were removed. It was not possible to conclude whether the perceptual feedbacks had a major impact on the choice of the correct set of HRTFs to use. Adaptation to the modified HRTFs lasted weeks after their removal.	Adaptation , Perception , Adaptation , Spatial localization , Hearing , Perceptual modalities , Plasticity	en	10615.0

The advent of democracy, an invaluable human achievement, more or less regulated ideological plurality, and allowed the evolution of an organized political exercise. Today, in the new world order, it is the moral and religious diversity that need to be managed. The challenge remains for democratic institutions and civil society to create a better harmonious community through dialogue, understanding and compromise. However, much work is still to be done : first, within each religious tradition, second, between different traditions and third, between tradition and modernity. Dogmatism  is at the heart of these debates. An order, whether traditional or modern hampers objectives reasoning in the process of liberation and emancipation. The issue of this paper concerns the management of the moral and religious plurality in the West. In this work, we will try to demonstrate how the relinquishing of ‘dogmatism’ in general and the relinquishing of Muslim ‘dogmatism’ in particular, can contribute to the achievement of a harmonious in a pluralistic West. This will be achieved by shedding light on the projects of two contemporary Muslim thinkers : Muhammad Arkoun and Tariq Ramadan. Our research is mainly to reflect on their attitudes towards tradition versus modernity, as we believe that the issue of dogmatism is linked to Muslims’ attitude towards tradition and modernity. According to these two thinkers, the release of muslims’ ‘dogmatism’ is only possible by changing both our relationship to tradition and modernity.  Arkoun thinks this change should follow the model of Western release through a subversive critique of the Islamic tradition. However, Ramadan opts for a radical reform of Islamic thought through a comprehensive critique of the tradition, in order to save the foundation of faith : The ‘sacred’.

999	Modélisation et analyse des interventions d’équitation thérapeutique utilisées à des fins de réadaptation	Context and research question. According to the Canadian Therapeutic Riding Association, therapeutic riding regroups all equestrian activities offered to persons with disabilities. Therapeutic riding can be divided into different approaches, including hippotherapy, a rehabilitation strategy practiced by occupational therapists, physiotherapists and speech language specialists. Hippotherapy bases itself on the three dimensional movement created by the horse which favours the improvement of various neuromotor skills such as muscle tone of the trunk and head, standing posture and postural adjustments. Although therapeutic riding is gaining momentum in Quebec, official regulation still does not exist. As a consequence, much confusion exists between the different forms of therapeutic riding and hippotherapy (presently the only medically recognised rehabilitation therapy using horses). Clientele presenting with severe neuro-musculo-skeletal disabilities are often and regularly referred to centers not offering hippotherapy and are thus exposed to important risk. Objectives. To modelize therapeutic riding interventions in order to make the components and relationships of these interventions explicit. To also analyze the plausibility that these interventions will reach the set therapeutic goals. Methodology. Therapeutic riding techniques were modelized via interviews with the main therapists offering therapeutic riding services in Quebec. A literary review of the rehabilitation principles guiding these interventions was also conducted. Results. The created models helped improve the knowledge of therapeutic riding and hippotherapy practices in Quebec. Consequences. The models have allowed the conversation surrounding regulation of these practices in Quebec and Canada to begin as well as promoted the reference process to the various centers offering these services.

The main time period under consideration is from the foundation of the order in 1938 until 2012. In order to contextualize the particularities of this modern order’s emergence, this thesis begins by presenting its historical roots related to the history of Sufism in North Africa and West Asia. Then, the thesis offers a comparative analysis of certain national contexts in which the order was disseminated, from Sudan to Egypt, France, Germany, the United States, and Canada. The author concludes from his findings that the sheikhs of the Burhaniya have facilitated the expansion of their order in the West, and perpetuated a fairly traditional Sufi heritage in the modern world. They have done so by combining strong commitment to core doctrines and adaptability to contexts of practice.	islam , Burhaniya , Islam , mysticism , Sufism , Sudan , Burhaniya , modernity , globalization , post-colonialism , decolonialism , transdisciplinarity	en	10578.0
1001	L'absorption des recours pour atteinte illicite prévus à la Charte des droits et libertés de la personne par le régime de responsabilité civile de droit commun	"In a sequence of judgments rendered since 1996, the Supreme Court of Canada assimilates liability action for ""unlawful interference"" under Article 49 of the Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms to civil liability action under the general law. The Supreme Court said on this occasion that for there to be unlawful infringement, violation of the right has to be qualified as faulty. This qualification may be demonstrated if a person’s conduct violates ""a standard of conduct considered reasonable in the circumstances under the general law"" or if the person violates ""in the case of certain protected rights, a standard set out in the Charter itself"". In the first case, the notion of fault, as understood by the Supreme Court of Canada, absorbs the notion of ""unlawful interference"", while in the second case it dissolves in ""unlawful interference"" (which makes an objective fault in abstracto). However, in the second case, the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision in St. Lawrence Cement, rendered in 2008, said that the fault is an obligation of means, which is assessed according to the criteria of prudent and diligent person. Thus, it is not obligation of result. It would be now difficult to reconcile this characterization of the fault with the policy adopted by the Supreme Court's in the matter of the Charter. Since the text of the Charter itself contains the substantive and formal conditions under which it is possible to determine the existence of an ""unlawful interference"", it would be desirable that the method of convergence of actions between the Code and the Charter should be abandoned in favor of the recognition of the material autonomy of the Charter to ensure consistency of law, which would also mean not to distort the concept of fault. Moreover, while the Supreme Court established unlawful interference has no prejudice in itself, the author attempts to demonstrate that the violation of a right is still an inherent prejudice that the law must recognize."

1002	Évaluation du projet Hôpital promoteur de santé en contexte de périnatalité : analyse logique et analyse d’implantation	Problem: The concept of health promoting hospitals (HPH) emerged in the wake of the 1986 Ottawa Charter, which notably calls for the reorientation of health services toward more health promoting services. The concept targets the health of patients, staff, the community and the organization itself. In the context of Quebec’s health system reform that aims to bring services closer to the population and facilitates the journey of any person within a local network of health and social services (RLS), the adoption of the HPH concept appears to be a window of opportunity for teaching hospitals, now included in integrated university health care networks (RUIS) and linked to RLS, to carry out major organizational changes. Given the paucity of evidence regarding implementation of the different dimensions of HPH projects, there is a need for health care facilities to be accompanied in this process through the development of clear-cut strategies and practical tools in order to support implementation. Our study will focus on the first university hospital in Montreal that decided to adopt the concept and implement a HPH pilot project within its perinatal centre. Objectives: The objectives of this thesis are 1) to analyse the intervention theory underlying the HPH project; 2) to analyse the implementation of the HPH project; and 3) to explore the potential of developmental evaluation as a means of supporting the implementation process. Methods: To better understand the implementation of the HPS project, we opted for a qualitative case study. We first analyzed the theory of intervention by conducting a literature review in order to identify the characteristics of an HPS project as well as the conditions necessary for its implementation. Then, as regards the implementation analysis, our single case study had two methodological approaches: one to assess the level of implementation and the other to analyze facilitators and barriers to implementation. Finally, we explored the interest of using developmental evaluation to support the implementation process. Based on purposeful sampling, data of the case study were collected from key informants, HPH project promoters, managers, professionals and couples of patients directly concerned by the HPH project implementation in the perinatal centre. A documentary analysis of project documents has been done and participant observation was conducted in the setting. Results: The first article is about a logical analysis that presents the strengths and weaknesses of the implementation of the HPH project within the birthing centre, and offers a deeper comprehension of the factors likely to influence implementation. The second article assesses the level of implementation of the four dimensions of the HPH project. The complementarity of the different sources used allowed us to identify global successes, activities that were implemented only partially or still in the process of implementation, and activities that were based on an inadequate intervention theory. The third article shows the influence of intervention characteristics, outer and inner settings, and individual characteristics upon the implementation process, using the consolidated framework for implementation research developed by Damschroder et al. (2009). The fourth and final article highlights the challenges encountered by the researcher in attempting to use developmental evaluation, and puts forth solutions that will enable researchers to anticipate the difficulties that can emerge from integrating the demands of research and of utilization. Conclusion: This thesis contributes to the understanding of HPH project implementation in health care facilities, particularly within a perinatal care context. The results we have obtained are of interest to researchers as well as hospital or health care facility administrators who wish to implement or evaluate HPH projects.

1003	Choix de portefeuille de grande taille et mesures de risque pour preneurs de décision pessimistes	This  thesis consists of three chapters on the topics of  portfolio choice in a high-dimensional context, and risk measurement. The first chapter addresses the estimation error issue that arises when constructing large portfolios in the mean-variance framework. The second chapter investigates the relevance of currency risk for optimal domestic portfolios, evaluates their ability of to diversify away currency risk, and  study the links between portfolio weights stability and currency risk. Finally, under the assumption that decision makers are  pessimistic, the third chapter derives the risk premium, propose a measure of the degree of pessimism, and provide a statistical framework for their estimation.  The first chapter improves the performance of the optimal portfolio weig-hts obtained under the mean-variance framework of Markowitz (1952). Indeed, these weights give unsatisfactory results, when the mean and variance are replaced  by their sample counterparts (plug-in rules). This problem is amplified when the number of assets is large and the sample covariance is singular or nearly singular. The chapter investigates four regularization techniques to stabilizing the inverse of the covariance matrix: the ridge, spectral cut-off, Landweber-Fridman, and LARS Lasso. These four methods involve a tuning parameter that needs to be selected. The main contribution is to derive a data-based method for selecting the tuning parameter in an optimal way, i.e. in order to minimize the expected loss in utility of a mean-variance investor. The cross-validation type criterion derived is found to take a similar form for the four regularization methods. The resulting regularized rules are compared to the sample-based mean-variance portfolio and the naive 1/N strategy in terms of in-sample and out-of-sample Sharpe ratio and expected loss in utility. The main finding is that regularization to covariance matrix significantly improves the performance of the mean-variance problem and outperforms the naive portfolio, especially in ill-posed cases, as suggested by our simulations and empirical studies.  In the second chapter, we investigate the extent to which optimal and stable portfolios of domestic assets  can reduce or eliminate currency risk. This is done using monthly returns on 48 U.S. industries, from 1976 to 2008. To tackle the instabilities inherent to large portfolios, we use the spectral cut-off regularization described in Chapter 1. This gives rise to a family of  stable global minimum portfolios that allows investors to select different percentages of principal components for portfolio construction.  Our empirical tests are based on a conditional International Asset Pricing Model (IAPM), augmented with the size and book-to-market factors of Fama and French (1993). Using two trade-weighted currency indices of industrialized countries currencies and  emerging markets currencies, we find that currency risk is priced and time-varying for global minimum portfolios. These strategies also lead to a significant reduction in the exposure to currency risk, while keeping the average premium contribution to total premium approximately the same. The global minimum weights considered are an alternative to market capitalization weights used in  the U.S. market index. Therefore, our findings complement the well established results that currency risk is significantly priced and economically meaningful at the industry and country level in most countries.  Finally, the third chapter derives a measure of the risk premium for rank-dependent preferences  and proposes a measure of the degree of pessimism, given a distortion function.  The introduced measures generalize the common risk measures derived in the expected utility theory framework, which is frequently violated in both experimental and real-life situations. These measures are derived in the neighborhood of a given random loss variable, using the notion of local utility function. A particular interest is devoted to the CVaR, which is now  widely used for asset allocation and has been advocated to complement the Value-at-risk (VaR) proposed since 1996 by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. We provide the statistical framework needed to conduct inference on the derived measures.

1004	Avoir ou être dans les formes verbales composées : conflits, usages et choix des grammairiens dans l'histoire du français de 1500 à 1789	In contemporary French, the hesitation in the choice between être and avoir as an auxiliary verb in compound verb forms (i.e. the passé composé) of certain intransitive verbs (i.e. tomber), especially in non-standard varieties of French, clearly demonstrates the gap that exists between normative French and everyday spoken French. This hesitation, or uncertainty, in the choice of the auxiliary is not an arbitrary or random characteristics of contemporary French; it falls squarely within a diachronical and cross-Romance trend that can be observed in the French language since its emancipation from Latin.  This study, which is based on Grammaticalisation Theory, is an analysis of grammatical discourse from 1500 - the era when the first grammars of French appeared - to 1789 and the French revolution, a period when the language is said to have been standardised and its modern form established.  The three centuries that this study covers are divided into four distinct periods, already well  established by previous historical studies. These periods are :    - The 16th century (1530-1599)   - The first half of the Classical Period (1600-1650)   - The second half of the Classical Period (1651-1715)   - The Enlightenment (1716-1789)   For each of these four periods, there are three levels of analysis. First, we identify the grammarians, lexicographers and essayists who, explicitly or implicitly, express their views on the use of the auxiliaries avoir and être in compound verbs forms, as well as, where possible, their native dialect and the model of French (usage) they promote. Second, we summarize the observations and commentaries of each author on the choice of auxiliary in compound verb forms, including any attempts to explain the variation attested during the period. Finally, we look at the description, for each period, of the use of auxiliaries in compound verb forms put forward by historians of the French language.  Our study has allowed us to confirm certain established trends related to auxiliary use in compound verb forms in French and to identify others. As well, we identify, or define, the factors that influence auxiliary selection, such as the verbs most likely to alternate between the two auxiliaries, the grammarians who had the greatest influence or who set the groundwork for establishing the norm for this grammatical point, the social contexts in which the grammatical debate took place and the periods during which the concern over auxiliary selection was the most intense.

1005	La cinéphanie et sa réappropriation : l’«affect originel» et sa réactualisation par le fan, un spectateur néoreligieux	Mostly theoretical in nature, this thesis looks into a subject that has been little researched by the francophone academia both in Europe and in Québec: fans. Though fan studies are an active field of study in English-language universities (see Henry Jenkins and Matt Hills, among others), there exists no body of work in French that summarizes and speculates about the affective experience of fans. My thesis intents to fill this gap. Inspired by the concept of hierophany that was formulated by the famous religious historian Mircea Eliade, I created the neologism cinephany to describe the following concept: any affective expression spreading over a short period of time which culminates into a high level of emotional satisfaction. From this concept, I will define the typology which will illustrate the various types of cinephanic experiences that can drive viewers and fans to get emotionally involved in cultural reappropriation activities (alone or within a fandom) in order to adapt the emotions linked to the source cultural object. Using anthropologist Victor Turner's work on rituals, I suggest a tripartite organization of the cinephanic experience into the following phases: premilimal cinephany, cinephany (liminal) and post-liminal cinephany.  My research objectives are threefold. The first is to speculate about the intense affective relationship between consumers and a pop culture object in a diachronic and synchronic manner. There currently exists no such body of work in the world, including among English-language researchers. My second aspiration is to secularize the terminology used to describe the intense episodes fans experience. Some still use religious analogies with words such as epiphany and revelation to adequately illustrate the importance fans attach to the emotions they feel towards a specific cultural object. Finally, my last objective is to synthesize – in an openly transdisciplinary perspective – the work from various disciplines in regards to media affect. This will allow me to paint a clear picture highlighting the implicit existence of theoretical traces of cinephany within the work of other researchers.

1006	Un pont entre les obédiences : expériences normandes du Grand Schisme d'Occident (1378-1417)	Between 1378 and 1417, the Catholic Church was divided between two, and then three contending popes. While Urban VI and his successors settled in Rome, Clement VII and his successor, Benedict XIII, returned to Avignon. This dissertation documents and analyses the multiple experiences known in Normandy in reaction to the Great Western Schism. Norman commitments to resolve this division were plural and they were expressed in numerous manners. Relying on Vatican archives, University of Paris and local archives, this study demonstrates the different reactions that coexisted in Normandy in response to the Great Western Schism. Although the Norman nobility was generally favourable to the Avignon popes, officially recognized by the King of France, important waves of resistance to that papacy were also expressed amongst Norman clergymen, prelates, as well as university students and professors. This resistance led some to choose exile, in order to recognize the Roman popes. Those Norman exilees, although they formed a modest community, had considerable influence in the Roman obedience, and they have been the object of very little scholarly attention. Amongst the vast majority of those who remained in the obedience of Clement VII, many Norman intellectuals were known for being very critical, even being enemies of the Avignon popes. The relationships that exiled Normans maintained with their colleagues who remained in Clément VII’s obedience played a very important role in the dialogue between obediences that led to the council of Pisa in 1409. This dissertation highlights the multiplicity of Norman attitudes in response to the Great Western Schism, it deepens our knowledge of the various Norman groups touched by the division and it improves our understanding of the different debates that surrounded the crisis. It also allows to further the reflection on the questions of how the schism affected the notion of obedience, and of the Norman networks at work during that period.

1007	Effets de l'activité physique durant la grossesse sur le cerveau de la mère et de l'enfant	Pregnancy is a pivotal moment in life when a woman reconsiders the value of each of her lifestyle choices. It is well known that physical activity brings benefits for cognition in children and adults, but is this also the case for pregnant women? What about their children? The overall objective of this thesis was to examine the effect of the interaction between physical activity and pregnancy on the cognitive functions of the mother and of the child. A first study shows that the cognition of pregnant women decreases during the third trimester and is not affected by their fitness level. A second study shows the effects of an exercise session on several cognitive abilities of pregnant women. We observed that pregnant women's self-monitoring ability is poorer than that of control women and that pregnant women's self-monitoring and sustained attention diminish after a bout of acute cardiovascular exercise. Finally, a third study shows the impact of physical activity performed throughout pregnancy on the brain of the newborn. This study demonstrates that newborns of active mothers have more mature neurophysiological responses than children of sedentary mothers. Taken together, these results demonstrate that pregnancy induces cognitive deficits. In addition, the cognitive functions of pregnant women are impaired as a result of an exercise session. Thus, they should not plan to exercise before a cognitively demanding activity. Nonetheless, women should still exercise regularly during pregnancy to provide the best possible start in life for their child.

1008	Rapport au travail, mobilité professionnelle et parcours de vie : le cas de jeunes infirmières et infirmières auxiliaires d'un centre de santé et de services sociaux	This doctoral thesis in applied social sciences first set out to address a very concrete problem, namely turnover among nurses and nursing assistants in the health and social services system. Along the way, however, it became apparent that there was a need to broaden our investigation to include the issue of young nurses’ relationship with work so as to grasp the broader social dynamics behind some work-related decisions, including the nurses’ decision to leave their jobs. This thesis therefore pursued two main goals. First, it sought to identify all the processes that lead young nurses to decide to leave their jobs. Second, it aimed to better understand how young nurses’ relationship with work evolves over the course of their lives.  The theoretical perspective chosen was based on two complementary approaches, that is, the life course perspective and various streams of sociology of the individual which all place great importance on the social context and structural constraints as well as the autonomy of actors and their capacity to take action to influence their life course. These approaches proved to be particularly fruitful for our study because they made it possible to consider the complex relationships between the more general social context, the particular contexts involved in individuals’ lives, and their employment behaviours. Thus, the relationship with work was conceptualized as a process that evolves over time and through which different aspects of individuals’ lives and of the lives of their loved ones combine to guide their professional trajectories. Viewed from this perspective, the decision to leave one’s job involves a process that is constructed over a relatively long period of time and involves several dimensions of one’s life. The perspective adopted in this thesis addresses some gaps in this field since few studies have examined – from the point of view of the actors themselves – the various processes that shape individuals’ relationship with work over time and lead to the decision to leave their jobs.   To meet the goals of this research, a qualitative study was conducted. Individual life-narrative interviews were carried out to investigate – from their own point of view – how the participants’ relationship with work evolved and the processes that led them to leave their jobs. A case study was undertaken in a health and social services centre in the province of Quebec which had a particularly high turnover rate. It involved nurses and nursing assistants, a professional group affected by a high rate of turnover. In-depth interviews lasting from 2½ to 3 hours were conducted with 42 nurses and nursing assistants.  The study results were presented in three scientific articles. The first, Pour une compréhension dynamique du rapport au travail: la valeur heuristique de la perspective des parcours de vie (For a dynamic understanding of the relationship with work: the heuristic value of the life course perspective) aims to bring out the usefulness of the analytical principles associated with the life course perspective for the study of the relationship with work. This article shows that individuals’ relationship with work involves a complex process wherein their aspirations, concrete working conditions and the events that occur in their personal and family lives are dynamically and interdependently linked and shape their relationship with work throughout their lives. This article reflects on a question posed by researchers, that is, how best to grasp the factors involved in young people’s relationship with work?   The second article, Rencontre entre l’idéaltype de travailleur et l’idéal de travail: le cas de jeunes infirmières en début de vie professionnelle (Encounter between the ideal type of worker and the ideal of work: the case of young nurses at the start of their working lives) explores how nurses’ expectations regarding work came up against the concrete realities of their work at a specific time in their professional trajectory, that is, their initial integration into the job and their first years on the job. The article shows that three dimensions of the nurses’ relationship with work were affected by the new managerial practices prevailing in the health and social services system: 1) the desired role of work in their lives 2) the ability to self-actualize through work, and 3) the meaning given to work. This article makes an important contribution to the understanding of the relationship with work of young professionals practising a helping profession in Quebec’s health and social services system.  The third article, Comprendre le roulement comme un processus lié au cycle de la vie: le cas des infirmières (Understanding turnover as a lifecycle process : the case of nurses), more specifically examines turnover among nurses. It presents four turnover trajectories with distinct characteristics related to the mismatch between the nurses’ expectations regarding work and the realities of their work, the interaction between work and life outside of work and the way the nurses’ decision to leave their jobs developed over time. The results show that the nurses’ decision to leave their jobs involved a process that developed over a shorter or longer period of time, involved various dimensions of their lives, and was intimately tied to the quest for self-actualization through work and in other spheres of their lives. This article proposes a way to grasp turnover that differs from the dominant models, which approach this issue from an essentially individualizing and psychologizing perspective.  The contribution of this thesis to the advancement of knowledge mainly resides in its innovative way of examining the relationship with work and employee turnover, that is, by applying the life course perspective and sociology of the individual to these issues. Our approach aimed to grasp the social processes and many other aspects that need to be taken into consideration when examining young nurses’ relationship with work and their decision to leave their jobs. It highlights the importance of considering the broader social context affecting all people in modern societies who must construct their identity over the course of their lives.

1009	Éco-épidémiologie de la maladie de Lyme dans le Sud-Ouest du Québec : étude des facteurs environnementaux associés à son établissement	Since the 90s in Canada, studies have identified new endemic areas for the agent of Lyme disease, Borrelia burgdorferi and the tick vector, Ixodes scapularis. These newly endemic areas for complex I. scapularis - B. burgdorferi are prime areas to study the transmission cycle in its environmental context. The main objective of this project is to study the spirochete-tick-host relationships and environmental factors involved in the transmission cycle from the data of the vector and the pathogen collected in southwestern Quebec, 2007 to 2008. First, a description of the seasonality of ticks and associations between the vector and captured rodent hosts was performed. The identification of specific seasonality at each stage of the tick I. scapularis establishes months conducive to make the future collections of ticks. Synchronous seasonality of questing immature ticks may also be an indicator of the nature or strain of B. burgdorferi found. In addition, the association of immature ticks in different species or different classes of hosts (i.e. age, sex, reproductive status) was explored. The Peromyscus mice and adult males in particular contributed significantly to the survival and development of complex I. scapularis-B. burgdorferi. Chipmunks and squirrels also contributed to the survival and development of I. scapularis populations. Second, the associations between vector and examined deer was described taking into account the environmental factors associated with the level of infestation and the use of deer as sentinels for the vector and the pathogen was evaluated. According to our results, the deer are effective sentinels to detect Anaplasma phagocytophilum, but seem ineffective or imprecise to detect endemic areas for complex I. scapularis-B. burgdorferi. Finally, an analysis of the impact of the host diversity and habitat on the abundance of I. scapularis and prevalence of B. burgdorferi considering other environmental factors was performed. These analyzes were used to determine the critical factors in the establishment of complex I. scapularis-B. burgorferi and explore the relative contribution of various host species. According to our studies, the diversity of the host community and habitat influences the complex I. scapularis-B. burgdorferi. On the other hand, the climate (temperature and precipitation) plays a significant role in the establishment, survival and development of the I. scapularis populations. This study allowed us to explore and identify various biotic and abiotic environmental factors influencing the establishment of complex I. scapularis-B. burgdorferi in southwestern Quebec. These environmental factors could be used as environmental indicators of the risk of Lyme disease in Quebec and possibly elsewhere in Canada.	borrelia burgdorferi , anaplasma phagocytophilum , Lyme disease , eco-epidemiology , environmental factors , rodents , deer , Quebec , ixodes scapularis	en	10507.0
1010	Perception du soutien social chez les adolescentes victimes d'agression sexuelle	This study investigates the role of social support as a protective factor in the posttraumatic adjustment of sexually abused victims. Many studies show the protective role of social support but others find its positive impact varies according to the source of support (Ullman, 1996), the type of support (Feiring, Taska, & Lewis, 1998) or the victim’s perception (Campbell, Ahrens, Sefl, Wasco, & Barnes, 2001). A qualitative approach allows us to examine the complex process at play when social support impacts post-traumatic adjustment which then allows us to better identify and explore social support’s characteristics. The goal was to describe in depth and to better understand how sexually abused female teenagers perceive the social support they received. A semi structured clinical interview was used with eight sexually abused adolescents to document their perspectives and verbatim accounts were analyzed qualitatively using thematic analysis. Social support was mainly positive although three main negative reactions were identified: betrayal regarding the abuse, verbal and physical violence and negative rumors about the adolescents. This understanding of the perspective of these adolescents can lead to promoting better social support experiences in the future.

1011	L'anorexie mentale chez les adolescents et les jeunes adultes de sexe masculin: Recension des écrits	Anorexia nervosa has been the target of many research efforts. The latest studies, however, are mainly focused on female subjects. The literature on males with anorexia nervosa is currently emerging. The review of this literature suggests pooling knowledge about male anorexia nervosa that can be extracted from the literature starting from1996 until 2011. The variables that are specifically targeted are clinical presentation, the premorbid conditions, personality characteristics, sexual orientation and gender identity, comorbid troubles, and prognosis. The comparison and the pooling of the results of 24 studies forming the review allow us in some cases to support observations made by previous research and to identify certain trends. Among other things, there appears to be similarities between the behavioral symptoms of boys and girls. The review identifies some areas where further research is needed and emphasizes the plurality and heterogeneity of research methods.

1012	Identification et caractérisation des principaux fragments du collagène de type II du cartilage équin, produit in vitro par l'enzyme cathepsine K	The proteolytic degradation of type II collagen is believed to be mainly an irreversible event in the process of cartilage matrix degradation in osteoarthritis. Cathepsin K is the most active enzyme protease outside the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family (MMP 13, -8, -1) capable of degrading the intact triple helical type II collagen. The short term objective of our study was to characterize the specific cleavage sites of CK on type II collagen. Our long term goal is to develop antibodies specific to these sites to develop biomarkers to detect it’s cleavage, for the early diagnosis of OA. Thus, in order to achieve our first goal, Cathepsin K cleavage of equine type II collagen was first examined by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. Molecular characterization of proteolytic fragments, and therefore cleavage sites, was performed using tryptic digestion followed by LC-ESI/MS analysis to establish a comprehensive peptide map which was used as a template to identify specific proteolytic cleavage by cathepsin K. Comprehensive peptide mapping provided information on post-translational modifications and permitted the identification of 48 proline (P) and 5 lysine (K) residues that were subject to post translational modification. Six major fragments were observed on 1D SDS-PAGE and confirmed by HPLC-ESI/MS including F1 [189-190], F2 [252-253], F3 [326-327], F4 [428-429], F5 [563-564] and F6 [824-825]. The observed F1 fragment showed that cleavage was three residues N-terminal to the site reported previously for bovine type II collagen. These new findings will be used to develop new analytical methods to quantify biomarkers associate to equine type II collagen degradation in osteoarthritis patient and/or to support the development of new treatments.

1013	Ethnobotanique de la Nation crie d'Eeyou Istchee et variation géographique des plantes médicinales antidiabétiques	Type 2 diabetes has reached epidemic proportions among Canada’s aboriginal populations and affects on average 29% of adult Cree of Eeyou Istchee (CEI). In collaboration with the Cree Board of Health and Social Services of James Bay and the CIHR team in Traditional Antidiabetic Aboriginal Medicines, interviews were held in the CEI communities of Wemindji and Oujé-Bougoumou to identify potential antidiabetic plants. Using a quantitative approach, species mentioned were ranked and compared to the pharmacopoeia of other participating communities. Sixteen and 25 plants were mentioned in Wemindji and Oujé-Bougoumou respectively. Seven new plant and one fungal species were added to the list of potential antidiabetic species, although most of those mentioned were common to the general CEI pharmacopoeia, thus supporting the cultural importance that they hold. Phytochemical analyses of two of these species, Rhododendron groenlandicum and Sarracenia purpurea, were made from accessions harvested throughout Eeyou Istchee. While no pattern was detected in the variation of S. purpurea’s biologically active compounds, phenolic compounds from R. groenlandicum, specifically (+)-catchin, (-)-epicatechin and quercetin-3-galactoside, varied spatially as a function of insolation parameters such as solar radiation or photoperiod. Samples from the latter, tested in vitro in the 3T3-L1 murine adipocytes adipogenesis bioassay, increased the intracellular accumulation of triglycerides, thus conferring it a glitazone-like antidiabetic activity. This activity, however, was weaker in accessions with high quercetin content, which could have an impact on the quality of a natural health product made from this species.

1014	L'hospitalisation de la femme en raison d'une grossesse à risque élevé : l'expérience de couples	Planning to have a child is most of the time a joyful event for a couple. However, the same event might becomes a real nightmare when the woman is hospitalized because of an at high risk pregnancy. To date, researches exploring this abrupt event have suggested that it may conduct to numerous impacts on future parents. Even though, the subject has only been explored using a maternal or paternal perspective, without considering the systemic aspect of the situation. This qualitative multiple case study suggests to explore the couples’ experience regarding the hospitalization of the woman because of an at high risk pregnancy, in a systemic and constructivist approach. Semi-directed interviews have been conducted with seven couples with a woman hospitalized because of an at high risk pregnancy, at the moment of the interview. Qualitative data analysis was inspired of thematization and took into account the theoretical and epistemological approach, respectively the Wright and Leahey (2013) family approach and constructivism. Results suggest the hospitalization is touched by intense emotions, such as feeling almost all the time worries, uncertainties and loneliness. It is however interesting to note that even the couple himself is touched by changes resulting of the hospitalization. According to that, this event requires a huge reorganization, which implies loads of systems gravitating around the couple’s system. Lastly, in order to face the intensity and the unpredictability of the situation, couples are asking for external support, while using their own internal resources. Concerning the theoretical and epistemological approach chosen to realize this study, results confirm the necessity of adopting a systemic and contextual vision in order to develop nursing cares appropriate with couples’ experience. Besides, it becomes essential to duplicate this type of study to perfection the actual comprehension of the event. However, nursing interventions relating to the external reorganization and the couple relation reorganization are proposed, in order to reinforce nurses’ consideration of the couple’s experience. Only then, it is suggested that nurses can influence couples’ capacity to face the consequences of the antenatal hospitalization.

1015	Extraction automatique et visualisation des thèmes abordés dans des résumés de mémoires et de thèses en anthropologie au Québec, de 1985 à 2009	Taking advantage of the recent development of automated analysis of textual data, digital records of documents, data graphics and anthropology, this study was set forth using data mining techniques to create a thematic map of anthropological documents. In this exploratory research, we propose to evaluate the usefulness of thematic analysis by using automated classification of textual data, as well as information visualizations (based on network analysis). More precisely, we want to examine the method of hierarchical clustering (HCA, agglomerative) for thematic analysis and information extraction. We built our study from a database consisting of 1 240 thesis abstracts, granted from 1985 to 2009, by anthropological departments at the University of Montreal and University Laval, as well as historical department at University Laval (for archaeological and ethnological abstracts). In the first section, we present our theoretical framework; we expose definitions of text mining, its origins, the practical applications and the methodology, and in the end, we present a literature review. The second part is devoted to the methodological framework and we discuss the various stages through which the project was conducted; construction of database, linguistic and statistical filtering, automated classification, etc. Finally, in the last section, we display results of two specific experiments and we present our interpretations. We also discuss about thematic navigation and conceptual approaches. We conclude with the limitations we faced through this project and paths of interest for future research.

1016	Développement d'antennes RF pour l'imagerie du rat en résonance magnétique	This master thesis focuses on the design and development of two RF coils used in magnetic resonance imaging. These coils are designed to guide the future development of a multi-animal imaging platform that will serve researchers of the new CRCHUM. More specifically, these coils were designed for proton imaging at 1.5T. The first uses a lowpass birdcage as transmitter and uses 8 surface elements for the receiving part. The second coil is a circularly polarized lowpass birdcage which is used both for transmission and for reception. The latter presented good performances, generating images with high SNR and good homogeneity, making it a good candidate for the future platform. The first one presented a few problems at the detuning of the birdcage and the coupling between the elements. In the case where these problems would be overcome, this coil would have the advantage of being able to use parallel imaging techniques and possibly to have a higher SNR.

1017	Probabilité et temps de fixation à l’aide de processus ancestraux	The expected time for fixation given its occurrence, and the probability of fixa- tion of a new mutant allele in populations subject to various biological phe- nomena are analyzed using the approach of the ancestral process. First, the paper of Tajima (1990) is analyzed, and the missing or incomplete proofs are fully worked out in this Master thesis in order to familiarize ourselves with calculations of fixation times. Our study of Tajima’s paper helps to show the importance of the fixation time in some biological phenomena. Thereafter, we extend the work of Tajima (1990) by introducing the effect of natural selec- tion in the model. Using a diffusion approximation, the work of Mano (2009) provides an interesting result about the expected time of fixation given its oc- currence. We derived an alternative method that uses an ancestral process that approximates well Mani’s result. Simulations are made to verify the accuracy ofthenewapproach.Finally,onemodelsubjecttogeneconversionisanalyzed, since this phenomenon, in the presence of bias, has a similar effect as selection. We deduce an analytical result for the probability of fixation of a new mutant in the population. Finally, simulations are made to determine the probability of fixation and the time of fixation given its occurrence when rates are too large to be calculated analytically.

1018	Of master Hongyi's last calligraphic work	Hongyi (1860-1942) is a Master of Pure Land Buddhism in modern China. In the history of Chinese Buddhism, he is the only Buddhist Master who can rank among the greatest Chinese calligraphers. In the history of Chinese calligraphy, he is the first monk calligrapher who combines his Buddhist faith with his calligraphic art, and applies Western painting principles in his work of calligraphy. His calligraphic art well serves his religious belief, not independent from the latter as it is in most cases in the history. He uses the Buddhist concept of “a form without form” to interpret Chinese calligraphy, and puts forward a series of Buddhist calligraphic theories to guide his practice. Moreover, his calligraphy serves only to transcribe classical and contemporary Buddhist texts. In this sense, his calligraphic work exemplifies the influence of Chinese Buddhism on Chinese calligraphy. Traditionally, the last work of a calligrapher is often considered as his masterpiece according to two standards: its technique and its moral content. Furthermore, few of the last works by great calligraphers have survived. Scarcity makes these works even more valuable. Bei xin jiao ji (“悲欣交集”) is Hongyi’s last calligraphic work, which was completed three days before his nirvana. This thesis will study and analyze the influence of Hongyi’s Buddhist thought on the literary content and artistic form of this work and expounds that his last work fully displays the ultimate state of his Buddhist practice and the highest level of his calligraphy.

1019	Nanoformulations de nystatine pour une efficacité antifongique améliorée	Hypothesis : Nanomilling of a nystatin suspension will increase its antifungal efficacy in vitro and in vivo. Methods: A nystatin nanosuspension was obtained using wet bead milling. It was characterized for its particle size distribution and for its drug content. In vitro activity was evaluted against C. albicans strains SC5314 and LAM-1 at concentrations of 12.5 μg/mL up to 5000 μg/mL. The in vivo efficacy was evaluated using a murine model of oropharyngeal candidiasis. Results: Median particle size of the nystatin nanosuspension was reduced from 6577 nm to 137 nm. HPLC analysis demonstrated a content assay of 98.7 ± 0.8%. In vitro activity of the nanosuspension was superior to the suspension’s at concentrations ranging from 100 μg/mL to 5000 μg/mL. Oral fungal burdens were inferor in the nanosuspension group compared to the suspension and saline groups. Mice survival was also superior in the nanosuspension group.

1020	JSreal : un réalisateur de texte pour la programmation web	Natural language generation, a part of artificial intelligence, studies the development of systems that produce text for different applications, for example the textual description of massive datasets or the automation of routine text redaction. Text generation projects consist of multiple steps : determining the content to be expressed, organising it in logical structures such as sentences and paragraphs, and producing human-readable character strings, a step usually called realisation, which this thesis takes on.  The web is constantly growing and its contents, getting progressively more dynamic, are well-suited to automation by a realiser. However, existing realisers are not designed with the web in mind and their operation requires much knowledge, complicating their use.  This master’s thesis presents JSreal, a realiser designed specifically for the web and easy to learn and use. JSreal allows its user to build a variety of French expressions and sentences, to add HTML tags to them and to easily integrate them into web pages.

1021	Le lien entre les perceptions des élèves sur la relation élève-enseignant et les problèmes de comportement extériorisés	Appling pedagogical methods and transmitting programmed material is not sufficient to define the complexity of teaching. The pedagogical relationship built by the teacher with his or her students is another important and necessary component. This relationship is considered optimal when it has a high level of warmth and a low level of conflicts. Previous studies demonstrate significant links between the quality of this relationship and different indicators of school-adaptations. In general, the reports reveal that a warm student-teacher relationship has a positive impact on student behaviour, academic success as well as feelings and attitudes toward school. Furthermore, the quality of student-teacher relationship has an even greater effect on students considered at risk. This student category is characterised by the presence of vulnerability factors such as poverty (social factors), difficult parent-child relationship (family factors) or a lack of social skills (individual factors). Majority of research done on student-teacher relationship does not specify which aspects in particular have a significant influence on its overall quality. In order to address this issue, two goals are aimed by the present study: 1) examine the relationship between perceptions of high school students considered at risk for various aspects of the quality of the student-teacher relationship and externalizing behavior problems; 2) verification if this link evolves over time. In our work, the type of student-teacher relationship is categorized by two dimensions: the warmth and the conflicts (Pianta, 1992). The classification according to the positive or negative pole of each dimension enables to distinguish between four types of relations the student is prone to establish with his or her teachers: either warm, controversial, negligent or conflict. A random sample of the data collected in 2002-2008 during the evaluation of intervention strategy Agir Autrement (Act Differently) (SIAA) is used in the present longitudinal study. It is composed of 563 high school students: 273 girls and 290 boys. V Secondary analyses are made on the data collected on the same students during their first and fifth year. This approach gives the opportunity to observe the changes in student behaviour as function of student-teacher relationship quality. In general, our results show a high complexity of links between different types of student-teacher relationship and the exteriorized behaviour problems. More specifically, we conclude that a warm type relation is less likely to be associated with exteriorized behaviour problems of students at risk, and that as much in 1st year of high school as in the 5th. According to our results, conflict and controversial relationship types are significantly linked to exteriorized behaviour problems of students at risk in the 1st and the 5th year of high school. In the case of the negligent relationship, the results demonstrate the existence of a correlation between this bond type and exteriorized behaviour problems. However, the strength of this correlation is higher for the students at risk in the 5th year of high school as compared to the same students when they were in their 1st year. Finally, when all the results are taken together, they reveal the relative stability of the relationship type over time and on the other hand, a significant increase in the frequency of problematic behaviour such as serious stealing and psychotropic consumption. Furthermore, the obtained results show the existence of a link between the conflict dimension of the student-teacher relationship and the psychotropic consumption of students accounted by our sample. The present study demonstrates that since conflicts act as risk factors capable of increasing the frequency of exteriorized behaviour problems of high school students considered at risk, the conflict dimension is equally important in the student-teacher relationship as the warmth dimension. A relationship between students and their teachers with a reduced level of conflicts can play an important role in the prevention of this type of problems experienced by high school students.	relations interpersonnelles , attachement , student-teacher relationship , student-teacher relationship quality , interpersonal relations , attachment , student at risk , exteriorized behaviour problems	en	10397.0
1022	Étude de la dynamique des interactions des constituants du complexe de biosynthèse et d’insertion de la sélénocystéine dans la traduction des sélénoprotéines in vivo	"Selenoproteins are proteins that incorporate selenocysteines, which is called the 21st amino acid, during their translation. Specifically, selenocysteine (Sec) is a metabolic derivate of serine, which is structurally equivalent to Cys except for replacement of sulfur with an atom of selenium in the δ-position. It differs from other amino acids since a unique synthetase converts the serine into Sec while the residue is already attached to the tRNA. The codon for Sec on the mRNA is a UGA codon that is usually a STOP signal, introducing the concept of ""recoding"". Through a specific metabolic machinery for the tRNASec and the presence of a SecIS (Selenocysteine Insertion Sequence) on the mRNA, this codon allows the incorporation of the Sec into the protein. However, the mechanism of biosynthesis of this amino acid and its incorporation into proteins is not well understood. It is known that the synthesis starts with the acetylation of tRNA[Ser]Sec by seryl-tRNA synthetase (SerRS) to give the seryl-tRNA[Ser]Sec. The latter is subsequently phosphorylated by the O-phosphoseryl-tRNA[Ser]Sec kinase (PSTK) which will generate the O-phosphoseryl-tRNA[Ser]Sec. Subsequently, a large complex of several proteins and cofactors acting as machinery for incorporation of Sec during translation, associates with tRNA[Ser]Sec and the mRNA and finally, the components of the ribosome. Among these proteins, SepSecS catalyzes the final step in the biosynthesis of Sec converting O-phosphoseryl-tRNA[Ser]Sec into selenocysteinyl-tRNA[Ser]Sec using monoselenophosphate as a source of selenium. Recent studies showed that the association with SECp43 would be required for SepSecS to play its role to segregate into the nucleus to be associated with the machinery that recognizes the UGA codon. Among the proteins of the biosynthesis machinery of selenoproteins that we analyzed, there are eEFSec, RPL30, SPS2, SPS1, SBP2 and NSEP1. Results of analysis of the dynamics of the interaction between the components of the Sec biosynthetic machinery confirm some data from the literature, but conflict with the model so far established. A better understanding of the dynamics of interactions between its constituents and the reaction of this process would allow us to make assumptions about the role of the biosynthetic machinery of selenoproteins and the importance of its complexity. We analyzed the dynamics of interaction in vivo in HEK293T cells using a Protein-Fragment Complementation Assay (PCA) based on a humanized Renilla luciferase (hRLuc) by coupling, by molecular cloning, genes encoding each protein of interest with gene encoding fragments of the luciferase protein (hRluc). We have thus achieved an expression of fusion of N-terminal and C-terminal fragments for each luciferase protein of interest. Then, we analyzed the dynamics of the interaction with the components of the Sec biosynthetic machinery. Further work will be essential to build on the results presented in this research."	eEFSec , NSEP1 , PCA , SBP2 , SECp43 , SepSecS , SLA/LP , Protein fragment complementation assay , RPL30 , SPS1 , SPS2	en	10386.0
1023	La chose en soi comme concept «critique» : le problème de la limitation de la connaissance dans la Critique de la raison pure de Kant	In the following thesis, we will claim that Kant’s concept of a thing-in-itself is both a metaphysical and a critical concept. Accordingly, the thing-in-itself must be understood as a real transcendental object that grounds phenomena. Thus, we maintain – contrary to F.H. Jacobi’s (1787) and G.E. Schulze’s (1791) harsh objections – that this assertion does not violate the structures of critical philosophy. Indeed, this particular claim is arrived at through analogical cognition, which does not transgress the boundaries of human knowledge: as a matter of fact, analogical cognition allows us to point towards and assert the existence (Dasein) of something the nature (Beschaffenheit) of which may remain problematic. Thus, we believe that Kant’s metaphysical commitment with regard to the existence of the thing-in-itself as ground of phenomena can be fully justified within the Critique of Pure Reason.

1024	Une culture du pluralisme religieux chez les jeunes au Collège Saint-Viateur de Ouagadougou comme prophylaxie contre l’intégrisme religieux au Burkina Faso	Saint-Viator College at Ouagadougou in Burkina Faso (West Africa) is a Catholic school, the mission of which is to evangelize the youth that attend it, while assuring them a Christian education of quality.  Besides the Catholics, many of the students are Muslims, Protestants or Animists. There is therefore a religious diversity among the educational community.  Since this situation has been accepted and recognized as such, we may very well speak of religious pluralism. In such a context, one must really wonder if it is always pertinent to want to evangelize the young Catholics as well as the students belonging to the other religions, or must we simply educate them to become better human beings in their own religion.  This question leads us to an adventure of five chapters corresponding to the five stages of pastoral praxeology.  The first chapter depicts the educational community of Saint-Viator College, in the pluralistic context of Burkina Faso, and demonstrates the strengths and weaknesses of the manner by which religious diversity is managed. The second chapter poses the problem of the relevance of the evangelization of youth of different religions, by ensuring their Christian education. The third chapter illustrates a hermeneutic of the act of evangelizing youth, taking into account the positive theological perspective of religious pluralism, in relation to the Church’s magisterium regarding Christian education of youth. The fourth chapter puts forth four proposals so that the evangelization of youth, in this context of religious pluralism, may take on the meaning of an integral education that draws the youth to becoming better human beings in their own faith. Finally, the fifth chapter expresses the hopes and beneficial effects of a culture of religious pluralism among the youth at Saint-Viator College of Ouagadougou. This culture would constitute simultaneously an evangelical prophylaxis against religious fundamentalism/integrism within the educational community and within the society of Burkina Faso.

1025	À la cheville des temps : la construction du présent dans la littérature narrative française au tournant du XXIe siècle	This doctoral thesis highlights present-day French authors’ narrative strategies used to illustrate and conceive the present. Our central hypothesis is that through an act of utterance intermeshing discourse and narration, as well as the critical and pragmatic use of references to the past, today’s narrative literature offers a counterpoint to the “presentism” described by François Hartog (i.e. a retrospective look at eras in which the present is both the vantage point and the point under observation). By so doing, contemporary authors offer a system of historicities where the past and the future are linked to the present in order to reconcile the link between the three temporal categories and reveal a present which, otherwise, would remain narratively elusive or subrogated to the authority of a past or a future that dictates its behaviour.  By distancing their works from the fictional genre and from the narrative form it embodies, Pierre Bergounioux, François Bon, Olivier Cadiot, Annie Ernaux, Chloé Delaume, Jean Echenoz and Olivier Rolin, amongst others, are part of the enunciative tradition of the narrative, considered here as a literary genre in which the enunciation and the text in gestation are, in and of themselves, their own intrigue. In the contemporary narrative, the aim of the enunciation subject is to clarify its relationship to time by using enunciative scenes having to do with this quest and the conversation so that from a personal and intellectual anamnesis, as well as from the clash of a memory with its recounting, emerge the characteristics integral to the present experience. And yet, one of the characteristics of the present that the contemporary subject experiences seems to be a resistance to narration and to storytelling, which makes it almost impervious to literary analysis. Authors take up this opposition to storytelling by using, in an effort to bring the immediacy of the present to the foreground, the note, the journal entry, and literary genres that thwart narration, such as poetry. In spite of their enunciative efforts to distil the present from the operation that transforms it into the past, these authors are nevertheless faced, time and again, with having to live the immediate dissipation of the present and their inability to capture in a literary form its essence. Perhaps the only way to offer a glimpse of this is to try to create the present by repeatedly showing the impossibility of such an achievement.

1026	Figures of Time : Preemptive Narratives in Recent Television Series	This thesis examines complex narrative temporalities in the recent television series Life on Mars (BBC, 2006-2007), Flashforward (ABC, 2009-2010), and Damages (FX/Audience Network, 2007-2012). The general argument proposes that the renewed technics of television have enabled innovative aesthetic standards and temporal experiences in serial TV fiction. It is subsequently shown that these new aesthetic and experiential qualities of TV fiction are correlative to an increased political and ethical relevance of time. This overall argument is laid out in four major steps. The project first addresses the technics of recent television to show how new technologies have enabled new techniques of experiencing television. Drawing on the philosophy of Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari as well as the media theories of Matthew Fuller, Thomas Lamarre, and Jussi Parikka, the complex and productive linkages between technology and techniques will be theorized as an abstract machine which I call the serial machine. The argument then draws on theories of perception and nonrepresentational approaches to art in order to analyze the new qualities of aesthetic experience in serial TV fiction. For this purpose, I develop the central concept of the figure of time understood as the directly felt abstract shape effectuated by a narrative’s movement through time.  It will be seen, in a third step, that the figural movements discussed in this thesis concern questions of future-orientation and preemption. All of the narratives in this project anticipate their own ending and take form with respect to this foretold future. They are therefore conceptualized as “preemptive narratives,” in which the future poses an affective rather than epistemological problem. I will show that, in the serial narratives under discussion, the preemptive loop through the future is immediately ontogenetic in that it creates a reality in the present by inducing uncertainty and fear of the future. Finally, the thesis proposes that such affective politics are an element of what Gilles Deleuze calls control societies, in which conditions of life are constantly modulated. Following his writings on control societies and Spinoza’s Ethics, it is argued that the requirements of such a modulatory environment are ethical in nature (rather than moral). Drawing on the work by artists-philosophers Madeline Gins and Arakawa, I elaborate the techniques of attention which sustain an ethics for surviving the control society in the TV series Damages.	television series , temporal complexity , aesthetic experience of time , preemptive narratives , figures of time , ethics of attention	en	10347.0
1027	Étude de la négativité de discordance dans l'amusie congénitale	Congenital amusia is a neurodevelopmental disorder which is characterized by a deficit in fine-grained pitch discrimination. In fact, the amusic brain does not respond to small pitch changes, such as reflected by the absence of the event-related (ERP) component P3b, which is associated to late and conscious pitch discrimination processes. Until now, very few studies focused on early preconscious levels of processing in amusia, which can be studied through an ERP component called the mismatch negativity (MMN). Some studies have demonstrated that the MMN can be recorded while playing the soundtrack of a movie in concurrence with the MMN-critical tones. However, one study demonstrated that playing the movie soundtrack reduced MMN amplitude, but did not investigate the origin of this effect.  The main goals of this project are, first, to investigate the nature of the effect responsible for the MMN reduction observed when playing a movie soundtrack, and secondly, to evaluate the MMN in congenital amusia. The first study aimed to investigate if an attentionnal or acoustical interference effect could account for the reduction in MMN amplitude observed when playing the movie soundtrack. The results showed that an acoustical masking effect of the movie soundtrack was responsible for the reduction in MMN amplitude. In fact, MMN amplitude increased as the intensity level of the movie soundtrack decreased.  The goal of the second study was to investigate the MMN in congenital amusia, but also to explore if the abnormal N2b-P3b complex observed in amusics in a previous study could be accounted for by an effect of salience of the stimuli. Thus, we first compared the MMN results between amusics and controls, and then, we modified the experimental paradigm meant to evoke the N2b-P3b by adjusting the probabilities of occurrence of the sounds presented to the controls as a function of the sounds perceived by their matched amusics. The results showed that the amusic brain can detect all pitch changes at an early and preconscious level of processing, such as demonstrated by a normal MMN in both groups. Furthermore, our results showed that the amusic brain does not respond normally solely to small pitch changes at a later conscious level of processing, such as revealed by the absence of the P3b, thus showing that the abnormal N2b-P3b complex of ERP components observed in a previous study is better explained by a saliency effect of the stimuli and does not represent an electrophysiological anomaly specific to congenital amusia.  In conclusion, our results have first shown that MMN amplitude is decreased by presenting a movie soundtrack and this is due to a masking effect at the acoustical level of the soundtrack over the MMN-critical tones. Finally, our second study showed that the early preconscious mechanisms of pitch discrimination are preserved in congenital amusia, and that the pitch deficit underlying congenital amusia is limited to an anomaly in the late and conscious processing of small pitch changes, the abnormal N2b-P3b complex being rather explained by an effect of salience of the stimuli.

1028	Génération de résumés par abstraction	This Ph.D. thesis is the result of several years of research on automatic text summarization. Three major contributions are presented in the form of published and submitted papers. They follow a path that moves away from extractive summarization and toward abstractive summarization.  The first article describes the HexTac experiment, which was conducted to evaluate the performance of humans summarizing text by extracting sentences. Results show a wide gap of performance between human summaries written by sentence extraction and those written without restriction. This empirical performance ceiling to sentence extraction demonstrates the need for new approaches to text summarization.  We then developed and implemented a system, which is the subject of the second article, using the Fully Abstractive Summarization approach. Though the name suggests otherwise, this approach is better categorized as semi-extractive, along with sentence compression and sentence fusion. Building and evaluating this system brought to light the great challenge associated with generating easily readable summaries without extracting sentences. In this approach, text understanding is not deep enough to provide help in the content selection process, as is the case in extractive summarization.  As the third contribution, a knowledge-based approach to abstractive summarization called K-BABS was proposed. Relevant content is identified by pattern matching on an analysis of the source text, and rules are applied to directly generate sentences for the summary. This approach is implemented in a system called ABSUM, which generates very short and content-rich summaries. An evaluation was performed according to today's standards. The evaluation shows that hybrid summaries generated by adding extracted sentences to ABSUM's output have significantly more content than a state-of-the-art extractive summarizer.

1029	Étude structure/fonction des cotransporteurs Na+/glucose	This thesis is about the structure/function relationship in Na+/glucose cotransporters (SGLTs). SGLTs are membrane proteins which use the Na+ transmembrane electrochemical gradient to accumulate their substrates within the cell. As an introduction, a short review of the current state of the field will be followed by a presentation of the different technics used in this work. This work can be divided in three main projects. In the first project, we investigated the structural basis of water permeation through SGLTs. By using molecular modeling technics, we have identified, in silico, a passive permeation pathway used by water to go through the cotransporter across the membrane. Using voltage-clamp volumetric measurement, we were able to corroborate these findings for hSGLT1 expressed in oocytes. A second project allowed elucidation of some of hSGLT1 structural characteristics through the use of dipicrylamine (DPA), a fluorescence acceptor whose repartition in the lipid membrane is voltage-dependant. Use of DPA concomitantly with voltage-clamp fluorescence and FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer) has clearly demonstrated the extracellular localisation of part of the 12-13 loop which was previously assumed to be intracellular. In addition, we have shown that hSGLT1 forms a dimeric structure where the subunits are linked by a disulfide bridge. A last project aimed at characterizing the steady-state and pre-steadystate currents of a member of the SGLT family named hSMIT2 (human Na/myo-inositol transporter 2). We showed that phlorizin is a poor inhibitor of pre-steady state currents following depolarisation, and the presence of a time, membrane potential and substrate dependent leak current. A simulated annealing algorithm was developed in order to allow objective determination of both the connectivity and the parameters associated with the optimal kinetic model.

1030	Évaluation du processus : analyse de l’évaluabilité et de la mise en œuvre d’une stratégie d’amélioration de la couverture vaccinale au Burkina Faso	Immunization is one of the most important subjects in public health despite constant on-going controversies. In the context of this research it is more its accessibility that is at issue. This particular research is situated in the perspective of the comprehensive approaches to evaluation and analyses an immunization improvement strategy using a three steps process evaluation after documenting its context. The perceptions and factors influencing immunization coverage before the intervention are assessed, as well as the conceptual and theoretical foundations of the intervention, the implementation and reception of the intervention and mechanisms used to attain the results.  The results indicate that immunization is integrated into the local strategies used for protection and grounded in the local concept of risk. Results show also that the context associated with socioeconomic factors and the relations between parents and health services contribute to explain the relatively low complete immunization coverage rate (50.3%) before the intervention. The exploratory analysis indicates that the intervention had an implicit theory and a philosophy. Although the intervention was adequate for an evaluation, discrepancies in the implantation compromised the possibilities of validating its initial theory and philosophy. The descriptive analysis showed that more than 95% of the recipients were reached by the intervention and the received dose of intervention was acceptable indicating that the intervention is a workable strategy that needs to be improved. The complete immunization coverage after the intervention was 87.3%; it was influenced positively by factors including parents’ level of knowledge and the fact that the child was born in a health center, and negatively by the long distances from household to immunization place. The strategies involved in the attainment of the results used parents’ knowledge improvement as a principal procedure. This contains an underlying mechanism mainly related to the perception of the opportunities that immunization permits for preventing various health, social and economic risks. However, complementary approaches tend to maximize intervention outcome by using the power given to female community immunization facilitators and social coercion. The research contributes to highlight the relationship between evaluability assessment and process evaluation, to propose a new conceptual and operational understanding of dose of intervention administered and dose of intervention received. On practical grounds, this research recommended the improvement of the immunization activities staff profile and the widespread adoption of the strategy after it improvement. Indications are provided to improve the intervention and to inform founding agencies.

1031	Les effets des pratiques de leadership sur la performance de l’équipe : rôle médiateur de l’engagement des membres envers les objectifs d’équipe	The purpose of this research is to study the effect that leadership practices can have on team performance. We decided to concentrate this study on two types of leadership practices that are distinct: empowerment leadership and autocratic leadership. This research also tends to explain the mediating role of team goal commitment in the relation between leadership practices and team performance. Furthermore, we examine the harmonization of both leadership practices present among a team leader to notice if the adoption of one type of leadership would diminish or amplify the impact of the other leadership type.   Secondary data were collected in a public safety organization located in Canada. Overall, 381 members of 101 teams and their corresponding 101 immediate superiors were questioned through a questionnaire survey. Confirmatory factor analyses and a series of hierarchical multiple regression analyses were conducted to verify our eight hypothesis.   The results showed that leadership practices have a moderate and significant effect on team performance. Leadership practices are also strongly and significantly related to team goal commitment. Otherwise, the results points out the mediating role of team goal commitment. In fact, the mediating role of team goal commitment was complete between leadership practices and team performance. Contrariwise, the interaction effect between leadership practices turned out to be not significant. The verification of the mediating role of team goal commitment represents a theoretical implication within the comprehension of team work. Likewise, on the practical side results showed that team leaders had better to adopt managing practices that can allow the team to reach the team objectives while improving the members’ sense of commitment and the team performance.

1032	Nom propre et roman chez Suzanne Jacob	This thesis focuses on the use of names in four novels written by Quebec's author Suzanne Jacob : Laura Laur (1983), La Passion selon Galatée (1987), Rouge, mère et fils (2001) and Fugueuses (2005).   Suzanne Jacob thinks that reality is made from conventions. Based on this idea, this thesis confronts the hypothesis that names are fictitious. Using narratological and pragmatical methodologies, this analysis, made of microtext readings, focuses on the characters' and narrators' comments on names, in addition to identifying processes that highlight names functionality on a semantic and syntactic point of view. This means that names will be addressed based on the network of the text’s different signs, and will not be considered as an isolated signifier.  The study is divided in three chapters dedicated to structural problems about names in Jacob's novels : « The ubiquity of the name », « The instability of the name » and « The name performed ? » From these three axes, the reflection opens to broader issues concerning identity as well as social and familial relationships.

1033	Comparison of epicardial mapping and noncontact endocardial mapping in dog experiments and computer simulations	Atrial fibrillation is the most common clinical arrhythmia currently affecting 2.3 million patients in North America. To study its mechanisms and potential therapies, animal models of atrial fibrillation have been developed. Epicardial high-density electrical mapping is a well-established experimental instrument to monitor in vivo the activity of the atria in response to pacing, remodeling, arrhythmias and modulation of the autonomic nervous system. In regions that are not accessible by epicardial mapping, noncontact endocardial mapping performed through a balloon catheter may provide a more comprehensive description of atrial activity.   In this study, a dog experiment was designed and analyzed in which electroanatomical reconstruction, epicardial mapping (103 electrodes), noncontact endocardial mapping (2048 virtual electrodes computed from a 64-channel balloon catheter), and direct-contact endocardial catheter recordings were simultaneously performed. The recording system was also simulated in a computer model of the canine right atrium.  For simulations and experiments (after atrio-ventricular node suppression), activation maps were computed during sinus rhythm. Repolarization was assessed by measuring the area under the atrial T wave (ATa), a marker of repolarization gradients. Results showed an epicardial endocardial correlation coefficient of 0.8 (experiment) and 0.96 (simulation) between activation times, and a correlation coefficient of 0.57 (experiment) and 0.92 (simulation) between ATa values.   Noncontact mapping appears to be a valuable experimental device to retrieve information outside the regions covered by epicardial recording plaques.

1034	Élaboration d’un modèle théorique pour étudier le rapport au savoir en didactique de l’histoire et en éducation à la citoyenneté	This thesis explores the relation to historical knowledge of high school students from the province of Quebec. More precisely, we will discuss the relations between student’s conception of history and of the work of historians, student’s conception of human action in history and student’s feeling of their own capacity to effectively participate in the democratic process. The context of this study is the introduction of the recent history and citizenship curriculum in Quebec’s high school that set new objectives in terms of citizenship education: students must now understand the role of human action in history in order to become conscious of their own value as participatory citizens.  In this regard, researches show that teachers are resisting this new direction and that they perpetuate a way of teaching in which historical narratives and men of influences are predominants (Bouhon, 2009 ; Moisan, 2011). Furthermore, the textbooks they are using give little importance to ¨ordinary¨ individuals and groups of individuals whose actions were politically effective (Éthier, 2001 ; Lefrançois, Éthier et Demers, 2011). Researches also show that students have the tendancy to explain historical change by attributing to single exceptionnal individuals the responsability for this change (Hallden, 1986 ; Carretero, Jacott, Limon, Lopez-Manjon et Leon, 1994 ; Carretero, Asuncion et Jacott, 1997 ; Tutiaux-Guillon et Fourmond, 1998). This situation brings to light the distorsion existing between the prescriptions of the new history and citizenship education curriculum and the reality of the classroom.  While exploring the complex consequences and imbrication of these differents statements, we came upon a sense of insatisfaction towards the concepts and notions that exist in didactic of history. In consequences, this thesis will transfer from sociology and anthropology to our field the notion of ¨relation to knowledge¨ (rapport à l’histoire). The theoretical model that is proposed has been obtained by applying Martineau, Simard and Gauthier (2001) and Van der Maren’s (1996) method of theoretical research.	rapport à l’histoire , relation to knowledge , relation to history , citizenship education	en	10231.0
1035	L’inhibition des cytochromes P450 dans les cas d’insuffisance rénale chronique : rôle de l’hormone parathyroïdienne	Chronic renal failure (CRF) is associated with a decrease in drug metabolism, due to a down-regulation of hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP450). Previous studies indicated that CRF modifies activity, protein and mRNA expression of different CYP450 isoforms in vivo and in vitro via circulating mediators and parathyroid hormone (PTH). This PhD project is divided in four parts. First, we have developed an assay in order to measure the CYP3A’s activity, using the production of 3-[(3,4-difluorobenzyl)oxy]-5,5-dimethyl-4-[4-methylsulfonyl)phenyl] furan-2(5H)-one (DFB). This method will be used in the next studies. Secondly, CYP450 activity and expression are decreased in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). It has been shown that dialyzable uremic toxins could be implicated in these decreases. Recent studies indicated that hemodialysis can prevent the inhibition of P450 although the mechanism remains to be defined. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of hemodialysis on P450 expression and activity using a rat hepatocytes culture model. Thirdly, calcidiol insufficiency is highly prevalent in CRF and the pathophysiology of this phenomenon is poorly understood. Recently, we have demonstrated that CRF is associated with a decrease in hepatic drug metabolism due to a reduction in liver CYP450, which is in part mediated by PTH. The formation of calcidiol, through hepatic 25-hydroxylation, is also mediated by several CYP450 isoforms (CYP2C11, 27A1, 2R1, 3A2 and 2J3) and could thus be altered in CRF. The objectives of the present study in rats presenting a CRF were a) to confirm the role of CRF on calcidiol levels and b) to evaluate the role of PTH in calcidiol apparent deficiency. Finally, in order to understand all the CYP450 inhibitions, we evaluated the mechanisms of action of CYP450. CRF and PTH cause an inhibition of CYP450 although the mechanisms remain to be defined. The aim of this study was to evaluate the contribution of different nuclear receptors or transcription factors like; pregnane X receptor (PXR), constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB). The results obtained show that the hemodialysis of CRF patients improves the CYP450’s expression in the cultured hepatocytes, with the serum from these patients. Also, the vitamin D 25-hydroxylation is affected by CRF. The activation of NF-κB and nuclear factors PXR and CAR are implicated in the CYP450’s inhibition.   In conclusion, CRF affects not only drug metabolism but also vitamin D hydroxylation, one of the endogenous roles performed by CYP450. This study will enable us to understand the effect of CRFon CYP450 regulation in order to improve the treatment of CRF patients.

1036	Sensibilité cérébrale à la lumière en fonction du vieillissement et d’aspects physiologiques fonctionnels de l’œil	Notwithstanding its effects on the classic visual system allowing image formation, light acts upon several «non-visual» functions including body temperature, hormonal secretions, sleep-wake cycle, alertness and cognitive performances. Results have shown that non-visual functions are maximally sensitive to blue wavelength (460-480nm), in comparison the longer light wavelengths (i.e. green: 550nm). Changes as to the sensitivity of these responses during the aging process were reported. In our research project, two groups of subjects, 16 young (18-30) and 14 older (55-70), followed a pupillometry protocol in order to measure the pupillary dynamic while being exposed to three different intensities of blue and green monochromatic lights. Results revealed more constrictions in blue than in green lights, and significant effects following the increase of light intensity. Our results also demonstrated a similar pupillary constriction between the two age groups, suggesting that this non-visual response remains intact with age. In the second phase, the same subjects executed cognitive tasks involving functional magnetic resonance imaging while maintained in darkness, or exposed to blue monochromatic lights. Results indicate a decrease of the impact of light with age namely, at the level of the thalamus, amygdala, insula and in the tegmental ventral area. These brain regions are involved in alertness, awakeness, attention and emotional processes. Consequently, the modifications which occur in the different non-visual responses during the aging process do not appear to be homogeneous. Our results are coherent with animal evidences which demonstrate different sensitivity thresholds to light and the presence of neuronal networks partially independent for various non-visual responses. In addition, they are the first indications of a decrease of the stimulating neuronal effects of light during the aging process. Future studies will help to verify whether the brain sensitivity reduction is linked to age-related behavioral differences. A better understanding of light effects on non-visual functions will permit an adapted light exposure in healthy aging and will also contribute to optimal lighting environment.

1037	Du rôle de l'interprète-chercheur en création et re-création musicale : théories, modèles et réalisations d'après les cas de Kathinkas Gesang (1983-1984) de Karlheinz Stockhausen et de La Machi (2007-2011) d'Analía Llugdar	This dissertation is based on a hybrid methodological approach belonging to research-creation in music and musicology applied to performance. It explores the following central question : “What roles are occupied by the performer-researcher in a context of musical creation or re-creation (or performance)” ? In response, the author examines and relates the creative and re-creative process for two significant works in her practice as a performer : Kathinkas Gesang als Luzifers Requiem (1983- 1984) by Karlheinz Stockhausen and La Machi, rituel pour flûtes, électronique et regards (2007-2011) by Analía Llugdar. The work on these mixed electroacoustic music pieces that both include a theatrical dimension and the staging of instrumental characters also leads her to consider issues of appropriation of the piece by a performer-researcher and their freedom when faced with pieces involving a high level of notational determinism. The first part lays out the discipline-based and theoretical contexts of the author’s research. Chapter 1 provides insight into how a performer’s research is carried out in music and situates the different ways in which this type of research is undertaken. Chapter 2 explains the notions of performance, improvisation and composition, and it positions the performer in relation to these three fields of activity. The author also compares creative approaches in theatre to those in music, while exploring different types of authenticity inherent in the interpretive process. Chapter 3 presents the principal angle of investigation and analysis adopted in this dissertation, that of instrumental timbre. The second part focusses on Kathinkas Gesang by Stockhausen. Chapter 4 presents a recapitulative chronology of the different major periods of the author’s performance. Chapter 5 presents and contextualizes the symbolism of the cycle Licht, die sieben Tage der Woche (1977-2003), from which Kathinkas Gesang is taken. Chapter 6 is devoted to the analysis of the symbolism attributed to the timbre of Licht’s main instruments. Chapter 7 evaluates the impact of the performer’s presence during the compositional process for Stockhausen, while exploring the question of casting in Licht. Chapter 8 is articulated around a lexicon of timbre presenting an exegesis of the playing techniques used in Kathinkas Gesang to produce various types of timbres. The third part focusses on La Machi by Analía Llugdar. In Chapter 9, the author presents the general structure of the piece and its synopsis, and she explores the role she played in the creative process of this piece. Chapter 10 takes the form of a lexicon of timbre presenting an exegesis of playing techniques used in the piece to produce various types of timbres. In the conclusion, three spheres of action and six archetypal roles of the performer-researcher in musical creation and re-creation are identified. Furthermore, answers to the issues of appropriation of the piece and the performer’s freedom are proposed. The author also suggests reflections for research-creation in music and she presents the main outcomes of the dissertation.	timbre , Stockhausen , Llugdar , research-creation , performance , instrumental theatre , mixed electroacoustic music , Licht , symbolism	en	10215.0
1038	Structural aspects of the ribosome evolution and function	In the year 2000, the first high-resolution structures of the individual ribosomal subunits became available to the public. The following year, the X-ray structure of the complete bacterial ribosome was published. These major achievements opened a new era in studying the mechanisms of protein synthesis. From then on, it became possible to attribute different aspects of the ribosome function to particular elements of its tertiary structure. However, establishing the structure-function relationships is problematic due to the immense complexity of the ribosome structure. In other words, in order to make the crystallographic data on the ribosome tertiary structure really useful for understanding of how the ribosome functions, it must be thoroughly analyzed. Here, based on systematic analysis of the available X-ray conformations of the ribosome we have tried to resolve two fundamental problems of the ribosome biology: concerning (1) the nature of rearrangements in the ribosome that take place at different steps of its functional cycle, and (2) the reconstruction of the ribosome evolution from the RNA world to present time. In the first project, we systematically compared the available structures of the ribosome and its subunits to identify rigid domains, which always have the same conformation, and flexible regions, where the conformation can vary from one ribosome structure to another. There were two known types of structural rearrangements whose mechanisms we wanted to understand: the ratchet-like motion and the so-called domain closure. The ratchet-like motion takes place during the ribosomal translocation and is roughly seen as a rotation of one subunit with respect to the other. The domain closure occurs in the small subunit and is associated with the cognate codon-anticodon recognition in the A-site. Comparison of the available ribosome conformations revealed the detailed mechanisms of both rearrangements. Although the selection of the cognate amino-acyl-tRNA in the A-site and of the ribosomal translocation have never been thought to have anything in common, we demonstrate that the rearrangements in the ribosome structure associated with the first process repeat in reverse order the rearrangements associated with the second process. In other words, during the ribosome elongation cycle, the domain closure and the ratchet-like motion can be seen as a back-and-forth movement, which eventually returns the ribosome to the initial conformation. iv In the second project, we attempted to reconstruct the evolution of the 23S rRNA from the RNA world to present time based on the presumption that the evolutionary expansion of this molecule proceeded though random insertions of relatively short regions into different regions of the polynucleotide chain. We developed criteria for integrity of the ribosome structure and presumed that during the evolutionary expansion, the ribosome structure always matched to these standards. For this, we specifically considered the A-minor interaction, a frequent arrangement in the rRNA structure consisting of a stack of unpaired adenosines tightly attached to a double helix. We presumed that in all A-minor interactions present in the ribosome, the double helix emerged before or at least simultaneously with the corresponding adenosine stack. The systematic application of this principle to the known tertiary structure of the 23S rRNA allowed us to elucidate in a step-vise manner the order in which different part of the modern 23S rRNA joined the structure. Taken together, the two projects demonstrate the effectiveness of the systematic in-silico analysis of the ribosome tertiary structure and pave the way for future discoveries.

1039	La réflexion phénoménologique au crible de la grammaire : la question de l’expression de la vie intérieure de la conscience chez Husserl et Wittgenstein	"Wittgenstein is typically thought to have put forth a devastating critique of one of the most constant temptations of modern philosophy: the so-called ""myth of interiority"". Against philosophies of reflexion, which attempt to clarify the meaning of obscure philosophical concepts (e.g. truth, significance, thought, etc.) by reflecting upon our mental states (Locke and James come to mind as examples of this paradigm), Wittgenstein showed that such a philosophical project is premised on a profound misunderstanding of how ordinary language and its grammar function. Although Wittgenstein might not have been the first to propose this kind of criticism, his central role in the last century's debates over the problem of interiority is due to the distinctive means through which he carried out this criticism: believing in the value of introspection within philosophical inquiry requires a profound misunderstanding of the nature and operation of the language through which we express our mental life. Since Husserl's phenomenology purports to solve philosophical problems through description and reflection upon lived experience, it is extremely tempting to see him as an inheritor of the philosophical tradition that Wittgenstein's arguments demolished. Taking as its starting point the assumption that the deconstruction of the ""myth of interiority"" instigated by Wittgenstein is well founded, this project will attempt to show that Wittgenstein's arguments can only appear to refute Husserl's conception of interiority on the basis of a superficial reading of the Logical Investigations and of the Ideas I. Indeed, upon a close examination of the relevant texts, Husserl's reflexions on the nature of language can be shown to lead him to a critique of the modern and empiricist conception of interiority very similar to Wittgenstein's, a critique that turns out to have the resources to avoid some of the major difficulties that the latter faces. This comparative and polemical study will defend two more general theses about the method that philosophical inquiry ought to rely upon. First, it will be argued that the reflexiveness required for philosophical discourse is illustrated in both Husserl and Wittgenstein's use of quotation marks. This seemingly trivial observation will support the claim that philosophical discourse relies on the use of a banal i typographical devise belonging to the grammar of ordinary language. Second, a case will be made for the the superiority of the ""genealogical"" method of Husserl's genetic phenomenology, for it manages to avoid the pitfalls of Wittgenstein's conventionalism while also steering clear of the problems incurred by the essentialism of the Ideas I static phenomenology."

1040	"Sectaire et ""inter-dit"" : introduction à la dimension du croire dans l'écoute du dire des personnes en cause dans le sectaire"	The thesis questions the conditions of listening concerning the testimonies of people who lived a sectarian experience, as well as the ethical and methodological issues arising from the way literature proposes to understand the telling of these people. A literature review shows that the main theoretical frameworks used to explain the sectarian (alienation, mental manipulation, addiction) determine the way the telling of these people is listened. Thereby, the meaning of the sectarian directs not only our understanding of people, but it also outlines the conditions of the listening. The premise of the dissertation is that the introduction of the « dit-mention » (the mension of the telling) of the believe as an interpretative intersection leads to develop a listening concerning both the speaking subject and the dimension of the being. From a theorization of believe as a movement of the living distinct from religion, spirituality, belief and mysticism, the dissertation moves the problematic of a sectarian experience from its polemic structure to give full value to the telling of people. Thus, by setting the listening on its symbolic side, that is in a way that takes into account the subject's relation to the Other, the meaning produced by an act of listening to a believe does not rely anymore on an external meaning to explain and report a sectarian experience. It is produced by the binding of the signifiers together, which opens a research space where something of the subject can happen. The hypothesis of a subject « à croire sur parole » (which words must be believed) then offers a basis for a differential act of listening, since it allows the working out of an effective knowledge, a knowledge that moves, surprises, revives the subject.

1041	L’évolution de la qualité d’emploi des immigrants du Canada par rapport aux natifs : une comparaison interprovinciale	It is well documented that immigrants face many difficulties in the Canadian labour market. Particularly, compared to native-born, they earn lower wages, occupy more precarious jobs and are often overqualified. In this research, we discuss these three issues in terms of job quality. Using the data from the 1991 to 2006 Canadian population censuses, we compare the trends in job quality of immigrants and native-born in Canada, Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia. These comparisons highlight the rising gap in job quality between immigrants and native-born in the four geographical areas, but especially in Quebec. This gap persists even after controlling human capital, demographic variables and unemployment rate at entry in the labour market.  Overall, we found that education, work experience and language skills improve the job quality of immigrants and their native-born counterparts. However, when we separate Canadian and foreign work experience, we find that the latter type of experience reduces job quality of immigrants. In these circumstances, it is counterproductive that Canada and Quebec continue to insist on this criterion in the point systems. We also suggest increasing the importance of age in the point systems in order to encourage the admission of younger candidates with little or no foreign experience. Youth, foreign students and temporary workers who already have work experience in Canada appear to be ideal candidates for immigration. Nevertheless, using Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition method, we show that the job quality gap between immigrants and natives is mainly due to unfavourable treatment of immigrants in the labour market. This means that immigrants are penalized in terms of job quality regardless of their characteristics. In this context, the selection of the best candidates for immigration may produce a limited effect. We therefore suggest acting downstream with public policy to support employment integration of immigrants. To do so, a better coordination between all actors in the labour market is required. Professional orders, government, employers and immigrants must establish accelerated pathways of skills recognition for newcomers. In addition, our results indicate that the treatment of immigrants in the labour market is more problematic in Quebec compared to Ontario and British Columbia. It is likely that Quebec society is less open to immigration given its francophone character and its minority status in North America. Since the beginning, the desire to protect the French language motivates Quebec to be actively involved in immigration and the Quebec point system already emphasizes this criterion. Moreover, nearly two-thirds of newcomers to Quebec speak French in 2011.

1042	Le Théâtre-forum : pour une délibération sous le signe de la reconnaissance?	Inspired by the democratic virtues of public deliberation but preoccupied with its blind spots, this research explores Forum Theatre as a deliberative medium to initiate discussion about the social tensions which underscore copresence between the homeless and other dwellers of public space in downtown Montreal. Indeed, we argue that in neighborhood forums social inequalities lead to deliberative ones for the homeless who lack epistemological authority due to their status, thereby reproducing the denial of recognition they endure as pariahs of public space. Forum Theatre stems from Theatre of the Oppressed which was initiated by Augusto Boal during the Brazil dictatorial regime as a revolutionary practice for the oppressed. It is premised on active audience engagement whose members are encouraged by the Joker to become Spect-Actors by replacing the protagonist in order to overcome his oppression. As such, can stepping inside the shoes of the homeless protagonist thru character replacement facilitate a passage from indignity to recognition for the latter? In other words, can a theatrical exchange create a space of intersubjectivity between the homeless and their domiciled neighbours? After all, the virtues of deliberation, not to mention the principles defended by recognition theorists like Honneth and Renault, both rest on intersubjectivity.

1043	Mise à l’essai et évaluation qualitative d’une intervention inspirée de la pédagogie narrative destinée aux infirmières soignant des personnes âgées en état confusionnel aigu	Older persons occupy a growing proportion of the beds in Quebec short-stay hospitals. Many of these persons present acute confusional state (ACS), or delirium, in the course of their hospitalization. The nursing care that they require is complex but studies show that continuing nursing education takes scant account of this reality. The approaches used in these studies have focused above all on the acquisition of knowledge and technical skills and have neglected the creative, relational, critical, reflexive and ethical aspects essential to delivering quality nursing care. In addition, these studies contain little information relative to the design of pedagogical interventions and their evaluation. Against this background, a study was undertaken aimed at field-testing and qualitatively evaluating the process and results of a pedagogical intervention for nurses who care for hospitalized older persons with ACS. The focus was more specifically on identifying the facilitating and constraining conditions to learning, the aspects most useful to practice, the different types of knowledge expressed, and the care outcomes perceived by participants. Inspiration for the design and evaluation of the intervention was drawn from the narrative pedagogy approach developed by Diekelmann (2001) and the various patterns of knowing knowledge defined by Chinn and Kramer (2008). The narrative pedagogy at the root of this intervention consists essentially of describing the lived care experiences of nurses and creating a learning environment conducive to group interpretation of these experiences based on theoretical and empirical data.  To achieve the objectives, a case study design was used. Purposive sampling allowed selecting participants working all three work shifts, possessing different levels of training, boasting nursing experience ranging from eight months to 36 years, varying in age from 23 to 64 years. The sample, composed of 15 nurses who worked on cardiac and orthopedic surgery units and who often cared for persons with ACS, was divided into three equal groups of five. The pedagogical intervention comprised four days of training offered at an interval of three weeks for a total duration of 12 weeks. On each of these days, participants had to complete a written reflexive exercise regarding a lived care situation involving a person with ACS and then, in the context of a group discussion, share, interpret and question these situations by drawing connections with available theoretical and empirical data on ACS. A triangulation of data collection methods, including the investigator’s field notes, the participants’ written reflexive exercises, questionnaires completed by the participants after each day of training, and individual interview with each participant carried out by an outside interviewer at the end of the intervention, allowed describing the field-testing of the intervention and qualitatively evaluating its process and results. The qualitative intra and inter-participant data was then subjected to content analysis.  Field-testing of the intervention highlighted the importance of taking account of the varied needs of the participants and to adjust the pedagogical intervention from one group to the next, particularly with respect to the theoretical and empirical content on ACS. Process evaluation underscored that the intervention was facilitated by the attitudes and the diversity of experiences of the participants, as well as by the use of real care situations, which allowed integrating theory in practice. Access to new tools for assessing persons with ACS was perceived to be particularly useful by the participants. As for the results evaluation, it allowed revealing various types of knowledge, including of the empirical, ethical and esthetic sort, but also some personal and emancipatory knowledge expressed by the participants. Moreover, the participants performed more in-depth assessments of persons with ACS, reduced or avoided the use of physical control measures on these persons, and involved families more in care. The evaluation also allowed documenting some of the effects perceived by the participants on the physical and psychological well-being of care recipients and their families. Persons with ACS were reassured, calmer and soothed, among other things, while families were less worried and more involved in care.  The study’s results evidence the applicability of a narrative pedagogy intervention based on a nursing frame of reference and its utility in continuing education in the field of care. The study opens up the possibility of transferring the intervention to other populations of nurses who tend to clienteles with complex needs, particularly in geriatric, oncological and palliative care. It is proposed that future studies evaluate the intervention on a larger sample and explore its effects on the persons cared for and their families.	narrative pedagogy , nursing knowledge , acute confusional state , delirium , nurses , older persons	en	10114.0
1044	No Laughing Matter: Shakespearean Melancholy and the Transformation of Comedy	My dissertation argues for a reconsideration of melancholy as an integral component of Shakespearean comedy. I analyse its presence across the comic canon, from early farcical plays through mature comic works, to the late romances that conclude Shakespeare’s career. In doing so, I denote its shift from an individual, humoural characterization to a more spectral incarnation that engrains itself in the dramatic fabric of the plays it inhabits. Ultimately, its manifestation purports to the cyclical nature of emotions and the mixture of mirth and sadness that the aforementioned late plays put forth. The thesis repositions Shakespearean melancholy away from humoural, psychoanalytical and other theoretical frameworks and towards an early modern context, where the term “melancholy” channels a plethora of social, scientific, and dramatic meanings. After a brief overview of the prevalence of melancholy in early modern England, the following chapters attest to the pervasiveness of melancholy within Shakespeare’s comic corpus, suggesting that, rather than a mere foil to the spirits of mirth and revelry, it proves elemental to comic structures as an agent of dramatic progression that fundamentally alters its generic make-up. I initially consider the ways in which melancholy is developed in The Comedy of Errors and Love’s Labor’s Lost, as an isolated condition, easily dismissible by what I refer to as the symmetrical structure of comic resolution. In both plays, I suggest, the failure to completely eradicate melancholy translates into highly ambiguous comic conclusions that pave the way for subsequent comic works, where melancholy’s presence grows increasingly cumbersome. Chapter three reads Much Ado about Nothing and The Merchant of Venice as prime dramatic examples of the phenomenon by which prominent comic characters not only fail to offer a clear cause for their overwhelming melancholy, but refuse to mitigate it for the benefit of the plays at hand. The melancholy found here creates emotional loose ends from which a sense of malaise that will take full effect in later comedies emanates.       In the next chapter, As You Like It and Twelfth Night are held as a landmark in Shakespeare’s treatment of comic melancholy. The chapter suggests that these plays complete the break from individual melancholic characterization, which no longer seem suitable to the comic style towards which Shakespeare progressively turns. Consequently, the final chapter undertakes an analysis of Pericles and The Winter’s Tale to demonstrate the fact that, in his concluding dramatic phase, Shakespeare returns to the comic taxonomies of melancholy in order to foster more forceful, lingering emotional impacts as a form of dramatic impressionism, a relinquishing of details in favour of more powerful emotional responses. In a brief coda, I read The Two Noble Kinsmen as the culmination of the dramatic treatment in melancholy in Shakespeare, where the spectral wistfulness that characterized the late plays reaches a breaking point. I suggest that the play bears witness to a passing of the torch, as it were, between the Shakespearean dramatization of melancholy and the one propounded by Fletcher, which was to become the norm within subsequent seventeenth-century tragicomic works.

1045	Physiopathologie des maladies métaboliques héréditaires des acyls-Coenzyme A révélée par l’étude d’un modèle animal déficient en 3-hydroxy-3-méthylglutaryl-Coenzyme A lyase	Most conditions detected by expanded newborn screening result from deficiency of one of the enzymes that degrade acyl-CoA esters in mitochondria. The role of acyl-CoAs in the pathophysiology of these disorders is poorly understood, in part because CoA esters are intracellular and samples are not generally available from human patients. We created a mouse model of one such condition, deficiency of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase (HL), in liver (HLLKO mice). HL catalyses a reaction of ketone body synthesis and of leucine degradation. Chronic HL deficiency and acute crises each produced distinct abnormal liver acyl-CoA patterns, which would not be predictable from levels of urine organic acids and plasma acylcarnitines. In HLLKO hepatocytes, ketogenesis was undetectable. Measures of Krebs cycle flux diminished following incubation of HLLKO mitochondria with the leucine metabolite 2-ketoisocaproate (KIC). HLLKO mice also had suppression of the normal hyperglycemic response to a systemic pyruvate load, a measure of gluconeogenesis. Hyperammonemia and hypoglycemia, cardinal features of many inborn errors of acyl-CoA metabolism, occurred spontaneously in some HLLKO mice and were inducible by administering KIC. KIC loading also increased levels of several leucine-related acyl-CoAs and reduced acetyl-CoA levels. Ultrastructurally, hepatocyte mitochondria of KIC-treated HLLKO mice show marked swelling. KIC-induced hyperammonemia improved following administration of carglumate (N-carbamyl-L-glutamic acid), which bypasses an acetyl-CoA-dependent reaction essential for urea cycle function, thus demonstrating an acyl-CoA-related mechanism for this complication. In a second animal model of an inborn error of acyl-CoA metabolism, short chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SCAD)-deficient mice, the main finding in liver acyl-CoAs is increased butyryl-CoA, particularly during fasting or after enteral loading with medium chain triglyceride precursor of butyryl-CoA.	leucine , CASTOR , syndrome de Reye , ketone body , leucine , biochemical genetics , hypoglycemia , hyperammonemia , ketogenesis , CASTOR , inborn errors of metabolism , Reye syndrome , energy metabolism	en	10098.0
1046	Les attentes, la satisfaction et la qualité de vie des édentés suite à une réhabilitation par mise en charge immédiate d'une prothèse totale reliée à deux implants non jumelés : une étude pilote expérimentale	Statement of problem: Most published research on the immediate loading of a mandibular 2-implant overdenture has only reported on clinical outcomes. Few studies have evaluated patients centered-outcomes but with measurement errors. Consequently, there is a need to assess clinical and patient-reported outcomes in this regard. Objectives: To examine patients’ level of satisfaction, expectations and quality of life with regard to the implants’ immediate loading protocol in edentate individuals.  Methods: This phase-I trial used a pre-post design to assess patient-centered outcomes in 18 edentate individuals (mean age 62.39 ± 7.65 years) who have received a 2-implant (unsplinted) mandibular overdenture through an immediate loading protocol. The McGill Denture Satisfaction Instrument, a VAS instrument assessing expectations and the OHIP-20 questionnaire were used to evaluate patients’ outcomes at baseline, 2 weeks, 1 and 4 months. Socio-demographic and personality trait data were obtained using the Revised NEO Personality Inventory and a self-administered questionnaire. Change scores were calculated and non-parametrical tests were used to analyse the data. Repeated measures ANOVAs and paired t-tests were also conducted, and effect size was estimated. Results: The participants had a wide range of expectations regarding the immediate loading protocol. Expectations included short-term positive impact on aesthetics (83.3 %) and social life (55.7 %). Other expectations included negative effects on comfort (5.6%), the ability to chew (11.1 %) and to clean their lower denture (11.1%). At 4 months, the immediate loading protocol had met most patients’ expectations regarding aesthetics (94.4%), the ability to chew (83.3%), ability to speak (61.1%), comfort (94.4%), the ability to clean their lower denture (88.9%) and their social life (88.9%).  The statistical analysis showed an overall satisfaction increase with a median change score of 66 (range=7-98), 68 (range=7- 95), and 70 (range= 17- 99), at 2 weeks, 1 month and 4 months respectively. There was a statistically significant improvement in overall satisfaction, comfort, perceived aesthetics, stability of the overdenture, and ability to chew at 2 weeks (p < 0,001). Pairwise comparison (within-subjects comparisons) revealed significant decreases in total OHIP scores (P < 0.001), as well as fewer functional limitations, physical pain, psychological discomfort, physical disability, psychological disability, and handicap (P < 0.01) from baseline to 2 weeks, 1 month and 4 months follow-up. Social disability score decrease significantly only after 1 month follow-up (p = 0.01). These changes remained stable during subsequent follow-ups. The protocol satisfied 94.4% of the participants and improve their quality of life with an estimated effect size of 1.9 (p < 0.001), regardless of socio-demographic and personality profiles. There was 100% agreement among patients on recommending this procedure to their peers. Conclusions: Immediate loading of two unsplinted implants with a mandibular overdenture seemed to fulfill patients’ satisfaction regardless of their expectations and may improve oral health-related quality life of edentate individuals in short-term. Encouraging results from phase I should be confirmed and approved in Phase II clinical trials.

1047	La mise en présence dans l'acte d'achat : là où la consommation engendre le scénario	This research investigates the purchasing moment and opens a breach in the mysterious relationship that we develop with consumer goods. Micro-economics and the sociology of consumption considers that the consumer makes rational choices through a buying process (Langlois, 2002). This process is divided into five stages: problem recognition, information search, evaluating alternative options, choice and post-purchase analysis (Bree, 2004). Although the stage of choice is certainly the turning point, because it determines the final choice leading to the purchase, it is often understood as the result of prior calculations and not as a moment governed by its own dynamics. The dominant paradigm in terms of choice, the rational choice theory, argues that we choose to optimize our situation by selecting the choice that gives us the most value for the least cost (Abell 1991). However, critics of the rational choice theory argue that the multiplicity of choices encouraged by our society generates stress when buying that confuses the judgment. This invites us to consider the uniqueness of the moment leading to the choice. What is happening in the consumer’s mind when it is in the presence of an object? In fact, the influence of the object’s presence on judgement is often not considered by the disciplines interested in consumer behavior. The presence refers to the moment when an individual is in the presence of a specific object or a representation of an object. When placed in contact with the object, the consumer will make an aesthetic judgment, and will experience emotion. Indeed, the judgment will be potentially related to sensations of beauty (Hutcheson, 1991), or to emotions caused by a specific object. Despite this, the aesthetic judgment is disregarded when it comes to influences on consumer choice. Also, it appears that emotion can occur when brought in presence of an object in consumption and generate an emotional judgment. We define emotions as an affective state revealed in a situational moment (Desmet, 2002). Thus, we developed the main research question: in what ways the presence of object can impact the consumer judgment during the buying process. We conducted a survey based on a qualitative approach with consumers and the results are presented and discussed here. This allows an opening on new research possibilities. The survey attempted initially to identify the impact of the presence of the object in the purchasing process. The shopping story of four participants is analyzed using elements such as criteria, factors, constraints and influences. The survey shows among other things that the moment of presence intervenes and modifies the consumer's judgment. The analysis of the interviews highlights a trend among our participants to create imagined scenarios throughout the buying process, especially during times of development presence. We observed that the moments of presence feeds the scenario and allows him to create future life scenarios based on the interactions with other consumer goods.	design , consumption , scenario , aesthetic , emotion	en	10048.0
1048	La maladie cœliaque et les allergies alimentaires sévères : les effets sur les relations sociales au Québec	This research is about the social consequences, in Québec, of the celiac disease and food allergies.  Its aim is to bring an explanation and a better understanding of how celiac disease and food allergies influence the social relations, the social activities and the perceptions of the people that are living with those conditions and their close relations. With this aim in mind, semi-directed interviews were carried out with 11 participants that were either celiac, allergic or near relations.  During these interviews, diagnostic, food accidents, accessibility, activities with friends, the family’s reaction and adaptation, perceptions and relationships were the main topics that were discussed.  The experiences of the people living with celiac disease (CD) or food allergies (FA) were compared following their description.  The data stemming from the interviews was analysed by using Bourdieu’s habitus concept (1980), Giddens’s concepts of agency and rules (1979), concepts of exclusion and identity as well as the definitions of sickness, illness and disease and a gravity scale of perceptions. From this research will be noticed that perception of illness is different for the people living with CD than those living with FA.  CD tends to be taken less in charge by health professionals and to be taken with less seriousness, by people living with CD and the general population, than FA are.  Both conditions lead to a modification of habitus and an adaptation phase.  Nevertheless, these changes seem to be harder to deal with and more complex for people living with CD than for people living with FA because of the age period where the condition was revealed.  Depending on the flexibility of the individual and group habitus, the confrontation to the recasting of habitus will go more or less well.  If the confrontation is more on the negative side of the spectrum, social disapproval or personal denial will take place, leading to exclusion.  The literature generally shows that the quality of life for people living with CD and FA gradually diminishes over time, bringing negative social, emotional and physical consequences.  My participants, however, are apparently living well with their respective conditions because they benefit from a good support of their peers.

1049	Sur la pertinence de la culture en pragmatique	There is a strong division between those who believe in linguistic relativity and those who tend more towards universalism. Since Whorf, many experiments were conducted to determine how and if language could influence thoughts, but not often they were focussed on pragmatics. I revisit the debate on linguistic relativism by considering pragmatics only. There are two different theoretical models in pragmatics at the time, and they support opposing views on relativism: ethnopragmatics and relevance theory. Using models of cultural interaction from anthropology, in particular the ideas of Bourdieu and the concept of assemblage, I show that relevance theory is flexible enough to be able to incorporate a relativistic component, without having to modify its core principles. To illustrate this necessary transformation, I introduce the Cognitive Identity that could interact with the universalistic relevance of the model and still be relativistic itself.

1050	Localisation et fonction de CHK2 en mitose	Centrosomes function primarily as microtubule-organizing centres and play a crucial role during mitosis by organizing the bipolar spindle. In addition to this function, centrosomes act as reaction centers where numerous key regulators meet to control cell cycle progression. One of these factors involved in genome stability, the checkpoint kinase CHK2, was shown to localize at centrosomes throughout the cell cycle. Here, we clarify that CHK2 only localized at centrosomes during mitosis. Using wild-type and CHK2-/- HCT116 human colon cancer cells, or human osteosarcoma U2OS cells depleted for CHK2 with small hairpin RNAs, we show that several CHK2 antibodies are non-specific for immunofluorescence and cross-react with an unknown centrosomal protein(s). To analyse further CHK2 localization, we established cells expressing inducible GFP-CHK2 and Flag-CHK2 fusion proteins. We show that CHK2 localizes to the nucleus in interphase cells but that a fraction of CHK2 associates with centrosomes in mitotic cells, from early mitotic stages until cytokinesis. In contrast to previous data obtained by A. Stolz and colleagues with the human colon carcinoma HCT116 cell line, our experiments exploring the possible functions for CHK2 during mitosis did not support a role for CHK2 in the bipolar spindle formation and the timely progression of mitosis in human osteosarcoma U2OS cells.

1051	D’une structure de gouvernance canado-américaine pour la gestion du Passage du Nord-Ouest : l’apport du transgouvernementalisme	Transgovernmentalism is based on the existence of transboundary networks between sub-national entities exercising similar functions in order to address common issues. Canada-United States transgovernmentalism can be characterised by limited relinquishment of sovereignty by partners, significant participation of regional actors, informality in the relations and the integration of the private and public sectors and civil society into mixed networks.   The governance model in place in the St. Lawrence basin and the Great Lakes region presents all the features of the typical model of Canada-United States transgovernmentalism. A thorough analysis indeed reveals a complex and strong matrix of transgovernmental networks which ramifications now extend far beyond the strict framework of agreements under whose auspices these networks arose.  However, if transgovernmentalism is the solution adopted by both governments for the collaborative management of the St. Lawrence basin and the Great Lakes, it is an appropriate governance model for the management of the Northwest Passage? Although the model in place in the region of the St. Lawrence basin and the Great Lakes can not be entirely reproduced for the management of the Northwest Passage, a “bottom-up” transgovernmental model focused on the implementation of common rules in the field of navigation, and on collaboration at the operational level to ensure the implementation of this regulation, is appropriate for the management of Northwest Passage.

1052	Colonial Ideology and Legacy and Feminine Resistance in Jamaica Kincaid	"My thesis ""Colonial Ideology and Legacy and Feminine Resistance in Jamaica Kincaid"" analyzes, criticizes and deconstructs the foundations of colonial ideology. It examines how colonial Manichaeanism oppresses the woman, and explores the sites of feminine resistance for (formerly) colonized women. In the first chapter, I define colonial ideology as based on Colonial Manichaeanism. I argue that the colonizer-colonized relationship is reductive and dehumanizing. I explicate and criticize Frantz Fanon's analysis of this relationship of superiority and inferiority and his understanding of violence. I also study Jamaica Kincaid's A Small Place, which reproduces this relationship and extends it to the present through the tourist/native relationship. In the second chapter, I study the mother as a colonial figure in Annie John. The mother-daughter relationship offers another re-enactment of the colonizer-colonized relationship, which is highlighted through images of heaven and hell. I also develop the metaphor of death and I argue that love and Obeah are resistance strategies to colonial figures. The last chapter engages the corporal in colonial oppression, and feminine resistance. I scrutinize the female body in its wavering between veiling and exposure in Lucy. I analyze the movement of the female body as emblematic of the fluidity of feminine identity and as such, an identity which is misrepresented by colonial and patriarchal discourse."

1053	Le soutien parental à l’autonomie et l’honnêteté : le rôle médiateur de l’intériorisation de la valeur de l’honnêteté et de l’analyse coûts/bénéfices	Honest communication in parent-adolescent relationships is a precursor of adolescents’ healthy development (Stattin & Kerr, 2000). This study investigates how parents can foster their adolescents’ honest communication. In line with self-determination theory (Deci & Ryan, 2000), we postulated that the more parents are autonomy supportive, the more their adolescents would be honest with them. We also postulated that this relation would be mediated by two variables: adolescents’ integration of the honesty value and their perception of the costs/benefits of being honest with their parents. Results from Structural Equation Modeling with 174 parent-adolescent dyads showed that the more parents were autonomy supportive, the more adolescents integrated the value of honesty and the more they perceived high benefits and low costs in being honest with their parents. These variables, in turn, were positively related to adolescents’ honest communication behaviors. Parental valuation of honesty also predicted adolescents’ integration of the honesty value.

1054	Excitabilité du système miroir : une étude de stimulation magnétique transcrânienne sur le chant et le langage	The perception of movements is associated with increased activity in the human motor cortex. This system underlies our ability to understand one’s actions, as it is implicated in the recognition, understanding and imitation of actions. In this study, we investigated the involvement and lateralization of this “mirror neuron” system (MNS) in the perception of singing and speech. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was applied over the mouth representation of the motor cortex in 11 participants. The generated motor response was measured in the form of motor evoked potentials (MEPs), recorded from the mouth muscle. The MEPs were compared for the singing and speech conditions in each cerebral hemisphere. Furthermore, to investigate the time course of the MNS activation, TMS pulses were randomly emitted in 7 time windows (ranging from 500 to 3500 milliseconds after stimulus onset).  The stimuli for the singing condition consisted in 4-second videos of singers producing a 2-note ascending interval. Participants had to judge whether the sung interval matched a written interval, previously presented on the screen. For the speech condition, 4-second videos of a person explaining a proverb were shown. Participants had to decide whether this explanation matched a written proverb previously displayed on the screen. Results show that the MEP amplitudes were higher after stimulation of the right hemisphere in the singing condition. More specifically, sending TMS pulses between 1000 and 1500 milliseconds over the right hemisphere yielded higher MEPs as compared to the left hemisphere. No effect was found in the speech condition.  These results suggest that the right MNS is more activated after an audiovisual motor presentation compared to the left hemisphere.

1055	"Pandémie H1N1 : comparaison Canada-France des enfants hospitalisés en Soins Intensifs Pédiatriques Étude épidémiologique descriptive à partir de 2 cohortes
nationales"	Background: The pandemic influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 resulted in a large number of admissions to pediatric intensive care units (PICUs). The objective of the study was to compare the incidence and mortality rate of children admitted to PICU in autumn 2009 between France and Canada, two countries that essentially differed by their population immunization to this virus (first pandemic wave in summer and vaccine coverage >50% in Canada; no wave in summer and vaccine coverage of 18% in France). Methods: We compared two national cohorts that included all patients with documented H1N1pdm09 infection, admitted to a PICU in Canada and in France between October 1st 2009 and January 31st 2010. Results: In Canada, 160 children (incidence=2.63/100,000 children) in 6 weeks were hospitalized in PICU compared to 125 children (incidence=1.15/100,000) in 11 weeks in France (p<0.001). Prior vaccination was under 25% among critically ill children in both countries. Severity of illness at PICU admission and mortality rates were similar in Canada and France (6.5%, vs 4.4 p=0.45, respectively). In Canada, H1N1pdm09 vaccination was associated with a decreased risk of requiring invasive ventilation (Odd Ratio 0.30, 95%Confidence Interval 0.11-0.83, p=0.02). In Canada as compared to France, median PICU length of stay and invasive ventilation durations were shorter (2.9 vs 3 days, p=0.03 and 4 vs 6 days, p=0.02, respectively). Conclusion: Critically ill Canadian and French children were much less likely to have received prior vaccination against influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 in comparison to all children in the populations. In Canada, where vaccination rate was higher, the risk of severe respiratory failure was less among those critically ill children receiving prior vaccination.

1056	La mémoire émotionnelle chez les patients schizophrènes consommateurs de cannabis : une étude en imagerie par résonance magnétique fonctionnelle	Context In spite of well-known adverse consequences of cannabis consumption in patients with schizophrenia (SCZ), it is recognized that cannabis use reaches levels as high as 40 % in this population. Recently, a number of studies have attempted to get a better grasp of the relationship between these two conditions, which remains unclear to this day. Previous studies, including some from our group, have shown that cannabis abusing patients (SCZCAN) tend to have less prominent negative symptoms, better cognitive abilities, and that their emotion processing is closer to normal. Aim The present study aims to compare emotional memory in patients with schizophrenia with or without cannabis abuse, our hypothesis being that SCZCAN will perform better on an emotional memory task and will activate larger brain regions during functional imaging, as compared to SCZ. Method Three groups of subjects, namely SCZ (N=14), SCZCAN (N=14) and control subjects (N=21) underwent an emotional memory task during a functional magnetic resonance imaging session. Results Our study showed that the group of SCZCAN performed better than SCZ in a functional memory task and activated larger brain regions during functional imaging, in particular those linked to memory and emotional processing (orbitofrontal and temporal cortex, hippocampus). Conclusion The group of SCZCAN demonstrated a relative preservation of their emotional memory as compared to SCZ and activated larger brain regions during functional imaging.

1057	Étude de l’implication de la Neuroligine 1 dans le processus homéostatique de régulation du sommeil chez la souris	Sleep  is  essential  for  the  well-functioning  of  the  body.  It  has  been  suggested  that  sleep  is regulated, in part, by the homeostatic process of sleep regulation which controls a pressure for  sleep  in  function  of  the  amount  of  time  spent  awake.  Studies  have  suggested  that  the homeostatic process could be linked to synaptic plasticity, and that changes in sleep pressure can  affect  brain plasticity.  N-methyl-D-aspartate  receptors,  which  are  important  plasticity mediators, appear to be implicated in the deleterious effects related to sleep loss as well as in  the  regulation  of  cortical  synchrony  characteristic  of  slow  wave  sleep.  Their  activity  is  controlled  by  Neuroligin  1  (NLGN1),  a  synaptic  adhesion  molecule.  Also,  a  Nlgn1  mutation has similar effects on memory and behavior as those observed following a sleep deprivation. In  this  master’s  thesis,  we  hypothesized  that  NLGN1  is  implicated  in  sleep  and  wake regulation. To test this hypothesis, Nlgn1 mRNA and protein expression has been measured  after sleep deprivation, and the sleep of mice lacking NLGN1 has been studied. The results of my  research  project  show  that  an  increase  in  sleep  pressure  changes  Nlgn1  mRNA  and protein  expression  in  mice.  We  also  find  that  Nlgn1  mutation  reduces  wake  duration  and modifies  the  EEG  spectral  composition  during  wake  and  sleep.  These  results  indicate  that NLGN1  is  important  in  the  maintenance  of  wakefulness  and  the  regulation  of  sleep,  and provide further support to a role for NLGN1 in the regulation of neuronal activity.

1058	Exploration de la relation entre l’évaluation à l’aide d’examens à la fin du primaire et l’apprentissage par la lecture d’élèves en difficulté d’apprentissage	Nowadays, it is not enough to decode to be considered as taught to read and write (alphabetized), it is also necessary to be capable of understanding various types of texts and of using with efficiency the information which they present (MELS, 2006). The redoubling and the educational underachievement in the primary school being mostly attributable to the difficulties in reading and in writing and these weaknesses echoing on the success of the pupils in all subjects (Stetson and William, 1992), the importance to present to the pupils of the situations of learning and evaluation which will support them in the learning by the reading is without ambiguity. Especially that Horton and Lovitt (1994) mentions that the academic failures would strictly be connected to the difficulties which these pupils feel when they learn by reading. This study joined within the framework of a research which was led in 2003-2004 by Chouinard, Bowen, Cartier, Desbiens, Laurier, Plante ( 2005 ) and whose title is: « The effect of various evaluative approaches on the commitment and the school perseverance in the context of the passage of the primary sector in the secondary sector» (Chouinard and coll., 2005). The present study was realized from the collection of datum of this research. The objective of research for this study was to investigate the link between teacher’s evaluative practices (tests) of the end of the primary school and the learning by reading of underachieving students. The three main concepts of the research question are the learning difficulties, learning by reading and evaluation practices. An analysis of the characteristics listed 22 research has found that very little research dealt with the link between evaluation practices and the learning process of elementary students and even fewer involve students with learning difficulties. To meet the objective of this study, an exploratory type of research in a quantitative approach was chosen. Descriptive analyses (mean and standard deviation) followed by a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) with two levels (2x2) were performed for the iv evaluation practice. A hundred and six teachers and 1864 students agreed to meet two self-reported questionnaires: Le questionnaire sur les pratiques évaluatives (Chouinard and coll., 2005) was used with teachers. Le questionnaire sur l'apprentissage par la lecture: Lire pour apprendre from Cartier and Butler (2004 version) was used with students. The results of this study indicate a significant effect of interaction bet ween thes tests (strong or low) and the type of students (learning disabilities students and regular students). The students with learning disabilities interpet more the requirements of the activity than the regular students when they are in the same context. We also notice that the students with learning disabilities report to turn more to the cognitives strategies than the regular students.	pratiques évaluatives , apprentissage par la lecture , lecture , assessment , learning disabilities , primary school , learning by reading , evaluation , testing methods	en	9940.0
1059	Les archives dans l'art de Robert Rauschenberg	This thesis takes an archival perspective in order to examine the work of Robert Rauschenberg, an American artist who gained notoriety in the New-York art scene of the sixties. It is relevant to see appropriation art strategies by artists like Rauschenberg as a way of having « set up the table » for the archival art movement that would follow, starting in the late eighties and early nineties. The artist's connexions with the archives are first studied. Then, an archival reading of a corpus of his artworks is conducted in order to learn about his particular use of the archives. The conditions of use are raised, along with the conception of archives as memory and, at last, the relationship between archives and photography.

1060	Étude Pharmacologique de la Douleur Neuropathique Centrale à la suite d'une Hémorragie Intrathalamique induite chez le Rat	Central post stroke pain is a debilitating condition for which treatment is often difficult and unsuccessful. The goal of this project was to reproduce an animal model of this condition by performing a stereotaxic injection of collagenase solution inducing a localized hemorrhage within the ventroposterolateral thalamic nuclei of rats. Behavioral tests to evaluate motor coordination, sentivity to mechanical, hot and cold stimuli were performed regurlarly to establish if neuropathic pain was present. Then, the effects of ketamine, amitriptyline, gabapentin and carbamazepine on such pain were evaluated. Induction of an intrathalamic hemorrhage produced bilateral persistent mechanical allodynia as well as transient cold allodynia in some animals without notable changes in motor coordination. High doses of ketamine did reverse mechanical allodynia but with significant impairment in motor coordination. Similarly gabapentin also reversed mechanical allodynia without undesirable effect on coordination. The others two drugs failed to show any significant effect. Histopathological evaluation of the brain revealed a well localized lesion in the area of interest. These results show that an intrathalamic collagenase injection produced a reliable model of central neuropathic pain. Ketamine was able to reverse mechanical allodynia but with significant side effects. Gabapentin appeared to be a promising drug for the treatment of this condition. The role of NMDA receptors and voltage dependant calcium channels, that target ketamine and gabapentin respectively in the maintenance of this pain, needs to be further defined.

1061	Le projet organisant : vers une ontologie du projet d'aménagement	Construction projects are often affected by lower levels of performance and significant gaps between what is planned and what is actually realized. This thesis aims to examine the phenomenon that allows the built environment project to organize itself and carry out its objectives. The hypothesis states that: projects influence, transform and create the organizations that conduct them, following a dynamic and iterative process, referred to as «self- organizing » and «  structuring ». This « active organizing » process generates transformations – organizational and structural – conditioned by the very nature of the project itself. To validate this hypothesis, an ontological frame, based on four categories of analysis has been devised, including: (a) organization and structures; (b) the project and its processes; (c) the artefact and its design, and; (d) actors’ dynamic. These fields are put in relations using systemic principles and tools within the paradigmatic frame of complexity. The methodology includes three steps, deployed along five articles : article no1 presents the research problem and theoretical framework; articles no2, 3 and 4 use case studies and case surveys for the study of various aspects of the organizational structures; article no5 presents a longitudinal case study, spanning three years, which examined decision processes. The five articles explore the following topics: (no1) the design thinking approach to projects and actors’ dynamic behavior ; (no2) the informality of communications and coordination ; (no3) contingency factors that influence the « structuring » of the temporary multiorganization – TMO;  (no4) the typologies of the TMO, and ; (no5) the study of iterative processes and their influence on organizational structures. Seven results validate sub-hypotheses that state that: a process of «self-organization » generates transformations – organizational and processual – linked to the specific nature of the project. Therefore, the project : (1) is conducted by both formalized and often linear management approaches as well as  iterative design process, the former being non-linear and self-organizing and responding to systemic principles ; (2) contributes to create its own processes of development, and ; (3) constitutes a contingency factor that influences the structuring of the TMO that is created to conduct the project itself. This analysis reveals the diversity and complexity of organizational processes and structures, producing a multidimensional representation of project behaviour. Three important contributions are drawn from these conclusions : (1) the frame of ontologies of the project and its underlying systemic functioning ; (2) the existence of inter-organizational work constellations and a typology of six TMO configurations, and ; (3) the statement of the « organizing  project » that, through the « self-organization » approach, « organizes » itself and the processes and organization that are created to conduct it, through actors’ multiple roles.

1062	Le Nanomonde des chercheurs. Analyse sociologique des pratiques et des discours sur l’instrumentation en nanotechnologies	"In the vanguard of the current scientific innovation, the research in nanotechnologies joins in a promise of conquest of a new dimension: the Nanoworld. Defined by a dimensionality criterion including all the objects between 1 and 100 nanometers and by the application of the laws of the quantum physics in the analysis of phenomenon, this new territory of knowledge is used as a social showcase for the promises of radical processing of our understanding of the reality, through in particular the production of ""nano"" objects displaying revolutionary properties, such as carbon nanotubes. But what exactly is the nature of this dimension? How is it defined, and who, once the speeches and practices have been analyzed, eventually controls it? Through a grounded research in two nanotechnologies laboratories and a series of interviews with researchers, I have analyzed the importance of technical instrumentation as a structuring element of the Nanoworld, both in practice and speeches. Furthermore, the concept of technical thought allows to report the nature of aprioris within the research work in nanotechnologies. By going through the various works made by humanities on nanotechnologies, the square of the instrumentation, if evocated as an element of accessibility to join the Nanoworld, is only rarely considered in a problematic perspective. Through the analysis of the reflexive speech of the research practitionners, it seems that the instrumentation, much more than being a simple material element of the laboratory, structures the interpersonal relations. It creates a network of cognitive interdependence where every researcher is situated according to his instrumental expertise. It structures the relations within the researchers’ group. This cognitive sharing is a way to establish social relationships, while being an element of determination of the nature of the researches on the Nanoworld. The instrumentation is thus naturalized as a granted component of ""laboratory life"". Yet, the analysis of the attempts of control of the research context and a discussion around the efficiency of the technical system of the instrumentation in nanotechnologies, the auto-reference aspect which takes the work of exploration of the Nanoworld becomes highlighted. This aspect of closure on the technical system of the instrumentation is parallel with the way the speeches on the nanotechnologies - both internal and external to the scientific sphere - present the objects of the Nanoworld and the researchs on these objects through their performative aspect. By insisting on the performances of the products of their research, scientists and developers of the nanotechnologies turn the Nanoworld into a dimension of merchandised knowledge, in the same logic as neoliberal market ideas. However, far from corresponding to an enrichment of the expertises, this model of merchandisation entails their impoverishment. Furthermore, a difficulty to train the ""nanos"" researchers of the future arised in the past few years. This double standard is obvious as a consequence of the technical imperative of the speech performativity and the choice of individual researchs. Thus, the analysis I conducted here insists on the idea that it is according to the technical way of thinking that the Nanoworld is investigated, conquered, and, finally, exploited."

1063	Impact de l'art de la guerre napoléonien dans la seconde moitié du XIXe siècle	On June 18, 1815, Napoleon was defeated at the battle of Waterloo, but his revolutionary warfare survived long after he was gone, and it was put into application in many instances. Inspired by some of the most famous theoreticians of the XVIIIth century, he had favored the strategy of annihilation in the conduct of his military operations, and thus ranked among those strategists who were seeking decisive battles in order to destroy all enemy forces. Based on the strategy and tactics that the Emperor used in his most famous campaigns, this thesis will attempt to highlight the extent to which they were applied during the second half of the XIXth century. The conflicts analysed during this period of time will be the Crimean War (1853-1856), the Italian Campaign (1859), the american Civil War (1861-1865), the Austro-prussian War (1866) and the Franco-prussian War (1870-1871). This study will consider the impact of the advances of technology in the fields of weaponry, and means of transportation and communication, as well as the economic, financial, political and military contexts of the warring nations at that time. In the XIXth century, two military thinkers, Clausewitz and Jomini, emerged as the most notorious interpreters of napoleonic warfare. In the course of our analysis of Napoleon's methods in the above-mentionned conflicts, we will also try to determine the extent to which Jomini's vision of Bonaparte's campaigns differed from that of Clausewitz. We will then analyse Napoleon's infleunce in the administration, organisation and marches of the armies involved in the selected wars, and will pay particular attention to the impact of his warfare on specific aspects of the battles themselves. The final analysis will outline the lessons that the military in the long run drew from Napoleon's campaigns.

1064	Ni hypersexualisées ni voilées ! Tensions et enjeux croisés dans les discours sur l’hypersexualisation et le port du voile «islamique» au Québec	This dissertation identifies a co-occurrence between the discourses about girl’s ‘hypersexualization’ and those regarding the ‘Islamic’ practice of veiling, which have been generating similar concerns, discourses and anxieties in Quebec as well as in most Western societies for the past years. More specifically, I propose a ‘general economy of discourses’ (Foucault, 1976) about hypersexualization and headscarf-wearing, from a conjunctural perspective, and by means of three contexts of analysis: feminist, media, and public. I demonstrate how hypersexualization and headscarf-wearing are problematized (Foucault, 2001/1984), that is to say, how they are produced as concomitant social problems. The dissertation consists of three main chapters that each takes on one of the contexts of problematization. The chapter entitled ‘Feminism(s) and Gender Equality’, argues that gender equality is invoked as the modern value par excellence within the feminist movement as in Quebec society. As such, gender equality is constitutive of the problems of hypersexualization and headscarf-wearing. The next chapter, ‘Media Diversity and (Hyper) Visibility’, focuses on the media and popular culture as both subjects and objects of discourse, which produce and define adolescence and Muslim religion/culture as worlds apart, while exposing them to the public. Finally, the chapter entitled ‘Secularism, Sexuality, and Neutrality’ analyzes the public discourses about hypersexualization and headscarf-wearing and highlights the ways in which these problems are constitutive of charters, codes of conduct and other forms of regulations, in the name of the common good and state’s neutrality. In conclusion, I provide a ‘look back’ on the conjuncture, stressing some issues that crosses the main chapters of the dissertation, such as the questions of consensus and extreme.

1065	From Reasonable Accommodation to Understanding: Reconsidering Diversity Management Practices in Quebec	In 2007 and in response to conflicts stemming from ethnic and religious difference, Quebec Premier Jean Charest established the Consultation Commission on Accommodation Practices Related to Cultural Differences. The Commission’s mandate was to take stock of accommodation practices in Quebec, analyse the issues, consult the population and formulate recommendations to the government to ensure accommodation practices’ congruence with the values of Quebec society. This mémoire will first argue that two factors, namely the evolution of the francophone majority population’s identity and changes to immigrants’ origins, contributed to Quebec’s malaise with diversity management and thus made the establishment of the Commission relevant. Second, through a review of the Commission’s methods, findings, recommendations and the Ministry of Immigration and Cultural communities’ response to the recommendations, it will be argued that while the Commission’s mandate was both pertinent and fulfilled, the government’s response was inadequate. Finally, it will be argued that while open secularism and interculturalism, diversity management methods proffered by the Commission’s report, are necessary components of diversity management, they espouse the political philosophies of neutralism and pluralism which respectively result in force and compromise. I will argue that Quebec can manage difference more effectively and achieve true reconciliation by embracing conversation, a patriotic approach to diversity management.

1066	Inuit ethnobotany and ethnoecology in Nunavik and Nunatsiavut, northeastern Canada	Unique habitats of the boreal-subarctic ecotone in northeastern Canada are being impacted by climate change. Combined with effects of globalization, changing environmental conditions are causing Inuit of this region to see significant strains on their traditional lifestyle and on the language and knowledge that go with it. This study compared two aspects of Inuit ethnobiology: we compared plant names and uses from two Inuit communities and examined what kinds of places or habitats Inuit recognize and name. Semi-structured interviews were conducted in Nain, Nunatsiavut and Kangiqsualujjuaq, Nunavik, by showing interviewees (mostly Elders) plant specimens or photos of the region. Plants were used for food, tea, medicine, fuel, construction, cleaning, and other uses. Both communities used equal numbers of plants, with equivalent proportions of vascular/non-vascular taxa, growth forms, and species per use category. Forty-three species were reported in each community, for a total of 78 species from 39 families. Despite high overlap in species distributions, only half of all species were shared, reflecting community-specific bodies of traditional knowledge, or perhaps an overall decline in ethnobotanical knowledge use. The most frequently reported landscape features were topographical, hydrological, and ecological (i.e. plant associations and animal habitats). Some Inuit categories reflected their significance to traditional Inuit lifestyle (e.g. ‘berry-patch’, ‘seal-place’), aiding navigation and resource finding. Integrating Inuit conceptions of plants and landscape with those of contemporary science can improve our understanding of subarctic ecology, help involve local stakeholders in sustainable development discussions, and inform land-use planning, biodiversity conservation initiatives, and climate change adaptation strategies.	ethnobotany , landscape ethnoecology , Inuit , Nunatsiavut , Nunavik , Subarctic , boreal , medicinal plants , ecological classification , traditional knowledge	en	9841.0
1067	Portrait de l'écrivain en ascète: Ralph Waldo Emerson et la modernité des exercices spirituels	This master thesis considers how the literary practice of Ralph Waldo Emerson might help us rethink the modern heritage in the tradition of spiritual exercises. The nineteenth century American writer followed the path of this antique tradition that was uncovered by the philosophy historian Pierre Hadot, allowing us to consider anew this tradition within the framework of modernity. It is thus possible to access an unexpected modernity of spiritual exercises, unknown to Hadot himself, characterized by the production of literary texts that convey what Emerson calls, “an original relation to the universe.” The first chapter explains the specificity of traditional spirituality, where writing serves to incorporate traditional text into oneself. It considers the literary practice of Marcus Aurelius, Seneca and Saint Augustine, who all attempted to live according to their conception of transcendence: personal under stoicism, institutional within Christianity. Chapter two illustrates how Emerson overturns the traditional way of behaving with a spiritual text. His critique of Christian theology shows that the revelation of Christ is, in its origin, a personal experience of transcendence that cannot be instituted. From this romantic dissension with Christianity emerges a theory of literature related to mysticism and in close ties with an “expressivist” conception of language (Charles Taylor). The final chapter examines Emerson’s literary askesis. First explained is the antischolastic conception of the scholar, subsequently showing how his way of thinking is interrelated to a fluxional conception of the universe. Lastly demonstrated is how his experimental way of life relies on a conception of literature as process.

1068	A dynamic sequential route choice model for micro-simulation	In transportation modeling, a route choice is a model describing the selection of a route between a given origin and a given destination. More specifically, it consists of determining the sequence of arcs leading to the destination in a network composed of vertices and arcs, according to some selection criteria. We propose a novel route choice model, based on approximate dynamic programming. The technique is applied sequentially, as every time a user reaches an intersection, he/she is supposed to consider the utility of a certain number of future arcs, followed by an approximation for the rest of the path leading up to the destination. The route choice model is implemented as a component of a traffic simulation model, in a discrete event framework.  We conduct a numerical experiment on a real traffic network model in order to analyze its performance.

1069	Revisiting optimization algorithms for maximum likelihood estimation	Maximum likelihood is one of the most popular techniques to estimate the parameters of some given distributions. Under slight conditions, the produced estimators are consistent and asymptotically efficient. Maximum likelihood problems can be handled as non-linear programming problems, possibly non convex, that can be solved for instance using line-search methods and trust-region algorithms. Moreover, under some conditions, it is possible to exploit the structures of such problems in order to speedup convergence. In this work, we consider various non-linear programming techniques, either standard or recently developed, within the maximum likelihood estimation perspective. We also propose new algorithms to solve this estimation problem, capitalizing on Hessian approximation techniques and developing new methods to compute steps, in particular in the context of line-search approaches. More specifically, we investigate methods that allow us switching between Hessian approximations and adapting the step length along the search direction. We finally assess the numerical efficiency of the proposed methods for the estimation of discrete choice models, more precisely mixed logit models.

1070	Tectonique moléculaire : vers l'utilisation du dispirofluorène-indénofluorène comme unité de construction pour bâtir des réseaux cristallins poreux	Supramolecular chemistry is a field of rapidly increasing interest in recent years.  The field uses weak intermolecular interactions to control molecular organisation and therefore modulate the properties of materials.  Adequate selection and positioning of functional groups, combined with a carefully selected molecular core to which the groups are attached, allows for the creation of molecules with a high degree of predictability in the way they will interact with their neighbours.  This approach to the design and construction of materials, called molecular tectonics, is based on subunits called tectons (derived from the Greek word for builder), which use weak interactions to organise themselves in a predictable manner and generate novel supramolecular architectures.  In favorable cases, the interactions can counter the general tendency shown by molecules to pack together in a compact manner.  Instead, specific functional groups direct molecular recognition and help guide the process of auto-assembly.  At the same time, the molecular core of the tecton is also of capital importance as it must allow an optimal orientation of the recognition groups. The molecular tectonics approach, used jointly with crystallisation, opens the door to new opportunities in crystal engineering.  For example, crystal engineering now allows the logical creation of porous crystalline networks that can accept guest molecules.  Although any type of weak interaction can hold such networks together, the hydrogen bond is favored for constructing porous supramolecular networks.  The strength, directionality and versatility of the hydrogen bond accounts for its special importance in the domain of crystal engineering.    A recognition group of particular interest in crystal engineering is the 2,4-diamino-1,3,5-triazinyl unit.  This unit forms hydrogen bonds according to various standard motifs.  The use of this recognition group, joined to molecular cores specifically designed to inhibit close packing, such as Onsager crosses, allows for the construction of supramolecular networks with high porosity, as shown by the behaviour of 2,2’,7,7’-tetrakis(2,4-diamino-1,3,5-triazin-6-yl)-9,9’-spirobi[9H-fluorene].  We present here an extension of previous studies of spirobifluorenyl cores by describing the synthesis and structural analysis of molecules with related dispirofluorene-indenofluorenyl cores.  This new core offers the same characteristics as the spirobifluorenyl core, namely rigid topology and an Onsager cross molecular shape which are known to inhibit close packing.  We have combined this core with a variety of recognition groups to verify the influence of the molecular core on the crystalline networks generated, particularly on the volume accessible to guest molecules.

1071	Chert Nastapoka : caractérisation chimique et exploitation au Paléoesquimau, baie d’Hudson, Nunavik	The dominant cultural material on Nunavik’s archaeological sites is lithics. As a result they constitute an important source of information on prehistoric lifeways. The lack of lithic raw materials resarchs carried out on the east coast of Hudson Bay gave us the opportunity to focus on a source in this area. The objective of this thesis research was to characterize one component of the geological formation: Nastapoka chert.  In order to do this, X-ray fluorescence was chosen. The results demonstrate that it is difficult to construct a unique geochemical pattern for the source because of its variability. To complete the portrait, we take into account the technological use of Nastapoka chert by the Paleoeskimo groups by comparing three site’s studies (GhGk-4, GhGk-63 and IcGm-5). This analysis of the exploitation of this material reveals a developement from Predorset to Dorset that supports the idea of cultural continuum between the two periods.

1073	Image de la femme transsexuelle dans Transamerica	Transsexuality and its depiction represent for many a subversion or transgression of gender binarity. Transsexuality’s depiction is oftenly regarded as representation. In order to question this transsexuality's depiction, its subversivity, its transgressivity, and even its representability, we will attempt to look at it otherwise. This thesis discusses transsexual audiovisual image as figure. To define what figure is, a distinction will be made between this term and another concept of aesthetics: representation. By means of a filmic analysis of Transamerica, directed by Duncan Tucker, we shall see how some modalities allow trans figure to appear. After this cinematic figure's study, we will give an account of the manner by which we pursued in a video production the research concerning the question about trans figure.	figure , transsexuality , figure , representation , film , video , gender , sexual identity , research-creation	en	9802.0
1074	Problèmes de comportement à long terme chez les patients pédiatriques atteints de leucémie lymphoblastique aiguë	Recent improvements in pediatric cancers treatment have led to marked increases in patient survival rate. However, it has been well documented that pediatric cancer survivors are at elevated risk for various other health problems. With respect specifically to neuropsychological side effects, known predictors (mainly: age at diagnosis, patient gender, exposure to radiation therapy) remain insufficient so far to target, and prevent efficiently, long term sequelae in this population.   General objectives related to this thesis were: 1) characterization of individual trajectories of behavioral problems in pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia; 2) the identification of genetic, medical and psychosocial determinants of behavioral problems in this population.   This research program was based on the following hypotheses: 1) there is an association between the trajectories of individual behavioral problems and a – familial well-being-related psychosocial factors, b – gene polymorphisms involved in the therapeutic responses to methotrexate and glucocorticoids, c – anti-cancer treatments-related variables. 2) Multilevel statistical modeling can be used to characterize patient groups according to their individual behavioral problem trajectories, and can also identify predictive factors.   138 pediatric patients (0-18 years old) who received an acute lymphoblastic leukemia diagnosis between 1993 and 1999 at CHU Ste-Justine participated in this 4 years-long longitudinal study. A standardized and validated instrument, the Child Behavior Checklist, was used to measure behavior problems, as reported by the mother, at diagnosis, and then 1, 2, 3 and 4 years post-diagnosis. Genetic, psychosocial and medical data were also collected during this longitudinal study; these data were exploited in the context of the statistical modeling performed.   Results obtained suggest that internalized and externalized behavioral problems have distinct trajectories and have different predictive factors. Internalized problems are affective issues presented by the patient, such as depressive or anxious symptoms. They are highly prevalent post-diagnosis and normalize over the following years, suggestive of temporary yet significant problems. Stress-enhancing medical variables such as a higher relapse risk at diagnosis and medical complications requiring a longer hospitalization slow down the normalization process. Externalized problems need interpersonal contact to occur; violence or aggressiveness manifestations are some examples. Compared to internalized problems, externalized problems are much more stable across time. However, pharmacological and genetic variables do contribute to individual differences in trajectories. In particular, administration of a more potent glucocorticoid (from pharmacological and toxicological perspectives) and being homozygous for NOS3 gene -786C844T haplotype are linked to modulation of externalized problems in time. Finally, the level of perceived family stress at time of diagnosis is positively correlated with initial externalized problems, while shortly after the induction period, the level of familial stress is linked with the initial internalized problems.     Together, these results support the idea that a holistic care strategy is essential to develop efficient, preventive interventions in this population, due to the multifactorial nature of these behavioral problems. The knowledge generated in the present studies could contribute to better quality of life for these patients.     This thesis also brings a more holistic contribution to our current knowledge of behavioral problems in this population, by highlighting the need for individual, multidisciplinary follow-ups, with particular emphasis on repeated measurements and appropriate statistical analyses. More than ever, knowledge de-compartmentalization appears essential in reaching a certain comprehension level of observed phenomena, rather than adhering to descriptive settings. It indicates that, despite obvious methodological and logistic challenges, this type of research is not only desirable in studying dynamic processes, but is certainly achievable with current analytical tools.

1076	Prédiction des habiletés et habitudes de conduite automobile sécuritaire chez les conducteurs âgés : apport de la neuropsychologie clinique	"The increase of crash rates in elderly population can be attributed in some part to the effects of normal aging on cognitive functioning. In the other hand, older drivers are likely to adopt self-regulated driving behaviours, such as driving habits to restrict their exposure to less complex situations. Neuropsychological assessments have shown some efficacy in the field of fitness-to-drive screening of older drivers suffering from neurological disorders. This thesis aims to assess the relevance of clinical neuropsychology in screening methods considering older drivers population. The main goal is thus to study the contribution and the sensitivity of neuropsychological testing in the prediction of skills and habits of safe driving among older drivers. In the same vein, the thesis investigates the role of other socio-demographic and psychological variables.  To this end, article 1 evaluates the predictive validity of seven tests of visuo-attentional functions and working memory efficiency in relation to peripheral detection task performances in 50 drivers aged from 62 to 83 years in a simulated car driving environment. The driving simulation consisted of a simple driving condition and a condition including a ""hands-free"" cell phone distraction task. The results indicate that some neuropsychological tests, as opposed to age, are good predictors of detection performances. In addition, the predictive validity of the tests is more important in the most challenging driving condition. The Corsi Block Tapping test, assessing visuospatial working memory, is revealed as on of the best predictor of detection skills.  Article 2 was carried from previous neuropsychological testing and self-administered questionnaires related to avoidance driving behaviours, drivers perceptions and attitudes. The results indicate that individuals who show higher difficulties in tests assessing visuospatial working memory, processing speed, and divided and selective attention capacities are significantly more likely to adopt avoidance driving strategies. The results also demonstrate that driving avoidance is higher among drivers who tend to depreciate their general driving skills, to express a lower perception of control and an unfavourable attitude towards risky driving. Avoidance strategies are thus proven to be self-regulatory responses which are proportionate to cognitive limitations and individual perceptions.  In summary, this thesis demonstrates that peripheral detection performances of older drivers in a simulated car study, are well reflected in neuropsychological testing assessing working memory and other attentional abilities. Since detection skills are crucial for driving safety, an indirect link can be established between neuropsychological measures and road safety among older drivers. It also seems that those drivers, who have greater cognitive limitations, are more likely to avoid challenging driving situations, thereby balancing their crash risk. It is concluded that fitness-to-drive assessments based on neuropsychological screening need to be complemented with the assessment of self-regulatory behaviors. In the context of an aging population, new interventions should focus on strengthening self-regulatory behaviors of older drivers."	attention , distraction , older drivers , cognitive tests , predictors , detection , self-regulatory strategies	en	9779.0
1077	Disclosure of HIV status and stigma in rural communities in Brazil: A conundrum for researchers	Stigmatization and discrimination are common consequences following disclosure of HIV serostatus; such factors are especially problematic in rural communities where “everyone knows everyone”. In this case study, researchers conducting ethnographic field studies in remote areas of Brazil decided to impersonate friends or relatives of research participants living with HIV as a means to protect participants from inadvertent disclosure of their serostatus to fellow community members. These acts of “wilful deception” raise issues about honesty and integrity in research, and how to balance issues of confidentiality with communicating research findings to communities and the broader public.

1078	Développement de composés conjugués en étoile de première génération incluant des liens azométhines et études électrochimiques et photophysiques	Conjugated materials are been used in many applications and fundamental research, owing in part to their high degree of conjugation.  They further have opto-electronic properties that are compatible for use as conjugated materials in many devices including solar cells, organic field effect transistors, organic light emitting diodes and electrochromic devices. The latter are of particular interest because their colors that can be changed when a potential is applied. The advantage of these color switching materials compared to other opto-electronic devices is their simple fabrication that can be done under ambient conditions. Electrochromic devices have found many consumer applications including mirrors, tunable windows, camouflage and electronic paper, to name a few examples.  The focus of our research group is the preparation of new conjugated materials based on azomethine. Previous efforts from the group demonstrated that azomethines having the required properties for use in electrochromic devices (electrochemical reversibility and air stability) were possible when using a 2,5-diaminothiophene derivative as a building block.  It was also demonstrated that color tuning of both the neutral and oxidized states was possible when coupling 2,5-diaminothiophene with various heterocyclic arylaldehydes.  Despite the many examples of azomethines studied in our group, fundamental structure-property relationships of these conjugated materials are still not understood. The objective of this thesis was therefore to prepare to new conjugated azomethines from triarylamine aldehydes.  The objective was also to examine the opto-electronic properties of these novel azomethines, including the effect of the degree of conjugation and type of triphenylamine aldehyde precursor on the absorbance, electrochemical properties, and fluorescence.	dopage , fluorescence , triphenylamine , thiophene , azomethine , fluorescence , doping , electrochemistry	en	9743.0
1079	Étude des mécanismes cellulaires activés par l'Angiopoïétine-1 et le VEGF régulant la perméabilité et la migration endothéliales	Angiogenesis is the formation of new blood vessels from a pre-existing vascular network. It is an essential mechanism for many physiological and pathological conditions. Also, the general mechanism in both conditions remains the same. VEGF and its receptor VEGFR-2 have been proven to be specific and critical for blood vessel formation. The Angiopoietin-1 receptor, Tie2, is required for vascular development as well as in tumor angiogenesis. It is known that the activation of Tie2 is required for vascular stabilization by inhibiting vascular permeability induced by VEGFR-2. First, we found that the pro-angiogenic growth factor, Ang-1 counteracts the effects of VEGF-induced permeability by inhibiting NO production by endothelial cells. This inhibitory effect of Tie2 acts directly on eNOS activity. Following activation of Tie2 by Ang-1, eNOS becomes highly phosphorylated on the inhibitory site, the Thr497, following PKCζ phosphorylation and activation. Our results suggest that the inhibition by Tie2 of vascular permeability during angiogenesis is due, in part, to the inhibition of NO production.  In our second study we distinguished between two types of endothelial cell migration induced by Ang-1 and VEGF. At the opposite of Ang-1 that induced collective and directional cell migration, VEGF promoted individual and random cell motility. We identified β-catenin as a new molecular partner of PKCζ. This association of PKCζ with β-catenin brings the Par6-aPKC polarity complex and the adherens junctions complex to interact with each other at two different locations in endothelial cells. PKCζ/β-catenin complex is located specifically at cell-cell contacts to maintain cohesion and cell adhesion necessary for the collective migration process. This complex was located also at the leading edge of endothelial cells during migration to ensure the directionality and the persistence of migration in response to Ang-1. In addition, inhibition of PKCζ or β-catenin switched the migration mode, in response to Ang-1, from directional and collective to a more random and individual cell migration which resembles the type of migration of endothelial cells exposed to VEGF. These results were confirmed in vivo by aberrant cell polarity and cell adhesion defects of tip cell during vascular sprouting of intersegmental vessels in PKCζ deficient zebrafish embryos.  In summary, Ang-1/Tie2 modulates endothelial cell signaling and biological responses induced by VEGF/VEGFR-2. The identification of molecular mechanisms involved in the action of these two receptors, VEGFR-2 and Tie2, and the understanding of the different signaling pathways activated by these molecular complexes will allow us to identify new therapeutic targets for the treatment of angiogenic diseases treatment.

1080	"Alliance Politics in Hybrid Regimes :
Political Stability and Instability since World War II"	The thesis studies stability and instability in hybrid regimes. The research question is: under which conditions the authority of the elites in power is recognized or contested? Our answer rests on the inclusive or exclusive dimension of the ruling coalition: that is, the strategic alliance between the ruling elites and dominant social groups. Inclusion favors consent and stability whereas exclusion favors contention and instability. The composition of the ruling coalition depends on (i) the degree of extra-legal organized violence and (ii) the degree of state penetration over the territory and in the economy. The first variable identifies which social group in the state (military officers) or in the regime (opposition parties) is dominant and influences the forms of political communication with the ruling elites. The second variable identifies which social group in the state (bureaucrats) or in society (local leaders) is dominant and shapes the relation between regions and the center. The thesis contribution is to deepen our understanding of political institutions in hybrid regimes by focusing on the identity of dominant social groups according to a given context. It offers a simple, flexible and original model that allow us to grasp causal relations that would otherwise be counter-intuitive. Hence, political stability is also possible in a country where the state is weak and/or rebellion movements exist; and instability in the opposite context. It all comes down to the composition of the ruling coalition. In order to illustrate the line of reasoning and unfold the richness of our framework, a comparative historical analysis of the ruling coalition in Malaysia (1957-2010), Indonesia (1945-1998), Senegal (1960-2010) and Paraguay (1945-2008) is used. The main conclusion is that the two variables are key. One without the other necessarily amounts to an incomplete explanation of political alliances at stake when dealing with conditions of stability and instability in hybrid regimes.

1081	La responsabilité sociale des multinationales lors de licenciements collectifs	This thesis deals with the examination of the elements of influence and decision-making that can describe and explain the behaviour of a multinational firm, during a mass layoff brought about by a plant closure, as measured using the concept of social responsibility. We take as a starting point the nefarious social and economic consequences of mass layoffs on employees and communities as well as the shortcomings of Quebec labour legislation in this regard. Moreover, we establish the link between the nature of social responsibility from a theoretical point of view and the empirical perspective within the framework of a mass layoff process. To arrive at this conclusion, at a theoretical level, through the ethical criteria defined by Garrett and Klonoski (1986), that is, just cause, mitigation of damages and procedural justice, our research has demonstrated that it is possible to determine the social responsibility of a firm from an empirical point of view within the context of a mass layoff. We have also closely examined various theories describing a firm’s social responsibility before finally adopting an instrumental theory of stakeholders. At the methodological level, we relied upon a single case study, that of the partial closure of the Rio Tinto Alcan plant located in Beauharnois, Quebec.  Moreover, it was possible to categorize the approach adopted by this firm under a theoretical taxonomy of social responsibility, thus producing an integrative approach on two levels, local and corporate, derived from our analysis. At the local level, we identified an ethical perspective related to the personal values of the individuals charged with implementing the necessary mechanisms. At the corporate level, an instrumentalist perspective takes precedence. In this sense, to establish the necessary legitimacy, the multinational firm considers itself accountable to both its shareholders and its financiers as well as to the political level (among them municipal and provincial) in order to have access to the resources it both desires and requires for its operations, from which flows the importance of its corporate image. In the natural resources sector, the type of firm must be taken into account, the role and involvement of the political level being of central importance, given that it allows access to the resources that are essential to the survival of the firm.  The contribution of this research lies mainly in the study of the concept of social responsibility through a significant phenomenon in labour relations, that of mass layoffs. This study also expands the usual theoretical domain of labour relations by taking into account a social responsibility framework that allows for the examination of phenomena through a new angle that reflects the current priorities of multinationals within a context of market openness and the search for legitimacy.

1082	Exposants géométriques des modèles de boucles dilués et idempotents des TL-modules de la chaîne de spins XXZ	"This thesis is concerned with the study of critical phenomena for two-dimensional models on the lattice. Its results are contained in two articles: A first one, devoted to measuring geometric exponents, and a second one to the construction of idempotents for the XXZ spin chain projecting on indecomposable modules of the Temperley-Lieb algebra.  Monte Carlo experiments, for a family of loop models in their dilute phase, are presented in the first article. Coined ""dilute loop models (DLM)"", this family is based upon an O(n) model introduced by Nienhuis (1990). It is defined by two coprime integers p,p' and an anisotropy parameter. In the continuum limit, DLM(p,p') is expected to yield a logarithmic conformal field theory of central charge c(\kappa)=13-6(\kappa+1/\kappa), where the ratio \kappa=p/p' is related to the loop gas fugacity \beta=-2\cos\pi/\kappa. Critical exponents pertaining to valuable geometrical objects, namely the hull, external perimeter and red bonds, were measured. The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, as well as several methods improving its efficiency, are presented. Despite the extrapolation of curves presenting large slopes, values as close as three to four digits from the theoretical predictions were attained through rigorous statistical analysis.  The second article describes the decomposition of the XXZ spin chain Hilbert space \otimes^nC^2 using idempotents. The model of interest (Pasquier & Saleur (1990)) is described by a parameter-dependent Hamiltonian H_{XXZ}(q), q\in C^\times, expressible as a sum of elements of the Temperley-Lieb algebra TL_n(q). The spectrum of H_{XXZ}(q) in the continuum limit is also believed to be related to conformal field theories whose central charge is set by q. Using the quantum Schur-Weyl duality, an expression for the primitive idempotents of End_{TL_n}\otimes^nC^2, involving U_qsl_2 elements, is obtained. These idempotents allow for the explicit construction of the indecomposable TL_n-modules of \otimes^nC^2, all of which are irreducible except when q is a root of unity. This case, and the case where q is generic, are treated separately.  Since a wide variety of results and tools are required to tackle the problems stated above, this thesis contains many introductory chapters. Its layout is as follows. The first chapter introduces theoretical concepts common to both articles, in particular an overview of critical phenomena and conformal field theory. Before proceeding to the article entitled \emph{Geometric Exponents of Dilute Loop Models} constituting Chapter 3, the second chapter deals briefly with logarithmic conformal fields, Schramm-Loewner evolution and the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. The fourth chapter defines some algebraic concepts used in the second article, ""The idempotents of the TL_n-module \otimes^nC^2 in terms of elements of U_qsl_2"" of Chapter 5. A summary of the main results, as well as paths to unexplored questions, are suggested in a final chapter."

1083	Dance and the colonial body : re-choreographing postcolonial theories of the body	Classical texts of postcolonial theory rarely address the embodied expression of dance as they examine the colonial body only through the imperial discourses about the Orient (Said), the construction of the Subaltern subject (Spivak), and the ambivalent desire of the colonial gaze (Bhabha). The Cyprian theorist and dancer Stavros Stavrou Karayanni has emphasised the centrality of dance as a key category of analysis through which discourses of resistance can be articulated from the perspective of the colonial heterosexual and queer body. However, Karayanni adopts the psychoanalytic method according to which the dancing body of the colonised subject has an ambivalent effect upon the Western traveller and / or coloniser who both desires and derides this body.     In contrast to this approach, my study examines dance as a space in which the colonial body choreographs its collective history which colonial amnesia suppresses so as to de-historicise colonised subjects and disfigure their cultures. Departing from Frantz Fanon’s emphasis on the relevance of dance in colonial studies, I argue that the colonial body choreographs its collective memories in dance and prompts us to rethink hegemonic discourses of postcolonial identity formation that revolve around ambivalence and elusiveness. I borrow the notion of “choreographing history” from the Western contemporary discipline of dance studies which has integrated cultural studies since mid 1980s and influenced postcolonial inquiry of dance over the last decade. I include various cultural traditions in my project so as to re-direct today’s predominantly ethnographic research which describes dance as an encoded articulation of culture in specific postcolonial societies. I also include different cultural traditions to show that while choreographing silenced memories in various historical experiences of colonial violence, the dancing body allows us to construct discourses of resistance in ways that postcolonial theory has not addressed before. The re-choreography of postcolonial theories of the body, as developed in this dissertation, articulates an ethical imperative because it shows how the subaltern body not only choreographs memories that colonial amnesia silences but also produces cultural knowledge with a difference.   Methodologically, this study brings together Western and indigenous theories of dance as well as postcolonial theories of the dancing body from both heterosexual and queer perspectives.    My study discusses Susan Foster and André Lepecki’s contemporary theories of dance and the body in the context of postcolonial theories of Oriental dance and eroticism.  It also examines the socially and politically transformative potential of the erotic in dance through textual and cinematic representations of the body.  My study equally opens a dialogue between Western and indigenous theories of dance in the context of Canadian indigenous literary work of Tomson Highway.  A critical examination of Trinidad Carnival and Calypso in a novel by Earl Lovelace demonstrates that dance is a central paradigm of analysis for a postcolonial critique of the body and the categories of identity that inscribe it.

1084	The dismembered family : youth, memory, and modernity in rural southern Chile	This thesis tells a story of the supposed loss of political and citizen culture in post-dictatorship Chile. Focusing on the learning of civic behaviour among the country’s youngest political generation, now in its twenties, I question the taken-for-granted nature of this sense of loss. Given that members of this generation were either children or not yet born at the time of the 1990 democratic transition, they have largely learned from others about recent state repression and democratic reconciliation. This is amplified in sectors of the rural South, where much of what younger generations know about the conflicted past, including colonialism, revolutionary socialism, and fascism, has not been communicated through deliberate or verbal instruction, but transmitted indirectly as cultural tastes and habits that nevertheless influence political decisions. Through analysis of inter-generational transmissions of perspectives on the contested past, this thesis explores micro-level processes by which certain kinds of political behaviour are learned within families and small community networks. These are often in tension with lessons transmitted in public domains, such as in schools and among civic associations. Such tensions raise important questions about uneven membership in the national community, especially in a neoliberal era in which the restructuring of social services and of control over natural resources have transformed relationships between the rural poor and dominant society emanating from urban centres.  Among Chile’s youngest political generation, in what ways do situated understandings of the contested past and its impacts on the current distribution of power in the country, shape budding political identities? I broach this question through ethnographic analysis of the means by which youth acquire and express knowledge about history and its lingering influence on civic life today. Observations draw on over two years of anthropological fieldwork in three localities of the southern countryside impacted by industrial interventions in nearby rivers. These include the contamination of one from a pulp mill, and the proposed hydroelectric damming and diversion of several others. Industrial activities offer backdrops for assessing emergent political identities, as well as for identifying what the learning of political behaviour communicates about citizenship in Chile today.

1085	Variations circadiennes du syndrome d’impatiences musculaires de l’éveil (SIME ou RLS – restless legs syndrome)	A close temporal relationship was shown between the onset of melatonin secretion at night and the worsening of restless legs syndrome (RLS) symptoms, suggesting that melatonin may play a role in the genesis of this phenomenon. Thus, we studied the effects of the administration of exogenous melatonin and the suppression of endogenous melatonin secretion by bright light exposure on the severity of RLS symptoms.   Eight RLS subjects were studied in three conditions: at baseline, after administration of melatonin and during bright light exposure. The severity of RLS symptoms was assessed by the Suggested Immobilization Test (SIT), which allows quantification of both sensory and motor manifestations (SIT-PLM – periodic leg movements) of RLS.  Analyses showed a significant increase of SIT-PLM index when subjects received exogenous melatonin compared to both baseline and bright light conditions, but bright light exposure had no effect on leg movements compared to the baseline condition. Analyses also revealed a small but significant decrease in sensory symptoms with bright light exposure compared to baseline.  Although that exogenous melatonin may have a detrimental effect on motor symptoms, the augmentation of endogenous secretion during the evening is insufficient to explain the variations of the severity of the RLS symptoms.

1086	The Andhra Pradesh Microfinance Crisis and American Payday Lending: Two Studies in Vulnerability	Microcredit, a non-profit lending approach that is often championed as a source of women’s inclusion and empowerment, has in the past decade been followed by microfinance, a forprofit sibling of a different temperament. Microfinance in India is now in turmoil, precipitated by legislation in the state of Andhra Pradesh, which has encouraged withholding of payment, which in turn has frozen the market. This paper considers one precipitating condition of the crisis: the remarkable, new, and developing burden of formal economic debt that poor women in the state have only recently come to hold – debt that now surpasses one year’s family income, on average. The development of this lending sector follows upon innovation in lending to the poor of the global north over the past two decades, and the practices show noteworthy parallels. Both lending schemes have produced similar disproportionate burdens upon some low-status individuals within their respective economic orders, and both may exploit a vulnerability that is born of aspiration and produces great dysfunction for borrowers. This paper introduces the two lending schemes, sketches the parallels, and introduces the claim that ethical finance arrangements for the poor require attention to vulnerability, an under-utilized category in both liberal ethical theory and in finance.

1087	Exploitation as a Path to Development: Sweatshop Labour, Micro-Unfairness, and the Non-Worseness Claim	Sweatshop labour is sometimes defended from critics by arguments that stress the voluntariness of the worker’s choice, and the fact that sweatshops provide a source of income where no other similar source exists. The idea is if it is exploitation—as their opponents charge—it is mutually beneficial and consensual exploitation. This defence appeals to the non-worseness claim (NWC), which says that if exploitation is better for the exploited party than neglect, it cannot be seriously wrong. The NWC renders otherwise exploitative—and therefore morally wrong—transactions permissible, making the exploitation of the global poor a justifiable path to development. In this paper, I argue that the use of NWC for the case of sweatshops is misleading. After reviewing and strengthening the exploitation claims made concerning sweatshops, most importantly by refuting certain allegations that a micro-unfairness account of exploitation cannot evaluate sweatshop labour as exploitative, I then argue that even if this practice may seem permissible due to benefits otherwise unavailable to the global poor, there remains a duty to address the background conditions that make this form of wrong-doing possible, which the NWC cannot accommodate. I argue that the NWC denies this by unreasonably limiting its scope and is therefore incomplete, and ultimately unconvincing.

1088	Identifying the direct effects of ammonia on the brain	Elevated concentrations of ammonia in the brain as a result of hyperammonemia leads to cerebral dysfunction involving a spectrum of neuropsychiatric and neurological symptoms (impaired memory, shortened attention span, sleep-wake inversions, brain edema, intracranial hypertension, seizures, ataxia and coma). Many studies have demonstrated ammonia as a major player involved in the neuropathophysiology associated with liver failure and inherited urea cycle enzyme disorders. Ammonia in solution is composed of a gas (NH(3)) and an ionic (NH(4) (+)) component which are both capable of crossing plasma membranes through diffusion, channels and transport mechanisms and as a result have a direct effect on pH. Furthermore, NH(4) (+) has similar properties as K(+) and, therefore, competes with K(+) on K(+) transporters and channels resulting in a direct effect on membrane potential. Ammonia is also a product as well as a substrate for many different biochemical reactions and consequently, an increase in brain ammonia accompanies disturbances in cerebral metabolism. These direct effects of elevated ammonia concentrations on the brain will lead to a cascade of secondary effects and encephalopathy.

1089	Induction of astrocytic cyclooxygenase-2 in epileptic patients with hippocampal sclerosis	Induction of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) has been described in a wide range of neurological diseases including animal models of epilepsy. The present study was undertaken to assess COX-2 expression in hippocampal biopsies from patients with therapy-refractive temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). For this purpose, hippocampal CA1 subfield was dissected from epileptic patients with (n=5) or without (n=2) hippocampal sclerosis (HS). COX-2 expression was investigated using immunohistochemistry and semi-quantitative RT-PCR. COX-2 immunoreactivity in TLE patient material in the absence of HS was restricted to a few neurons of the hippocampus. In the presence of HS, on the other hand, a significant induction of astrocytic COX-2 immunoreactivity associated with a concomitant increase in the steady-state level of COX-2 mRNA was observed in the CA1 subfield. These findings suggest that induction of astrocytic COX-2 is implicated in the pathogenesis of HS in TLE and is consistent with the previous findings of increased concentrations of prostaglandins in the cerebrospinal fluid of these patients.

1090	Neuropathological changes in the brain of pigs with acute liver failure	Abstract Objective. Cerebral edema is a serious complication of acute liver failure (ALF), which may lead to intracranial hypertension and death. An accepted tenet has been that the blood-brain barrier is intact and that brain edema is primarily caused by a cytotoxic etiology due to hyperammonemia. However, the neuropathological changes in ALF have been poorly studied. Using a well characterized porcine model we aimed to investigate ultrastructural changes in the brain from pigs suffering from ALF. Materials and methods. Sixteen female Norwegian Landrace pigs weighing 27-35 kg were randomised into two groups: ALF (n = 8) and sham operated controls (n = 8). ALF was induced with an end-to-side portacaval shunt followed by ligation of the hepatic arteries. Biopsies were harvested from three different areas of the brain (frontal lobe, cerebellum, and brain stem) following eight hours of ALF and analyzed using electron microscopy. Results. Profound perivascular and interstitial edema were found in all three areas. Disruption of pericytic and astrocytic processes were seen, reflecting breakdown/lesion of the blood-brain barrier in animals suffering from ALF. Furthermore, neurons and axons were edematous and surrounded by vesicles. Severe damage to Purkinje neuron (necrosis) and damaged myelin were seen in the cerebellum and brain stem, respectively. Biopsies from sham operated animals were normal. Conclusions. Our data support the concept that vasogenic brain edema plays an important role in the development of intracranial hypertension in pigs with ALF.

1091	Limited capacity for ammonia removal by brain in chronic liver failure: potential role of nitric oxide	Chronic liver failure leads to hyperammonemia and consequently increased brain ammonia concentrations, resulting in hepatic encephalopathy. When the liver fails to regulate ammonia concentrations, the brain, devoid of a urea cycle, relies solely on the amidation of glutamate to glutamine through glutamine synthetase, to efficiently clear ammonia. Surprisingly, under hyperammonemic conditions, the brain is not capable of increasing its capacity to remove ammonia, which even decreases in some regions of the brain. This non-induction of glutamine synthetase in astrocytes could result from possible limiting substrates or cofactors for the enzyme, or an indirect effect of ammonia on glutamine synthetase expression. In addition, there is evidence that nitration of the enzyme resulting from exposure to nitric oxide could also be implicated. The present review summarizes these possible factors involved in limiting the increase in capacity of glutamine synthetase in brain, in chronic liver failure.

1092	Portacaval anastomosis-induced hyperammonemia does not lead to oxidative stress	Ammonia is neurotoxic and believed to play a major role in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy (HE). It has been demonstrated, in vitro and in vivo, that acute and high ammonia treatment induces oxidative stress. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are highly reactive and can lead to oxidization of proteins resulting in protein damage. The present study was aimed to assess oxidative status of proteins in plasma and brain (frontal cortex) of rats with 4-week portacaval anastomosis (PCA). Markers of oxidative stress, 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) and carbonylation were evaluated by immunoblotting in plasma and frontal cortex. Western blot analysis did not demonstrate a significant difference in either HNE-linked or carbonyl derivatives on proteins between PCA and sham-operated control rats in both plasma and frontal cortex. The present study suggests PCA-induced hyperammonemia does not lead to systemic or central oxidative stress.

1093	Intervention infirmière brève auprès de familles dont un proche présente un délirium suite à une chirurgie cardiaque	Introduction : Delirium is a neuropsychiatric disorder affecting 47% of cardiac surgery patients. This complication results in higher postoperative morbidity and mortality rates. In addition to its many consequences on the patient’s condition, delirium also affects family caregivers: three-quarters report feelings of severe anxiety during an episode, and helplessness in relation to their ability to provide support to the delirious patient. The lack of evidence on family caregivers’ needs and effective interventions limits the support that can be provided by the nursing staff. In response to this increasingly problematic situation, we tested a personalized intervention with family caregivers of cardiac surgery patients as part of a Master’s degree project.  Method : Semi-structured interviews, inspired by the Calgary Model for Family Intervention (Wright & Leahey, 2009), were conducted to enhance our understanding of their needs during the delirium episode as well as the support they desired from the nursing staff. The student then provided a short and personalized intervention based on the needs expressed by the family caregivers during the interview. The effect of the intervention was assessed one to two weeks following the interview to collect the families’ impressions of the project. A clinical tool was developed from a comprehensive literature review combined with suggestions from the family caregivers who were interviewed. This tool has been validated by nurses expert in the field of family intervention and in cardiac surgery related delirium, as well as nurses working on the units where the project took place. Conclusion : Family caregivers are important allies in the prevention, detection, and management of delirium. This project is expected to guide nurses’ interventions aimed at offering adequate support to family caregivers of delirious cardiac surgery patients.

While the incidence of allergic disease has expanded at an alarming rate, efforts to ensure that allergy sufferers have access to adequate allergy treatments are far from universal; global inequalities in access to essential allergy medications are demonstrative of this fact. The ramifications due to these inequalities are broad and numerous. This case study shows that global inequalities in the provision of allergy drugs are pertinent to one particular context involving refugee claimants.	allergie , allergy , refugee , essential medicines , public health , ethics	en	9237.0
1099	Le bon air et la bonne grâce : attitudes et gestes de la figure noble dans l’art européen (1661-1789)	This thesis concerns the characteristic gestures and attitudes of the aristocratic figure in European art between 1661 and 1789. This period corresponds to the lifetime of a noble bodily ideal named “le bon air” and “la bonne grâce”, from its formulation at Louis XIV’s court and hegemonic propagation until its decline with the French Revolution. A panoply of means (exercises, orthopaedic instruments…) have been invented by the Ancien Régime society to embody a grace that should appear inborn and testify to noble birth. The dancing-master enjoyed the monopoly of inculcating this grace and elaborating it in accordance with highly aesthetic criteria. Most of the bon air and bonne grâce gestures and postures are here catalogued, described and associated with their original connotative values, showing that a deep and meticulous knowledge of body techniques can sharpen our understanding of a great proportion of Early Modern artworks.  The author agues that this bodily habitus transcended every field concerned with the noble body (education, theatre, dance, opera, martial arts…) and came to infiltrate most pictorial genres, challenging age-old artistic traditions and imposing itself as a modern alternative to the grace of the Ancients.  Portraiture, fashion plates, porcelain figurines, city and garden landscapes were the most affected by this phenomenon. Bonne grâce thus affirmed itself in a visual culture, which in return reinforced the very social practices that mirrored. The circular migration of aristocratic gestures between life and art caused a standardisation of both aristocratic body and figure. Within pastoral, history painting and genre scenes, the aristocratic ideal reveals itself antithetically in the figure of the peasant, the Pierrot and the Harlequin, and idealistically in those of the gallant shepherd and gallant hero. The substitution of emphatic gestures and strong facial expressions for ones based on restraint and dissimulation gave birth to a new historia that was less legible, but more subtle and suggestive, in accordance with aristocratic taste and sensibility.

1100	Estimation des corrélations phylogénétiques entre paramètres d'évolution moléculaire et Traits d'histoire de vie	In recent years, molecular evolution seeks to characterize the variation and intensity of selection through the ratio between non-synonymous and synonymous substitution rates (dN/dS). The dN/dS measure was either used to study the history of the variation of the intensity of selection over time or to detect episodes of positive selection. Correlations between selection and variations of the effective population size interfere in these measurements. The Comparative method can measure correlations between quantitative traits along a phylogeny. They are also be used to test hypotheses of correlated evolution of life history traits, like the body mass, and the substitution rate. We propose an approach combining the comparative method based on the principle of independent contrasts and a model of molecular evolution in a Bayesian probabilistic framework. By integrating along a phylogeny both ancestral reconstructions of lines and of dN/dS we estimate the covariance among traits and between traits and parameters of the model of molecular evolution. A hierarchical model was implemented in the software coevol published during this master. This model allows the simultaneous analysis of multiple genes within a single model. Parallel calculations allow increasing the size of the model to the genome scale. We studied placental mammals, where many complete genomes and phenotypic measurements are available. Based on theories of life history traits, our method is expected to characterize the association of groups of genes in biological processes related to the studied phenotypes.

1101	Amplitude de mouvement du coude, développement d’une méthode de mesure radiographique et identification des facteurs influents	The most commonly used instrument for elbow range of motion measurement is the universal goniometer. However great controversy remains regarding its reliability and validity. Hence this study presents an accurate and precise alternative: a radiographic method of measurement. The limits of the radiographic method and potential sources of error were first evaluated through a biomechanical study. Fifty-one volunteers then participated in a clinical study in which this radiographic method was compared to the goniometer for elbow range of motion measurement. Finally, the great precision of radiographic measurements allowed us to study the potential influence of various demographic and anthropometric factors on elbow range of motion in the last part of this work. Regarding the clinical study, the goniometric and radiographic methods differ but they correlate. The goniometer’s measurement error was ±10.3° during extension measurement and ±7.0 ° for flexion. Secondly, the radiographic method provides consistent results despite malpositioning of the upper limb during radiographic image acquisition and easily preventable sources of error were identified. The study finally found an association between the range of motion and various factors, including age, sex, BMI, and the arm and forearm circumferences. In conclusion, error associated with the use of the goniometer could be tolerated in a clinical setting, the instrument being both inexpensive and simple to use. However, its use is discouraged in the research context, where a measurement error of 10° is unacceptable. The radiographic method, being more precise and accurate, represents a much better alternative.	Range of motion , Elbow , Goniometry , Radiography , Mobility	en	9224.0
1102	La paix adjar	Between 1989 and 1994, two civil conflicts occurred in Georgia together with major political violence. South Ossetia and Abkhazia, two of the three regions with autonomous status within Soviet Georgia, are the scene of these conflicts. Clashes are otherwise avoided in the case of Adjaria, the third region with an autonomous status. The reasons of this relative adjar peace are not obvious at first glance, especially when considering the chaotic situation in which Georgia is at the time of the USSR collapse.  It seems appropriate then to further address the Georgian region of Adjaria, a region that certainly has experienced strong tensions with the newly independent Georgian state, although without turning into an open conflict. Because of the similarity between Abkhazia and Adjaria, the geopolitical arguments, or those concerning institutional structures, can only provide a partial explanation. It is rather an argument based on identity and putting forward relations between groups that appears to be determinant to explain the absence of conflict in Adjaria.

1103	La notion de placage chez Daryush Shayegan : la hiérarchisation des épistémès au service du néo-orientalisme	In this thesis, we present the notion of grafting developed by DaryushShayegan. In an inter-epistemic space, grafting links two heteromorphic epistemes (tradition and modernity). As both epistemes cannot be equated to one another without first diluting them, any overlapping characteristics that might emerge will be distorted. By assuming the guise of hermenauts, we strip to the core the structures of the text that define the notion of grafting. We then examine the “non-clear implications”, the author’s preconceived notions that permeate the text. This process forces us to define the notions of paradigm (Kuhn) and of episteme (Foucault), and to grasp how the author utilizes them to construct the notion of grafting. In the second part, we discuss about hierarchical relations between both epistemes. Even though DaryushShayegan’s position contains elements of neo-orientalism, we see that the rhizomic and traditionalist approaches dissolve the problem at hand.	tradition , rhizome , Daryush Shayegan , grafting , episteme , neo-orentalism , hermeneutic , Islamism , modernity , rhizome	en	9217.0
1104	Organisation moléculaire dirigée par le groupe CONH2 en 2D et 3D	Our study involves the design, synthesis and structural analysis of supramolecular architectures obtained by self-assembly, based on the concepts of molecular tectonics. This branch of supramolecular chemistry explores the properties of molecules called tectons,from the Greek word tectos, meaning builder. Tectons typically incorporate sites of recognition connected to well-chosen skeletons with defined geometries. The sites of recognition, oriented by the geometry of the skeleton, can participate in intermolecular interactions that are sufficiently strong and directional to control the topology of the resulting assembly. This strategy is thereby based on self-assembly processes involving reversible interactions between tectons. Self-assembly directed by strong directional intermolecular interactions is widely used to produce materials whose components must be positioned in three dimensions (3D) in a predictable way. This strategy can also be used to control molecular association in two dimensions (2D), thereby allowing the construction of predictably organized and predetermined nanopatterns on various surfaces, such as graphite.Our work has focused on the behavior of the amide groups as primary sites of intermolecular interaction. These groups are analogues of carboxyl groups, which have been widely used in previous studies of directed molecular assembly. We have studied the 3D and 2D association of compounds with flat cores designed to favor the formation of sheets and to facilitate adsorption on graphite, modified by the addition of amide groups to promote the formation of intermolecular hydrogen bonds. The ability of these compounds to form predictably ordered 2D nanopatterns has been examined by scanning tunneling microscopy, and their organization in 3D has also been investigated by X-ray crystallography. In our study, we have systematically altered molecular geometry and other parameters to examine their effect on molecular organization. Our results suggest that combined structural analyses in 2D and 3D are an important asset in the effort to understand why molecules aggregate in particular ways and how these preferences can be altered by underlying surfaces.

1105	Estereotipo, frontera y género : una lectura negociada de tres cintas de la India María	Played by María Elena Velasco since the late 1960s, La India María brings to life an “authentic” indigenous woman who despite her social standing and limitations, denounces the treatment of institutions to which she’s subjected: the political, judicial, economic, and religious systems. However, since her first appearances in theaters, critics have focused more on superficial aspects of her performance, judging that indigenous peoples and Mexico were represented in a reactionary way. Since the beginning of the 1990s, researchers have proposed a “negotiated” reading of her movies: they paid attention to the effects Velasco’s humorous performance and adventures had on her audience, but they also recognized the ambiguity of the character and storylines, all the while stressing the ethnic and class discourses. Through the analysis of Tonta, tonta pero no tanto (Foolish, Foolish But Not so Much) by Fernando Cortés (1972), Ni de aquí ni de allá (Neither From Here nor From There) by María Elena Velasco (1988), and Sor Tequila (Sister Tequila) by Rogelio González (1977), my thesis contributes to this reading by studying three subjects: the stereotype as represented by this character, in order to show how it criticizes Mexican society; the new cultural challenges that the Neoliberal system presents to indigenous peoples; and the transformation of masculine gender models and the public through an alternative construction of feminine gender models.

1106	Archipel suivi de L'étrangère en son royaume : la psyché du lieu chez Marguerite Duras	Through short accounts, the narrator reconstitutes the past of a family. The main character, a young girl, is the narrator attempting to trace the events which led to the break-up of her family cell. Seeking to distance herself from this past, she delivers the auto-biographical story using the third person. The little girl has grown up, and the narrator she has become attempts to reclaim her heritage: the possibility of writing this story.     In Marguerite Duras’ work, the presence of surroundings is often solicited to participate in narrating the events. In La pute de la côte normande and Écrire, two auto-biographical works written in the first person, the places evoked are those sheltering her everyday life. Those are revealing of the author’s psychology and intertwine with the concern of writing. Marguerite Duras, her surroundings and her writing style become bound to one another by the author’s language, which reveals the void caused by her father’s death.

1107	Espace urbain et identité : l’imaginaire de la ville comme symptôme de la crise identitaire dans l’oeuvre d’Orhan Pamuk	"Istanbul is for Pamuk what Paris is for Baudelaire: an inexhaustible source of inspiration and spleen. But, if the French poet is more conscious of his states of mind, the most widely read contemporary Turkish novelist seems at first to deliberately disregard the fact that any discourse on the external world is also a discourse about himself. At first, in emulation of other Turkish novelists, Pamuk seems to thoroughly enjoy mapping the hüzün, the much talked about collective feeling of melancholy, reputed to be intrinsic to the city and its ruins. Nevertheless, as soon as Pamuk starts to follow in the footsteps of foreign writers and artists who have visited Istanbul, he notices that the apparent melancholy of the ruins is only one layer among many fluid layers. While following the tracks of the otherness, Pamuk discovers the heterogeneous character of his city but also of himself and notices that the collective melancholy widely accepted by most his compatriots is fabricated by a certain socio-political narrative, within a specific social class. Indeed, by tracking the reflections of his own imaginative twin, the novelist is suddenly aware of the elusiveness of his own subjectivity but also of the world and the others. If such is the case, the urban space that preoccupies and obsesses Pamuk is only a reflection of his mind and the will to fully access to the presence, is nothing but an illusion. As if the disturbing uncanny of his unconscious, by revealing the elusive side of the world and the self, encourages Pamuk to challenge a number of views and opinions taken for granted, inside his own culture but also inside the culture of the other, his European twin. For, if everything is fluid and malleable, there is no reason not to question everything, including tradition and state politics, the latter making him, ""a person well more political, serious and responsible that I am and ever whished to be"". Thus, Istanbul: memoires and the city questions the relationship between the subjectivity and the heterogeneous layers of Istanbul in order to come to a deconstructionist conclusion: everything is a substitute; there is a general absence of sense. If the city lacks a tangible raison d’être or sense in its history and topography, then it must be the same in places that are far from Istanbul. Thus central characters in The House of the Silence question not only the very foundation of their identity and subjectivity, but also the relationship between tradition and modernity, center and periphery, East and West, not to mention the destructive and ephemeral nature of time and space. In Pamuk’s most recent novel, The Museum of Innocence, the protagonist engages in an even more obsessive and destructive quest for another kind of space and time — an imaginary in-between space allowing for a seamless traffic between reality and fiction, East and West, and tradition and modernity. This in-between space or identity clearly anchors Pamuk among the most interesting postmodern novelists of our time. But, this in-between positionality, however, can only be attained at a price: Pamuk’s work, illuminating insight or a precarious balance is more often than not achieved through the sacrifice of the female figure."

1108	Action collective patronale : les mécanismes de diffusion entre les niveaux sectoriel et local	This research focuses on employer collective action to this day little studied in North America. Yet, this actor is highly organized in Quebec and has an influence on public policies and industrial relations. This research aims to gain a better understanding on employer’s logic action and the areas where they exert their influence.  Most important, the research questions the diffusion mechanisms used by employer’s organizations to transmit orientations and guidelines to adopt by their members. Like the unions who has to develop their representative capacity (Dufour, Hege, Levesque and Murray, 2009), we believe it should be the same for the employers. Notably, this research wants to understand how the employers’ organizations makes sure that their members adopt practices related to the positions defended in labor market institutions and in the area of public’s policies.   Our research question is the following one: What are the mechanisms developed by employers’ organizations to diffuse their orientations about public’s policies and labor relations on the local managing practices of their members?   On the theoretical plan, this research is based on ideas developed by neo-institutionalism theories for a better explanation of how the actors used the institutions in place to shape the rules to their best interests, what points to a representative capacity and coherence in the actions between the levels where the employer is present.  We are looking to understand how the employers’ organizations can coordinate the employers’ actions in reaction to the transformations in the institutional environment. The employers’ organizations are institutional entrepreneurs (Crouch, 2005) who are actively researching opportunities and power leverage to use to maximize their members’ interests and by the same occasion reduce the uncertainty issued from the environment (Campbell, 2004; Streeck et Thelen, 2005; Crouch, 2005).  Still on the theoretical plan, this research is based on the ideas proposed by the logic of action sociology. This theoretical approach allows us to account for local and sectorial levels where the employers’ behaviors are rooted. On sectorial level, there is a plurality of instances who contributed to shape the logic of action of employers’ organizations. The logic of action sociology considered the employer organization as a group with a distinct life and a functional autonomy. The influence capacity of the organization depends on the coordination mechanisms used to generate agreement within the group. The coordination mechanisms should allow a regular and stable connection between the organization and their members.  This research is interested by the employers’ organization that uses a set of means to diffuse the privileged orientations to the enterprises members.   On the empirical plan, this research targets three objectives: (1) To gain a better understanding of the employers organizations forms in the Quebec mining sector;  (2) obtain a better understanding of the structure and the logic of action of the employers organizations on the public policies, labor relations and labor market and finally, (3) to attain a better understanding of the mechanisms developed by the employers organizations to diffuse their orientations on the managing local practices of their members.   In order to meet our research objectives, we used a qualitative research methodology; the case study of the Quebec mining industry was used. This method was processed in three steps; the preparation, the data collection and the interpretation (Merriam, 1998). Data for this research was collected during the winter of 2012 from interviews with mining enterprises managers and mining association managers. A qualitative analysis of the interview content was made and linked to the literature review and our research propositions. To this end, we used the patterns matching Yin (1994). This allowed us to compare our observations with our research propositions.  In terms of results, we found that employers' associations in the mining sector in Quebec endorse further the role of spokesman for the industry to the government rather than service developer to members.  Actions of employers' association takes place at all levels of the decision making process to ensure the best possible promotion of employers interests. Political representation is the most important field of activity which composes the logic action of employers' associations in the Quebec mining sector. It is important to note also that the representation of business interests with the public and media is also vital to employers’ collective action in the interests of social acceptability.  Employers' associations will mainly try to influence industrial relations practices that ensure a better image of the industry and are prioritized based on the institutional context in place.  Research has allowed us to observe a positive and significant impact on the diffusion capacity for five of the seven diffusion mechanisms composing our analysis model.  Three of these five mechanisms promote downward diffusion capacity (transposition of the logic of sectoral action of members on local practices) and the other two tend to favor the upward diffusion capacity (transposition of local issues judged a priority on the sectors logic action).  Mechanisms that better supports cohesion within the organization are those that involve a dynamic relationship between representatives and members and between members themselves thus demonstrating the relevance of a downward and upward diffusion direction.  It should be noted that since this research is a case study, there is some methodological limits specifically in the generalization of the results. It is hard to state that the results of this micro-analysis are generalized regarded to the specificities of the case study. On the other hand, the analysis helped to the elaboration of a model that can be used for future studies.

1109	L’évolution de l’évaluation de la composante linguistique de la compétence à écrire par le ministère de l’Éducation : une étude longitudinale sur les épreuves uniques de 5e secondaire	This research aims to describe the ways in which the evaluation of written French has evolved within the “épreuves unique” of secondary 5. More specifically, it analyzes the evolution of evaluation methods regarding written language conventions in these examinations. A documentary research has allowed us to collect examinations and other related documents for a time span stretching from 1971 to 2012. Although our study specifically looks into the “épreuves uniques”, which were implanted in 1986, we have chosen to go back further in time in order to depict a larger portrait of certificate evaluation of French writing in secondary 5. Many aspects are analyzed: context of examinations, tasks contained within them, scoring parameters and pass levels regarding language conventions, examinations as a whole as well as writing and the French language. We have also observed the province-wide evolution of students’ results for these examinations. Using a variety of theoretical concepts related to the evaluation of written language conventions, a methodology was developed in order to allow the analysis of writing assignments. The latter notably reveals that the nature of such tasks and their parameters have remained relatively constant in time, particularly since 1986. The number of allowed language-related mistakes has augmented, whereas students’ results have remained stable. Furthermore, the historic perspective of this study illustrates how the ministère de l’Éducation nowadays allows a great importance to writing and the correction of spelling mistakes.	ministère de l’Éducation , secondary 5 , writing , writing evaluation , language conventions , French	en	9169.0
1110	Réflexion sociologique sur des problèmes d’éducation, de l’apprentissage des normes et des valeurs à l’invention culturelle chez les enfants du primaire	Discussing educational problems in sociology is difficult without once again defining expressions such as « socialisation », « norms », « values » and without considering the relationships between the past and the future nor questioning the sociologists’ role in society. Our work intends to expose the debates regarding these delicate questions while suggesting other ideas that may further develop the reflection on that matter. Thus, through a field study involving primary school children, we shall bring forth what we label as cultural issues which solving depends on the human innovation capacity. Considering unwholesome practices hazardous to innovation’s development, we shall reflect upon the conditions for the safeguard of the human social life.	norms , social issues	en	9159.0
1111	"Pauvreté des familles monoparentales.
Le Canada et le Québec dans l’univers des régimes providentiels"	Single parent poverty has long been a significant challenge for policy makers in developed countries. Some societies have been more effective than others at developing policy regimes that provide conditions more favourable to families regardless of their status (single parent or two-parent families). As a result, the circumstances and experiences of single parent families tend to vary considerably from state to state.  This thesis seeks to better understand the role of welfare state in mediating the relationship between poverty and single parenthood. The circumstances of single parenthood depend on three welfare pillars: the state, the market and the family. Some societies place emphasis on the role of the state, while others favour the market. In other cases, the family is considered to be primarily responsible for individual well being.  The combination that best protects single parent families is not always clear. If governments are too generous, families may become dependent on welfare and public assistance programs. In a liberal context, incentives to work that target single parents tend to reduce this dependence, but simply finding a job doesn’t always provide a route out of poverty and financial vulnerability. At the same time, family supports often turn out to be more limited and transitory than most families need. What, then, is the best combination that permits single parents to maintain an autonomous household that is neither poor nor overly dependent on one welfare pillar?  In order to examine this question, we present a series of international and interprovincial comparisons using data from the Luxembourg Income Study (LIS). We explore differences in single and dual-parent family poverty outcomes among several high income nations. We place particular emphasis on how the welfare policies of Quebec compare to other members of the World of Welfare Regimes.   Our results show that single parent poverty is greatest in societies that allow well-being to depend most heavily on the market. It is greatest also in societies that offer state provisions that consist of mainly allowances and that neglect other sources of well-being. We find that certain regimes provide a good combination of welfare pillars that support families, which in turn result in lower poverty levels among single-parent families.  While Quebec, like the rest of Canada place more emphasis on market than state pillar, it structures its state supports in such a way that it actually encourages greater labour market participation and amplifies the benefits of market resources for single parents. But in the same time, Quebec reports some of the lowest single parent poverty rates in the nation. In contrast, a high proportion of working single parent families in some other countries and the rest of Canada confront a high risk of poverty.   When we consider part-time work, we find that single parents in Quebec are poorly protected and are at a higher risk of poverty. Yet some societies, particularly the Netherlands, have managed to use part-time work as a strategic tool to find a balance between work and family activities, where a very high proportion of single parents are working part-time jobs with low risk of poverty.

1112	Exploring the politics of intergroup accommodation in Kenya’s vernacular radios during the 2007/08 conflicts	For many years, Kenya gave the impression of a relatively stable nation-state within the turbulent sub-Saharan Africa and a suitable hub from which the international community extends its missions to parts of Africa such as the Great Lakes Region (Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda, DR Congo, Kenya and Tanzania) and the Horn of Africa (Kenya, Somalia, Ethiopia Djibouti and Uganda). However, the highly disputed presidential elections in 2007 and the upheaval that followed prompted concern about Kenya’s stability in the wake of global insecurity. While the healing process is underway, challenges of intergroup accommodation persist, as Kenya counts about forty-two distinct ethno-linguistic groups. Also, the International Criminal Court (ICC) recently brought criminal proceedings against four of the six alleged masterminds of the 2007/08 conflicts, adding to the challenges of intergroup cohesion ahead of the next general elections.  This dissertation examines the politics of intergroup accommodation in Kenya’s vernacular radios and how they influenced intergroup relations in the events leading to the 2007/08 conflicts. Considering conflict as a communicative process, it builds on Azar’s (1990) theory of Protracted Social Conflicts (PSC) by integrating media framing not only to unpack the discourses that surrounded the framing of the 2007/08 conflicts, but also to uncover attitudinal shifts that characterized intergroup relations prior to, during, and after this particular conflict. The study mainly borrows from qualitative methods to collect data from three distinct ethno-linguistic regions in Kenya: Nyeri (Kikuyu majority), Kisumu (Luo Majority) and Eldoret (Kalenjin majority).  The central argument of this dissertation is that the framing of conflicts by vernacular radios can either be differentiated or concerted, and this depends on the stage at which a given conflict manifests itself. While in differentiated framing, media narratives are negotiated in terms of negative competition likely to reinforce divisive or rebellious attitudes, concerted framing underpins the framing process whereby media discourses are articulated in a manner that underlines shared ideals that cut across intergroup allegiances, and thus may strengthen collaborative attitudes. I argue that the shifts in vernacular radio narratives occur when new elements are added to the already existing conflict frames and the kinds of “new meaning” they generate with regard to conflict processes.  I also argue that the shifts from differentiated framing to concerted framing (and vice-versa) also hinge on the degree to which the proposed frames resonate with the appeals and expectations of the target population. Overall, the study argues that the language of broadcast and cultural proximity drive the framing of intergroup relations in Kenya’s vernacular radios, particularly in situations of conflict or competition. The strength of this dissertation lies in the analytical viewpoints that it proposes to locate the shifting perspectives in conflict situations, especially in multiethnic states where the politics of intergroup accommodation are fragile and situational.

1113	Corps, pouvoir et douleur chronique : récits de vie de danseurs et de danseuses professionnels	The methodological starting point of this research was participant observation of a patient with «chronic pain» who was being seen for therapy through qigong. The patient’s frequent statements regarding situations of conflict with the family, the employer or doctors led me to consider the similarity between the symptoms described, the uses of the body and mental attitudes related to a mechanistic, dualistic representation of the body. Marcel Mauss was the first to address this relationship between the uses of the body and societal and cultural paradigms. At a time deeply marked by the automation of businesses and services, the dematerialization of documents and the tyranny of new technologies, «chronic pain» calls into question the uses of the contemporary body in a working world based on performance and productivity. The aim of this research is to examine how «chronic pain» may be a symptom of contemporary aporias that go far beyond the sphere of medicine and how it may be «the weapon of the weak» in a context of oppression (Scott, 1985). Ultimately, this research examines Michel Foucault’s statement that «we all have power in our bodies» (1987: 27). The collected life narratives of professional dancers, who were approached because of their ability to describe their feelings, avoid the tendency to relegate to the realm of the psyche whatever cannot be demonstrably proven. The strong credibility of the acccounts makes it possible to better document a complex phenomenon marred by a great many a priori and reveal the dynamics of power at work in a profession that, more than any other, confronts the limits of the body in the exercise of its art. A genealogical approach to these stories of pain and their examination side-by-side allowed me to identify the habits of endurance and rejection of medication and how they influenced the evolution of the pain. A more detailed analysis of the six healed one’s narratives shows that while power is exercised on a body perceived as docile, it may also be reversed to support a recovery at the cost of an insurrection of buried knowledge that is universal but «subjugated» and a change of paradigm. Thus, a better understanding of «chronic pain» makes it possible to envisage its reversibility and a social reintegration, with or without a career change, on the condition that we rethink our modes of representation, production and relation to work and to the uses of the body, and our relationship to the Other and the self.	pain , body , dance , chronic , power , work , wound , knowledge , healing	en	9142.0
1114	Relations entre l'excès de poids, la qualité de l'alimentation et l'insécurité alimentaire chez les Premières Nations vivant sur les réserves de la Colombie-Britannique, Canada	There is consistent evidence showing that the prevalence of excess weight is increasing all over the world. In Canada, the prevalence is 59.4%, of which 23.1% can be ascribed to obesity and 36.0% to overweight. These proportions are higher in aboriginal populations, along with higher prevalence of food insecurity and a transition diet characterized by less traditional foods known to be of high nutrient content, and more market foods of lower nutritional density. Because of this situation, the World Health Organization has recommended new research strategies and initiatives in order to document the health status of these populations and prevent negative health consequences. Our study aimed to describe the phenomena of excess weight and food insecurity among adult First Nations (FN), aged 19 years and over, living on the reserves of British Columbia (BC); this sample is the first of a ten year project, the “First Nations Food, Nutrition and Environment Study” (FNFNES) aiming to document the nutritional status and exposure to contaminants in Canadian First Nations communities living south of the 60th parallel. Specifically, this thesis aims to link three health dimensions: excess weight, diet quality and food insecurity. We explored whether in the context of FN people living on the reserves of BC, 1) an inadequate diet quality is associated with a higher risk of excess weight; 2) household food insecurity is associated with inadequate diet quality; and 3) together, diet quality and food insecurity might explain the high prevalence of excess weight. Our results (from univariate, bivariate, MANOVA and logistic regression analysis of data collected in 2008/2009) show that among women (n = 493) and men (n = 356) respectively, the prevalences were 44.8% and 35.4% for obesity, and 31.6% and 41.3% for overweight, for a total of 76.4% and 76.7% for excess weight; for food insecurity, the prevalence was 39.3% for women and 34.8% for men. Only 42.4% of women and 43.8% of men had sufficient access to traditional foods. After controlling for sociodemographic and lifestyle variables, the results of multivariate analysis suggest that although the prevalences of iv excess weight and food insecurity were similar between genders, the process linking excess weight, diet quality and food insecurity was different among men and women. Indeed, in women, the excess weight might be explained by compromised diet quality, as observed through relatively high energy intakes (OR = 2.26; 95% CI: 1.13 - 4.52), more frequent consumption of carbonated beverages (OR = 2.70; CI: 1.11- 6.56 for overweight and OR = 2.53; CI: 1.05 - 6.09 for obesity), together with physical inactivity (OR = 0.52; CI: 0.28 - 0.58 for the moderate physical activity group and OR = 0.36; CI: 0.18 - 0.72 for the active group). Cereals (OR = 0.35; CI: 0.16- 0.75) and dairy products (OR = 0.40; CI: 0.16 - 0.95) played a protective role against excess weight. Moreover, household food insecurity influenced diet quality (through saturated fatty acids, p = 0.02) but when the three variables were analysed together, the only dimension associated with excess weight in women was diet quality, but not food insecurity. In men, the only dietary factor associated with excess weight was white bread, in a paradoxically protective role (OR = 0.38; CI: 0.18-0.76 for overweight and OR= 0.36; CI: 0.16-0.80 for obesity); also, when the three variables were put together, food insecurity played a protective role for excess weight, in the context of relatively high rate of smoking, also known to be protective of excess weight, which cannot help explain the high prevalence of excess weight in men living on the reserves of BC. More detailed studies, carried out in larger samples, would be necessary to better understand these relationships. This study already suggests that positive effects on the reduction of excess weight could result from policies and programmes aiming to reduce carbonated drink intakes and physical inactivity, and to encourage consumption of cereals and dairy products, especially in women. Regarding men, our results do not permit specific recommendations. However, healthy behaviours recommended for women might be extended to men, while waiting for results from further studies.

1115	Nouvelles limites sur la détection directe de la matière sombre avec l’expérience PICASSO	Astronomical and cosmological observations strongly suggest the presence of an exotic form of non-relativistic, non-baryonic matter that would represent 26% of the actual energy-matter content of the Universe. This so-called cold dark matter would be composed of Weakly Interactive Massive Particles (WIMP). PICASSO (Project In CAnada to Search for Supersymmetric Objects) aims to detect directly one of the dark matter candidates proposed in the framework of supersymmetric extensions of the standard model : the neutralino. The experiment is installed in the SNOLAB underground laboratory at Sudbury (Ontario) and uses superheated C4F10 droplets detectors, a variant of bubble chamber technique. Phase transitions in the superheated liquids are triggered by 19 F recoils caused by the elastic collision with neutralinos and create an acoustic signal which is recorded by piezoelectric sensors. This thesis presents recent progress in PICASSO leading to a substantially increased sensitivity in the search of neutralinos. New fabrication and purification procedures allowed a background reduction of about a factor 10 of the major detectors contamination caused by alpha emitters. Detailed studies allowed to localize these emitters in the detectors. In addition, data analysis efforts were able to improve substantially the discrimination between alpha particle induced events and those created by nuclear recoils. New analysis tools were also developed in order to discriminate between particle induced and non-particle induced events, such as electronic backgrounds and acoustic noise signals. An important new background suppression mechanism at higher temperatures led to the present improved sensitivity of PICASSO at low WIMP masses.

1116	De retour de France métropolitaine : une étude des représentations (post)coloniales et des nouvelles formes d’altérité à la Martinique	"The Lesser Antilles Archipelago Martinique is a society born of the transatlantic slave trade, slavery and French colonialism. This Creole society, tied to its metropolis for nearly four centuries, became a French department in 1946 giving its residents the status of French citizens. As a result, migration to the colonial center, Paris and the metropolitan region (Ile-de-France), intensified gradually to the point of institutionalization in the 1960's, thanks to the state agency BUMIDOM. The Caribbean presence in France is now such that the metropolis is refered to by immigrants as a ""third island"". However, in the contemporary setting there are new transatlantic mobility practices, plural and multifaceted – an integral part of which are centered around return-migration. The protagonists of return, the so-called ""returnees"" or ""négropolitains"" encounter several obstacles upon return to their homeland. This study examines the tendency to consider the returnee as a new type of ""outsider"" – more precisely, as a cultural foreigner; revealing another facet of otherness in Martinique and a new configuration of its postcolonial relationship with the French Republic. Following ethnographic fieldwork with these ""returnees"" and with the local population, a qualitative analysis of representations of the island and its inhabitants reveals how their experience in the French territory transforms the migrant and their way of belonging to Martinican and/or French culture. The representations and practices of the returnees are examined, shedding light on the emergence of new allied identities and new determinants of otherness at the intersection of these two areas, at once near and far.  Also, we will examine how the prism of return as an object of study, is transposed and reconfigured in the case of Martinique. The return acquires a special dimension for ""citizens of color"" who often experience social rejection and a double exclusion without stepping outside their national borders."	return migration , Martinique , Representations , Postcolonialisme , Postcolonialism , Otherness , Identity	en	9119.0
1117	Immigration et alimentation à Montréal aux XVIIe et XVIIIe siècles : essai d’interprétation à partir d’analyses isotopiques sur des populations archéologiques	In order to study whether the migration had an influence on diet in Montréal during the 17th and 18th centuries, 64 human skeletons from Notre-Dame cemetery were used for osteological and isotopic analysis. The latter was carried on bone collagen (carbon (d13C) and nitrogen (d15N)) and on carbonate apatite (d13C and oxygen (d18O)) from bone and tooth (premolars and third molars). d18O obtained on the two types of teeth revealed approximately three origins (Montréal, region enriched in 18O (i.e. Acadia, Louisiana, France, New England, Antilles and Africa) and region depleted in 18O (inland or northern territories)) for 58 persons. Seven possible mobility patterns were also proposed (N=27). More than half of the sample was born in Montreal (55%). It appears that people were often not mobile under the age of 16. However, 12 of the specimens migrated from an 18O enriched environment to Montréal (N=5) or from Montréal to a more 18O depleted area (N=5). The recruiting age of the French “mousses” on transatlantic ships, the fur trade, the wood industry and possibly the slavery could explain that migration at a young age. The diet included C3 plants, meat from animal fed on C3 plants and fish. People of Montreal consumed C4 resources (mostly maize, but sugar cane too as in rhum) in different proportions. We were unable to explore thoroughly whether the migration had an influence on diet due to biases related to the d18O of bone carbonate apatite. Combining data from different sources (osteology, isotopes and spatial organization of the cemetery) allowed us to address issues related to funerary archaeology on an individual level (possibly identity), without any concluding results on a broader level (organization of the cemetery).	isotope , Montréal , XVIIe siècle , 17th century , 18th century , carbon , immigration , oxygen , Montreal , nutrition , New France	en	9114.0
1118	La dynamique chromatinienne induite par le pic de LH dans les cellules de granulosa chez la souris	Identification of regulatory elements in the genome is of paramount importance to understanding the mechanisms governing the expression of specific genes in a given cell type.  Following the LH surge, the ovarian peri-ovulatory follicle enters an intensive program of cellular differentiation, orchestrated by major changes in the transcriptional profile of granulosa cells, ultimately triggering ovulation and luteinization, processes essentials for fertility in females. In the mouse, several genes essential to the success of this program are induced 2 to 6 hours after the ovulatory stimulus. Using a standard protocol for superovulation in mice, the regulatory elements were isolated and identified in granulosa cells 4h after administration of hCG using the method FAIRE (Formaldehyde-Assisted Isolation of Regulatory Elements) combined with next generation sequencing. The results of this analysis demonstrate that after the ovulatory stimulus, granulosa cells undergo a major reprogramming of regulatory elements, which is correlated with the extensive changes in their biological functions. In addition, this study showed that most regulatory elements were associated with distal intergenic regions and introns, indicating that these regions are important in transcriptional regulation in granulosa cells. A variety of transcriptional regulators known to be essential for ovarian function, and their binding sites were also identified in this analysis, demonstrating that the FAIRE method has the power to predict molecular events that have correlates in the known physiology of ovarian processes.

1119	Étude des effets du phénotype de sénescence des cellules stromales de la moelle osseuse sur les fonctions hématopoïétiques	Ionizing radiation (IR) is used in the treatment of several cancers and hematological disorders, especially in conditioning regimens for bone marrow transplantation. Reduced doses of IR seem to favor the success of engraftment. This observation supports the growing evidences suggesting the importance of the microenvironment integrity for the success of bone marrow transplantation and hematopoiesis maintenance. IR induces senescence of bone marrow stromal cells in vitro. This defense mechanism which leads to a permanent cell growth arrest is also observed in different organs in vivo but has not yet been studied in the hematopoietic niche. The objectives of this doctoral thesis are to determine whether IR induces senescence of bone marrow stromal cells and whether such induction alters hematopoietic functions. Our results have demonstrated for the first time that total body IR actually induces the senescence of bone marrow stromal cells. Furthermore, this alteration of the microenvironment affects B lymphopoiesis in an Ink4a/Arf-dependent manner (paper #1). In addition, the systemic changes associated with IR compromise bone homeostasis by increasing bone resorption without reducing bone formation (paper #2). All together, these data enhance our knowledge related to the effects of IR-induced senescent bone marrow stromal cells on hematopoietic function. Moreover, our results suggest that using drugs and/or procedures inducing no senescent bone marrow stromal cells would provide a better long-term prognosis for patients.

1120	Conception, synthèse et diversification de l'azaGly-Pro : un mime de tour beta, outil d'étude structure-activité : application au développement d'un nouvel agent tocolytique	Premature birth is a steadily increasing major medical problem, in spite of efforts made to counter the onset of preterm contractions. This thesis describes the rational design of a new therapeutic agent (i.e., tocolytic) capable of 1) stopping uterine contractions, and 2) prolonging gestation. The prostaglandin F2α receptor was explored for tocolytic development and a peptidomimetic approach was developed to produce modulators of this novel target. A brief discussion introduces the impact of preterm birth and history on the design and synthesis of a peptide lead, PDC113, to address this unmet medical need.  Subsequently, the peptidomimetic approach is described for converting PDC113 to the small molecule PDC113.824, which was shown to be an allosteric modulator of prostaglandin F2α receptor, which mediates intracellular signalling pathways involved in uterine contraction. This thesis presents the design, synthesis and structure-activity relationship study of the peptide mimic PDC113.824, in which we have replaced the central β-turn mimic moiety, the indolizidin-2-one amino acid, by a series of other previously reported azabicycloalcane turn mimics and novel aza-amino acids. To accomplish the latter, new solution-phase methods for synthesizing aza-glycyl-proline analogs were developed starting from diphenyl hydrazone and p-nitrophenyl chloroformate. This strategy has surmounted side reactions such as the intramolecular cyclization commonly obtained with traditional coupling reactions employing alkyl-carbazates and phosgene, facilitating access to aza-glycyl-proline derivatives by a one step reaction. The modification of the aza-glycyl-proline using conventional strategies led to a new Smac mimic (a proapoptotic molecule), with potential as a tetrapeptide activator of apoptosis in cancer cells. Subsequently, we focused on the diversification of the aza-glycine residue by selective alkylation using different alkyl halides in the presence of potassium tert-butoxide. To validate the alkylation protocol, various alkyl groups were employed, and the usefulness of the resulting aza-dipeptides as ''building blocks'' was examined. Conditions were developed for selectively unmasking the protecting groups at the N- and C-terminal of the aza-dipeptide. In addition, removal of the amine protection of aza-alkylglycyl-proline methyl ester gave access to a class of compounds with therapeutic potential, the aza-diketopiperazines (aza-DKP), by intramolecular cyclization. Finally, our interest in developing a new tocolytic agent led us to develop a new solution-phase synthetic route to PDC113.824 for elucidating the intracellular signalling pathways of prostaglandin F2α receptor. To explore the importance of stereochemistry and to study the relationship between structure and activity, we replaced the central indolizidin-2-one (I2aa) of PDC113.824 by a series of others azabicycloalcanes and aza-dipeptides. The D-I2aa, quinazolidinone and indolizidin-9-one analogs were synthesized and incorporated into the mimic; however, none exhibited activity neither in vitro nor ex vivo, thus indicating the importance of a type II' β-turn for maintaining biological activity of PDC113.824. Finally, the synthesis of a series of aza(alkyl)glycyl-prolyl analogs led to new allosteric modulators of the PGF2α receptor, one containing aza-glycine and another aza-phenylalanine.  This results reported in this thesis have contributed to the development of novel agents with promise for inhibiting preterm labor by the conception and application of new methods for making aza-peptides.

1121	'Are We Now Equal?' Recent experiences and perceptions of South American migrants in Argentina under MERCOSUR	Broadly speaking, my thesis examines the workings of grounded social, economic and political processes that have contributed, often in a conflicting manner, to the (re)definition of membership criteria in both the nation and the state. It does so in dialogue with two broad, interrelated bodies of literature, those on citizenship and transnationalism, which have examined issues of belonging, exclusion, mobility and access to rights among transnational migrants, while highlighting the renewed capacity of the state to regulate both people’s movements and migrants’ actual access to public entitlements. My dissertation challenges three sets of claims shaping research and policy agendas on migrant transnationalism and citizenship, and questions the hegemonic analytical and methodological approaches underlying them. My research has been carried out at two distinctive analytical and empirical levels. On the one hand, I examine the “technologies of citizenship” (Ong 2003, Fujiwara 2008) deployed by the government to transform Argentina into a diverse, inclusive and Latin American nation over the past decade, paying particular attention to Kirchnerismo’s creation of a “new legality” for the Paraguayans, Bolivians and Peruvians in the country. On the other hand, I analyze the “horizontal dimensions of citizenship processes” (Neveu 2005, Pickus and Skerry 2007, Gagné and Neveu 2009) among these migrants in urban, peripheral and rural areas of the partido of La Plata. Namely, I study the extent to which migrants’ socio-economic circumstances have changed in tandem with their new legal status (as nationals of the MERCOSUR in Argentina with rights equal to those of its citizens) and the “inclusive citizenship” policies deployed by the government. My dissertation pays particular attention to the grounding and embodiment of rights by examining how migrants’ new legal status translates into everyday life depending on a) where they live and work, and b) their perceived social status by other migrants and non-migrants. On the one hand, I look at urban, peripheral and rural areas of La Plata as zones of graduated sovereignty (Ong 1999) where particular governmentality regimes have emerged in tandem with the settlement of often ethnically marked groupings, whose entitlements and obligations differ from those in other zones. On the other hand, I examine how social status is produced through everyday social interaction by transposing socially constructed distinctions, such as race, class, gender and national origin, into formal systems of exclusion (Gregory 2007). My ethnographic analysis of what I shall call limítrofes’ experiences of legality demonstrates that their formal equality vis-à-vis Argentinians, far from being merely given as a new legal status evenly guaranteed to all, is both unequally experienced by diverse migrants and differently enforced in geographic areas governed by distinctive governmentality regimes (Foucault 1978).

1122	"L’autoréflexion de l’énonciation filmique
du film Punch-Drunk Love"	In Punch-Drunk Love (2002), Paul Thomas Anderson applies a unique creative process that reveals the very inner workings of enunciation in the film. His filmic approach functions to distance the spectator from the film and, to various degrees, challenges the spectator to question the codes that create an aesthetic of illusion. Drawing on Christian Metz’s abstract approach to enunciation, this thesis proposes to analyse the filmic enunciation of Anderson’s film. By means of this theoretical approach, we become aware that the enunciation of the film stimulates the spectator into realizing that the implied meaning of the enunciation is one that can be understood within its own self. The “who” and the “what” are no longer questions that are answered from the “outside”. The “who” is the film and the “what” resides in it. What we are observing is the self–reflexive nature of enunciation.

1123	Éticas indígenas en discursos coloniales de los Andes y de Quebec : análisis, interpretación y perspectivas	This thesis is a comparative study of indigenous ethical conceptions, through the analysis of colonial discourses from two regions of the Americas: Peru and Quebec. The aim of this study is to discover the principles of indigenous ethics and have these participate in the creation of and discussion about intercultural and ecological ethics that are relevant to the contemporary world. To this end, this paper is devoted to the study of indigenous oral traditions, and more particularly to colonial literatures based on oral sources. Specifically, we study two indigenous colonial chronicles from the Andes: the Huarochiri Manuscript and the Relation, by Joan and Santa Cruz Pachacuti; we also examine the relations of two Jesuit missionaries in New France: Paul Lejeune and Jean de Brébeuf. Since these texts cannot be considered as direct transcriptions of indigenous oral traditions, we use a methodology that takes into account the locus of enunciation, discursive traditions and processes of textualization of memory; as well as contextual relationships (intertextual, referencial, and interpersonal) and the different instances of an “ethicologic” analysis. Regarding the Andean texts, ethical dynamics are highlighted and then synthesized as an “ethics of reciprocity”. This highly ecological ethics takes into consideration the coexistence of all environmental entities (human and non-human), and may be viewed as an effort of Andean people to respond to the specific challenges they faced. Concerning the texts from Quebec, the ethical principles identified may be summarized as an “ethics of respect”. These may also be viewed as an ecological ethics as they do not perceive a real separation between man and the other entities that inhabit their environment. Rather, they view the relationship between human and non-human entities as a fluid continuity that forms a “sacred circle”. Based on these results we draw a comparative assessment that demonstrates that the difference is mostly formal: ethics are anchored in different socio-historical realities related to environmental differences and the customs associated with these environments. Regarding the similarities between the Peruvian and Quebec indigenous ethics, they may be summarized by the concept of a “cosmoethics of the circle”. This reveals a conception of ethics as a dynamic process that brings into play not only humans, but also the environment, as well as that which escapes a palpable apprehension of the world. Finally, this thesis attempts to lend a perspective on some of the principles outlined in the analysis, by showing that they can involve a complexity that is at times denied or dismissed by contemporary Western philosophers. In summary, this dissertation shows that the study of indigenous discourses, or discourses which give a voice to indigenous people, is a gateway to their ways of thinking about ethics and therefore can contribute to the intercultural work of philosophy and ethics.	intercultural and ecological ethics , Andean colonial indigenous discourses , Jesuit relations of New France , Paul Lejeune , Jean de Brébeuf , ethics of reciprocity , ethics of respect , cosmoethics	en	9045.0
1124	Forum de discussion en ligne : analyse des échanges interculturels entre des élèves français et québécois	Information and communication technologies (ICT) are increasingly present in every aspect of our society, such as education. Many teachers use these to work in class with their students. Sometimes, the ICT uses are limited to basic functions, but these technologies can have positive outcomes for students. Intercultural exchanges that may occur through the use of ICT can also help students to open their minds to others.  In this project, students, aged 8 to 12, are linked together with two online software: Knowledge Forum and Via. Via is used for videoconferencing and Knowledge Forum for online writing. The knowledge and attitudes of students toward other cultures and technologies were analyzed. Specifically, the participation, differences and similarities, knowledge, interactions and level of social presence were studied with analytic tools, including Bales’ categories. Interviews conducted with teachers and students were also analyzed. The level of social presence helped students’ attitudes to evolve, becoming friendlier with time. Students learned about each other’s cultures, talked about differences and similarities and shared much information about themselves. In short, technology helped students learn about different cultures and build relationships.	Knowledge Forum , Via , Culture , Bales , Intercultural exchange , Elementary school	en	9042.0

1126	The prevalence of congenital amusia	Congenital amusia is a heritable disorder in which subjects fail to acquire basic musical abilities, such as normal music perception and music-recognition abilities, despite normal hearing, normal language abilities, and normal intelligence (Ayotte, Peretz & Hyde, 2002). Recently, a family-aggregation study showed that 39% of first-degree relatives in amusic families express the disorder, compared to 3% in control families (Peretz et al., 2007). This latter finding is interesting in that it illustrates a prevalence of the disorder in non-amusic families. Kalmus and Fry (1980) evaluated the prevalence of congenital amusia at 4%, using the Distorted Tunes Test (DTT). However, this test presents some methodological and statistical problems, such as a strong ceiling effect, as well as the use of folkloric tunes, which disadvantages the amusic participants since they cannot assimilate these melodies correctly. The present study aimed at re-evaluating the presence of congenital amusia, using a recently validated online test by Peretz and colleagues (2008). One thousand one hundred participants, from a homogeneous sample, completed the online test. Results showed a global prevalence of 11.6%, with four distinct patterns of performance emerging: pitch deafness (1.5%), pitch memory amusia (3.2%), pitch perception amusia (3.3%), and beat deafness (3.3%). The variability in the results obtained with the online test brings evidence of at least four types of amusias with individual prevalences, indicating a heterogeneity in congenital amusia that needs to be further explored in later studies.

1127	Les effets de la présence d’une audience et de la condition sur les préférences d’appariement des femelles diamant mandarin (Taeniopygia guttata)	Mate choice is often considered as the result of a simple interaction, but, in the wild, the social environment in which animals communicate generally corresponds to a network of several signallers and receivers. The presence of conspecifics, rivals, and even predators during mate choice can have many repercussions on that choice. Being observed by an audience of same-sex conspecifics can drive some species to alter the level of expression of their preferences, and even to modify those preferences to reduce competition or avoid being copied. The preference of several zebra finch females for two males was measured without and with a female audience to determine if the presence of an audience alters female mate choice. Moreover, to determine if these effects vary according to focal and audience females’ condition, the condition of several females was altered by diminishing their flying ability. According to the results, females lower their level of selectivity following the addition of an audience, and the intensity of male-female interactions depends on the focal females’ condition. Our findings suggest that females mainly adjust their behavior to avoid being copied and not according to their condition. However, these two mechanisms might have affected the females’ mating preferences simultaneously.

1128	Développement du sentiment d'appartenance à une équipe sportive et persévérance scolaire : le cas des jeunes du programme «Bien dans mes baskets»	"""Bien dans mes Baskets"" (BdmB) is a psychosocial intervention program using basketball as a tool to prevent school dropout and delinquency among adolescents in difficulty or at risk. The general goals of the program are to prevent school dropout, delinquency and social exclusion. This study has two main objectives: 1) investigate the construction process of a sense of belonging to the team and to the school among athlete-students participating in BdmB, and 2) explore the potential connection between the basketball players' sense of team belonging and sense of school belonging.  Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a sample of 21 male student-athletes enrolled in the program BdmB. We randomly selected seven student-athletes in three teams of different age categories (atome, cadet and juvénile) to highlight the potential progression of the sense of belonging over time. The interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim in order to conduct an analysis inspired by grounded theory.  The results allow the identification of three conditions that appear to play a key role in the construction of a sense of belonging: 1) the sharing of meaningful group experiences, 2) the valorization of playing basketball in BdmB, and 3) the team and program climate. These conditions arise from the interaction and combination of many individual factors, interpersonal factors and program factors. For some athlete-students, afterschool basketball seems to encourage academic motivation. For most of the athlete-students, their sense of team belonging is tantamount to their sense of school belonging."	basketball , psychosocial intervention , sense of belonging , student retention , qulitative method	en	8965.0
1129	Cross-Linguistic Transfer (CLT) in Bilingual Speakers : Neural Correlates of Language Learning	The purpose of this thesis was to study the behavioral and neural correlates of Cross-linguistic Transfer effects (CLT) at the word level, in second language learning. Moreover, given that language distance has an impact on CLT, (Paradis, 1987, 2004, Odlin, 1989, 2004, 2005, Gollan, 2005, Ringbom, 2007), two distinct language pairs were examined: Close language pairs (Spanish-French) and distant language pairs (Persian-French).  This thesis comprises three studies. In study I, Spanish speakers and in study II Persian speakers were trained for lexical learning until consolidation level.  Cognates (phonologically and semantically similar words), Clangs (phonologically similar words with different meanings), and Non-cognate-non-clangs (semantically similar words), were presented in a picture naming task. Accuracy rates and response times as well as event-related fMRI BOLD responses to each word category were measured. Simple and direct contrasts with phonologically similar and phonologically distant words were performed. Thus, Study I reports the results of close languages (Spanish-French) and Study II, reports the results of distant languages (Persian-French). The neurocognitive processing of language learning was further investigated in terms of networks using functional connectivity analysis in distant languages (Persian-French) and the results are reported in Study III. The Results with the General Linear Model analysis show that with close language pairs (French-Spanish), the processing of phonologically similar words (cognates and clangs) relies upon a shared L1-L2 language specific neural areas, whereas processing of phonologically distant words (non-clang-non-cognates), activates L1 language processing areas, but also relies upon working memory, attentional, and  processing structures. However, with distant language pairs (French-Persian), even phonologically similar words (cognates and clangs) activate areas known to be involved in attentional processing and cognitive control. Moreover, phonologically distant words (non-clang-non-cognates) also activate areas involved in working memory and executive function processing structures. Thus, the factor of L1-L2 cross-linguistic distance appears to modulate the executive load imposed to the system, on the basis of the degree of phonological overlap between L1-L2 items; thus in order to compensate for more effortful processing demands, the system recruits executive function supporting structures. The results of the connectivity analysis show that, in line with literature (Majerus, et al., 2008; Prat, et al., 2007; Veroude, et al., 2010; Dodel, et al., 2005; Coynel, et al., 2009), when the language proficiency is low, there is enhanced functional connectivity between and within language specific and other cognitive processing (working memory, attentional and cognitive control) networks. However, as proficiency increases, integration values (functional connectivity) decrease. This reflects that language tasks become less effortful and demand less cognitive resources. The results of this dissertation contribute to a better understanding of CLT effects on L2 learning, both in regards to different word types and L1-L2 language distance. These results have implications with regards to L2 learning and teaching strategies and approaches as well as with regards to the development of data-driven therapy approaches in the case of language break down in bilingual population.

1130	Rôle et régulation de la protéine kinase AMPK au niveau intestinal	Physiopathology of type II Diabetes is characterized by severe metabolic abnormalities such as hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia also implicated in development of cardiovascular diseases. Impaired AMPK activity in tissues such as skeletal muscle and liver is associated with these metabolic disorders whereas its pharmacologic activation is able to restore such abnormalities. Nevertheless, tissue-specific heterotrimeric αβγ AMPK likely confers distinct roles and regulation that remain unexplored in intestine, an organ promoting enhanced nutrients absorption in type II diabetes situation. This study demonstrates α1β2γ1 AMPK complex preponderance in intestinal Caco-2 cells whose α1 subunit role is to regulate ACC enzyme responsible of fatty acid synthesis. Unlike in the liver, AMPK doesn’t regulate HMG-CoA reductase enzyme implicated in cholesterol synthesis. AMPK activation mimics insulin effect by reducing intestinal glucose and lipids absorption whereas its alteration in insulin-resistance situation (e.g.: induced by 4-HHE in Caco-2 cell model or in Psammomys obesus animal model) enhances glucose and lipids absorption which could exacerbate postprandial hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia associated to type II diabetes. Thus, AMPK at the intestinal level could be a potential therapeutic target in prevention and treatment of type II diabetes.

1131	La chronique politique de la presse écrite montréalaise : portrait d’un genre journalistique en quête d’une définition	The political column – which figures at the heart of the issue of the press’ influence of public opinion – is rarely studied in scholarly literature, especially in Quebec. Yet, the study of punditry is particularly relevant in the context where different Web platforms seem to strengthen the presence of commentaries of all flavours. This study aims to shed light on the recent evolution of political column by presenting a systematic content analysis of such articles published in Quebec newspapers from 1991 to 2011, combined with a series of semi-directed interviews with renowned political columnists. Emphasis is first put on several characteristics, such as formatting or layout of the articles, while the wide variety of issues addressed by political columnists show that the column genre enjoys real freedom as the authors themselves choose their topics and decide how to write about them. Moreover, the negative critique remains ubiquitous in political punditry, though in a smaller proportion that could be expected, as many authors are rather neutral and explanatory in their comments. Finally, the remarks of the interviewed columnists suggest that their status is accompanied by recognition and celebrity, as much from the readers as from their colleagues. The general conclusions lead us to better assess the distinctions between political columns and other journalistic genres.	columnist , punditary , newspapers , political column , journalism , political commentary , public opinion , analysis	en	8900.0
1132	Étude du trafic du récepteur delta-opiacé suite à sa stimulation par différents agonistes	Opiates are among the most powerful painkillers to treat severe pain. Delta opioid receptor (DOR) agonists induce fewer side effects than mu opioid receptor agonists, which makes them a target of interest for the treatment of chronic pain. However, they induce tolerance to analgesia. Recent hypotheses suggest that drugs tolerance is the result of stabilization of ligand-specific conformations of the receptor, with distinct traffic properties such as internalization and/or recycling. In this context, we determined whether different DOR ligands differed with respect to their ability to induce signaling and receptor trafficking. Our results indicate that DPDPE and SNC-80 are the most effective drugs to inhibit the production of cAMP, followed by UFP-512, morphine and TIPP. Only DPDPE and SNC-80 manage to induce DOR internalization in HEK-293 cells. This effect is dependent on β-arrestin but not on GRK2 or PKC. Of these two internalizing agonists, only DPDPE allows the DOR to recycle back to the membrane of HEK-293 cells after recovery. DPDPE and SNC-80 also trigger similar DOR internalization in cortical neurons, and as observed in HEK293 cells only DPDPE allowed the receptor to recycle back to the membrane. This recycling capacity was suggested as a mechanism to protect against the onset of tolerance. These observations indicate that the DOR can undergo different regulations depending on the ligand bound to it. This property of functional selectivity of DOR ligands could be useful for the development of new opiates with longer lasting analgesic properties.

1133	Initiatives médiatiques pour baliser le développement des nanotechnologies : une enquête qualitative auprès des journalistes et des chercheurs en nanobiotechnologies	Thanks to nanotechnologies, mankind can control matter at the nanometer scale, on the level of individual atoms and molecules. Materials obtained following these nanoscale manipulations demonstrate novel properties with the potential for application to all scientific and technological disciplines. Nanotechnologies are therefore often considered a foundation for a deep technological and social revolution. However, while nanotechnologies interest investors, government, private enterprises and universities, they also raise ethical questions, particularly regarding their toxicity, their outcome and the modification of human beings. On top of these ethical questions several other interrogations arise with respect to the governance of nanotechnologies: how, indeed, should their development be initially monitored in order to avoid eventual negative consequences in the future? Among these many questions, the role of the media in the relations between the developers of nanotechnologies and the public is often mentioned. Some see in the media an actor that researchers might refer to in order to establish a dialogue with the public to insure a harmonious development of nanotechnologies. While this recommendation seems very relevant, no empirical study exists to our knowledge to assess its feasibility among the concerned stakeholders (researchers, media). Within the scope of this thesis, we thus wanted to examine and analyze the perception of researchers and journalists from Quebec towards media initiatives to monitor the development of nanotechnologies. To do so, we proceeded to perform a qualitative study with twenty (20) researchers in the fields of nanobiotechnology/nanomedicine and ten (10) journalists specialized in scientific popularization. The analysis of interviews with responders revealed that while the concerned parties are in favour of these initiatives, there are several constraints that may impede such an enterprise.  Following the study of these constraints, we have suggested concrete initiatives that Quebec researchers may implement in order to better monitor the development of nanotechnologies through a dialogue with the public. These suggestions mainly consist in creating private media for researchers, resorting to independent media and engaging the World Wide Web. Such initiatives, however, can only be obtained at the price of a realignment of researchers’ priorities.

1134	Une évaluation qualitative d’un programme de préparation à l’examen professionnel québécois à partir de la perception des candidates infirmières	Since 2000, the professional licensure exam of the Ordre des infirmières et infirmiers du Québec (OIIQ) is comprised of two parts; a written exam and a practical exam in the form of an objectively structured clinical examination (OSCE). Various establishments have created preparation programs in order to help candidates study for the exam; however, these programs have never been evaluated. The goal of this study was to qualitatively assess a preparation program for the professional licensure exam. Focus groups were held with candidates who had participated in a preparation program. The groups explored the program’s impact on the candidates’ experience during the professional licensure exam, as perceived by the candidates themselves. The data analysis was performed based on the method of analysis by analytical questioning of Paillé and Mucchielli (2008). The second-generation competency-based approach developed by Goudreau, Pepin, Dubois, Boyer, Larue and Legault (2009) was used as a framework for this study. Analysis of the interviews identified candidates’ expectations with regards to the preparation program and its impact on their experience during the professional licensure exam. The program allowed candidates to assess their strengths and weaknesses in order to guide their study sessions, while reducing the stress linked to the fear of the unknown and increasing their motivation and confidence. The OSCE and the feedback provided after OSCE are the activities perceived as being the most relevant, both by the candidates and from a competency approach perspective. On the other hand, the written exam was perceived as being less relevant for the exam preparation and less relevant to competency development. Suggestions to improve the preparation program were gathered from the interviews with the participants and recommendations for management, practice, education and research in nursing science were made as a result of this study.	preparation program for the professional licensure exam , competency approach , candidates , professional licensure exam	en	8890.0
1135	Aportes del Aprendizaje Basado en Problemas (ABP) en la enseñanza de la Fisiología Animal en un programa de Zootecnia	Based on difficulties observed on the subject of technical-scientific conceptualization and the integration of theory and practice in learning animal physiology for students in the Animal Science program at the National University of Colombia in Medellin, this research paper proposes a problem-based learning strategy founded on the method of Problem Based Learning (PBL), applied specifically to the issues of thermoregulation and physiological stress in domestic animals. In this case study, a sample size of eight students was presented with a pedagogical problem during the first session that would then be solved during the course. In order to evaluate the process, three surveys were conducted called Level Test Formulations (NF) performed at different times of the trial: one before beginning the topic (NF 1), one after three theoretical classes had been given and before beginning the fieldwork (NF 2), and another one after the end of the process (NF 3). Finally, individual interviews were conducted with each student to know the students' perceptions regarding the method. The information obtained was subjected to a qualitative analysis and categorization, using the QDA Miner program which reviewed and coded texts from the surveys and individual interviews, supplemented in turn, by field observation, analyzing the conceptual change, the theory-practice relationship and the correlation between the variables and categories established. x Among the main results obtained, it should be noted that following the implementation of PBL in this Animal Physiology course, support for conceptual change was demonstrated and the formulated problem served as a connector between theory and practice. Moreover, there was a fusion of prior knowledge with newly acquired knowledge, meaningful learning, improvement in the level of conceptualization and an increase in the scientificness of definitions; it also led to problem-solving and overcoming epistemological obstacles such as multidisciplinarity and nonlinearity. As a result of this research, it is recommended that this method be evaluated in other topics related to Animal Physiology, in other sciences, in larger sample sizes, as well as to address the issue of evaluation applied directly to this method.

1136	La bande-annonce, un film amplifié	Our project focuses on the relationship between the trailer and the film it presents, specifically, how the re-editing of the trailer amplify the film. First, we conducted an intertextual and aesthetic analysis of five contemporary trailers by identifying the specific concept of each example and by isolating what we called the effects of emphasis, that is to say accentuation  of certain qualities of the film through the editing of the trailer. We then explored conceptually the transforming logic of the trailer considering complementary ideas: attractive editing, open structure and the evocation of a virtual memory.	trailer , editing , aesthetics , rhetoric , intertextuality	en	8865.0
1137	Distances, rencontres, communications : les défis de la concorde dans l'Empire carolingien	At the start of the 9th Century, the Carolingians intended to unite Western Europe in the Christian faith and cult. This ideal was central to the emperors’ thoughts, who considered themselves protectors, legislators and judges, even claiming to be the vicars of Christ and rectors of the Church’s institutions. Such ambitions led to the development of an original form of government. Since the conquests had composed a large mosaic of populations, cultures and interests, maintaining concord became a major difficulty for the Carolingian government. In rising to this challenge, Charlemagne and Louis the Pious made communications their foremost political tool. With inventiveness and efficiency they used communications as best they could, but it was not enough to establish long lasting unity : discordances built up where they were unable to maintain strong relations with the regional élite. Distances and means of communications determined the nature and limits of the exchanges between the political center and its peripheries, thus orienting the destiny of the Empire. This study tackles a wide variety of sources, including diplomas, capitularies, correspondences, coins... Among other things, it investigates the relations of the imperial government with the southwestern part of the Empire. The results are supported by a series of inquiries touching on representations of political authority, network studies, sociopolitical consequences of geographical distance and speed of communication, anthropological complexities of encounters and long-distance relations. Beyond the history of the 8th and 9th Centuries, it illustrates the necessity of approaching pre-modern political realities through the lens of geographical distances, meetings and communications.

1138	Criminal liability of canadian corporations for international crimes	This master’s thesis examines the criminal liability of Canadian corporations for their involvement in international crimes committed in part or entirely overseas.    First, we observe that initial developments by the military tribunals established after the Second World War in recognizing criminal liability of collective entities were not pursued by the United Nations ad hoc tribunals and the International Criminal Court.  In fact, the personal jurisdiction of the latter tribunals does not extend to organizations and is limited to the prosecution of natural persons accused of committing international crimes.    In the second part of this thesis, we offer concrete examples to illustrate that Canadian corporations have assumed and continue to assume criminal roles in supporting civil wars and armed conflicts where international crimes are committed.  We will demonstrate that Canadian criminal law attributes criminal liability to an organization (corporations or unincorporated groups) for common law offences committed in Canada, under direct or accomplice liability.  We further maintain that Canadian corporations may be prosecuted before Canadian courts for their involvement in international crimes committed overseas, in accordance with the Crimes against Humanity and War Crimes Act, the principle of universal jurisdiction and common law rules.      In conclusion, Canada has the necessary legal and judicial instruments to prosecute corporations suspected of committing international crimes overseas and is therefore capable of ending their undesirable status of impunity.	international , Crimes , Canada , collective , Corporations , International , criminal law , Canada , Universal , jurisdiction , Collective , liability	en	8842.0

la radio CISM 89,3 FM vue par ses artisans"	Abstract This essay aims to improve the reflection about the conception of an alternative media trough the analysis of a so-called alternative media, CISM 89,3 FM, the college radio of the Université de Montréal. After a literature review, the author proposes interrogations and explores ways of analyzing alternative medias. From a field research, based on interviews with actors engaged in CISM, this work sheds light on some elements that were not much discussed in the literature. The author shows the importance of this alternative status for the workers of CISM, and the complexity of this status and the stakes of it. This work also shows, trough the words of the interviewed people, the difficulty and the tensions that alternative medias worker have to deal with daily, in order to enact an alternative status. Through these negotiations, tensions, CISM is defining itself in regard to what is or should be an alternative media. It is these constant tensions that make CISM evolve.

1140	Systèmes superintégrables avec spin et intégrales du mouvement d’ordre deux	This thesis is part of a research program studying superintegrable systems with spin. In particular, we consider a Hamiltonian with a spin-orbital interaction in three dimensions admitting an integral of motion that is a matrix polynomial second order in the momenta. Since we are considering a Hamiltonian which is invariant under rotation and parity, we classify the integrals of motion into irreducible O(3) multiplets. We obtain the commutator of the Hamiltonian with the scalar, pseudoscalar, vector and axial vector operators. We provide a complete classification for the scalar and vector cases. We find the necessary condition for superintegrability on the potential as a differential equation. We use symmetry reduction methods to obtain particular solutions of this equation.

1141	Les relations entre les compétences des professionnels en ressources humaines, les caractéristiques des clients et leur satisfaction par l’approche des constituantes multiples	This empirical study conducted in to the consulting engineering has two primary objectives: (1) the validation of relationships between certain characteristics of clients of human resources and their level of satisfaction with these services and (2) the study of relations between the competencies of HR professionals and the level of customer satisfaction. We selected a theoretical framework that consists mainly of the multiple constituencies approach.  Our analytical model assumes that the satisfaction of the clients of a service of human resources department is influenced by eleven factors. Five of these factors reflect the characteristics of clients; 1-commitment, 2-age, 3-sex, 4-seniority and 5-the frequency of contact. The other six factors represent the skills of HR professionals; 1-operational executor, 2-business ally, 3-culture and change steward, 4-strategy architect, 5-talent manager and 6- credible activist. For purposes of our research, we use a quantitative and qualitative approach.  The results of bivariate analysis refute our hypotheses. However, seniority and age of the customers seem to have a negative relationship with customer satisfaction. As for the analysis containing interviews conducted with HR professionals in an organization, it highlights the links between satisfaction and five skills, which are the operational executor, business ally, culture and change steward, talent manager and credible activist. Thus, five proposals are supported.	Skills , Customer satisfaction , Multiple constituencies approach , Clients’ characteristics , Human resources service	en	8823.0
1142	Évolution du risque cardiométabolique sur une période de quatre ans : étude chez des adultes béninois (Afrique de l’Ouest)	The objectives of this study on four-year trends (2006-2010) in cardiometabolic risk (CMR) in Benin adults were: • To examine whether abdominal obesity according to International Diabetes Federation (IDF) waist circumference cut-offs, or insulin resistance  measured by the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) was associated with more unfavourable changes in other CMR factors,  • To examine the effects of diet, physical activity and socioeconomic status including place of residence on the evolution of CMR assessed by both the Framingham risk score for cardiovascular diseases (FRS) and the metabolic syndrome (MetS).  We hypothesized that: • Abdominal obesity as currently defined by IDF anthropometric criteria is weakly associated with unfavourable changes in other CMR factors while IR exacerbates other CMR factors in sub-Saharan Africans, • Medium income status, less urbanized place of residence (rural or semi-urban), physical activity and healthy eating patterns (higher score of consumption of foods that may protect against CMR) contribute to more favourable evolution of CMR.  The study included initially 541 apparently healthy adults aged 25-60 years and randomly selected in a large city (n = 200), a small town (n = 171) and its surrounding rural area (n = 170). After baseline survey, subjects were followed-up after two and four years. Dietary intake and physical activity were assessed by two or three 24-hour recalls in baseline studies and then by short frequency questionnaires at follow-ups. Data on alcohol intake and smoking patterns were collected in personal interviews. Anthropometric data, blood pressure, insulin resistance based on homeostasis model assessment (HOMA), blood glucose and blood lipids were measured. Education, income (proxy) and place of residence were the socioeconomic variables appraised in interviews. A food score based on consumption frequency of “sentinel foods” was developed and used. Complete data at last follow-up was available in 416 subjects. Baseline prevalence of MetS and FRS ≥ 10% was 8.7% and 7.2%, respectively. The incidence of MetS, and a FRS ≥ 10% over four years was 8.2% and 5%, respectively. The CMR deteriorated in 21% of subjects. Abdominal obesity as defined by IDF thresholds of the waist circumference was associated with a higher likelihood of insulin resistance: relative risk (RR) = 5.7 (CI 95%: 2.8-11.5), high total cholesterol/HDL-Cholesterol ratio: RR = 3.4 (CI 95%: 1.5-7.3). However, abdominal obesity was not associated with a significantly increased risk of high blood pressure or high triglycerides. In the study population, the optimal cut-offs of waist circumference that predicted at least one component of MetS were 90 cm in women and 80 cm in men. Insulin resistance measured by HOMA was associated with an increased risk of hyperglycemia: RR = 5.7 (CI 95%: 2.8-11.5). However, the insulin resistance was not associated with a significant risk of high blood pressure and high triglycerides.  The combination of MetS and the FRS depicted more at-risk subjects than the use of either tool alone. Diet and lifestyle mediated location and income effects on CMR evolution. Low “sentinel food” scores (foods that may reflect the protective effect of the diet against CMR): meat, poultry, milk and milk products, eggs and vegetables; and inactivity increased the likelihood of CMR deterioration: RR = 5.6 (CI 95%: 1.9-16.4) and RR = 6.3 (CI 95%: 3.0-13.4), respectively. Subjects with medium or low socioeconomic levels, and those living in the rural and semi-urban areas had a lower risk of CMR deterioration.  The study showed some differences in the relationship between abdominal obesity, insulin resistance and other CMR factors in Blacks compared to Caucasians and it also highlighted the need to reconsider MetS components and their cut-offs for sub-Saharan Africans. Combining MetS and FRS might be appropriate for surveillance purposes in order to better capture CMR. The results of the present study call for urgent measures to reduce CMR deterioration focusing on more active lifestyle and dietary inadequacies.

1143	Étude de l’oxydoréduction de monocouches électroactives de ferrocénylalcanethiolates par spectroscopie à résonance des plasmons de surface	The oxidation and reduction of self-assembled ferrocenylalkanethiolate monolayers formed on gold surfaces (FcRSAu) have been followed in real-time by electrochemical surface plasmon resonance (E-SPR) spectroscopy. Film thickness changes on the order of angstroms resulting from SAM structural changes can be detected by SPR. The electrochemically-induced reorientation of the ferrocenylalkanethiolates has been proposed by several spectroelectrochemistry studies. We have used E-SPR to elucidate the nature of the molecular reorientations.  The SPR refractometer was first calibrated to find a pixel to angle equation so that Fresnel modeling could be used to calculate SAM thickness changes from the measured resonance angle changes (Δθmin). SAMs of FcCnSAu (where n = 6, 8, 12, 14) were characterized by electrochemistry, infrared spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy. The results obtained show that an increase in the alkyl chain length gives a thicker and less disordered SAM. Oxidation of the surface-bound ferrocenes to ferroceniums and pairing with ClO4- anions produces a similar change in Δθmin for these SAMs, but the variation in the SAM thickness is linearly dependent on the chain length. Mathematical deconvolution of the cyclic voltammograms of binary SAMs (FcC12SAu/C11SAu) of different compositions was used to separate the contributions of the different ferrocene domains (aggregated vs. isolated ferrocenes). We conclude that the aggregated-ferrocenes undergo a change in the orientation of the alkyl chain orientation. We cannot however exclude that the cyclopentadiene rings also reorient themselves. Anion pairing effect was studied by E-SPR. Our electrochemistry results indicate that the ability of the electrolyte anion to pair with the electrogenereted ferrocenium decreases in the following order: PF6- > ClO4- > BF4- > NO3-. On the other hand, the change in Δθmin does not follow the associated trend observed for the anion pairing capacity but rather NO3- ≥ ClO4- > PF6- ≈ BF4-. We hypothesize that the difference in the uptake water molecules by the oxidized SAM may be the reason for this observation. This hypothesis still needs to be verified.

1144	Le double et le texte : homonymes, pseudonymes et auteurs chez Dostoievski, King, Auster, Poe et Nabokov	The mythical figure of the double appears in most of cultures through archetypes translating the human experience of division, be it complementary or antithetical.  In Gothic and Fantastic literatures, the myth often stands for a feeling of anguish and horror underlining the mysteries and complications arising from the subject’s dividedness. This analysis wishes to group into two thematic categories occurrences of doubles based on the textual treatment that is made of them: doubles as homonyms and as pseudonyms. This distinction will lead in commenting on the author’s perception of himself and of the creative process. We will use a Lacanian and post-structuralist reading grid, based on the fact that dividedness has been a core issue in psychological and psychoanalytical theoretical developments. The works studied will be Paul Auster’s New York Trilogy, Stephen King’s The Dark Half, Edgar Allan Poe’s William Wilson, Fyodor Dostoevsky’s The Double and Vladimir Nabokov’s Despair.

1145	L'activité physique : une stratégie pour contrebalancer l'effet hyperphagiant du travail mental	Introduction: Although energy expenditure during knowledge-based work is not higher than energy expenditure at rest, recent literature suggests that a stressful mental task is related to an increase in energy intake. It is suggested that mental work produces physiological changes, thereby influencing energy intake. Because physical activity can influence hunger, the aim of the study was to determine if the introduction of an active pause could counteract the negative effects of mental work on food intake and energy balance in a population of adolescent males. Method: Twelve male students of normal weight between 14 and 20 years old were evaluated at UHC Sainte-Justine. All subjects participated in three different sessions in a randomized order: a) NOpausevisit = relaxation/mental work/meal; b) RELpausevisit = mental work/relaxation/meal; and c) PApausevisit = mental work/physical activity/meal. The effect of introducing an active pause on energy intake and energy balance (kilojoules eaten – kilojoules expended during the tasks) was studied by comparing visits with paired t-tests (level of significance: p<0.05). The same analyses were performed to determine differences in appetite sensations. Results: The introduction of an active pause did not influence energy intake, even though higher appetite-related sensations were observed. Taking into account energy expenditure related to physical activity, a lower energy balance was measured for the PApausevisit compared to the NOpausevisit. Conclusion: This study is the first to confirm that being active between mental work and a meal represents a good strategy to counteract the hyperphagic effect of knowledge-based work via mainly an increased energy expenditure and a maintenance of energy intake. Globally, these results could help individuals attain and/or maintain a healthy body weight in a context where knowledge-based work is omnipresent.

1146	Mesure et Prévision de la Volatilité pour les Actifs Liquides	The high frequency observed price series is contaminated with market microstructure frictions or noise. We explore the measurement and forecasting of the fundamental volatility through novel approaches to the frictions’ problem. In the first paper, while maintaining the standard framework of a noise-frictionless price additive model, we use the trading volume, quoted depths, trade direction indicator and bid-ask spread to get rid of the noise. The econometric model is a price impact linear regression. We show that incorporating the cited liquidity costs variables delivers more precise volatility estimators. If the noise is only partially absorbed, the remaining noise is closer to a white noise than the original one, which lessens misspecification of the noise characteristics. Our approach is also robust to a specific form of endogeneity under which the common robust to noise measures are inconsistent. In the second paper, we model the variance of the market microstructure noise that contaminates the frictionless price as an affine function of the fundamental volatility. Under our model, the noise is time-varying intradaily. Using the eigenfunction representation of the general stochastic volatility class of models, we quantify the forecasting performance of several volatility measures under our model assumptions. In the third paper, instead of assuming the standard additive model for the observed price series, we specify the conditional distribution of the frictionless price given the available information which includes quotes and volumes. We come up with new volatility measures by characterizing the conditional mean of the integrated variance.

1147	"Le processus de design visuel communicationnel :
tensions et négociations dans l’industrie publicitaire"	The advertising industry involves a daily collaboration between two ways of thinking or two hemispheres: one of commercial nature and the other of creative nature. Rational and logical individuals must collaborate with intuitive and artistic individuals, and from this collaboration emerge various tensions. In the advertising industry, this relationship operates throughout a process of visual communication design. We chose to use the term visual communication design process because it illustrates our approach in this research, an approach that joins communication and design. The advertising industry has developed tools to facilitate the visual communication process: among them the creative brief. Our research proposes to observe how “commercials” and “creatives” in the industry perceive their day-to-day work and their use of the creative brief through a series of interviews. Our questions are: in which ways do the “commercials” and “creatives” negotiate the tensions that emerges from the visual communication design process? What are the roles of the creative brief throughout this process? Our findings illustrate the transformations and innovations that emerge from the tensions between “commercials” and “creatives” and highlight the importance of the communicational characteristics of the creative brief as part of the visual communication design process.

1148	Stress oxydatif, fonction mitochondriale et maladie inflammatoire de l'intestin	Background: Although mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are key mechanisms in various pathological conditions, they have not been extensively studied in the gastrointestinal tract, which is known to be constantly exposed to luminal oxidants from ingested foods and pathogens. Key among these is the simultaneous ingestion of iron salts and ascorbic acid, which can cause oxidative damage to macromolecules. The protein ‘’Nuclear factorerythroid 2- related factor’’ (Nrf2) is an important redox-sensitive transcription factor, which protects against oxidative stress by inducing antioxidant and detoxifying genes through binding with antioxidant response element (ARE). Many of Nrf2 antioxidant protective and anti-inflammatory functions have been established in various cells and tissues. However, limited information is available on its role in the gastrointestinal tract. Objectives: The objectives are to evaluate how iron-ascorbate (FE/ASC)-mediated lipid peroxidation affects mitochondrion functioning in Caco-2/15 cells, and to mechanistically determine the role of Nrf2. Methods: Caco2/15 cells were treated with 0.2mm/2mm of FE/ASC to induce oxidative stress. To increase Nrf2 expression, cultured Caco2/15 cells were pre-treated with 50 μM Olitpraz (OPZ). To down regulate the Nrf2 function, Nrf2 gene was knocked down by transfecting Caco-2/15 cells with a pGFP-RS lentiviral vector containing shRNA against Nrf2. 4 RESULTS: Our results show that the treatment of Caco-2/15 cells with FE/ASC (0.2 mm/2 mm): increased the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), a marker of oxidative stress; reduced ATP production; raised mitochondrial calcium content; regulated the protein expression of cytochrome C and apoptotic inducing factor (AIF); decreased mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes I, II, III and IV activity; prevented mtDNA damage as illustrated by the raised levels of 8-OHdG; lowered DNA Glycosylase, and altered the gene expression and protein mass of mitochondrial transcription factors (mtTFA, mtTFB1, mtTFB2). Furthermore, our observations indicate that the induction and activation of Nrf2 in Caco2/15 cells resulted in an augmentated endogenous antioxidants enzymes (catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase), a reduction of nuclear factor-kappaB (NFκβ) and Tumor Necrosis Factor- Alpha (TNF-α), an increase in the ATP production, mitochondrial respiratory complexes (I, II, III, VI), PGC1α , and a regulation of the mitochondrial Prohibitin, anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein, and Occludin level. CONCLUSION: Findings indicate that acute exposure of Caco-2/15 cells to FE/ASC-catalyzed peroxidation produces pathological effects on mitochondrial functions and DNA integrity, which were diminished by Nrf2 induction. It appears that Nrf2 plays a critical cytoprotective role in intestinal epithelial cells against oxidative stress.	Oxidative stress , Mitochondria , Inflammation , NRF2	en	8751.0
1149	Étude de la voie de signalisation de l’insuline chez la drosophile par une approche phosphoprotéomique	Phosphorylation is a reversible post-translational modification that modulates protein activity, and can impart conformational changes and affect translocation of their protein substrates. Kinases and phosphatases are responsible for the dynamic of changes in protein phosphorylation and act in a coordinated manner. Abnormal activation or misregulation of kinase activity can lead to the development of cancers and metabolic disorders. Tyrosine kinase receptor (RTK) associated signaling pathways are often implicated in numerous diseases and the further understanding of mechanisms affecting their regulation is necessary to determine their activity and effects anticipated on their substrates. In this context, the primary objective of this thesis is to study the phosphorylation events arising from the activation of the insulin receptor (InR) following stimulation of drosophila S2 cells with insulin. The phosphorylation cascade triggered after InR activation is conserved in mammals. In order to study the phosphoproteome of drosophila S2 cells, we enriched phosphopeptides on titanium dioxide (TiO2) stationary phase prior to their separation by liquid chromatography (LC) and ion mobility (FAIMS) mass spectrometry (MS). Phosphopeptides were then analysed by tandem MS at high resolution. We first compared the benefits of FAIMS to conventional LC-MS, and observed a 50% increase in the number of identified phosphopeptides when using ion mobility. FAIMS enables the separation of phosphoisomers that are typically unresolved by LC, enabling high confidence assignment of modification sites via distinct MS/MS spectra. This approach was used to profile phosphorylation changes taking place between control and insulin-treated drosophila cells and enabled the identification of 32 phosphopeptides (out of 2 660 quantified) showing differential regulation. Interestingly, 50% of the regulated targets have a CK2 consensus site. These preliminary experiments were followed-up by RNAi mediated inhibition of CK2 and revealed that 6 phosphoproteins (CG30085, su(var)205, scny, protein CDV3 homolog, D1 and mu2) were positively modulated after insulin stimulation and negatively regulated after CK2 RNAi treatment. Using in vitro kinase assay, we identified 29 direct CK2 targets, of which 15 were correlated with results from the CK2 RNAi experiment. We demonstrated specifically that the su(var)205 (S15) is regulated by insulin and is a direct CK2 target based on RNAi and kinase assays. Our phosphoproteomics data also highlighted the presence of isomeric phosphopeptides, several of which could be distinguished using FAIMS. We developed two algorithms to determine the occurrence of phosphoisomers in large scale studies. The first algorithm based on differences in retention times between isomers identified 64 candidates in mouse and rat phosphoproteome datasets corresponding to less than 1% of all identified phosphopeptides. We also identified 117 isomer candidates in drosophila using a targeted LC-MS/MS approach with inclusion lists. The second algorithm is based on the presence of characteristic fragment ions present in MS/MS spectra of co-eluting or partially resolved species and allowed the identification of 23 isomeric pairs. The ability to distinguish phosphoisomers in large-scale phosphoproteome datasets is of significance to correlate phosphorylation events taking place on specific residues with biological activities.

1150	Étude de la variante d’histone H2A.Z et du cycle de phosphorylation de l’ARN polymérase II chez Saccharomyces cerevisiae	Chromatin is more than just the eucaryotic DNA packaging system; it is the substrate of all reactions involving DNA in eukaryotic cells and actively regulates RNA Polymerase II (RNAPolII) access to DNA. Responsible for all mRNA transcription in eucaryotes, the RNAPolII must, following its recruitment to the pre-initiation complex, overcome the chromatin barrier in order to transcribe genes. The RNAPolII CTD allows for the co-transcriptional coordination of mRNA maturation and chromatin modifications. The work covered in this thesis addresses two aspects of transcription: the chromatin substrate, with the localization of H2A variant, H2A.Z, and the transcription complex with the phosphorylation cycle of the RNAPolII CTD. Following the introduction, chapter 2 constitutes a detailed and annotated Saccharomyces cerevisiae ChIP-chip protocol, from the culture to the hybridization of the array, with an emphasis on the proper controls required for chromatin study. This technique, extremely powerful for the in vivo study of all DNA transactions, leads to a better understanding of chromatin function in nuclear phenomena, thanks to the localization of histone variants and modifications. The third chapter maps the H2A.Z variant across the yeast genome at ~300 base pairs resolution using ChIP-chip. Our data shows that H2A.Z is incorporated into one or two promoter-bound nucleosomes at the majority of genes. H2A.Z enrichment is anticorrelated with transcription, and the results suggest that it configures chromatin structure to poise genes for transcriptional activation. Furthermore, we have shown that H2A.Z can regulate nucleosome positioning. The next chapter focuses on the transcription machinery and, more precisely, on the phosphorylation cycle of RNAPolII. The CTD contains repetitions of a heptapeptide (YSPTSPS) on which all serines are differentially phosphorylated along genes in a prescribed pattern during the transcription cycle. Here, we systematically profiled the location of the RNAPII phospho-isoforms in wild-type cells and mutants for most CTD modifying enzymes. The results provide evidence for a uniform CTD cycle across genes. Together with results from in vitro assays, these data reveal a complex interplay between the modifying enzymes, identify Ssu72 as the Ser7 phosphatase and show that proline isomerization is a key regulator of CTD dephosphorylation at the end of genes. Moreover, it reinforces the notion of variants of the phosphorylation marks, even though the exact nature of the variant is still difficult to identify. The discussion introduces the studies that followed this work, including new projects conceived in our lab.

1151	"The association between caries and
periodontal diseases"	Aim: The aim of this clinical study was to compare adults with a healthy periodontium and those with chronic periodontitis, in terms of caries’ risk and caries’ clinical and microbiological measures. Methods: Ninety-six healthy adults were divided into chronic periodontitis (n= 38) and healthy periodontium (n=58) based on their periodontal status, and matched for age, gender, and ethnic background. Chronic periodontitis was defined as having at least four teeth with ≥1 site with a pocket depth ≥4 mm and clinical attachment loss ≥2 mm. Each group were subsequently subdivided in 2 groups according to their caries status: participants having at least one untreated decayed surface and those with no untreated caries.  Data were collected by means of self-administrated questionnaire, clinical examination, and supra- and subgingival plaque sampling. Assessments of oral levels of Streptococcus mutans and six periodontal pathogens were conducted by PCR amplification techniques. Data were analyzed using descriptive and bivariate statistical tests. Results: Individuals with chronic periodontitis were 3.5 times more likely to have caries than healthy individuals (OR 3.5; CI: 1.5 – 8.3; P = 0.006). Subjects with both chronic periodontitis and dental caries had a significantly lower level of education than periodontally healthy subjects without dental caries (OR 6.0; CI: 1.7 – 21.7; P = 0.04). A significant higher proportion of subjects with high oral levels of Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. g.) and Treponema denticola (T. d.) was found among subjects with chronic periodontitis and untreated caries compared to periodontally healthy subjects with untreated caries (P. g.: OR 8.6; CI: 2.4 – 30.3; P = 0.004 and T. d.: OR 10.0; CI: 2.6 – 38.1; P = 0.003).  Conclusion: The results from this study suggest that, adults with chronic periodontitis are more prone to caries disease than those adults with a healthy periodontium. Furthermore, low educational level could have a negative impact on the periodontal status of individuals.

1152	Rivalité et marchés : une éthique adversative pour les agents économiques	The argument of my thesis can be summarised as follows: in the context of rivalry, an agent may attempt to satisfy his or her preferences at the expense of other agents’ preferences if this generates social benefits that could not be generated otherwise (without producing too much harm). This argument leads to an adversarial ethics, that is, a description of our moral obligations in contexts like a sport competition or a trial. This ethics will be developed and applied to the behavior of economic agents in the market. I will address two main questions. The first question focuses on the design of our social institutions. An adversarial scheme is a pattern of social interactions that fulfills its function through a dynamic of rivalry. Parts of our institutions can be modeled as adversarial schemes. When is it desirable to use these schemes? It is desirable if the balance between the scheme’s functionality and harms is 1) acceptable and 2) preferable by comparison with other schemes. These two conditions yield a test. The test is developed in the first chapter. The second chapter argues that the market passes this test. An agent must be allowed to adopt adversarial behaviors in an adversarial scheme. But this permission does not apply to his or her behavior outside the scheme or inside non-adversarial incorporated schemes (like a firm in the market or a team in sport competitions). These two criteria, once combined, yield a threefold distinction or a tripartition of the moral obligation of economic agents, which solves some of the problems with the shareholder primacy view and the stakeholder theory. The tripartition and its implications are presented in the third chapter. The second question focuses on our moral obligations at the personal level. How ought we to behave in an adversarial scheme? In the fourth chapter, I argue that we ought to adopt the ideal of beneficial rivalry, which implies that we ought to: 1) contain our adversarial behaviors inside the scheme, 2) respect the scheme’s rules and 3) adopt a behavior that will allow the scheme to pass the desirability test (developed in the first chapter). The fifth chapter argues that this ideal avoids some of the problems with Joseph Heath’s ideal of healthy competition and Lynn Sharp Paine’s ideal of positive competition.	efficience , ethics and economics , business ethics , sport ethics , lawyers ethics , adversarial ethics , rivalry , exclusive preference , market , competition , efficiency	en	8712.0
1153	Conscience and Attestation : The Methodological Role of the “Call of Conscience” (Gewissensruf) in Heidegger’s Being and Time	This study aims to exhibit the methodological role that Martin Heidegger assigns to conscience (Gewissen) in Being and Time and to reveal the implications of his interpretation of the “call of conscience” as the means of producing the attestation (Bezeugung) of authentic existence as a possibility of Being-in-the-world (or Dasein). We begin by seeking to understand how Heidegger’s notion of conscience evolved prior to the 1927 publication of Being and Time and to identify the sources which contributed to his interpretation of conscience as the “call of care.” Our historical analysis notably reveals that Heidegger never once describes conscience as a “call” before reading Das Gewissen (1925) by Hendrik G. Stoker, a young South African philosopher who studied under Max Scheler’s direction at the University of Cologne. We specifically examine how Stoker’s phenomenological study—which describes conscience as the “call-of-duty” issued to each human being by the divine “spark” (synteresis) placed in his or her soul by God—contributed to shaping Heidegger’s account of the “existential call.” Focusing on the methodological role of conscience in Being and Time, we analyze Heidegger’s major work in light of his early lectures on phenomenology at Freiburg and Marburg. This approach confirms the relation between conscience in Being and Time and the concept of “formal indication” that Heidegger placed at the heart of his evolving “method” of phenomenological investigation. While many commentators have argued that Heidegger’s “call of conscience” is solipsistic and impossible to experience, we propose a way of reconsidering this apparent impasse by examining what Being and Time itself “formally indicates” with regard to conscience. We show that Heidegger’s conscience points to a phenomenon of existential “testimony” which is radically different from the traditional notion of conscientia. Guided by Heidegger’s “formal indication” of conscience, we “destructively” review the history of the German word Gewissen and reveal its original meaning to be “testimonium” not “conscientia.” In recognizing that Gewissen originally meant “attestation,” we show how Heidegger’s existential phenomenon of conscience can be understood as Dasein’s experience of hearing the “silent testimony” of the martyr.

1154	Langue de travail de la population immigrée recensée en 2006 dans la RMR de Montréal	Language of work is proven to be an important variable in order to explain how immigrants integrate to a society and in which language they communicate in public. In the province of Québec and especially in the Montreal CMA, the status of French as a widespread language of work remains unclear. This situation is driven by factors such as globalization, increasing use of technology and demographic trends and figures that help to strengthen the use of English in the public sphere. Therefore, this study will focus on examining Montreal CMA immigrants’ language of work. Some analysis will first provide an overview of immigrants’ language of work in 2006. Then, an emphasis will be put on the key variables explaining immigrants’ linguistic choices on the labour market. Those analyses will be performed using the 2006 Canadian census data. Among the main findings of the explanatory analysis, it should be noted that immigrants’ education and linguistic profile, their country of origin and period of immigration are the variables most strongly associated with the use of French, English or bilingualism at work in 2006. The descriptive analysis showed similar conclusions, reinforcing the major influence of the previously mentioned variables. Finally, this study is useful in assessing the situation of immigrants’ language of work and in suggesting changes to policies regulating immigration trends and immigrants’ linguistic integration.

1155	Apprentissage machine efficace : théorie et pratique	Despite constant progress in terms of available computational power, memory and amount of data, machine learning algorithms need to be efficient in how they use them. Although minimizing cost is an obvious major concern, another motivation is to attempt to design algorithms that can learn as efficiently as intelligent species. This thesis tackles the problem of efficient learning through various papers dealing with a wide range of machine learning algorithms: this topic is seen both from the point of view of computational efficiency (processing power and memory required by the algorithms) and of statistical efficiency (n umber of samples necessary to solve a given learning task).The first contribution of this thesis is in shedding light on various statistical inefficiencies in existing algorithms. Indeed, we show that decision trees do not generalize well on tasks with some particular properties (chapter 3), and that a similar flaw affects typical graph-based semi-supervised learning algorithms (chapter 5). This flaw is a form of curse of dimensionality that is specific to each of these algorithms. For a subclass of neural networks, called sum-product networks, we prove that using networks with a single hidden layer can be exponentially less efficient than when using deep networks (chapter 4). Our analyses help better understand some inherent flaws found in these algorithms, and steer research towards approaches that may potentially overcome them. We also exhibit computational inefficiencies in popular graph-based semi-supervised learning algorithms (chapter 5) as well as in the learning of mixtures of Gaussians with missing data (chapter 6). In both cases we propose new algorithms that make it possible to scale to much larger datasets. The last two chapters also deal with computational efficiency, but in different ways. Chapter 7 presents a new view on the contrastive divergence algorithm (which has been used for efficient training of restricted Boltzmann machines). It provides additional insight on the reasons why this algorithm has been so successful. Finally, in chapter 8 we describe an application of machine learning to video games, where computational efficiency is tied to software and hardware engineering constraints which, although often ignored in research papers, are ubiquitous in practice.

1156	La construction de l’identité personnelle et sociale des jeunes parents lors de la fondation d'une famille	The goal of this study is to understand the process of construction and transformation of personal and social identity in young parents following the entry in parenthood. It focuses on the impact that parenthood has on the perception of self in the different spheres of intimacy. What distinguishes this study is the focus on young couples who have grown within a traditional parental model that has become more difficult to reproduce given social changes, such as the entry of women in the labor market.  The study was conducted among ten participants (five couples) using semi-directive interviews. The participants were chosen according to the following criteria: be a heterosexual couple living together, be between 27 and 32 years of age, be the parent of a child between 2 and 4 years of age and be a resident outside of a metropolitan area. Additionally, at least one of the parents for each couple had to have a university degree.  The study confirms the ideas that, for fathers, the familial environment is a motivational factor in the decision of founding a family. Many experience a shock relative to the level of sacrifices they have to make as parents. However, the greatest shock was felt by women. Many of them felt really confused when faced with the many social pressures relative to their role as mothers or in the workplace. They also felt guilt when making their identity choices. Women's social circles were most affected following the birth of their first child, since they would surround themselves with other women who were in the same situation, thus having less time for they friends and relatives.

1157	L’image qui parle : comment traduire l’altérité par l’adaptation de la poésie au cinéma ?	The visual aspect in the Illuminations of Rimbaud brought us to ask us if it was possible to adapt these poems to the cinema. There were of course several researches on the cinema of the 20s which investigated the poetic creation. Other researches were led to find tracks of poetry in a little more conventional narrative movies. Although these studies are very interesting, we wanted to aim towards a more radical approach. Our research work aimed at finding the means to make an adaptation of completely autonomous poem of the original work. Although we bend over the Surrealist texts by the intervention of Man Ray, we also studied more recent attempts of adaptation of poems to the cinema. We discovered a link between these adaptations and the notion of otherness. That is why we decided to deal with our subject under the angle of the otherness of the philosophic point of view. Moreover, three movies which we retained for our research work present situations of marginalization. The marginalization is one of the aspects of the otherness which interest us. The first chapter of this thesis is intended to establish what we mean by otherness. In the second chapter, we approach the adaptation of the poetry to the cinema in connection with the otherness. We adapted eighteen poems of the Illuminations of Rimbaud under the shape of a scenario in the second part of this thesis to try to investigate what we established in our theoretical part.

1158	Algorithmes pour la reconstruction de génomes ancestraux	Ancestral genome inference is a decisive step for studying genome evolution. Knowing genomes from extinct species, one can propose biological mecanisms explaining divergences between extant species genomes. Various methods classified in two categories have been developped : distance based methods and synteny based methods. The state of the art of distance based methods only permit a certain repertoire of genomic rearrangements, thus synteny based methods are more appropriate in practice for the time being. We propose a synteny method for ancestral genome reconstruction based on a relaxed defenition of gene adjacencies, permitting unequal gene content in extant genomes caused by gene losses and whole genome duplications (WGD). Simulations results demonstrate our method’s ability to form a more assembled solution rather than a collection of contiguous ancestral regions (CAR) with respect to other methods, while maintaining a good reliability. Applications on data sets from yeasts and cereal species show results agreeing with other publications, notably the existence of nested chromosome fusion during the evolution of cereals.

1159	Évaluation d'un programme de formation en administration des services de soins infirmiers : le cas du Sénégal	All over the world providing a solid education to nurses is a necessity. In order to face the changes, a lot of countries are conceiving postgraduate programs. Around the world, training in management of nursing managers has become a necessity. To provide nursing leaders abilities to cope with change, many countries have developed training graduate programs in educational administration for the nursing services.  Several programs that are being developed in this direction are more or less valued. Several authors believe that evaluation of these programs would better appreciate the achievement of educational goals and ultimately, improve training and management practices. To contribute to the development of new skills that will surely meet the training needs and assist in real change, we propose to make this study which aims to evaluate the training program administration and teaching of the National School of Health and Social Development (ENDSS) of Senegal. This assessment takes into account the views of graduates, teachers, program designers and directions of hospitals. This is a retrospective evaluation research type. A questionnaire survey and interview was conducted with graduates, teachers, program designers and management head of the hospitals. Also, databases of students graduating between 2003 and 2009 were consulted to collect the scores on the certification exam, the number of admission and enrollment and demographic information. This assessment focuses on the major components of the training program Administration and teaching of ENDSS are evaluated through the systemic model of evaluation of educational program of Stufflebeam commonly known as CIPP model, which is retained as the reference of this study.  The results of the analysis based on 70 questionnaires and 37 interviews. In order to answer the research questions, the data are analyzed and interpreted using indicators and according to defined criteria. The process of analyzing the results was carried out in three stages. First, data from questionnaires and interviews provided by graduates, teachers and program designers are analyzed as well as the academic record of students enrolled in the program. Second, the review focused on questionnaire data collected from directions of hospitals. Finally, the opinions of all respondents on improvements to the program are analyzed to account for their recommendations thereon. Throughout the analysis of results, data from questionnaires and interviews are presented at a time. The verdict on the effectiveness of the training program Administration and teaching of ENDSS is determined by analysis of indicators related to four types of evaluation proposed by Stufflebeam (1981). Graduates and program designers believe that training is adequate for the exercise of the functions of head of nursing services. Consistency between the concepts of the module Management of health services and the exercise of the function of chief of nursing services is considered stronger in respect to several notions, by graduates, teachers and program designers. Graduates, as well as teachers believe in the majority, provided that supervision is inadequate. More than half of graduates and a majority of program designers believe that the material and didactic resources in the library do not facilitate learning the matter. However, students do well in their school leaving examination, particularly in the last four years reviewed. Teachers, graduates and program designers are satisfied with the training program Administration and teaching of ENDSS. Directions of hospitals are shared on the idea that students are prepared for function of chief of nursing services. In addition, as most of the directions of hospitals is not responding to the strategy of the hospital reform. They unanimously say that they were not involved in the process of developing the program and agree that, in general, the training received by the head of nursing services is quality. Unanimously, the directions of hospitals felt that the concepts should be added or improved in the training program administration and teaching-ENDSS. Interpretation of the data reveals the complexity surrounding the importance of balancing the number of hours to devote to the theory and practice in a training program. In addition, results on knowledge gain express a high need for development of further education or the content of notions Health Information System and Introduction to Computers, Introduction to Management, Program elaboration and Hospital administration. An appropriate choice of land where the student could achieve the learning objectives, a selection of the appropriate period for the course, and a signifier coaching, would be a profitable course for the student. We believe that this research has opened avenues for research perspectives related to professional development of future leaders of the nursing department.

1160	Étude du rôle des récepteurs NMDA du mésencéphale ventral dans la récompense induite par la stimulation électrique du mésencéphale postérieur chez le rongeur	The mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway, originating from the ventral midbrain and projecting to rostral limbic structures, is part of a neural substrate that controls reward and incentive behaviors. It has been suggested that the rewarding effect is produced by a tonic to phasic shift in dopamine cell firing and a transduction process initiated by the action of glutamate at the N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Given that an alteration in reward signaling is often associated with clinical symptoms of compulsive addictive behaviors and emotional disturbances such as anhedonia, we investigated the role of NMDA receptors in reward induced by intracranial electrical stimulation. Since NMDA receptors are composed of distinct subunits, GluN1, GluN2 and GluN3, we investigated the role of the main GluN2 subunits that are expressed in the ventral midbrain, GluN2A and GluN2B. Results show that ventral midbrain injections of R-CPP or PPPA, preferential GluN2A/2B antagonists, produce a dose-orderly enhancement of reward, an effect that was, at some time after the injection, accompanied by an increase in maximum response rates. These effects were not observed following ventral midbrain injections of a wide range of doses of the selective GluN2B antagonist, Ro-04-5595. These findings suggest that ventral midbrain glutamate exerts a negative modulation on reward induced by electrical stimulation of the posterior mesencephalon, an effect most likely mediated by NMDA receptors composed of GluN2A subunits.

1161	Complexité des homomorphismes de graphes avec listes	Constraint satisfaction problems, consisting in assigning values to variables while respecting a set of constraints, form a large class of natural problems. In order to study the complexity of these problems, it is convenient to see them as homomorphism problems on relational structures. One current research topic is to characterise complexity classes where the homomorphism problem belongs. The ultimate goal is to confirm conjectures that bind together algebraic properties of the relationnal structure and complexity of the homomorphism problem.   At first, the thesis characterizes digraphs which generate FO list-homomorphism problems. It is shown that in the particular case of telescopic digraphs, conjectures binding together algebra and complexity are confirmed.   Subsequently, we characterize graphs which generate arc-consistency solvable list-homomorphism problems. We introduce the notion of monochromatic polymorphism and we propose a simple algorithm which solves the list-homomorphism problem if the target graph admits a monochromatic TSI polymorphism of arity k for every k ≥ 2.	complexity , digraph , list-homomorphism , polymorphism , constraint satisfaction problem	en	8585.0
1162	Le suivi des jeunes contrevenants dans la communauté : les interventions favorisant la généralisation des acquis suite au Programme alternatives à la violence	For a little more than a decade, the Direction of Specialized Services and Young Offenders Services of the Montreal Youth Center advocates the use of the cognitive-behavioral approach. This approach has proved its effectiveness towards the youth subjected to the Youth Criminal Justice Act. One of the general objectives of this approach is to promote the acquisition of new prosocial behaviors and the generalization of these behaviors in the natural environment to protect the society and prevent recidivism of the adolescent. This report is centered on the identification of intervention methods that favour the generalization of gains, which is a topic that has not been thoroughly studied in criminology intervention research. To achieve this study, three adolescents participating in the Aggression Replacement Training (ART) were followed. The ART program seeks the learning of violent behavior alternative techniques and abilities. It is intended for adolescents convicted of violent offenses by the Youth Division of the Quebec Court. Following a literature review several intervention techniques were selected and applied to the rehabilitation program of the delinquents: overlearning, role-plays, stimulus variability, incorporating aspects of real life setting. These cases analysis suggests that the combination of these techniques with the cognitive-behavioral approach can lead to the generalization of the offender’s gains. Furthermore we noticed that the family involvement, the adolescent motivation and the therapeutic alliance also have an influence on the generalization of gain.

1163	La détermination d’un sous-groupe de contrevenants de la conduite avec capacités affaiblies à risque élevé de récidive : l’utilité de l’axe hypothalamo-hypophyso-surrénalien	Among driving while impaired (DWI) offenders, the risk of recidivism varies greatly. In order to overcome the heterogeneity among this population, the present thesis proposed a renewed conceptualization of DWI. More specifically, a model integrating disinhibitory personality traits and high-risk behaviours associated with DWI recidivism and the categorization of a high-risk subgroup of offenders based on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity has been proposed. Three manuscripts aimed to answer these general objectives using salivary cortisol, that is, the stress hormone.   In the first manuscript, the current HPA axis literature of DWI offenders and other high-risk populations have been merged into a comprehensive theoretical model. Previous studies have demonstrated an inverse correlation between DWI convictions frequency and cortisol reactivity to stress. Among recidivists, cortisol reactivity was partially explained by experience seeking, a sensation seeking dimension. Beyond this disinhibitory personality trait, low HPA axis activity has been linked to various traits (e.g., impulsivity and antisocial tendencies) and high-risk behaviours (e.g., traffic infractions, criminal arrests, and psychoactive drugs). By incorporating cortisol reactivity, this model stimulates a thorough conceptualization of several DWI offenders’ characteristics and as such, explains hypothetically repetition of high-risk behaviours.  The following manuscripts are less theoretical and more empirical. The detection of a high-risk recidivism subgroup delineated with HPA axis activity has been investigated among two DWI offender populations. More specifically, the second manuscript hypothesized that among DWI recidivists (n = 30), low cortisol responders have more characteristics linked to recidivism such as disinhibitory personality traits and high-risk behaviours than high cortisol responders (as defined by the area under the curve sensitive to total hormonal release and to response to stimulation). This hypothesis was not supported. On the contrary, low cortisol DWI recidivists have less traffic infractions and criminal arrests than high cortisol recidivists. Finally, the third manuscript investigated a similar hypothesis but this time, among first-time DWI offenders (n = 139). Results demonstrated that low cortisol offenders have more attentional impulsiveness, non-planning impulsiveness, criminal arrests and cigarettes consumed per day than high cortisol offenders (as defined by post-stress minus pre-test episode). An exploratory analysis showed a more prevalent variety of disinhibitory personality trait and high-risk behaviours among low cortisol offenders compared to a non-DWI comparator group (n = 31). These results reinforce the potentially higher recidivism risk of this first-time DWI offenders subgroup.  Neurobiological mechanism usefulness in modelling disinhibitory personality trait and high-risk behaviours of DWI offenders has been investigated in the present thesis. Additionally, detection of a high-risk recidivism subgroup seems more relevant among heterogeneous first-time DWI offenders. Instead, HPA axis activity is not as useful in detecting a problematic subgroup among the most severe offenders, namely recidivists.

1164	Vers un cinéma immatériel : réminiscences du cinématographique dans l’œuvre d'Olafur Eliasson	It is now common to acknowledge that cinema, today, is emancipated from its traditional media figure, adopting various forms related to the cultural fields that welcome it : video games, web, portable medias, etc. However, it is perhaps the visual and media contemporary arts that have morphed it, since the late sixties, into the most disembodied forms, even sometimes beyond recognition. To this end, some contemporary sculptures and installations only composed of light and steam seem, by their own means, to have adopted, and simultaneously put to the test, some characteristics of the cinematographic medium. Based on this observation, this paper aims to analyze, on an aesthetic level, this relationship between media-cinema and the nature of these immaterial artworks. To do so, our analysis will be divided into three chapters focusing respectively on : 1) the expansion of the cinema and its requalification as seen by intermedial theories, 2) the cinema’s loss of its images and materials in some visual art practices since the last fifty years, and 3) the artistic corpus of Danish artist Olafur Eliasson, and more precisely his work entitled Din Blinde Passenger (2010), which is intimately related to our subject matter. Finally, our reflection will mainly be guided by the aesthetic and philosophical approaches of Georges Didi-Huberman and Jacques Rancière.

1165	Fabrication, caractérisation et étude électrochimique de microcapsules conductrices à base de dérivés carbazole aminés pour la conception de biopiles enzymatiques	The main objective of this thesis is the development of a conductive enzyme immobilisation template for laccase through microencapsulation allowing an efficient electron transfer between the enzyme and the electrode for application in biofuel cells. First, p-phenylenediamine was used as substrate for the characterisation of the microencapsulated laccase. The diffusion of this substrate through the microcapsules was studied under various conditions by means of its electrochemical and enzymatic oxidation processes in order to assess its reversibility and stability. Cyclic voltammetry, rotating disk electrode and Clark electrode were the techniques used in this study. Moreover, poly(aminocarbazole) compounds and their derivatives were identified to replace poly(ethyleneimine) in the fabrication of the microcapsules. These polymers exhibit primary amines (mono- or di-amino) that could be available for an interfacial polymerisation using a cross-linker agent. Also, the monomer 1,8-diaminocarbazole presents the desired electrochemical propreties for an efficient electron transfer between the enzyme and the electrode. Therefore, a synthetic pathway was developed in order to synthesise this monomer since the available literature protocol was considered inappropriate for large scale synthesis. As for the direct synthesis of the poly(1,8-diaminocarbazole), to our knowledge, there is no protocol currently available. Two structural isomers (1,6 and 1,8-diaminocarbazole) were thus synthesised in two steps. The first step consists in the electrophilic substitution of 3,6-dibromocarbazole in 1,8 and/or 1,6 positions by nitro groups. This step was followed by a dehydrodehalogenation reaction that comes along with reduction of nitro to amino functions using Et3N and 10% Pd/C as the catalyst in methanol under H2 flux. During the first step, the 3,6-dibromo-1-nitro-carbazole was also obtained and appeared to be an efficient monomer in the synthesis of the desired conductive copolymer. Finally, the fabrication of the conductive microcapsules was realised by adding the copolymer poly[(9H-octylcarbazol-3,6-diyl)-alt-co-(2-amino-9H-carbazol-3,6-diyl)] to the PEI. This copolymer was synthesised in large quantities, which allowed its use in the design of microcapsules. Its electrochemical behaviour was similar in many ways to the one of poly(1,8-diaminocarbazole). These conductive microcapsules were then used to modify the surface of a platinum electrode to fabricate the bioelectrode. The main objective of this project was achieved through this final step.	laccase , microcapsules , 1,8-diaminocarbazole , 3,6-dibromo-1-nitro-carbazole , poly[(9H-octylcarbazol-3,6-diyl)-alt-co-(2-amino-9H-carbazol-3,6-diyl)] , p-phenylenediamine , poly(ethyleneimine) , cyclic voltammetry , microcapsules , Clark electrode , bioelectrode	en	8477.0
1166	Étude fonctionnelle du cotransporteur Na+/glucose (hSGLT1) : courant de fuite, vitesse de cotransport et modélisation cinétique	The results presented in this thesis clarify certain functional aspects of the Na+/glucose cotransporter (SGLT1), a membrane protein which uses the downhill electrochemical gradient of Na+ ions to drive the accumulation of glucose in epithelial cells of the small intestine and the kidney. We first used two microelectrodes electrophysiology on Xenopus oocytes to indentify the ionic species mediating the leak current of SGLT1, a current measured in the absence of glucose that is uncoupled from the strict 2 Na+/1 glucose stoichiometry characterising cotransport. Our results showed that cations such as Li+, K+ and Cs+, which interact weakly with SGLT1 binding sites and are unable to generate the conformational changes that are triggered by Na+ binding, were however able to generate leak currents similar in amplitude to the one measured in the presence of Na+. This suggests that the leak current permeating through SGLT1 does so using a pathway that differs from the conformational changes associated with Na+/glucose cotransport. Moreover, it was found that the cationic leak and the passive water permeability could share a common pathway. We then sought to estimate the turnover rate of SGLT1 using the ion-trap technique, where a large tip ion-selective electrode (~100 μm) is pushed against the oocyte plasma membrane, thus enclosing a small volume of extracellular solution referred to as the trap. The variations in ionic concentration occurring in the trap as a consequence of SGLT1 activity made it possible to assess that the turnover rate of Na+/glucose cotransport was 13 s-1 when the membrane potential was clamped to -155 mV. As a last project, we focused our interest on the development of a kinetic model for SGLT1. Taking advantage of the simulated annealing algorithm, we constructed a 7-state kinetic scheme whose predictions accurately reproduced the currents of the cotransporter as a function of extracellular Na+ and glucose. According to our model, the rate limiting step of cotransport under a saturating glucose concentration is the reorientation of the empty carrier that follows the intracellular release of substrates.

1167	"L’impact de l’action collective patronale sur les pratiques locales des organisations :
le cas de l’industrie de l’hôtellerie au Québec"	This research project is interested by the forms and the capacity of employer organizations to elaborate work rules at a sector level, precisely, the Hotel sector in Quebec. It also aims to have a better understanding how these rules contribute to change the local industrial relation practices of their members. Our first research question is looking to target the impacts of the logic of representation and actions of the employer organization on the industrial relations practices. For some authors, especially Berhens and Traxler (2004 and 2007), Carley and al (2010) Charest, Laroche and Hickey (to be published), the logic of representation and action at the employer level are distinct from one to another and will influence in a different way the industrial relations practices.  Thus, the presence, the form and the role of an employer organization will have a significant impact on the industrial relation practices. The members are able to be influenced by the orientation of their association.    Our second research question will address the way the firms will use their power resources to influence the actions of employer organizations. The existing literature about this subject mentions that the management actors are holding multiple power resources being internal or external (Charest, Laroche and Hickey, to be published) are able to exercise an influence in the political institutions. We will attempt to verify if the more an association is able to mobilize its power resources, the more it will be able to influence the institutional context in which it’s acting   On the theoretical plan this research is based on ideas developed by neo-institutionalism theories. First, we acknowledge that the actors must react and adapt to changes that occur in their environment. They will develop different strategies in management actions coordination as well as work relation at a local level, based on their interpretation of these transformations (Traxler and Huemer 2007). Also we admit that the actors are able to mobilize their power resources to deploy strategic initiatives that can provoque changes inside their environment (Crouch, 2005) These institutional entrepreneurs are actively researching opportunities and power leverage to use to maximize their respective interest and also reduce the uncertainty issued from the environment (Campbell, 2004: Streeck and Thelen, 2005; Crouch, 2005). Our research also concedes that the actors holding the greater power inside a group, the project holders, will be able to modify the institutions in functions of their specific interests. It is specifically on this plan that our research wants to distinguish itself from the wider research it gets into.   On the empirical plan, this research will study the management actor in the hotel industry in the province of Quebec and targets three objectives: 1) produce the cartography of employer organizations in the hotel sector of the province of Quebec (form, structure, activities, missions etc.); 2) analyze the impact of the rules issued from the regulation process at the sector level on the local industrial relations practices; and 3) identify the dominant employers inside a sector and analyze the way that they arrive to modify the institution and the environment in which they act.   In order to meet our research objectives, we used a qualitative research methodology; the case study was specifically used. This method was processed in three steps; the preparation, the data collection and the interpretation (Merriam, 1998). Data for this research was collected in fall of 2011 from interviews with hotel managers and hotel association managers in the region of Montreal and Quebec City. A quantitative analysis of the interview content was made and linked to the literature review and our research propositions. To this end, we used the patterns matching Yin (1994). This allowed us to compare our observations with our research propositions.  It should be noted that since this research is a case study, some methodological limits specifically in the generalization of the results. It is hard to state that the results of this micro-analysis are extendable. On the other hand, the analysis helped to consolidate the model for future studies.	employer organizations , members , logic of representation , logic of influence (action) , industrial relations practices , power resources	en	8441.0
1168	Les déterminants de l'épuisement professionnel et des troubles musculosquelettiques et leur cooccurrence chez les policiers	This thesis was written in the scope of a multidisciplinary research aiming to develop better intervention tools and policies for management of mental health in the workplace. The main objective was to identify the determining factors of burnout, musculoskeletal disorders, and their associated comorbidity within a population of police officers. Four hundred and ten officers from the Service de Police de la Ville de Montreal (SPVM) were interrogated using a questionnaire based on standard tools in work-related mental health research. The organizational conditions (main independent variables for this study) were derived from validated theoretical models. The data analysis consists of a segmented approach that looks at the effect of each concept (decisional latitude, social support, demands, rewards, and overcommitment). This revealed that the effects of organizational conditions were unevenly distributed among the three dimensions of burnout (emotional exhaustion, cynicism and personal accomplishment). Moreover, it was observed that three different types of rewards described in the “Effort-Reward Imbalance Model” (Siegrist, 1996) also had uneven effects on the likelihood of burnout. According to our data, self-esteem rewards and the overcommitment phenomenon had the most significant impact on each of the three dimension of burnout and on its global index. Finally, our results show that self-esteem rewards are significantly related to the comorbidity of musculoskeletal disorders and burnout. However, we note that more specific research tools would enable further analysis of the effect of organizational conditions on musculoskeletal disorders and more detailed explanation of the comorbidity relationship between the two disorders.

1169	Agressivité physique à l'enfance et criminalité à l'âge adulte : effet modérateur de la consommation d'alcool et de cannabis à l'adolescence	Individuals exhibiting high levels of physical aggression during childhood are more at risk of criminal behaviors during adulthood regardless of the presence of several risk factors. Aggressive children are also more at risk of using psychoactive substances during adolescence. Studies of the relationship between substance use and crime have provided different conclusions, depending on the substance under consideration and depending on the category of crime. Alcohol consumption has been positively associated with crimes, both against people and against property. Cannabis consumption has been associated positively with crime against property and negatively with crime against people. This present study aimed at investigating the hypothesis that physical aggression manifested in childhood is associated with an increase in criminal charges during adulthood and that association is specific to the type of crime and moderated differentially by alcohol and cannabis use. To this end, 887 male participants from lower socioeconomic status were followed from age 6 to age 25. Multinomial logistic regressions indicate that individuals belonging to a moderate or a high trajectory of physical aggression during childhood are more likely to commit crimes later in adulthood. This association remains significant after control of family adversity and drug use. Alcohol and cannabis use during adolescence has no effect on this association. However, main effects of alcohol use on crimes against person and cannabis use on crimes against property are observed. The implications of these findings are discussed.

1170	"""The nothing that is"" : An Ethics of Absence Within the Poetry of Wallace Stevens"	This dissertation focuses on what I refer to as a “negative-space” of representation in the poetry of Wallace Stevens’s in order to explore what, contrary to the bulk of Stevens research to date, I understand to be a genuine politics of engagement.   Drawing on the philosophical writings of Emmanuel Levinas, I argue that Stevens’s emphasis on the representation of representation itself opens up a space beyond the rigid limitations of identity—what Levinas refers to as the “I of the same”—allowing genuine contact with the concept of “the infinite,” or “the Other.” Though Stevens staunchly opposed himself to the Romantic notion of sublime transcendence—of a space purported to exist outside the limits of the human imagination—he nonetheless concerns himself with the exploration of just such a space “beyond” individual identity. For Stevens, however, “transcendence” is always, necessarily, bound by the acknowledged restrictions of human language and imagination and therefore by the reality of the perceivable world. Any “transcendence” that is sought, or achieved, in Stevens’s work should not, therefore, be understood in the sublime sense intended by the earlier Romantics—a more apt connection can instead be made with the concrete and immediate transcendence described by Levinas as the “face to face.” Stevens’s concern for the concrete and the immediate is often expressed through his attention to the aesthetic qualities of language. His is indeed a poetry about poetry—but not in the limited, solipsistic sense that is often assumed.  In concentrating on the active, creative process inherent to writing and reading poetry, Stevens explores the nature of Being itself.  I compare this exploration in Stevens’s work to that of the draftsman, or to the artist’s sketch, and in my conclusion suggest the connections between Stevens’s investigative approach and contemporary visual artists who are also committed to the figuration of the creative process.  South African artist William Kentridge provides my chief example, due to his conviction that the method is linked intrinsically to political and social engagement.

1171	Pour un cinéma du «réel» : les films de fiction de Jean-Pierre et Luc Dardenne	"This master's thesis focuses on five fiction films directed by Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne: La promesse (1996), Rosetta (1999), Le fils (2002), L’enfant (2005) and Le silence de Lorna (2008). This research aims to analyze the problem of “the real” through these five films, arguing that although the real can’t be represented (Jacques Lacan), it can be targeted — and expressed — through the cinematic apparatus of the Dardenne.  In the first chapter, we explain how the films of Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne deploy a new fictionality that blurs the boundaries between document and fiction. In the second chapter, we place the Dardenne’s approach in the context of modern cinema and analyze the aesthetic aspects that set out the problem of the real in their cinema. The third chapter is dedicated to the Dardennian actor, a proper ""body character"" (Gilles Deleuze), who also participates in the expression of the non obvious character of the real."

1172	La faiblesse de volonté : conceptions classiques et dynamiques	This thesis explains, analyses and examines the classical and modern positions on the nature and causes of the weakness of will. Since Plato and Aristotle’s identification of the problem, many principles and propositions on the subject of practical rationality in general and motivation in particular have been examined in details. These principles and propositions are being discussed on the basis that they are still somewhat relevant to modern theories. An emphasis is made on what is now known as the standard conception of strict akrasia and its supposedly paradoxical nature.  We argue that a skeptical position toward strict akrasia cannot be based on one version or another of the preference-revealed theory and we demonstrate that a description of the decision process is necessary to assign an overall preference or a better judgment. We discuss the philosophical debate on internalist and externalist conceptions of the connection between better judgment and decision. We then argue that, based on experimental results in cognitive psychology and neuroscience, the externalist conception, although imperfect, is stronger. But these experimental results are not incompatible with the hypothesis that agents are maximizers when it comes to the satisfaction of their preference. This hypothesis continues to justify a form of skepticism toward strict akrasia. However, we strongly argue against this hypothesis and we demonstrate why maximization is not absolutely necessary to rational choice; therefore, we have to revise the standard conception of strict akrasia.  We then discuss Richard Holton’s influential theory on non-strictly akratic weakness of will. Although compatible with a non-maximizing conception, Holton’s theory tends to reduce episodes of weakness of will to irresolution cases.   Lastly, we introduce the theory of intertemporal choice, a more potent theory that describes and explains, with the same conceptual schema, both strict and non-strict akrasia. This schema concerns the properties of temporal distribution of akratic decision’s consequences and the prospective attitudes that motivate agents to make those decisions. Also, the structure of these distributions, along with the devaluation of the future, allows us to explain, clearly and simply, why weakness of will is irrational. We discuss the hypothesis that this devaluation of the future is due to a pure temporal preference and we mention a number of critical elements and rival hypothesis more in keeping with a cognitive approach to the problem.	motivation , philosophy , will , akrasia , decision , motivation , judgment , rationality , maximization , intertemporal	en	8415.0
1173	La musique traitée comme sujet dans le cinéma narratif, contemporain et occidental : réflexion et expérimentation autour d’une forme : la matérialisation de la musique	This work is divided in two parts. The first one, theoretical, studies music as the subject in the narrative, western and contemporary cinema, i.e., from the 1960s until today. The second part is a fictional movie of thirty minutes titled A Capella.  The scenario is included here in appendix. SYNOPSIS: Born with a vocal handicap, Hubert developed as time goes by a new technique of rehabilitation: the physiophony. Sophie, a young wounded dancer, tries this new method...  This document, consisting in the theoretical part, first summarizes the reflections of Michel Chion and Claudia Gorbman on the subject.  Then it presents the first draft of a typology on the subject organized around four categories: the musician, the music group, the place of music and the materialization of music.  This last category echoes well the practical part of this project and, as such, it will be developed furthermore in the third section. The interest of this work lies mainly in the bridges between theory and practice it creates, which will be treated in the fourth section.  The materialization of the music is analyzed from the voice of the main character, the movements of the dancer as well as the technique of rehabilitation, the physiophony. The challenges faced while screenwriting, directing the movie and composing the music will also be explained.	narration , cinema , music , narration , intermediality , materialization	en	8413.0
1174	Le cinéma omnistéréo ou l'art d'avoir des yeux tout le tour de la tête	This thesis deals with aspects of shooting, projection and perception of stereo panoramic cinema, also called omnistereo cinema. It falls largely in the field of computer vision, but it also in the areas of computer graphics and human visual perception.  Omnistereo cinema uses immersive screens to project videos that provide depth information of a scene all around the spectators. Many challenges remain in omnistereo cinema, in particular shooting omnistereo videos for dynamic scenes, polarized projection on highly reflective screens making difficult the process to recover their shape by active reconstruction, and perception of depth distortions introduced by omnistereo images.  Our thesis addressed these challenges by making three major contributions. First, we developed the first mosaicing method of omnistereo videos for stochastic and localized motions. We developed a psychophysical experiment that shows the effectiveness of the method for scenes without isolated structure, such as water flows. We also propose a shooting method that adds to these videos foreground motions that are not as constrained, like a moving actor. Second, we introduced new light patterns that allow a camera and a projector to recover the shape of objects likely to produce interreflections. These patterns are general enough to not only recover the shape of omnistereo screens, but also very complex objects that have depth discontinuities from the viewpoint of the camera. Third, we showed that omnistereo distortions are negligible for a viewer located at the center of a cylindrical screen, as they are in the periphery of the visual field where the human visual system becomes less accurate.	cinema , omnistereo , immersion , immersion , panoramic , stereo , computer vision , visual perception , active reconstruction , psychophysic experiment	en	8382.0
1175	Données nouvelles sur l’innervation à dopamine du striatum et son co-phénotype glutamatergique	Knowing that a subset of rat and mouse mesencephalic dopamine (DA) neurons expresses the mRNA of the vesicular glutamate transporter type 2 (VGLUT2), we used electron microscopic immunocytochemistry, after single or double labeling of the biosynthetic enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and of VGLUT2, to determine the presence of one and/or both proteins in axon terminals (varicosities) of these neurons and characterize their ultrastructural morphology under various experimental conditions. At first, young (P15) or adult (P90) rats, subjected or not to cerebro-ventricular administration of the cytotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) a few days after birth, were examined in order to investigate the role of VGLUT2 in DA neurons during normal and pathological development of these neurons. In the young rats, these studies revealed: i) the presence of VGLUT2 in a significant fraction of TH immunoreactive varicosities in the core of the nucleus accumbens and the neostriatum; ii) an increase in the proportion of dually labeled terminals in the nucleus accumbens following neonatal 6-OHDA lesion; iii) frequent double labeling of TH varicosities belonging to the aberrant DA innervation (neoinnervation) which develops in the substantia nigra following neonatal 6-OHDA lesion. Significant differences were also noted in the size of the axon terminals labeled for TH only, VGLUT2 only, or TH and VGLUT2. Finally, at this age (P15), all the dually labeled terminals appeared equipped with a synaptic membrane specialization, unlike the terminals labeled for TH or for VGLUT2 only. In a second step, we sought to determine the fate of the dual phenotype in adult rats (P90) subjected or not to the neonatal 6-OHDA lesion. In contrast with the observations made in young rats, we found: i) a complete absence of dually labeled terminals in the core of the nucleus accumbens and striatum of intact animals, as well as in the remains of the substantia nigra after neonatal 6-OHDA lesion; ii) a sharp decline of their number in the core of the nucleus accumbens of 6-OHDA-lesioned animals. These findings, suggesting a regression of the dual TH/VGLUT2 phenotype with age, reinforced the hypothesis of a specific role of the co-release of glutamate from midbrain DA neurons during development. Under these conditions, it was of considerable interest to examine the DA meso-striatal innervation in two strains of mice whose Vglut2 gene has been selectively invalidated in DA neurons, as well as in their control littermates and wild-type mice. This issue was particularly relevant with the increasing use of genetically modified mice in neurobiology; indeed, this DA innervation had never been systematically characterized by electron microscopy. Because of possible differences between the core and shell of the nucleus accumbens, the study included both parts of this nucleux as well as the striatum of young (P15) and adult (P70-90) mice of each strain, prepared for TH immunocytochemistry, and also for double labeling of TH and VGLUT2, according to the protocol previously used in rats. The results were surprising. At both ages, regardless of the genotype, the TH immunoreactive axon terminals of the three regions appeared comparable in size, vesicle content, percent with mitochondria, and exceeding low frequency of synaptic membrane specialization (5% of varicosities, on average). Thus, in mice, the regression of the dual phenotype might be even more precocious than in rats, unless the two proteins are segregated very early in different axon terminals of the same DA neurons. These data also strenghten the hypothesis of a diffuse (volume) transmission and of an ambient level of DA as determinant elements in the functioning of the meso-striatal DA system in mice as well as rats.

1176	Effets de la croissance des capacités respiratoires sur la longueur des énoncés et sur la diversité lexicale	Brown (1973) proposed the « mean length of utterance » (MLU) as a standard index of language development. MLU is calculated by counting the mean number of morphemes in 100 utterances of spontaneous speech. The underlying hypothesis of this index is that syntactic complexity rises with the number of morphemes in utterances. According to Brown, MLU indexes the development of a « grammatical competence » up to about four morphemes. However, authors have criticized the lack of reliability of the MLU and the limit of four morphemes. Reported variations in MLU with age also suggest that factors such as the growth of respiratory capacities can influence Brown’s index. The present study reviews those problems and examines how the MLU and certain measures of lexical diversity vary according to the development of respiratory capacities. We calculated the MLU and the lexical diversity in the spontaneous speech of 50 male speakers aged 5 to 27 years. We also measured, with a pneumotachograph, the vital capacity (VC) of the speakers. The results show that MLU and measures of lexical diversity strongly correlate with the growth of VC. Thus, the growth of respiratory functions constrains morphosyntactic and lexical development. Our discussion focuses on the necessity to revaluate the MLU index and a « linguistic » conception of language development as a mental competence emerging separately from the growth of performance structures.

1177	L’Anthropologie de l’Alcibiade de Platon : l’être humain considéré comme la partie rationnelle de son âme	What does it mean to be human? Plato is one of many to have pondered the eternal question and followed the famous Temple of Delphi inscription, “Know thyself.” While the quest for the essence of humanity is present in many of Plato’s writings, I believe that the Alcibiades gives us his clearest definition. Indeed, the entire ending of the dialogue is devoted to it, with Socrates enthusiastically offering his thoughts on the matter. Scholars are of different minds as to the proper interpretation of this somewhat obscure passage on the essence of human nature. Some argue that Plato is portraying man as primarily defined by his soul, others that the body and soul are both part of the definition of man, and others still, that man is the rational part of his soul. The three chapters of this thesis outline and analyze the main arguments of each school of thought in the hopes of resolving this contentious question. The argument will be made that in the Alcibiades, man is defined broadly as his soul, but more specifically as the dominant part of himself, his reason in other words. It will also be suggested that a similar portrayal of humanity is found in other works by Plato.	Alcibiade , Plato , Alcibiades , anthropology , self-knowledge , human nature , philosophy	en	8353.0
1178	Les déterminants de l’engagement de carrière par rapport à l’engagement organisationnel chez les professionnels en ressources humaines	The purpose of our research is to study the influence of the fulfillment of the employer’s promises in regard the employment conditions and the fulfillment of the employees’ expectations related to their practices roles on the organizational commitment as well as on the occupational commitment. Our study is empirical and based on a survey conducted among 636 HRP practicing in Quebec.    Our study uses the theoretical framework of the psychological contract suggesting the reciprocity of the mutual agreement between the employer and the employee has an impact on the workers’ behaviours including the organizational commitment. We are finding an interesting link to establish between the fulfilment of the promises related to the employment conditions and the expectations related to the professional roles.   Our findings reveal that fulfilment of the promises made by the employer in regard to the employment conditions will affect the organizational commitment and the occupational commitment. In particular, the fulfilment of the promises link to the work content and the social atmosphere will influence the affective commitment, whereas keeping promises related to external development has an impact on limited alternatives. Also, the fulfilment of the expectations associated to the professional roles will influence the organisational commitment and the occupational commitment. Particularly, the fulfilment of expectations related to business partner role has an influence on affective commitment.	psychological contract , violation , organizational commitment , occupational commitment , human resources professionals	en	8352.0
1179	"Pharmacothérapie de la douleur chronique non
cancéreuse chez des patients suivis en première ligne"	Background: Chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP) is highly prevalent and mostly managed in primary care. This study sought to describe the use of analgesics in primary care, the prevalence and management of adverse reactions, as well as patients’ satisfaction with treatment and their barriers to pain management. Methods: Patients reporting CNCP (pain for six months and more), present at least twice weekly, with an average pain intensity of at least 4 on a 0-10 scale(10=worst pain possible) and having an active analgesic prescription from a primary-care physician were recruited in a cohort study conducted in Quebec (Canada). They completed a telephone interview and a self-administered questionnaire to document the characteristics and impact of their pain, their emotional well-being, their satisfaction with pain treatment and beliefs/attitudes about pain and its management using validated measurement instruments. Information on pharmacotherapy was retrieved using an administrative provincial database and pharmacies’ charts. Results: A total of 486 patients participated in this study. Their mean age was 58.4 years(SD=12.5) and they had pain for 11.7 years (SD=11.1) with an average pain intensity of 6.5. Over a one year period, 52.9% of patients had analgesics prescriptions from two or three primary-care physicians. The most commonly dispensed analgesics were nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (72.2%) and opioids (65.6%). Though 90% reported adverse gastrointestinal effects, 36.4% and 54.4% of these patients took no medication for constipation or nausea, respectively. Patient satisfaction was low, particularly regarding information about pain and its treatment The most important patients’ barriers to optimal management included fear of harmful effects of analgesics. Conclusions: In primary care, the management of moderate to severe CNCP is not always optimal. It involves several primary-care physicians indicating that the management is presently complex and lack of coherence and continuity. The prevalence of adverse effects of pain medication is high and often left untreated, patients’ satisfaction is low, and patients are reluctant to take pain medication.

1180	Justice réparatrice et théorie de la responsabilité : problématique de la réconciliation dans un contexte de transition : les cas du Chili, de l’Argentine et de l’Afrique du Sud	The rulers of state policy emerging from conflict – civil war, dictatorship – face irreconcilable demands that their authors consider, however, essential. They face the requirements of criminal justice formulated by victims and the demands of impunity emanating from the perpetrators, often constituted by former officials in charge of the state. The punishment, indeed, does not allow neither the peace nor the democratization. It is therefore clear that the exit of the crisis can take ways other than the punishment. Restorative justice appears as a kind of justice that may grant the requests of offenders and offended by promoting the peace and the democratization. Yet it faces critics relating to the disempowerment of individuals and the criminalization of everyone in the execution of the committed crimes. The ultimate goal is to foster discussion between the offenders and the offended. It is, however, necessary to protect such a dialogue against the risk of instrumentalization. In Truth Commissions, the discourse turns essentially around the themes of human rights, apologies, forgiveness and amnesty. However the use of these concepts does not magically make disappeared the hatred of some victims.	Justice , Argentine , Reparations , Responsibility , Truth , South Africa	en	8338.0
1181	La souveraineté alimentaire dans le système-monde : une étude comparative des structures agraires cubaine et mexicaine	"Following the bursting of the subprime bubble in 2008, which is considered to be the turning point of this period of crisis, much attention has been focused on the global economic meltdown, masking the other consequences of the crisis which are as heavy and perverse as the rise of unemployment and the credit crunch (Carfantan 2009). This research is dedicated to the study of other aspects of the crisis as it evolves in the countryside, mostly dealing with the socio-political consequences of the global food crisis and the crisis of peasant societies. The focal point of this study concerns in particular the rise of the ""food sovereignty alternative"" which mounts a serious challenge to the dominant agri-food model of neo-liberalism in crisis (Desmarais 2008; Holt-Giménez 2009). Therefore, the present study seeks to reveal the socio-political determinants leading to the establishment of food sovereignty policies despite the pressure of the neo-liberal food regime. This thesis maintains that food sovereignty policies originate from peasant counter-movements which engender, in the first place, the establishment of a new agrarian domestic structure of ""popular-democratic"" and ""antisystemic"" nature, and secondly, the transnationalization of this structure so as to challenge the neo-liberal food regime in crisis. By adapting the intermediary theory of ""domestic structures"" to the critical study of agrarian structures on the basis three different variables (Risse-Kappen 1999), the thesis argues that the emergence of food sovereignty policies requires the decentralization of the decision-making and the collectivization of the agricultural sector through a radical and agro-ecological agrarian transformation (the ""political structure"" variable), as well as the emergence of a potent agrarian societal structure which is built on consensual political networks, in presence of a strong state and a mobilized agrarian civil society (the ""societal structure"" and ""policy networks"" variables). At the conceptual level, the research draws on the world-systems theory, and consists of a comparative study modeled on a contrasted case study approach which includes the case of Cuba, characterized by a strong resistance to challenges posed by the neo-liberal food regime, and Mexico, marked by the adoption of neo-liberal food policies."

1182	L'exigence de coopération dans les contrats internationaux de franchise	The duty to cooperate is emerging as a new legal concept intended to facilitate the performance of contractual agreements. By broadening the principles of good faith or common interest, the notion of cooperation could be seen as analogical to the notion of affectio societatis in the right of societies? This notion has developed in particular to support the globalization of economic exchanges, not only as a guide for contracting parties in the proper administration of their relationship, but also as a mode of interpretation or for dispute resolution. The duty to cooperate is an innovative notion designed to create an implicit cooperative, no longer antagonistic , attitude among the parties. This is could be best demonstrated by examining its development in the field of international franchising : for example, the parties to an international franchising agreement must adjust their business plan to the local market and culture, which obviously necessitates a cooperative entrepreneurial attitude. The dut y to cooperate should be understood as a key element in the proper performance of contractual agreements. It has already been acknowledged as such normative compone nt in international contractual law where it serves as a suppletive law in those cases where the letter of the contract is insufficient.

1183	Caractérisation de l'interaction de l'auto-antigène ADN topoisomérase I avec les fibroblastes dans la sclérose systémique	Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is an autoimmune disease of unknown etiology characterized by vascular damage, cellular and immunological disorders. The vast majority of patient sera are characterized by the presence of autoantibodies directed against nuclear proteins. The autoantibodies are associated with specific clinical manifestations and thus useful for diagnostic and classification of the disease. One of the major autoantibody groups are the anti-DNA topoisomerase I (anti-topo). They are associated with the diffuse form of the disease which is characterized by extensive cutaneous and visceral fibrosis. Increased extracellular matrix synthesis and deposition by fibroblast result in the development of fibrosis.   Although anti-topo are associated with the worst form of the disease, correlated with the activity and the severity of SSc, their exact role in the pathogenesis of SSc is controversial and still unravelled. On the other hand, there is now strong evidence for active contribution of autoantigens, targeted by autoantibodies, in autoimmune diseases. Indeed, numerous cells have been shown to be influenced by the interaction of autoantigens with their cognate receptors present on their surface. These autoantigens display cytokine-like effects toward their target cell and are called bifunctional autoantigen. Hence, determination of the exact role of these autoantigens and characterization of their interaction with their target cell may open up research perspectives for the elucidation of the potential pathogenic role of their autoantibodies.  In our study, we demonstrated that topo activates intracellular signaling pathways leading to the stimulation of fibroblast migration. We undertook experiments to characterize the interaction of the autoantigen topo with fibroblasts responsible of these cellular effects. Our results strongly suggest a direct interaction of topo with CCR7, a chemokine receptor, present on the surface of fibroblasts.  Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG), abundantly present on fibroblast surfaces, were found to act as coreceptors for topo binding. Previous work has demonstrated that once bound to fibroblast surfaces, topo recruits anti-topo autoantibodies, which subsequently lead to adhesion and activation of monocytes. Here, we demonstrated that anti-topo autoantibodies from SSc sera lead to the amplification of topo binding to HSPG on fibroblast surfaces. The binding of topo/anti-topo IC could mediate the initiation and maintenance of an inflammatory cascade and further fibrosis development.  Hence, perturbing the binding of topo/anti-topo immune complexes to HSPG became an interesting therapeutic approach. Heparin and low molecular weight heparins were found to prevent the binding of topo and topo/anti-topo immune complexes to the fibroblast surfaces. Moreover, topo/anti-topo immune complexes could be dissociated from fibroblast surfaces by these molecules. Hence, the prevention of topo/anti-topo immune complexes binding to HS chains could result in the absence of the inflammatory cascade initiation.  Overall, our results support an active role for topo as a bifunctional autoantigen toward fibroblasts and a pathogenic role for anti-topo autoantibodies in SSc. Finally, a potential therapeutic approach is proposed which could target inflammatory and fibrotic development characteristic of SSc.

1184	L’intégration de modalités sensorielles : l’influence de l’olfaction sur la vision	Most studies on perception isolate one sensory modality in order to better study and comprehend it. Unfortunately, none of our senses represents the only source of information, since sensory integration is underway at all times during environmental perception. The information from one sense is therefore usually in agreement with or in conflict with the input of information from other senses. The goal of the present study was to investigate, by fMRI, the cerebral activations caused by visual and olfactory integration when these two perceptions are congruent. To do this, an image and/or an odour were presented to the subject who then had the task of identifying whether the perceived stimulus was congruent. This protocol allowed the observation of the cerebral activations during stimulus analysis and decision-making depending on the congruity of the presented stimulus. The vision-odour congruent condition activated the visual and olfactory areas more strongly than the control conditions (image only, odour only). These results illustrate a potentialization of the visual and olfactory areas by an integration of the congruent information coming from these two modalities. As a result, the integration of a visual and olfactory congruent stimulus seems to enhance the perception of a stimulus.	Olfaction , Vision , Sensory integration , fMRI , Congruency	en	7107.0

This thesis aims to fill this gap through two empirical articles each addressing several research objectives. To this end, data were collected from two independent samples of candidates (Study 1, N = 111; Study 2, N = 153) who underwent an assessment center in a consulting firm specializing in industrial psychology. The first paper aims to test two theories related to self-esteem that oppose each other in terms of predicting cognitive reactions to feedback, self-enhancement and self-verification theories. To better understand this phenomenon, the influence of self-esteem and the objective valence of feedback on the two components of cognitive appropriation of the feedback in assessment settings, acceptance and awareness, was tested. The results support the postulates of self-enhancement theory when it comes to predicting the acceptance of feedback. In contrast, the results offer little support for self-evaluation theory in the prediction of awareness with regard to feedback. The second article aims to identify levers that could be used to positively influence the reactions of individuals with low self-esteem. To do this, two variables related to the influence of the source were targeted: perceived credibility and practices of constructive confrontation. This article includes two studies, the first aimed at validating an instrument measuring the perceived credibility of the source and the second examining the relationship between three determinants, namely self-esteem of the candidate, the perceived credibility of the source, and the practice of constructive confrontation, and two cognitive reactions to feedback, acceptance and awareness. Results of the first study indicate that the perceived credibility scale has satisfactory psychometric properties and support a single-factor structure. The results of the second study suggest that the three determinants studied were positively related to acceptance and awareness. The results also show that perceived credibility attenuates the relationship between self-esteem and acceptance, and constructive confrontation moderates the relationship between self-esteem and both acceptance and awareness. Finally, perceived credibility and constructive confrontation interact in the prediction of awareness, thus emphasizing the importance of establishing credibility to increase the positive effect of constructive confrontation. The theoretical and conceptual contributions of each article, as well as practical implications, are discussed separately and included in an overall conclusion. The impact of this thesis on both research and intervention is also addressed in this final section.	self-esteem , valence , perceived credibility , constructive confrontation , cognitive appropriation , feedback , assessment	en	7102.0
1186	Lewis’ Theory of Counterfactuals and Essentialism	Modern logic since the end of the Second World War has undergone many developments.  Two of the most interesting of these are the Kripkian Possible World Semantics and Lewis’ system of Counterfactuals.  The first was developed by Saul Kripke in the 1960s and the second was developed by David Lewis in the 1970s.  In some senses we can say that Lewis’ system of counterfactuals or Counter Factual Semantics (CFS) is built on top of the architecture which Kripke created with his Possible Worlds Semantics (PWS).  But, what is the Kripkian Possible World Semantics itself built on?  The answer it seems is very finely tuned ontology founded on the notion of possible worlds.  This paper will attempt to do the following. First, attempt to draw a distinction between on the one hand conditionals and the other counterfactuals and at the same time attempt to look at some of the historical literature surrounding counterfactuals and their application in various fields like the philosophy of science.  Second, recapitulate Lewis’ system of counterfactual semantics as developed primarily in Lewis’ book Counterfactuals.  Finally this paper will attempt to explore the metaphysical foundations of the possible worlds account argued for by David Lewis in his conception of Modal Realism.

1187	Implication de DC-SIGN et DC-SIGNR dans la transmission mère-enfant du VIH-1	Mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) is the main cause of HIV-1 infection in children worldwide. MTCT of HIV-1 can occur during pregnancy (in utero, IU), delivery (intrapartum, IP) or breastfeeding (postpartum, PP). Dendritic cell-specific ICAM-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) and its homolog DC-SIGN related (DC-SIGNR) are attachment receptors for HIV-1 and are expressed in the placenta. They have been implicated in viral capture and transmission to T cells. To investigate the potential role of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR in MTCT of HIV-1, we carried out a genetic association study in a well-characterized cohort of 197 HIV-infected mothers and their infants recruited in Harare, Zimbabwe.  Infants harbouring two copies of DC-SIGNR H1 and/or H3 haplotypes (H1-H1, H1-H3, H3-H3) had a 4-fold increased risk of IU and 6-fold increased risk of IP HIV-1 infection after adjusting for a number of maternal factors. The implicated H1 and H3 haplotypes share two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in promoter region (p-198A) and intron 2 (int2-180A) that were associated with increased risk of both IU and IP HIV-1 infection. The promoter variant reduced transcriptional activity in vitro. In homozygous H1 infants bearing both the p-198A and int2-180A mutations, we observed a 4-fold decrease in the level of placental DC-SIGNR transcripts, disproportionately affecting the expression of membrane-bound isoforms compared to infant noncarriers. Infants carrying H4 and H6 haplotypes in DC-SIGN gene were more likely to be HIV-1-infected during pregnancy. These haplotypes contain promoter variants (p-336T/C and p-201C/A) and exon 4 variants (R198Q, E214D, R221Q and L242V) that were all significantly associated with increased risk of MTCT of HIV-1. Compared with wild-type sequence, the promoter variants reduced both the DC-SIGN transcription in vitro and expression (2-fold) in placental macrophages of HIV-1-unexposed infants. However, in HIV-1-exposed infants, the level of DC-SIGN expression in placental macrophages was similar in infants carrying either the promoter wild-type or variant sequences. Exon 4 variants increased HIV-1 capture and transmission to T cells in vitro. Association between DC-SIGN SNPs and HIV-1 IP and PP infection also suggests that DC-SIGN plays an important role in intestinal mucosa. This is the first study reporting on functional impact of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR natural polymorphisms on HIV-1 transmission from mother-to-child. Decreased levels of expression of membrane DC-SIGNR isoforms at the placental endothelial cell surface increased child susceptibility to HIV-1. Presence of DC-SIGN variants increasing its affinity for the virus augmented child susceptibility to HIV-1 and may favour viral dissemination across the placental barrier. This study provides compelling evidence to support an important role of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR in various modes of MTCT of HIV-1 and shed light on the possible mechanisms involved in HIV-1 passage from mother-to-infant. These findings raise the possibility that similar mechanisms may operate with other human pathogens known to interact with DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR.

1188	La protéine Nef du VIH-1 altère la fonction de Lck dans les thymocytes de souris transgéniques	HIV-1 Nef protein plays an essential role in the HIV-1 pathogenesis by modulating the host signaling transduction pathways. TcR signalling is important for the thymic selection process to CD4 and CD8 single positive T cells and is greatly dependent on the activity of Src kinase Lck and its ability to bind to CD4 and CD8 cytoplasmic tail. We previously found that expression of HIV or SIV Nef can induce severe thymocytes depletion and downregulation of CD4 expression in Nef+ mice. We also recently showed that Nef blocks generation of double positive thymocytes and impairs DP to CD4+ SP T cells transition. The reversal of this phenotype was accomplished by several approaches, among them by crossing Nef+ mice with mice expressing constitutively active Lck Y505F. These results imply that the maturation of CD4+ T cells is disrupted due to impairment of Lck-mediated CD4 receptor signaling. However, the molecular mechanisms by which Nef contributes to the impairment in thymic CD4 generation remains largely unclear.  In this study, using confocal microscopy and biochemical approaches, we found that Nef+ thymocytes express more Lck than the Nef- control. Despite of this increase, a significant portion of Lck molecules were unable to reach to the plasma membrane. It was significantly accumulated in the intracellular endosomal compartment of the Nef+ thymocytes. Moreover, using IVKA we found that the activity of Lck is significantly increased in Nef+ thymocytes but was not further increased upon stimulation by α-CD3ε, α-CD4 or α-CD3ε + α-CD4. Moreover, compared to Nef- controls, Lck kinase in Nef+ thymocytes was resistant to degradation upon stimulation. Examining the status of c-Cbl, the main negative regulator of Lck, showed that c-Cbl localized with Lck poorly, despite his constitutive hyperphosphorylation. This explains the failure of Lck degradation. In addition, we found that upon stimulation, Zap-70 phosphorylation at tyrosine 493 by Lck is decreased, resulting by a decrease of Zap-70 kinase activity and TcR proximal event block. These data indicate that CD4-Lck signaling was interrupted by the presence of Nef.	Hiv-1 , Nef , thymocytes , Lck , Zap-70	en	7040.0
1189	Investigating the role of the isomerase Rrd1/PTPA : from yeast to human	In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, mutants devoid of Rrd1, a protein possessing in vitro peptidyl prolyl cis/trans isomerase activity, display striking resistance to rapamycin and show sensitivity to the DNA damaging agent 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide. PTPA, the mammalian homolog of Rrd1, has been shown to activate protein phosphatase 2A. Our laboratory previously found that overexpression of PTPA leads to apoptosis independently of PP2A. At the outset of my thesis work, the molecular function of Rrd1/PTPA was largely unknown. My work has shown that Rrd1 is associated with the chromatin and interacts with RNA polymerase II. In vitro and in vivo analysis with circular dichroism revealed that Rrd1 mediates structural changes of the C-terminal domain of the large subunit of RNA pol II, Rpb1, in response to rapamycin and 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide. Consistent with this, we demonstrated that Rrd1 is required to alter RNA pol II occupancy on rapamycin responsive genes. We also showed that upon rapamycin exposure Rrd1 mediates the degradation of RNA polymerase II and that this mechanism is ubiquitin-independent.  Another part of my work was to gain insight into the function of PTPA, the mammalian counterpart of Rrd1. PTPA knockdown did not affect sensitivity to rapamycin, 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide or H2O2. We also attempted to find protein interaction partners for PTPA using tandem affinity purification, but no stable partners for PTPA were found. We also demonstrated that overexpression of a catalytically inactive PTPA mutant did not induce apoptosis, indicating that PTPA activity is required to produce this effect. Finally, we attempted to study PTPA in a mouse model. We first determined that PTPA was expressed in a tissue-specific manner and was most abundant in bone marrow, thymus and brain. We pursued creation of a knockout mouse and successfully generated chimeras, but the mutated allele was not transmitted to the germline.  My data and other data from our laboratory regarding the yeast work suggest a general role for Rrd1 in regulation of gene transcription. Whether PTPA has a similar function in mammalian cells remains unknown, and a different vision of what the protein does in mammalian cells will be required to adequately address this question in the future.

1190	Étude de l’association supramoléculaire bi- et tridimensionnelle d’oximes et d’hydrazones trigonales	The concepts of supramolecular chemistry can be exploited advantageously to control the structure and properties of molecular materials. In a productive approach, the molecular components of a material can be specifically selected to engage in strong and predictable interactions with their neighbours. This strategy, called molecular tectonics, is based on designing particular molecules called tectons (from the Greek word tectos, meaning builder) that self-associate in predictable ways via multiple non-covalent interactions, thereby generating a desired architecture. This process is reversible and guided by the presence of complementary chemical functions, named supramolecular synthons, specifically oriented to direct intermolecular interactions. This predisposes neighbouring molecules to be positioned in a predetermined fashion. The constraints arising from these interactions often tend to counter the natural tendency of molecules to form compact structures, thereby leaving significant volume within the material for guest molecules that do not directly contribute to the main architecture. When applied to crystallisation, this approach can generate potentially porous crystals similar to zeolites.  Hydrogen bonds are an ideal non-covalent interaction for the strategy of molecular tectonics because of their strength and directionality. The field of crystal engineering has evolved greatly through exploration of various chemical functions known to assemble through hydrogen bonds. Such exploration has revealed a variety of new materials. A classic molecule that well represents the tectonic strategy and has had a larger impact in the field of supramolecular chemistry is benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylic acid, commonly referred to as trimesic acid. Trimesic acid imparts a trigonal orientation to three carboxyl groups (COOH), favouring the formation of a hexagonal network supported by hydrogen bonds characteristic of these groups.  We aimed to replace the COOH groups of trimesic acid by less-commonly used synthons in supramolecular chemistry derived from oximes and hydrazones. Herein, we report the synthesis and crystallisation of a series of trigonal trioximes and trihydrazones analogous to trimesic acid. Crystals were analysed by X-ray diffraction and their structures were determined. Self-assembly of the trioximes and trihydrazones in 2D by adsorption on graphite was also studied by scanning tunnelling microscopy. Together, our results enabled us to compare the 2D and 3D organisation of different analogues of trimesic acid.

1191	Caractérisation du décalage du cadre de lecture de la protéine ataxine-3	Coding CAG repeat disorders have been associated with nine neurodegenerative disorders. Our group has previously shown that during the translation of mutant ataxine-3 (Atx3), the protein involved in Spinocerebellar Ataxia type 3 (SCA3), a ribosomal frameshift occurs and leads to the reading of a GCA frame rather than a CAG frame. This new reading frame causes the production of polyalanine in the polyglutamine peptide which increases its toxicity. Ribosomal frameshifts are known to occur in all organisms but little is known about this phenomenon in human. To study ribosomal frameshift along the ATXN3 transcript, we generated a transgenic Drosophila model in which we looked at the toxicity of the mRNA. Also, we developed a toeprinting assay to precisely evaluate where the change of reading frame occurs along the mRNA. Our results suggest that the toxicity observed in our Drosophila model results from the production of polyalanine and not from the presence of the mRNA per se. Moreover, the change in reading frame seems to occur at the 48th CAG codon and this pausing of the ribosome also occurs in other polyQ tracts. Because CAG repeat disorders share many characteristics, an alteration of the frameshift could alleviate symptoms of SCA3 patients as well as of many other diseases with coding CAG repeats.

1192	Impact du bicarbonate de sodium sur la prévention de la néphropathie induite par le produit de contraste en chirurgie endovasculaire pour anévrysme de l’aorte	Background: The endovascular approach for the repair of aortic aneurysm involves the administration of large quantities of contrast media, which can cause contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) in the post operative period. The only proven strategy to prevent CIN is intravenous hydration, but what type of infusion to use is not clear. We evaluated the efficacy of sodium bicarbonate, compared with NaCl 0.9%, to reduce the incidence of postoperative renal failure. Methods: We conducted a prospective, controlled, double-blind, randomized study in patients presenting for endovascular aortic aneurysm surgery. Patients in group A (n = 17) received sodium bicarbonate 3 mL/kg/h for 1 h before the procedure and then 1 mL/kg/h until 6 h after surgery, whereas patients in group B (n= 17) received the same amount of NaCl 0.9%. All patients received N-acetylcysteine. The primary end point was CIN, defined by serum creatinine greater than 25 % above baseline 48 h post operatively.  Biomarkers of renal injury were measured. Results: CIN developed in one patient in the bicarbonate group (5,88%), compared with no patient in the NaCl 0,9% group (0%) (difference 5.88%;95% CI -5.3% to 17.06%, P = 0.31). Interleukin-18, N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase and Kidney Injury Molecule-1 increased significantly in both groups after exposure to contrast media.    Conclusions: We demonstrated a low rate of renal failure following endovascular aortic surgery using contrast media, regardless of whether bicarbonate or NaCl 0.9% was used for hydration, despite significant elevation in biomarkers of renal injury.	cystatine c , interleukine 18 , KidneyInjury Molecule-1 , N-acétyl-β-D-glucosaminidase , Neutrophilgelatinase-associatedlipocalin , Aortic aneurysm , creatinine , cystatin c , interleukin-18 , Kidney Injury Molecule-1 , N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase , Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin	en	7007.0
1193	La pensée navale et le débat sur la torpille en Angleterre au cours de la décennie 1880	Great Britain saw in the 1880s, at the end of a period of intense technical change and before the publication of Mahan’s classic on Sea Power, the decline of the material way of thinking about naval affairs and the rise, from the years 1885 and 1886, of the historical school of John Knox Laughton. Proponents of a material method established the idea that technological change altered naval warfare in a fundamentally way. They were, however, opposed by the partisans of a historical method who supported the idea that naval warfare is set on some timeless principles which can be discovered by the use of the methods of the new historical profession. Throughout the decade, the material method, successful in an era of rapid technological change, quickly subsumed to Mahan’s precursors. In a debate originally dominated by tactics, we observe the introduction of strategy by the French materialist Jeune École. Consequently, strategy became the core of the historical school and seems closely linked to the rise of strategy as a subject of reflection.  The Jeune École believed that the torpedo would democratize Sea Power in making the powerful navies to use its mastery over the oceans. The Jeune École’s original success was so great, in France and abroad, that it influenced the English’s debate. Although materialists in Great Britain where more moderate than in France, they finally got marginalize by the historical school using the Jeune École’s wildest claims to disqualify the materialist point of view. Studying the debates through the Royal United Service Institution Journal, this thesis shows the existence, in Great Britain, of a debate centered on two method of thinking naval warfare and contributes to reassess current historiography which still focuses solely on the rise of Mahan’s precursors.

and the risk of preterm birth and small-for-gestational-age newborns"	Abstract: Anti-infective drugs are among the most used medications during pregnancy. Gestational infections are related to some adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as preterm birth and infants born small for their gestational age (SGA), which increases the risk of mortality and long-term morbidity. Given its health impacts, prompt management and treatment of these infections are warranted. However, there is some controversy on the use of anti-infective drugs to prevent adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as preterm birth. Furthermore, there is growing concern regarding its independent effects on these outcomes, when treatment of maternal infections is instituted. Therefore, we conducted 4 large population-based studies aimed to investigate the gestational use of anti-infective drugs during pregnancy and the risk of preterm birth and SGA. In addition, we systematically reviewed the available evidence on the use of metronidazole during gestation. We used data from the Quebec Pregnancy Registry, a longitudinal population-based cohort established with the linkage of three administrative databases from the province of Quebec (RAMQ, Med-Echo and ISQ). Data are available on prescriptions, pharmaceutical and healthcare services, acute care hospitalization and patient demographics. For study 1 and 2, we conducted a drug utilisation review within a cohort of 97 680 pregnant women. Study 3 and 4 were two independent case-control studies. Cases of preterm birth were defined as those with a delivery occurring before the 37th week of gestation (study 3). Cases of SGA were defined as a pregnancy resulting in a baby’s weigh adjusted for gestational age and gender <10th percentile, according to the Canadian gender-specific reference curves (Study 4). Oral use of anti-infective drugs during the last two trimesters of pregnancy was the exposure definition for both studies. Independent analyses were done to assess the risk for different classes of anti-infectives and individual agents. Our results indicate that the use of anti-infective drugs during pregnancy is prevalent (25%). Use of well-known agents increased once pregnancy was diagnosed, and the most frequent indications for use were respiratory and urinary infections. Predictors associated with use were having more that 2 different prescribers (adj. OR= 3.83,  95% CI: 3.3-4.3), having a diagnosis of urinary tract infections (adj. OR= 1.50, 95% CI: 1.3-1.8) and respiratory tract infection (adj. OR= 1.40, 95% CI: 1.2-1.6). The use of macrolides was associated with a decreased risk of preterm birth (adj. OR=0.65, 95% CI: 0.50-0.85), whereas metronidazole increased the risk (adj. OR=1.81, 95% CI: 1.30-2.54). Azithromycin had a protective effect in women with premature rupture of membranes (adj. OR=0.31, 95% CI: 0.10-0.93). Use of sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim was associated with an increased risk of SGA (adj. OR= 1.61, 95%CI: 1.16-2.23), whereas the use of urinary anti-infectives decreased the risk (adj. OR= 0.80, 95%CI: 0.65-0.97).The results of this thesis suggest that the use of macrolides and penicillins decrease the risk of preterm birth and SGA. Health care professionals should consider other therapeutic alternatives to metronidazole and sulfonamides, such as azithromycin.	anti-infective drugs , pregnancy , preterm birth , small for gestational age , Quebec Pregnancy Registry , case-control study	en	6953.0
1195	La capacité d'action collective des populations marginalisées dans le cadre des stratégies de lutte pour la reconnaissance : les cas de Cité de l'Éternel à Port-au-Prince (Haïti) et de la Sierra Santa Catarina (Mexico)	This thesis analyzes the collective action of marginalized populations located respectively in Cité de l’Éternel» in Port-au-Prince (Haiti) and in « Sierra Santa Catarina », Iztapalapa (Mexico City). In Port-au-Prince, before the fall of the dictatorship of Duvalier, the “tontons macoutes” invaded a terrain located on the edge of the quay of the capital, close to the boulevard Harry Truman. After being installed there, they proceeded to sell of lots intended for the construction of private housing. But after the fall of Jean-Claude Duvalier, in 1986, a part of the population took the opportunity to invade what remained of these marshes. After the occupation, they organized collectively to defend their property before undertaking actions to bring services and to obtain the regularization of their situation.  In the Sierra Santa Catarina (Mexico) populations led by militants of the Popular Front occupied ground at the foot of a sandy mountain in order to build their homes. Like the populations of «Cité de l’Éternel », these people organized to keep watch in order not to be evicted by the police. While working to gain access to the basic services, they undertake actions at the public institutions in order to obtain the regularization of their situation. In relation to the capacity for collective action of these populations, sociological theories are divided. On one side, certain authors support the thesis of the incapacity of these populations to have collective interests and to act consequently. According to them, without social mediation and without aggregation and a political representation, these populations are unable to acquire a collective subjectivity. Other authors think that at the basis of ties of friendship, family and vicinity, independently of their socio-economic situations, these populations can create strategies of subsistence and fight to find solutions that are individuals as well as collective. Concerning populations that invade territory to establish their homes, their actions are already a form of collective action. They are also involved in collective action either to bring basic services such as water and electricity, or to obtain public recognition of the invaded territories. This recognition implies not only the installation of regular services for the benefit of the population but also the granting to each owner of title. In the case of the Sierra Santa Catarina the actions undertaken with respect to public institutions, while in the case of Port-au-Prince, NGO’s or cooperation agencies are directly implicated.  We cannot conclude that populations are unable to have a collective subjectivity and shared interests without an aggregation and a political representation. Starting from various bonds between the individuals, associations are created which make it possible to establish mediation between the populations and other organizations. In the case of the Sierra Santa Catarina, collective action is certainly instrumentalised by leaders. That is part of a political tradition in Mexico. Nevertheless, some settlements people manage to resist their leaders. A part from  the socio-economic situation, the influence of certain leaders in Mexico and the indifference of the State (in the case of Port-au-Prince, in particular), these populations show an astonishing critical capacity with respect to their situation as well as their relations with the leaders of associations and the settlements. This suggests possibility for autonomous critical collective action where circumstances allow  Keys words: marginalization, collective action, recognition, smartness, critical capacity, slums fragmented recognition, denial recognition	Marginalization , Collective action , Recognition , Smartness , Critical capacity , Slums , Political intrumentalization , Fragmented recognition	en	6936.0
1196	"Pour une approche urbanistique de la conservation et de
la mise en valeur du patrimoine bâti :
l’expérience du canal de Lachine à Montréal"	For a few decades now, we are witnessing in the province of Quebec a multiplication of industrial wastelands. If those spaces represent predilection sites to urban redevelopment, their location in the core of the city encourages their reoccupation and their reconversion. However, their transformation doesn’t appear to be solely motivated by their emplacement but also by the historic interest that they arouse.  In this thesis we aim to determine how we can integrate urbanistic dimensions to the elaboration of a project which intends to preserve an old urban area. This thesis has for main objective to enlighten elements of an urbanistic perspective of heritage conservation. From the study of nine projects of heritage preservation located along the Lachine canal in Montreal, we question the contribution of the actual discourse on heritage conservation to the revitalization of old urban areas. We consider more specifically the morphological dimensions and the vocational activities of those projects. Our research is based on the following hypothesis: that the integration of heritage conservation issues to the transformation of the city results from the diversity and the complementarity of the vocational activities and from the different uses of the urban spaces. The study of those projects is conducted in order to identify how they take place in an urban project’s perspective. Constituted as a reaction to decontextualized urban planning practices, the notion of urban project is based on works related to the concept of urban heritage, specifically those of Gustavo Giovannoni and the Italian school of typomorphology. Because the projects that we have studied insist on a sectorial approach of the transformation of the old industrial corridor, and only on its integration to a regional scale of the organization of the territory, we can’t consider that they take place in an urban project’s perspective. We show how they differ from such an approach and how the discourse on heritage conservation developed in those projects forbids the integration of the Lachine canal corridor into local urban dynamics.

1197	Conception et développement d’un environnement d’apprentissage sur les transformations d’énergies et leurs rendements	The energy sector is at the heart of the concerns technological, political and economic modern society. This area requires a basic understanding of the scientific concept of energy. It is our opinion essential to any citizen training. We initially, from theoretical and practical considerations, examined why this area is so important in our technological society is so little discussed in the Quebec curriculum? Why do we merely a theoretical and discursive concept? Why, contrary to all scientific education, have we not considered learning situations in the laboratory for the study of energy? In a second step, we proposed an idea of practical and realistic solution to address all these questions. A solution that invites students to engage constructively in laboratory activities to appropriate these concepts. To do this, we have developed global variables energies that allowed students to experiment and measure energy transformations easily. This quest for technological development in education is therefore to take advantage of new technological developments in computing and microelectronics to design, build and test a computerized environment learning laboratory for science and technology. With this energy is at the confluence of three domains, this environment has been designed to support the same activity in the learning of mathematics, science and technology. This integration recommended by the new programs we believe is essential to the understanding of concepts related to energy and its transformations. For this learning activity multidisciplinary, we want, via an empirical and practical address these issues of energy transformations in order to give students the ability to develop the prototypes they build technology to improve their performance. We have shown that this approach techno, similar to the design of an experimental design in science, promotes understanding of concepts related to energy and their transformations. This educational development, open to scientific investigation, provides educational benefit, not only for practicing teachers and student teachers, but also for students from the fifth year of high school, we have shown in a setting tested empirically.

1198	Une continuité reconstruite à partir des ruptures migratoires. Les cas des Juifs argentins immigrés à Montréal pendant la période 2000-2007	In the context of Quebec’s migratory policies of the early 2000s, some Jewish Argentinean families decided to settle in Montreal. These migrants adhere to a cultural Judaism in which ethnicity becomes an identification dimension that is more important than religion. The Argentinean Jewish are bearers of their ancestors’ migratory histories, which are still present in  the collective memory. In the framework of their settlement in Quebec, they find themselves confronted with the Jewish context of Montreal, which presents other ways of living the Jewishness. How do these migrants perceive the encounter and cohabitation with Montreal’s Judaism? Will they continue to recognize themselves in the specificity of their Argentinean Jewishness? Do migratory family histories play a precise role in their current settlement process? Beyond adhesion to a cultural Judaism, do these migrants believe in a form of transcendence?	transcendances , anthropology , ethnicity , diasporic Jewishness , transcendences	en	6903.0
1199	Le développement des proportions métaphysaires chez les hominoïdes : croissance et influence de la locomotion	This thesis analyses the relationship between morphology, locomotion and growth in hominoids by studying metaphyseal proportions and development. Several levels of analysis — interlimb, upper and lower limbs — are discussed in an ontogenic perspective. Body mass and direction of loads affect the morphology of articular and metaphyseal surfaces but also their development. Taking into account the locomotion of a species and related loads during growth, we try to determine when proportions change, if at all, and why they appear. Australopithecus afarensis is one species for which the debate about its locomotion is still ongoing, study of the ontogeny of its proportions may shed light on the functions of its limbs during locomotion.  Linear measurements were collected on the humerus, radius, ulna, femur and tibia of H. sapiens, P. troglodytes, G. gorilla and P. pygmaeus. From these measurements, ratios have been calculated to intra and inter limb proportions of hominoid appendicular skeleton for different age groups.  Differences between species are most significant at the interlimb level and relative to the different relative percentage of upper and lower limbs use. Within species, results reveal a similarity for metaphyseal surfaces responses to loads at all levels of analyses. Proportional changes take place between dental stages 0 and 1 for H. sapiens (acquisition of bipedality), between stages 2 and 4 for P. troglodytes (majority of body weight supported by the lower limb) and between stages 3 and 5 for G. gorilla (knuckle-walking for 85 % of the time). For P. pygmaeus, no proportional change occur at any specific stage, which corresponds to the absence of changes in locomotor behavior from birth to adulthood in that species. From these data, it appears that proportional differences are responses to major changes in the mode of locomotion.

1200	Regards d’aînés sur le vieillissement : justice, autonomie et responsabilité partagée	Until now, the health of the elderly has been studied primarily in terms of loss of autonomy, health policy and the difficulties raised by the allocation of resources, and these problems were usually handled by technocrats, specialists and rarely by older people themselves. In addition, it pays little attention to the perceptions of seniors according to points of view's which can be theirs. The originality of this thesis comes precisely because it focuses on the experience of aging as experienced by older people and the representations they make with health services, experiences, expectations and needs, all considered from the perspective of ethical issues and respect for personal autonomy, justice and equity, shared responsibility. It comes out from thirty interviews with people aged between 70 and 91 years experience of aging is always unique, singular, although some categorizations and models can be built based on health status, ruptures and losses, links maintained or not. Preserve their autonomy appears as an important and sometimes central to the comments received, saying the efforts granted to this end. However, when weakened the autonomy needs, to still be able to live themselves and exerted in spite of the limitations and constraints related to age or illness, of an effective solidarity, assistance of close relatives and wider support. The division of responsibilities and tasks between relatives and social services is seen as unfair. Also one question, in conclusion of the thesis, the will of the State and his contribution in the implementation of the policy of home support and practical devices, and well founded in light of the heterogeneity aging.	justice , elderly , solidarity , autonomy , aging , health care , gerontology , ethic , justice	en	6874.0
1201	L’opération 5000/15000 logements sociaux et communautaires : une réponse au besoin en logements des ménages immigrants récents à Montréal, le cas de Côte-des-Neiges	Immigration in big cities like Montreal is a phenomenon which is growing in recent years. However, if households recent immigrants are an important positive contribution in the population growth, social, cultural and economic development of our society, improving their socioeconomic situation and conditions of housing they occupy, do not seem to be the priority housing policies of the government. Despite abundance of statistical data on immigration, it turns out that we know little about the housing conditions of such households and Quality of public support for their social housing are intended.  Our research, by a quantitative method and analysis technique Statistics conducted empirical research on population Greater Montreal, especially that of Côte-des-Neiges, for analyze the socioeconomic situation of households and recent immigrants their housing conditions. This to know if households Recent immigrants have a lower socioeconomic level than the average of households in the city, to constitute the poorest households poor, and if their housing conditions are unfavorable report to those of average households in the city and so are among the most poorly housed.  In our search for a second time, by a graphical method and mapping technique, we want to illustrate and then understand the logic implementation of housing, developed by the operation 5000/15000 housing community. Understanding this logic in its decision considering the initial choice of accommodation of households recent immigrants and in its uniformity of distribution of its units on the agglomeration of Montreal.	immigrants , households , social housing , geographical location	en	6869.0
1202	La dynamique de la déviance : comparaison entre les trajectoires de vie de délinquants et de joueurs excessifs	"This thesis explores the trajectories of two types of deviance, that of excessive gamblers (N = 100) and of persistent offenders (N = 172). The questionnaire used in each case has an important component to collect information chronologically on different themes; the life history calendar method.  The interest of a calendar analysis is that it takes into account the specific changes in behaviour and evaluates the short-term effects during their deviant careers.  The demonstration is based on the three dimensions of the trajectories: the intensity of the commitment, the episodes of voluntary abstinence and relapse episodes.  The major result of my thesis demonstrates that the circumstances of life (dynamic factors) have a greater influence on the dimensions of the trajectories, whereas the individual characteristics (fixed or static factors) often have very little explanatory power.  A careful analysis of the indirect effects illustrates the relevance of maintaining an interest in these factors.  Indeed, the impact of dynamic characteristics is often conditional on certain static variables.  No study, either American or Canadian, has examined the dynamic trajectories of excessive gamblers.  The second chapter examines the monthly fluctuations of amounts spent on gambling and games of chance.  We attempted to understand what motivates gamblers to spend more certain months and less at others.  Particular attention is also devoted to the months when the players cease to gamble, and the factors that promote this provisional abstinence.    The third chapter focuses on the trajectories of persistent offenders. Here, the criminal performance (illegal monthly income), measure the intensity of the criminal commitment. In this chapter, we are interested in the conditions that favour both the success of criminal episodes and episodes of temporary desistance.  The “official” measures of recidivism (new conviction, new admission into therapy) present a problem when it comes to unrecorded events; the actual relapses outnumber the relapse known by the official authorities. The interest of chapter four is to focus on an auto-revealed analysis of relapse and of the “moment in time"" when these relapses occur. The second objective of this study is to compare the relapse episodes between the two trajectories. The logic of this chapter follows that of the preceding ones, we are interested in the dynamics surrounding these episodes and we wish to see if it is similar in both deviant trajectories."

1203	Les procédés scripturaux des salons de clavardage (en français, en anglais et en espagnol) chez les adolescents et les adultes	One of the most sticking aspects of technological progress over the last fifteen years is computer- mediated communication (CMC): chatting, instant messaging, e-mail, discussion forums, blogs, social networking sites, etc. In addition to having significantly impacted contemporary society, these communication tools have greatly modified writing practices. The object of this study is group chatting which offers many writers the possibility of communicating simultaneous amongst themselves. This communication tool shows two important discursive and communicational characteristics. First, chatting is generally a hybrid form of communication: the code used is written, but the exchange of messages forms a dialogue structure resembling oral speech. Second, the spontaneous character of chatting imposes speed, both in encoding and decoding messages. Within the framework of a comparative study on writing practices in Francophone chatters (Tatossian and Dagenais 2008), four general categories for all writing variations in the corpus were established: abbreviatory processes, grapheme substitutions, word final neutralisations and expressive processes. Now we are interested in testing the rigueur of this classification in languages where the phonetico-graphical degree of correspondence differs. According to the Orthographic Depth Hypothesis [ODH] (Katz and Frost 1992), in which a transparent orthographic system (such as in Italian, Spanish or Serbo-Croatian) directly transpose phonemes into the orthographic system, we seek to verify whether our results for French can be generalised both to languages with a “transparent” orthographic system (Spanish) and to languages whose orthographic systems are “opaque” (French, English). For each language, two questions were asked:  1. How can attested scriptural practices be classified?  2. Are these graphic practices qualitatively and quantitatively similar amongst both adolescents and adults? The scriptural phenomena related to chatting also imply a generational identity. Adolescence is a period characterised by the quests for an identity. A study by Sebba (2003) on English shows that a relationship exists between “modified spelling” and the construction of identity in adolescents (i.e. graffiti, CMC). In addition, in these communication realms, we see the creation of a community of users based on common interests (Crystal 2006), such as in the adolescent community. A corpus was constructed from exchanges accessed through the Internet Relay Chat protocol. For each language in the study, two sociolinguistic distinct sub-corpora were defined: the first was made up of adolescent chat forums, the second, of a forum for adults. For each language, 4520 sentences, taken from various IRC channels for adolescents and adults, were analysed. First, a quantified inventory of the different scriptural phenomena collected was created and then the results were compared.	computer-mediated communication , chatting , opaque and transparent orthography , writing practices , generational variable , youth language , oral / written	en	6843.0
1204	"Exploration des schèmes de pensée chez les adolescents agresseurs sexuels 
au Centre de psychiatrie légale de Montréal"	The current project examined the presence of schemas in a group of juvenile sexual offenders. This study took place within the context of a clinical practicum (for the Masters Degree in Clinical Criminology) at the Centre de psychiatrie légale de Montréal. The objectives of the placement were to develop knowledge of the clinical environment and integrate theoretical knowledge into clinical practice. The project investigated the cognitions, in the form of implicit theories, of a sample of juvenile sexual offenders. The My life questionnaire (Mann, 2004) and an interview schedule developed by Beech and al. (2007) revealed a number of implicit theories related to sexually offending behavior among these youths. Theoretical and treatment implications of the findings are discussed.2	juvenile sex offender , implicit theories	en	6837.0
1205	Développement et caractérisation d’une méthode photonique pour créer des distributions spatiales de protéines	Cells are able to sense spatial distribution of proteins and accordingly migrate or extend in the appropriate direction. Understanding cellular responses to modifications in molecular spatial distributions is essential for advances in several fields such as development, immunology and oncology. A particularly complex example is axonal guidance that occurs during the development of the nervous system, which relies on distributions of attractive and repulsive guidance molecules to correctly wire this intricate network. Since several guidance cues collaborate to development of the nervous system, it is particularly difficult to assess the individual contribution of each cue and the signaling cascade each trigger in vivo; therefore methods to reproduce those distributions individually in vitro are necessary to study in detail the effect of each guidance cue. Several methods exist to produce graded distributions of protein that are either soluble or substrate-bound. A few methods making solution gradients are already widely used in several laboratories to perform experiments with the guidance cues that are normally diffusing in vivo. However, current methods allowing the fabrication of substrate-bound gradients are quite complex, which restrict their use to a few laboratories. First, we present a straightforward method exploiting photobleaching of a fluorescently tagged molecule using a visible laser to generating substrate-bound protein patterns: Laser-assisted protein adsorption by photobleaching (LAPAP). This method allows producing complex patterns of protein with micron spatial resolution and high dynamic range. An extensive characterization of the technique was performed and as proof of functionality, axons from dorsal root ganglions cells were guided on laminin peptide gradients. Secondly, LAPAP was improved in order to produce multicomponent patterns by using lasers at different wavelengths and antibodies conjugated to fluorophores corresponding to these wavelengths. Moreover, to speed-up the fabrication process and simplify the device, we developed widefield illumination LAPAP which uses a spatial light modulator, a light emitting diode and a standard microscope to directly print patterns. This patterning method is relatively simple compared to the original LAPAP setup, since it does not involve controlling the laser power or a motorized stage, but only sends an image of the desired pattern to a spatial light modulator. Finally, we used LAPAP to show how it could be used in automated high-content screening assays to quantify the morphological changes resulting from axon growth on gradients of guidance proteins. We produced thousands of laminin-1 gradients of different slopes and analyzed the variations in neurite guidance of neuron-like cells (RGC-5). An image analysis algorithm was developed to process bright field microscopy images, detecting each cell and quantifying the soma centroid and the initiation, terminal and turning angles of the maximal neurite. This data showed that laminin gradients influence the initiation angle of neurite extension of RGC-5, but does not contribute to its turning. We believe that the results presented in this thesis will facilitate the use of substrate- bound protein patterning in typical life science laboratories, since a confocal microscope or a slightly modified standard microscope is the only specialized equipment needed to fabricate patterns by LAPAP. This could increase the number of laboratories working with substrate-bound protein patterns in order to reach the critical mass necessary for major advances in neuroscience.	protein patterning , axon guidance , photobleaching	en	6317.0
1206	Un modèle explicatif des niveaux de réglementation des États américains en matière de production de gaz à effet de serre	This paper contributes to the state policy adoption literature by studding the legislative response of the American states to global warming. We quantitatively test hypotheses drawn from internal determinants models of policy adoption to explain why some states are leaders and other laggards in climate change. Our dependent variable is a grouping of all the important types of measures adopted by states to limit the production of greenhouse gases in six categories. To explain the number of measures adopted by each state, we include in our model economic, political and geographic variables that have an impact on the adoption of climate change policies. The results show that the strongest explanatory factors are the presence of an ideologically liberal population and of strong environmental interest groups.

1207	Darstellung und Wirklichkeit in Der Idiot und Die Dämonen, zwei Dostojewski-Bearbeitungen von Frank Castorf für die Volkbühne Berlin	"As a theatre performance is a volatile piece of art, as it has a performative character, and therefore possesses its own fictional world, the two concepts “representation” and “reality” are of meaning in theater studies. In this context, the works of the Berliner theater director Frank Castorf represent particularly rich research objects. Because Castorf give a lot of value to the present and the reality of the performance, it is to ask: what role does the representation of a fictional world play in the productions of Castorf? This work aims to first identify how important the performativity for Castorf in two theater adaptations of Dostoevsky's novels is for the stage, Die Dämonen und Der Idiot. Since man mediates his own phenomenon more and more and since in this context, the reproducible media like television or cinema has an overwhelming and increasing importance in our consumer society, the theater, like other art forms, has changed. For this reason, the two theatrical adaptations were transferred to other media, that is, in films and books. This work describes the process of ""re-representation"", i.e. the transition from one medium to another. Here will be analyzed the connections between the various works of art and the motivations of the Berliner director and his theater, The Volksbühne Berlin, to “repurpose” the novels in plays and plays in movies and books. Moreover, despite their increasing integration in theater, video projections are still seen by certain number of puristas as invaders to be proscribed because of their threat to theatre’s essence: performativity as the encounter between actors and an audience in the same space, at the same time. However, live video-projection images can maintain a performative nature since they are likely to generate mutual influences between themselves and the members of the audience. By analyzing Frank Castorf’s Der Idiot, this thesis shows how cameras and their transmission devices have the capacity to be substituted to the main objects of the theatrical show: actors."

1208	Étude des mécanismes moléculaires influençant la variation de phase des adhésines P, F1651 et CS31A présentes chez des souches d'Escherichia coli pathogènes	F1651, the pyelonephritis-associated pili (Pap) and the K88-related surface antigen CS31A are three members of the type P family of adhesive factors that play a key role in the establishment of disease caused by Extra-intestinal Escherichia coli (ExPEC) strains. They are all under the control of methylation-dependent transcriptional regulation that defines the number of fimbriated (ON) and afimbriated (OFF) cells within a clonal population. Despite a high similarity in DNA sequence, these three adhesive systems nonetheless differ in the ratio of ON cells. While CS31A is always turned toward the OFF state, F1651 presents a particularly high level of ON cells and Pap shows two distinct OFF and ON states, depending on the starting phenotype. The leucine-responsive regulatory protein (Lrp) plays an essential role in the reversibility of this epigenetic switch and it is believed that the difference in nucleotides within the regulatory region of each operons could modify the binding of Lrp and, in turn, CS31A, Pap and F1651 phase variation. Using a variety of techniques including gene expression, site-directed mutagenesis, and in vitro protein–DNA interaction analysis, we demonstrate that the preferential OFF state observed in CS31A-positive cells is mainly due to a weak interaction of Lrp with the clp distal region and that the presence of a PapI homologue within the cell plays a key role in CS31A production. For F1651, we show in this study that the high level of ON cells found during F1651 phase variation is due to an altered stability of the DNA complex formed by Lrp at its repressor binding sites 1-3. Again, after each cell cycle, complex formation is modulated by the local regulator FooI (homologue to PapI) which promotes the transit of Lrp toward its activator binding sites 4-6. Furthermore, we identify two nucleotides (T490, G508) surrounding the Lrp-binding site 1 that are critical to maintaining a high OFF to ON switch rate during F1651 phase variation, as well switching Pap fimbriae toward the OFF state.

1209	Connectivité hydrologique et signature géochimique à l'échelle événementielle dans un bassin versant forestier	In watersheds, hydrologic connectivity consists of a hydrologic state that links the upper part of a hillslope to the riparian zone. Its impacts on streamflow generation and transfer of dissolved elements towards the stream are considered substantial. This study aims to 1) detect hydrotops and hydrologic connections with a network of wells that allow measurements of water table (WT) fluctuations; 2) identify spatial and temporal variability and the geochemical signature of potential sources of water with major and trace elements and 3) examine the spatial and temporal contribution of sources of water within the watershed during a storm event. The study takes place in a small forested watershed of the Canadian Shield (the Hermine). We demonstrate the existence of four hydrotops representing a water convergence gradient, highlighting diversity of behavior of the WT. Hydrological connections are characterized by high Spearman coefficients of the relationship between WT depth and streamflow in their downstream portion. Some hydrological connections are engaged by the fill and spill mechanism. WT behavior is influenced by the distance limits of the basin, soil horizonation and subsurface topography. In sum, three water sources connect the hillslope to the riparian zone during the storm event in chronological order: 1) WT and B horizons of the entire basin (Sr), 2) LFH horizons of convergence zones (Ba and Zn) and 3) a depression of wet soil on north hillslope (Co and Mn).

1210	"Les occupations de fermes commerciales au Zimbabwe : récits, expériences et
devenirs des fermiers blancs"	"This thesis presents an ethnography of the fate of white farmers caught up in the complexity of their long-term presence in Zimbabwe. The analysis is centered around a time of crisis, the current farm occupations, characterised in this work as ethical and critical moments. These occupations symbolically and effectively challenge the remains of colonialism in Zimbabwe. The study of these leads us to question the ways by which decolonization is implemented in the Zimbabwe of President Mugabe, and about issues concerning the form, in particular in legal terms, of the post-colony. These occupations have caused the expulsion of more than 90% of white farmers from their “utopian place”, namely the farm, and pushed them into spaces of ambiguity within which the farm occupiers are seeking confrontation. The issue of corruption (economic and moral) is central to the experience of white farmers who were forced to give up their integrity. Some of them have tried by various means to maintain their integrity by protecting themselves against corruption and by calling for the respect of their ""rights""; others have agreed to live in the grey areas constituted by the occupation of their farms. This thesis, rooted in post-colonial anthropology, is organized into three parts. The central question of the first part, which is historically oriented, interrogates the form the settlers gave to this country and the manner by which white farmers made these lands of Africa ""their"" place. In the second part, the establishment of the post-2000 “fast-track land reform programme” and the daily experiences of the occupations from white farmers’ points of view are analyzed in detail. In the third part, the lives of farmers dispossessed of their farms is adressed from Harare, the capital of Zimbabwe, as well as from Britain, where many have found refuge. Those currently living in Harare have reorganized themselves socially and economically by redefining the limits, including moral ones, of the community. Meanwhile, those who fled Zimbabwe and ""returned"" to England have since became English again."

1211	Autour de Pierre Falardeau : found footage et réemploi d'images dans le cinéma politique	This thesis is concerned with the reuse of images in political cinema in general and, specifically, in the work of Quebec filmmaker Pierre Falardeau. We will first see how, from a historical point of view, archival images have been recycled in traditional documentary and then how they were used or reused for political purposes in found footage experimental films. We will then discuss the use of found footage in militant or revolutionary cinema both in Latin America (Santiago Alvarez, Fernando Solanas and Octavio Getino) and France (Guy Debord, Chris Marker and Jean-Luc Godard). We will then analyse Pierre Falardeau’s reuse of images in three of his documentaries: Pea Soup, Speak White and Le temps des bouffons. We will try and see how Falardeau fits within this tradition of the found footage film and the distinctive features of this aspect of his work.

1212	Impact de l’anémie postopératoire sur la récupération fonctionnelle et la qualité de vie après une arthroplastie de la hanche ou du genou	Red blood cell transfusions are frequently used to treat anemia after total hip or knee arthroplasties. The indications for transfusions remain unclear despite published guidelines. Clinicians have adopted a restrictive transfusion threshold (75-80 g/L) but the consequences of such a strategy on functional outcome and quality of life are not known. First, we characterized the transfusion practice inside the Centre hospitalier de l’Université de Montréal (CHUM). Our hypothesis was that transfusion practice varies inside the CHUM due to uncertainty. A retrospective study of 701 charts of patients operated for a hip or knee arthroplasty was conducted. We observed that there was no difference among hospitals regarding the way transfusions are used and that physicians mainly based their decision to transfuse on a single variable, the hemoglobin concentration, adopting a restrictive transfusion strategy. Sixty-six percent of patients had a hemoglobin concentration under 100 g/L after surgery. Second, we evaluated the impact of this postoperative anemia on functional outcome and quality of life. We hypothesized that a threshold hemoglobin concentration exists below which these become impaired. A prospective, observational cohort study was conducted in 305 patients categorized in groups according to their postoperative hemoglobin concentration. Hemoglobin groups (≤ 80, 81-90, 91-100 and > 100 g/L) were similar in the evolution of the distance walked in six minutes, perception of effort, maximal dominant hand strength and quality of life scores. Thus, moderate anemia is not associated with an impaired functional recovery or quality of life early after hip and knee arthroplasties. Further studies will be required to determine the long-term consequences of a restrictive transfusion strategy in these patients.

1213	Le devoir de coopération durant l'exécution du contrat	The duty of good faith in the performance of the contract was an implied condition of any contract under article 1024 of the Civil Code of Lower Canada. On January 1st 1994, however, this duty was codified at article 1375 of the Civil Code of Québec.  In parallel to this change, the traditional understanding of “contract” based on the doctrine of the autonomy of the parties has come to be challenged. In response to this critique, two theories emphasizing the importance of collaboration between contractual parties during the performance of a contract have been suggested, namely, “contractual solidarism” and “relational contract” have been suggested.  The notion of “good faith” has also recently evolved. It was originally limited to a duty of loyalty, consisting mainly in an abstention or in the duty not to harm anyone. Today, good faith also refers to a more active obligation which may require a party to act or to facilitate the performance of the contract. This general “duty to cooperate”, as it is called, has given rise to many applications, including the duty to inform or to advise. This paper examines the extent and limits of the duty of the contracting parties to cooperate during the performance of the contract. The content and intensity of this duty are influenced by factors pertaining to the characteristics of the contract or the contracting parties. Our study of the Québec jurisprudence focused on contracts of sale, contracts of enterprise, franchise agreements and contracts in the field of computers. It suggests that the duty of the parties to cooperate is greater in relational contracts than in transactional ones. For example, the creditor may, inter alia, be bound to “help” its defaulting debtor or to renegotiate the agreement when an unforeseen event has changed the initial contractual equilibrium. However, this last issue is still highly controversial.  This duty to cooperate is not itself without limits. Firstly, it is an obligation of means, not one of result. It is also limited, even inexistent, when the debtor is bound by other duties such as a duty of “reserve” or of non-interference, when the other party is acting in bad faith or when a party unilaterally terminates a contract or does not renew it.

1214	L’information de localisation à Montréal : une exploration	This master’s thesis is an exploratory research on localization experiences lived in Montreal’s urban space by subjects in relation to ‘location’ information. Localization is a spatial orientation process where a place’s location in space is a problem to be solved. This exploration is based on a theorization of information proposed by Bateson (1972) as well as on a development of the concept of apparatus (dispositif) by Belin (2002) and Agamben (2007) following Foucault’s; localization being an exploratory empirical concept. The localization process is investigated regarding its media character: location information is a medium that, being a result and a cause of action, shapes this process that is driven by effort. An ethnomethodological fieldwork is enacted by empirical observations and qualitative interviews that permit to identify certain conditions that make possible, in everyday life, relations between location information, urban space and a subject. Being mostly lived regarding actual, future or past movements, localization is thus conceptualized as wayfinding: the act of determining which path or trajectory to follow to get from point A to point B. This master’s thesis is actually an open problematization that aims to explore and identify some issues that are at the heart of localization processes in Montreal’s urban space. If “[t]he human act par excellence”, as put forward by André Leroi-Gouhran (1993 [1965]) “is perhaps not so much the creation of tools as the domestication of time and space” (p. 313), the fact that we dwell in a certain time and in a certain space is a problematic relation of trust (confiance) in itself. The living and the non-living inhabit spaces that are continuously transformed by their mutual determination. Starting from the observation that the built environment is deploying itself while being produced and developed (aménagé) in dispositions where some of our gestures are delegated, is it possible to consider being free without trusting?

1215	Étude cas témoin de la nutrition, du style de vie et du cancer du sein chez les femmes Canadiennes Françaises porteuses d’une mutation fondatrice sur un des gènes BRCA 1 ou BRCA 2	Breast cancer is a multifactorial disease and several dietary and lifestyle factors have been implicated in the development of breast cancer.  Women carriers of a BRCA1 or BRCA2 germline mutation have a lifetime risk of 50 to 80% to develop breast cancer compared with 11 % in non carriers.  Several studies have reported the existence of an association between the incidence of sporadic breast cancers, dietary factors and lifestyle which lead us to investigate the effects of these factors on breast cancer risk in women carriers of a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation.  We have carried out a case-control study among French Canadian women in Montreal. Cases were from a cohort of around 1000 women affected with breast cancer, recruited since 1994. We have identified 44 affected women who have been tested for BRCA1 and BRCA2 for six founders mutations in the French Canadian population. All these cases were carriers of one of the six mentioned mutations.  Controls were also women carriers of one of these six in BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations but, unaffected with cancers. Fifteen of them coming from the same families of the studied cases and twenty-nine were identified at the familial cancer clinic of the CHUM, resulting in a total of 44 controls.  A core questionnaire was administered to both cases and controls to gather information on socio-demographic and lifestyle risk factors covering the two years preceding the diagnosis of breast cancer for cases and the two years before the discovery of the mutation for controls.  A validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire was administered to ascertain dietary intake corresponding to the same period of time for both cases and controls.   A positive and significant association between breast cancer risk and higher education was observed among subjects with a universitary education (> 14 years of study) compared with subjects who had no more than high school education (<11 years of studies) [OR = 7.82, 95% CI :( 1.99-30.69), p = 0.003].  We have found that breast cancer risk increased when gene mutation carriers reached their maximum weight at age> 48 years [OR = 4.27; 95% CI (0.82-22.25)].   In this study it was observed that breast cancer risk in carriers decreased with more than 7 months breast feeding compared with no breastfeeding [OR = 0.35, 95% CI = (0.12-1.06)] but this association was not significant.   Women who practiced more than 22.45 MET-hours per week of moderate physical activity, compared with those practicing less than 11.45 MET-hours per week had a cancer risk decreased by 72% [OR = 0,28 - 95% IC (0.08-0.95), p = 0.04]. Those who practiced more than 31.95 MET-hours per week of total physical activity compared with less than 16.40 showed a risk reduced of around 79% [OR = 0.21; 95% CI:(0.06-0.75), p = 0.02].  The analysis of macro and micro-nutrients and food groups showed that consumption of more than 23.20 g/d of monounsaturated fatty acid increased the risk of breast cancer significantly compared with a consumption of less than 17.08 g/d [OR = 6.00, 95% CI:(0.97-37.02), p = 0.05].  We also observed that an intake of more 221.79 mg/d of vitamin K reduced the risk of breast cancer by 83% compared with those consuming less than 143.57 mg/d [OR = 0.17, 95% (0.05-0.61), p = 0.007].  High intake of fruits was associated with a lower risk of breast cancer risk (73%) among carriers who consumed more than 563.31 g / d compared with less than 356.18 g/d [OR = 0.27; 95% CI :(0.07-1.01), p = 0.05].  The results of our study support the role of lifestyle and dietary habits in the aetiology of breast cancer among French Canadian with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation.    In general, we have observed that a high level of educational and weight gain increased the risk of breast cancer among gene mutation carriers, while breastfeeding and a moderate physical activity reduced this risk.  Regarding food habits and nutrition, our results suggest that high intake of mono-unsaturated fatty acids increased the risk of breast cancer. The higher intake of vitamin K and fruits showed a protective role against breast cancer.  In our knowledge, this is the first finding of the possible relationship between nutrition, lifestyle and risk of breast cancer among French Canadian carriers of BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. Due to the small sample size of our study, more investigations are needed in the future to clarify this relationship.

1216	Rôle du cortex pariétal postérieur dans le processus d'intégration visuomotrice - connexions anatomiques avec le cortex moteur et activité cellulaire lors de la locomotion chez le chat	When progressing through a varied environment, an individual will depend on visual information to evaluate the size, shape or the distance and time to contact of objects in his path. This will allow him to plan in advance the gait requirements necessary to avoid or step over these obstacles. This concept is also applicable in situations where the subject must reach a target, as with a predator chasing down its prey. The neural structures involved in generating voluntary gait modifications during locomotion have been extensively studied, but relatively little information is available on the processes that integrate visual information to plan these movements. Numerous studies in the primate suggest that the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) plays an important role in the preparation and execution of visually-guided reaching movements. In this thesis, we investigated the proposition that the PPC is similarly involved in the planning and control of visually-guided locomotion in the cat. Our first study examined the extent of cortico-cortical connections between the PPC and the more frontal motor areas, particularly the motor cortex, using injections of fluorescent retrograde tracers. We mapped the cortical surface of anaesthetized cats to identify the somatotopical representations of the distal and proximal forelimb in the rostral portion of the motor cortex, the forelimb representation in the caudal motor area, and also the hindlimb representation. The injection of different tracers in two selected regions, for every cat, allowed us to visualize the density of divergent and convergent parietal projections to these motor sites. Our analysis revealed a distinct topographical organization of parietal connections with all of the identified motor regions. In particular, the caudal motor representation of the forelimb primarily received projections from the rostral bank of the parietal cortex, while the caudal portion of the PPC strongly projected to the rostral forelimb representation. The latter observation is particularly interesting, since the caudal bank of the PPC receives numerous visual inputs and its target, the rostral motor region, is well-known for its involvement in voluntary motor functions. Therefore, this study suggests that the PPC, through extensive connections with the different somatotopic representations of the motor cortex, could constitute an ideal neural substrate for processes such as inter- and intra-limb coordination, as well as the modulation of visually-guided voluntary movements. Our second study tested the hypothesis that the PPC participates in the modulation and planning of voluntary gait modifications during locomotion in the cat. Using the cortical mapping established in our anatomical study, we recorded the activity of parietal neurons, localized in parts of areas 5a and 5b which are known to project strongly towards motor regions involved in forelimb movements. These recordings were obtained during a locomotion task requiring the cat to step over several obstacles of different sizes. By dissociating the speed of the obstacles from that of the treadmill onto which the cat is walking, our experimental protocol also allows us to increase the importance of visual information from the obstacles and to separate it from the influx of proprioceptive influx generated during locomotion. Our recordings revealed two groups of parietal cells on the basis of their activity in relation with the step over the obstacle: one population, mostly localized in area 5a, discharged solely as the lead forelimb passed over the obstacle (step-related cells), and another group, mainly found in area 5b, that showed significant activity at least one step cycle before the gait modification (step-advanced cells). Additionally, we observed an increase of cell activity in these groups, but particularly in step-advanced cells, when the speed of the obstacles was dissociated from that of the treadmill, demonstrating the growing importance of visual information as the task’s difficulty is increased. Finally, a great number of step-related cells were found to discharge specifically in correlation with muscle activity in the contralateral forelimb, regardless of whether or not it led over the obstacle (limb-specific cells). Inversely, the majority of step-advanced neurons tended to maintain their discharge in phase with the leading limb during the gait modification, independently of its position in relation with the recording site (limb-independent cells). We suggest that this additional disparity indicates diversified functions in PPC activity. For example, limb-specific cells could be involved in modulating the movement of the contralateral forelimb over the obstacle, regardless of its order of passage, while limb-independent neurons could instead specify the type of voluntary movement required to overcome the obstacle. Together, our observations indicate that the PPC can potentially influence the activity of motor centers through extensive cortical networks, and contributes to different aspects of visually-guided locomotion, such as initiation and modulation of voluntary forelimb movements, as well as the planning of these gait modifications to allow an individual to walk through a complex environment.

1217	Analyse génétique moléculaire du gène de la voie non-canonique Frizzled/Dishevelled PRICKLE1 dans les anomalies du tube neural chez l’humain	The planar cell polarity pathway (PCP) or the non-canonical Frizzled/Dishevelled pathway controls the morphogenetic process of convergent extension (CE) that is essential during embryogenesis for gastrulation and neural tube formation. Recently, PCP signalling was associated with neural tube defects (NTD) in humans and animal models. The core PCP protein, Prickle1, is expressed in the primitive streak and mesoderm during mouse embryogenesis. Both gain and loss of function of Prickle1 cause faulty CE movements in zebrafish and the frog. PRICKLE1 physically interacts with two other core PCP members, Dishevelled and Strabismus/Vang. In the present study we investigated the role of PRICKLE1 in the aetiology of NTDs in a large cohort of 810 patients through resequencing of its open reading frame and exon-intron junctions. The pathogenicity of the identified mutations was assessed through bioinformatics methods followed by a functional validation in a zebrafish system, in vivo. We identified in our cohort a total of nine novel mutations, of which seven affected conserved amino acids: p.Ile69Thr, p.Asn81His, p.Thr275Met, p.Arg682Cys, p.Ser739Phe, p.Val550Met and p.Asp771As. These mutations were predicted to affect the function of the protein in silico and were absent in a large cohort of ethnically-matched controls. Co-injection of these variants with the wild type pk1 in zebrafish oocytes revealed that one mutation, p.Arg682Cys, antagonized the CE phenotype induced by the wild-type zebrafish prickle1a in a dominant fashion. Our study demonstrates that PRICKLE1 can represent a predisposing factor for human NTDs and further expands our knowledge on the role that PCP genes in the pathogenesis of these malformations.

1218	Le niveau d’autonomie du Brésil durant l’administration Lula (2003-2010) : étude du contexte pour l’action et des stratégies de politique étrangère	The purpose of this thesis is to examine Brazil’s level of autonomy in relation to the United States of America, which is the most powerful country in the western hemisphere. The problematic lies in determining the factors that influenced the level of Brazil’s autonomy during Lula’s administration (2003-2010). These are the proposed hypotheses: first, the context for action may have greatly contributed to an increase in Brazil’s level of autonomy; and second, Brazil's foreign policy strategies may have positively influenced the level of autonomy of the country. The first hypothesis, that concerns the impact of the context for action, will be analyzed in two main parts. First, the international context, which is characterized by the post-9/11 international environment and the emergence of new powers on the international stage, will be studied. Second, the continental context will be analyzed based on the current relationships between the U.S. and Latin America, the latter subcontinent being considered as America’s backyard for a long time. The evaluation of the second hypothesis will be based on three foreign policy strategies established during the Lula administration. The first is the development of South-South relations or, in others words, the horizontalization of relations. The second is the regional strategy of Brazil, which consists of playing a leadership role and promoting political and economic integration in the South American region. The third strategy is to distance itself from the United States by occasionally opposing this powerful nation. We conclude, based on the analysis of our hypotheses, that the level of autonomy of Brazil in relation to the United States increased significantly during the Lula administration.

1219	Establishing a recovery orientation in first line mental health teams in Québec : perspectives from social workers and managers	Following the 2005 Mental Health Action Plan most mental health services are offered in primary care teams. This policy called for a paradigm shift away from a biomedical model of care toward a process-focused ‘recovery’ orientation in mental health. Concurrently, it called for the use of a results-orientation that is outcome-focused in order to ensure efficiency. The objective of this research project was to explore the development of recovery-oriented practices among social workers in first line mental health teams in Québec. To do this, I investigated the microprocesses of implementing recovery-oriented services and practices alongside results-oriented management techniques.  In addition, this project explored the saliency of a recovery orientation specifically for first line mental health social workers. This qualitative, exploratory study consisted of 11 semi-structured interviews with social workers and managers in first line mental health teams. The results indicate that certain aspects of work organization, such as flexibility, autonomy, reflexivity, training, and interdisciplinarity can foster a practice that is recovery-oriented. In addition, the results show that the foundations of both the recovery orientation and the social work profession share common values.  However, social workers face constraints to practice that go beyond their know-how and professional base.  Our exploratory study leads us to contemplate the influence of work organization on changing practice. The results suggest that practicing from a recovery orientation was a shared ideal among the participants but that the meaning and expression of this ideal was profoundly shaped by practice contexts. The implications of these results are that recovery-oriented systems will be difficult to develop in a result-oriented paradigm.

1220	La cartographie des sites de régulation génétique à partir de données de débalancement allélique	Wilson and King (1975) proposed that evolution frequently operates through mutations affecting genetic regulation. Likewise, it is expected that genetic variation responsible for inter-individual differences will be due to variation in regulatory sites. Identifying such sites is thus important in the genetic and medical research. We have developed a new bioinformatics algorithm to find genome-wide regulatory sites for a big number of genes. Individuals carrying different alleles at a regulatory site will exhibit allelic imbalance(AI) due to differential expression of the two copies the same locus. Our approach consists of searching polymorphic sites (SNPs) in linkage disequilibrium with AI in order to map regulatory regions. We have detected many SNPs associated to the regulation of different genes pointed in previous studies. We have also found regulatory regions far from the transcription start site (TSS). The major advantage of this method is that phased data is not needed. In addition, AI data has the benefit of not being affected by external factors since it is measured in the same cell. The results show that our approach is reliable and it can detect sites far from the gene.	SNP , Allelic imbalance , LD , AI , Linkage disequilibrium , Regulatory Region , eQTL , Regulation	en	6179.0
1221	Réseaux de neurones à relaxation entraînés par critère d'autoencodeur débruitant	"Machine learning is a vast field where we seek to learn parameters for models from concrete data. The goal will be to execute various tasks requiring abilities normally associated more with human intelligence than with a computer program, such as the ability to process high dimensional data containing a lot of variations. Artificial neural networks are a large class of such models. In some neural networks said to be deep, we can observe that high level (or ""abstract"") concepts are automatically learned. The work we present here takes its inspiration from deep neural networks, from recurrent networks and also from neuroscience of the visual system. Our test tasks are classification and denoising for near binary images. We aim to take advantage of a feedback mechanism through which high-level representations, that is to say relatively abstract concepts, can influence lower-level representations. This influence will happen during what we call relaxation, which is iterations where the different levels (or layers) of the model can influence each other. We will present two families of architectures based on this mechanism. One, the fully connected architecture, can in principle accept generic data. The other, the convolutional one, is specifically made for images. Both were trained on images, though, and mostly images of written characters. In one type of experiment, we want to reconstruct data that has been corrupted. In these tasks, we have observed the feedback influence phenomenon previously described by comparing the results we obtained with and without relaxation. We also note some numerical and visual improvement in terms of reconstruction performance when we add upper layers’ influence. In another type of task, classification, little gain has been noted. Still, in one setting where we tried to classify noisy data with a representation trained without prior class information, relaxation did seem to improve results significantly. The convolutional architecture, a bit more risky at first, was shown to produce numerical and visual results in reconstruction that are near those obtained with the fully connected version, even though the connectivity is much more constrained."

1222	Patrons de distribution des crustacés planctoniques dans le fleuve Saint-Laurent	The research aims to determine the distribution patterns of crustacean plankton along the longitudinal (west-east) and transversal (north shore - south shore) axes of the St. Lawrence River between Lake Saint-François and the estuarine transition zone, during two hydroperiods in May (high discharge) and August (low discharge). The zooplankton samples and the environmental data were collected at 52 stations distributed along 16 transversal transects in 2006. In chapter 1, we present the theoretical concepts of river ecosystem models, and a synthesis on the generative processes driving zooplankton spatial patterns in rivers. We also present our research objectives and hypotheses. In chapter 2, we describe spatial patterns of the zooplankton community structure in three biogeographic zones of the St. Lawrence and 6 longitudinal habitats, together with the relationships between zooplankton spatial structure and water masses spatial distribution and environmental characteristics. In chapter 3, we perform a variation partitioning procedure on spatial variables AEM (based on water masses spatial distribution) and environmental variables in order to assess how much of the zooplankton variation is explained by hydrological processes (AEM variables) and local conditions (environmental factors). The salinity-conductivity gradient related to the fluvial-estuary discontinuity determines the large-scale spatial patterns of the crustacean zooplankton. In the fluvial zones, the zooplankton distribution patterns are more influenced by the water masses spatial structure than by local environmental factors. The spatial distribution of the water masses explained more of the spatial structure of zooplankton communities in August than in May.

1223	Le regard de l'allié britannique sur la France et son armée durant la guerre de Crimée	In the Crimean war, Great-Britain made an alliance with the Second French Empire, the traditional enemy, still considered as a threat; this cooperation, forced by circumstances, forms the basis of this research. Thousands of soldiers and civilians from both countries worked together for two years. The British personal letters reveal a fraternization between both cultures that is more important than the one mentioned in the historiography. According to Gordon Allport’s theories on the diminution of prejudices, all the necessary conditions for reconciliation could be found in Crimea. The steps leading to the fraternization, defined by Allport, are also perceptible in the personal letters. This reconciliation had under-estimated consequences: British soldiers and civilians started comparing themselves with the French and their pride gave place to an important self-criticism. This led to scandals in the army and the newspapers from the very beginning of the war, long before the scandals of the winter 1854-1855.

1224	Décrire quantitativement les interventions téléphoniques des infirmières au service Info-Santé selon le niveau de compétence novice - compétent - expert	Nurse telephone consultation services are rapidly progressing throughout the world. It is known that nurses with a greater experience in telephone practise obtain more information on the client’s health condition when in consultation, than nurses with less experience. We can presume that Patricia Benner’s «levels of nursing experience», (1984), will provide us with an explanation for these differences. Yet, to this day, no study describes how these differences between levels of experience are manifested in conversation during an intervention between the nurse and the client. The object of this descriptive study was to identify the manifestations of this communication expertise during a telephone consultation. Using the Roter interaction analysis system (RIAS), 190 recorded calls between nurses (N = 15) with differing levels of expertise, according to Benner’ nomenclature (1984), and the callers who have consulted them were analyzed. The calls that were studied, from a larger study, were first calls from parents regarding their child aged five years or less. It was possible to observe characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses common to nurses within each level of expertise in this study. Despite the fact that there are differences between nurses with fewer years of experience and nurses with more clinical telephone experience, results seem to indicate that, regardless of their experience, nurses are strongly centered on the task of assessing the caller’s health situation; however, their interventions include few phrases aimed at establishing a true partnership with the caller. Results obtained provide information that could be used to elaborate professional developmental strategies, and guide administrators in their choice of indicators when evaluating service quality and its effect on clientele. Nevertheless, an increased number of nurse participants and a greater number of calls would enable us to confirm the results obtained from these 190 calls.

1225	Quitter les siens? : une analyse des trajectoires de sortie chez les juifs hassidiques	This master’s thesis analyses the paths taken by individuals who exit ultraorthodox Jewish communities. More precisely, it illuminates the process by which certain Hasidim take it upon themselves to leave behind the lifestyle and the community in which they were born and raised. My research primarily uses interviews and field notes to show how certain individuals manage to exit such ultra-religious communities despite the presence of strong social controls to prevent leaving. This study examines adjustment strategies and ruses used by Hasidim to avoid religious control and prompt their departure process. Drawing from Goffman’s theory, I will show how in a controlled environment individuals are still able to succeed in creating some marges de manoeuvre. These particular spaces of liberty shaped by each individual allow for the ultimate success of completely leaving the community.

1226	Étude exploratoire des facteurs de risque du détournement en interne du patrimoine informationnel	While we are living in a society where information and data have a central place, organizations are regularly confronted to the misappropriation of immaterial assets. This type of workplace deviance represents a strongly hidden aspect of criminality, few reported and which management relies on each others. The objective of this study was also to relieve this lack of knowledge by analyzing the different risk factors involved in the internal misappropriation of informational patrimony (DIPI). In the case where workplace is a complex environment, made of numerous interactions between people and their environment, the proposed factors come from various disciplines and build up dimensions different one to the other. The data used in our research were collected trough a standardized questionnaires that were distributed to employees who handle or have access to data and/or information in the achievement of their work. At last, 66 questionnaires were completed. This survey shows that DIPI is a widespread phenomenon, but still sensitive inside organizations. The major risk factors of DIPI would be inhibition (absence of victim’s personalization and immaterial aspect of the target) and settings factors (opportunity to act and targets accessibility). To a less extend, but not insignificant, factors of participation to creation, work satisfaction and ethical work climate, have a role to play too in the risk of DIPI. The approach and the results support the necessity to conceive the risk globally regarding to measures taking into account both technical and managerial aspect to limit the DIPI.

1227	Relations entre le style parental, le style parental alimentaire et les pratiques alimentaires de la mère et les comportements alimentaires de l’enfant québécois d’âge préscolaire	Childhood overweight is a fast growing and worrisome problem. The role of parents in this situation is of great importance as they ensure food availability, chose the presented meals, act as role models in the feeding act and interact with children during feeding to guide their eating behavior. The parent offers and molds the environment in which the child will evolve. This thesis explores the mother's role within this environment. The parent uses various feeding practices to guide the child's food choices. Some are kind, such as positively encouraging the child to taste new foods, (e.g., give this a taste, I think it's delicious!) while others are coercive (e.g., you are not leaving from this table until you finish your plate). Parent-child interactions during mealtime are likely to have different consequences on the child's eating habits, possibly modifying his food intake, food preferences, neophobia and weight status. Parent-child interactions can also influence a child's eating behavior without necessarily being within a food setting. The main objective of this thesis is to explore the relationship between the general parent-child interactions, also known as the parenting style, the parent-child interactions in a food setting, known as the feeding style, the feeding strategies used by the parents to guide the child's food choices, known as the feeding practices, the child's eating behavior and his weight status. This thesis has 4 specific objectives. First, to examine the relationship between the parenting style, the feeding style and the feeding practices. Second, to study the relationship between the feeding style, the child's eating behavior (food preferences and consumption frequency) and his weight status. Thirdly, to evaluate the existence of a relationship between the feeding practices and the child's eating behavior. Finally, to explore relations between mother’s attitudes toward her weight and her child’s weight and neophobic behavior. One hundred twenty-two mothers of preschoolers aged 3 to 5, were recruited by daycare centers on the island of Montreal and completed and auto-administered questionnaire on parenting style, feeding style, feeding practices, child consumption frequency, child preference for certain foods and food groups, child neophobia, child weight and height, the mother's diet, the mother's perception of the child's weight, the mother's concern regarding the child's weight and a description of the family profile. Parenting styles, feeding style and feeding practices display correlations among themselves. The feeding styles, more precisely the two scales that describe them (demandingness and sensibility), show correlations with the consumption and preference for certain foods. Differences were also noted between various feeding styles and child weight status and certain eating behaviors. The following thesis suggests that three concepts are implicated in the feeding dynamic of the mother-child dyad; the parenting style, the feeding style and the feeding practices. It is suggested that the feeding style and food prerefences are correlated. Future research in this field will need to evaluate the relative impact of feeding practices, parenting styles and feeding styles on eating behavior (consumption and preferences) and child weight. An effective intervention seeking to change eating behavior among families will need to address parent feeding practices as well as parenting style and feeding style.	child , preschool , weight , eating habits , mother , parenting style , feeding practices , ood preferences	en	6086.0
1228	Exclusion de liaison génétique au locus SPAX2 de cas canadiens-français d’ataxie spastique	Hereditary ataxias are neurodegenerative disorders which share ataxia as common feature  is manifested by a decrease in limb coordination, imbalance and an unsteady gait. They consist in a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group. Many ataxia classifications have been proposed, however, the current consensus is to first characterize them according to their mode of transmission. Hereditary ataxias as a whole have a prevalence of 6/100 000, with variable estimation between country and region. In the Province of Quebec where the French Canadian genetic pool can be seen has a mosaic of regional gene pools there is clear differences in local variation in the prevalence of different ataxias. Acadia is also a French Canadian region with a history of many founder effects and a higher prevalence for certain hereditary ataxias. We recruit 8 French Canadian families from Quebec and with genealogical links with Acadia in which 10 cases manifest a presumably relatively mild autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of unknown etiology. The shared phenotype and Acadian background raised the possibility that they suffered from a new form of ataxia with a founder effect. To identify the mutated gene causing this ataxia, the individuals recruited were genotyped. By homozygosity mapping, a region of 2,5 Mb was identified in one family on chromosome 17p13. A literature review established that in 2007 four North Africans families segregating also a mild spastic ataxia were linked to the same locus on chromosome 17. To support our hypothesis that our patients were carrier of the same founder mutation we look closer at their haplotype in the region. We defined an interval of 200kb (70 SNP) between markers rs9900036 and rs7222052 shared by all affected cases. The two most promising gene in the interval were sequenced. No mutation was found in SLC25A11 and KIF1C. Thereafter a linkage analysis by LOD score excluded the candidate interval of 200 kb in the majority of our families. We conclude that even if in one family exists a large homozygous region on chromosome 17, the lack of informative SNP in the 200 kb region was responsible for the apparent sharing rather than they shared a common mutation. Further work will be necessary to identify the mutate gene causing the ataxia presentation in these cases of mild spastic ataxia.

1229	Étude du rôle des lymphocytes T chez les receveurs pédiatriques de greffe de sang de cordon ombilical	Umbilical cord blood (UCB) is increasingly used as a source of hematopoietic progenitor cells to treat a variety of disorders in children. UCB transplantation (UCBT) is associated with a reduced incidence of graft-versus-host disease, a robust graft-versus-leukemia effect, more frequent graft failures and a higher incidence of opportunistic infections (OI) compared to bone marrow transplantation; four processes in which donor-derived T lymphocytes are known to be predominantly involved. UCB T cells are mostly naïve. To examine the differential functionality of UCB T cells, CD8+ T cells specific for the melanoma-associated HLA-A2-restricted Melan-A26-35 A27L peptide were isolated from UCB and UCBT recipients, as it represents an abundant preimmune repertoire in human. Following in vitro stimulation, UCB T cells proliferated, oligoclonalized, acquired cell surface markers reflective of effector/memory differentiation, expressed cytolytic activity and produced IFN-γ. While functional properties of UCB T cells resembled their counterparts in adult peripheral blood, they were more likely to reach terminal differentiation following stimulation, produced less IFN-γ and were less frequently bifunctional (IFN-γ and cytolysis). Following UCBT, T cells became exhausted: they oligoclonalized dramatically, exhibited a terminal differentiation phenotype and a high frequency also expressed PD-1 (“ programmed death 1 ”) in the first 3-6 months post-UCBT. Moreover, very few patients developed an antiviral response during this period. Finally, the frequency of PD-1+ CD8+ T cells was significantly higher in subjects who subsequently experienced leukemic relapse. A second wave of T cells emerging at 6 months post-UCBT was observed and characterized by an increase in the repertoire diversity till 1 year, the development of a naïve population with polyfunctional potential and the progressive reconstitution of antiviral responses. This study reports to the biological properties of UCB-derived CD8+ T cells and provides a rationale for the characteristics of UCBT in terms of immune reconstitution and OI. These results also suggest that the first wave of CD8+ T cells in the first 3-6 months post-UCBT should be targeted in priority to improve both OI and leukemic relapse risks.

1230	Le Baylisascaris procyonis dans le sud du Québec : prévalence chez le raton laveur et étude de contamination des latrines	Raccoons are carriers of many parasites, some of which are zoonotic. We wanted to expand our knowledge of the Quebec raccoon intestinal parasitic fauna, specifically the Baylisascaris procyonis species. The study consisted of fecal matter (n = 301) and intestinal content examinations (n = 203) collected from 351 raccoons originating from two government programs on raccoon’s rabies and excrements collected (n = 409) from latrines in Quebec national parks. Eggs from B. procyonis were excreted by 23.3 % of raccoons while 29.1 % were worm carriers. The average parasitic burden of all stages of B. procyonis worms varied from 8.5 in adults to 27.1 in juveniles. In juveniles, the parasitic burden was 11.4 times superior to adult raccoons (p < 0.0001) with 23.7 times more immature worms (p < 0.0001) and 9.1 times more mature worms (p = 0.01). The number of eggs was 24.7 times superior in juvenile raccoons (p = 0.02) and 50.0 times lower in breast-feeding females. The probability of raccoons excreting eggs in autumn was 11.1 (IC95 %: 1.21-101.60) in comparison to spring and 21.1 (IC95 %: 2.91-153.18) in comparison to summer (p < 0.01). The sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) of coproscopy compared to necropsy (gold standard) were calculated based on observations of mature worms (Se: 81.8 %; Sp: 97.7 %) and worms of all stages (Se: 53.9 %; Sp: 97.0 %). In addition, our intestinal parasitic research permitted the finding of Giardia oocysts (6/159), which is a newly found parasite species in raccoons. In 2007, B. procyonis eggs were found in 15.8 % of latrines (n = 165) identified in Southern Quebec national parks and in 89.7% of active latrines (n = 26) in three Eastern Townships national parks sites accessible to man in 2008. The zoonotic potential of B. procyonis is a public health issue that could become serious considering the high percentage of raccoons excreting the parasite thus contaminating sectors accessible to man.

1231	Tracés de Proust, itinéraires maternels : la grand-mère dans « À la recherche du temps perdu »	According to Proust, the only true work is one translated from lost impressions, still sustained in our memory of senses. Characters enter the text of the Recherche by hitting the hero's sensibility. However, the grandmother, toujours déjà là (always already there) like the mother, belongs to a reality that has never imprinted itself, a reality that is anterior both to the narrator's consciousness and to the text. Nevertheless, the grandmother is a mother who ages and dies. Then only she appears to the narrator, but in reverse direction to the general introduction of alterity. She must become another woman, old, unknown, and indefinite in her gesture towards death in order for the text to give her back a « first impression ». It is precisely in this distance - which is also an itinerary - between the immediacy from the beginning and this first impression, that the grandmother's specificity approaches what Proust would call a neuralgia of his text. In order to become an object for literary style, the mother must bend (se plier) to the writer's stroke. Yet, the mother character, as it is elaborated in the Recherche, seems to resist this bend. The grandmother character allows Proust to express the reality of the mother's decay and death, a mother made malleable by the hand of a son becoming a writer.

1232	Le retour des réfugiés et des personnes déplacées dans le cadre de la consolidation de la paix : les cas de la Croatie et de la Bosnie-Herzégovine	The work addresses the question of the return of the refugees and the displaced persons in Croatia and in Bosnia-Herzegovina, within the framework of the operations of peacebuilding, which took place in the region. Indeed, the reinstatement of the populations in their place of origin was presented as one of the priorities, by the international community and as the ideal solution to encourage the reconciliation in the region and to restore the ethnic diversity. However, the respective balance assessments of the former two republics towards the return of minorities present significant differences. The internal factors on which stumbled the processes of return in both countries were appreciably the same. In these conditions, the determining variable seems to have been located in the nature of the international interventions, which was deployed in Bosnia- Herzegovina and in Croatia. Altogether, Bosnia-Herzegovina benefited, on behalf of the diverse international actors, of an attention much more supported in this respect than Croatia. Therefore, Bosnia saw itself granted considerably more financial, logistic and diplomatic resources to propel the return of ethnic minorities considerably than Croatia. This observation highlights the inconsistency of the international rhetoric which defends principles associated with the defense of human rights, pluralism and multiethnicity but which the concrete application collides with the domestics imperative of the involved countries and with the other requirements related to the post-conflict reconstruction obligations.

C.-27). Certain sectors, providing essential services such as the public transit sector and the health and social services sector have additional rules. Those rules are referred to as the essential services legislation. Negotiations occurring within this structure have noticeable differences - the exclusion of political considerations, on the one hand, and the lack of a replacement for public services for the public, on the other hand – that distinguishes them from the more common framework of collective bargaining established by the Labor Code for other sectors of activity (Bergeron et Paquet, 2006).   We ask the question: what are the impacts of the essentials services legislation on collective bargaining? For this research project, we have analysed the impact of the essential services legislation (rules by the Labor Code and decisions rendered by the Essential services board) on different aspects of collective bargaining: 1) mobilization, 2) power bargaining, 3) pressure tactics, 4) flow of negotiation, 5) work stoppage, 6) results of collective bargaining and 7) work climat.  We carried out two case studies in order to study the atypical negotiations in our industrial relations system. The first study was in the public transit sector and the second in the health and social services sector. The results demonstrate that the essential services legislation influences collective bargaining. But the additional constraints in the social services sector do not seem to influence, on a larger scale, the collective bargaining for that sector of activity.

1234	L'alimentation selon l'âge et la culture : une analyse logico-naturelle des représentations construites par des enfants canadiens/québécois et roumains	This research focuses on children’s representations of food and nutrition from a constructivist epistemological perspective based on an interdisciplinary approach integrating communication and social psychology. Our goal was to determine which representations of food and nutrition could be understood as social representations, and if children’s age and cultural background interfered with the development of those representations. The subjects were children aged 7 to 12 from three different cultural backgrounds - we compared representations of food and nutrition built by children born, raised and educated in Romania and Quebec, as well as children from families of Romanian immigrants born (or raised from a very young age) in Quebec. The research methodology integrated social psychology and communication perspectives, instrumentally derived from natural logic and theories on social representations. Results suggest that children build social representations of food and nutrition, and that these representations become progressively more complex, undergoing a similar developmental process, according to children’s age, both from a cognitive and moral viewpoint. Moreover, the research highlights that socio-cultural background influences on the representations content and complexity refer either to cultural or ideological influences with regards to the differences and similarities between socio-cultural groups. Furthermore, we proposed scenarios of communication strategies aiming to increase the effectiveness of nutritional education programs. Finally, the research provides contributions to theories of social representations and child development as well as to the development of new methods for the analysis of representations.	representations of food and nutrition , social representations , natural logic , healthy food , junk food , nutritional education , developmental research	en	6042.0
1235	L'éthique dans la philosophie politique de Georges Sorel	Contemporary political philosophy is fraught with a history still to be discharged, as much as last century’s “European civil war” forced its concealing. In this masters thesis, we seize Georges Sorel, figurehead of the 1900s revolutionary syndicalism, as an archetypical figure of what is “in remaining” of this history. Archetype not only of the way in which popular theorists can be easily forgotten by the force of history, but also archetype of these forces themselves, as Sorel is considered by intellectual history as the thinker having set up the bridge between extreme left and extreme right. This master does not directly intend to attribute to Sorel the “paternity of fascism”, or to exonerate him. It rather develops a deconstruction of its principal ideas from an essentially philosophical standpoint, method virtually unprecedented. More precisely, our work consists to extricate Sorel’s definition of ethics, whereas his major theoretical gesture appears like a reduction of politics to ethics.  To do so, we mobilize contemporary philosophy, especially Gilles Deleuze and Giorgio Agamben, because of their strong theoretical affinities with Sorel, particularly in their definition of ethics.

1236	Caractérisation de l'état hypercoagulable associé à l'hyperadrénocorticisme chez le chien	The purpose of this study was to use thrombelastography (TEG®) and thrombin generation (TG) to evaluate coagulation in healthy beagles receiving oral prednisone as well as client-owned dogs diagnosed with hyperadrenocorticism (HAC).Six healthy adult beagles were used in a prospective ongitudinal study whereby all dogs received 1 mg/kg of prednisone orally once daily for two weeks, followed by a 6-week washout period and then 4 mg/kg of prednisone orally once daily for two weeks. TEG® tracings and TG measurements were obtained at baseline, at the end of the washout period and at the end of both corticosteroid trials. Significant results as compared to baseline were obtained for clot kinetics (K), alpha angle (α)and maximum amplitude (MA), with tracings compatible with a hypercoagulable profile following both corticosteroid trials. Thrombin generation resulted in a significant increase in endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) after the 1 mg/kg/day trial only. Secondly, sixteen dogs affected by HAC were evaluated. Fifteen dogs were evaluated by TEG® and 15 dogs were evaluated by TG before treatment and compared to the normal reference values. For the TEG® analysis, 12/15 dogs had at least one parameter that suggested hypercoagulability. A paired t test for values with unequal variance was used to compare the HAC dogs to the healthy dogs and found that HAC dogs have hypercoagulable TEG® tracings. The same results were found when TG was used with the ETP elevated in the HAC dogs. However, when dogs were evaluated individually, only 4/15 had hypercoagulable TG results.

1237	Liens prédictifs entre l’agressivité proactive et la délinquance : le rôle modérateur des normes prosociales du groupe-classe et du rejet par les pairs	The purpose of this study is to examine the predictive relationships between the behavior of proactive aggression in childhood and adolescent delinquency, and possibly the effect of moderating standards prosocial class group and the rejection by the peer group. Specifically, linkages will be examined: 1) the main positive link between proactive aggression in childhood and adolescent delinquency, 2) the moderating effect (ie, guard) first-level standards in prosocial class group on the link between proactive aggression and delinquency and 3) the moderating effect of the second level of peer rejection, given the dampening effect of the first level of prosocial norms of their class group. Two theoretical models are used to support the choice of assumptions and provide a framework in interpreting the results: The model group and model group similarity person. The data come from a sample of 327 children were assessed at six times the age of 10 years (ie, grade 4) and 15 (third year of secondary). Delinquency was measured using self-reported data by participants. Standards prosocial class group are based on average ratings made by teachers of prosocial behavior in their class. The rejection by peers was measured using sociometric assessments in group classes. The hierarchical linear regression models were used. The results show a positive link between proactive aggression in childhood and adolescent delinquency. Despite obtaining a marginal interaction coefficient, the results indicate that moderate pro-social norms, but increasing, the link between aggression and delinquency. The moderating effect of peer rejection is not as significant. These results will be discussed to better understand the link between aggression and elements of social context in which the child grows, and their involvement in the prevention of problems with aggression and delinquency in schools.

1238	Modèle novateur de conception d’interface humain-ordinateur centrée sur l’utilisateur : le designer en tant que médiateur	In complex design projects, problems typically arise when the design process is undertaken by multi-disciplinary groups of experts as well as non-experts because they do not share a common vision about the user’s needs, do not have identical goals related to the task, and do not have a common language to have productive dialogues as the design process progresses.   This research addressed issues related to the human-centered design approach within the context of human-computer interfaces (HCI). It explored ways in which a designer can create conditions whereby various contributors involved in the design process can benefit from the potential that the multi-disciplinary context afford to enrich their personal knowledge and reflection and at the same time work efficiently and collaboratively to design an interface that is user centered.  The research used a mixed methodology. In the first instance, a project-grounded research (research through design) was used in three successive case studies with increasing degrees of intervention and control by the researcher. Project-grounded research involves the development of knowledge and theory related to the design activity in an authentic design project. The focus of the first case was for the designer/researcher to observe her role and interaction with others during the design process. In the second case, the focus shifted to the collaborative interactions. The design process was used as a method to foster consensus building and the adoption of a common language to communicate and mutual goals to aim for. Limitations identified in these two cases led to the design of an intervention that was implemented in the third case. This intervention comprised an intensive workshop whereby team members engaged in an interdisciplinary attitude building exercise leading to joint-reflective practice toward achieving the goal which was to create a website. Data generated from these three cases informed the development of a theoretical model that represents steps of “optimal” collaborative design process, focusing on user-centeredness. In this model, the designer is attributed the additional and central role of mediator (designer as mediator) that facilitates the convergence of disparate foci and ways of thinking.  In the second instance, the model was presented to three design experts individually for validation purposes. Interview data collected from this process affirmed the validity of the concepts and relations depicted in the model as well as its transferability potential to other complex contexts. The proposed model has the promise of structuring design activities to unfold in a more efficient and timely manner while being sustainable.

1239	Stratégies intermédiales et autoreprésentation dans l'oeuvre littéraire et les dessins-partitions d'Unica Zürn	Having recourse to many forms of expression, Unica Zürn (1916-1970) revitalizes the space of the sheet by having it take an active part in the individual writing. The “I” seems to increase thanks to “anagrammatic” games on the many mobilized signs, whether they are alphabetical, pictorial or musical. The self-representation is inspired by an unusual multidisciplinary work, which renews the aesthetics, somewhat “worn”, of the surrealist movement.  This attitude towards the sheet, where many “decomposable” and “recomposable” signs share the space, is observable in Unica Zürn’s literary work as well as in her pictorial work. The process of creation through the letter, the stroke and the musical note tends to reassert the value of the material support used by the abolition of the boundaries among the artistic disciplines, which calls for a distanced look from the reader/spectator on the work.  In order to interpret Zürn’s work in the plurality of the artistic means that are deployed, the intermedial approach will be favoured. In the first chapter of this dissertation, we will see how a certain dialog is structured between the views of the intermediality’s researchers and Unica Zürn’s work. The relation to objects will be our entry point in the intermedial subject. Through a return to the materiality of the media-related experience, we will notice that Zürn puts at the forefront the instruments and the supports to the creation, which leads to a contorted representation of oneself, space and time.  Once the parallel established between the intermediality’s concepts and Zürn’s work, we will focus on the musical aspect of the author-artist’s multidisciplinary work. The second chapter will deal with the intrusion of sound in the textual universe, which will occur through the reappropriation of the Vincenzo Bellini’s opera “Norma”. This revising is called “Les jeux à deux” and is significantly different from the original text, and is paired with drawings made by the author-artist directly on the opera’s partitions.  The multiple look placed upon the zurnian work will allow to understand that the palimpsest writing takes part in the self-representation process, through elaborating a view regarding the interrelation of literature, drawing and music, as well as the influence of this juxtaposition on the overflow of the traditional media boundaries.

1240	Caractérisation de nouvelles lignées cellulaires pré-chimiothérapie et post-chimiothérapie du cancer épithélial de l'ovaire	Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the deadliest of all gynecologic cancers. The serous type of EOC is the most common form of the disease, and it accounts for more than 50% of the cases. It is often diagnosed at advanced stages where its prognosis is poor. Advanced EOC is treated mainly with chemotherapy. However, chemoresistance development eventually impedes the success of the treatments for most patients. Researchers have derived cell lines from EOC from solid tumors or from ascites. So far, there has not been EOC cell lines established from samples taken before and after chemotherapy treatments within the same patient. Our laboratory is thus the first to develop a new and powerful model of pre-chemotherapy and post-chemotherapy cell lines. All cell lines were derived sequentially from 3 different patients (1369, 2295 and 3133), from either solid tumors (TOV) or ascites (OV). We therefore characterized these new pre-chemotherapy cell lines (TOV1369TR, OV2295, TOV3133D and TOV3133G) and post-chemotherapy cell lines (OV1369(2), OV2295(2), TOV2295, OV3133 and OV3133(2)) through several approaches. Using immunohistochemistry and Western blot, we have characterized the level of expression of typical epithelial keratin markers (KRT7, KRT8, KRT18, KRT19, KRT20) to confirm the epithelial and ovarian nature of the cells. We have also analysed the expression level of important EOC markers, such as that of HER2 and p53, and found no clear difference between the pre-chemotherapy and post-chemotherapy EOC cells. Moreover, we have studied various tumorigenic features of the cell lines, such as cell proliferation (by cell count), cell migration (by the wound healing assay), 3D spheroid formation (by the hanging drop method), in vivo tumor formation in SCID mice (subcutaneous xenografts). In general, there were no notable differences between the two categories of cell lines at the cellular level, except that post-chemotherapy cell lines seemed to be unable to form compact 3D structures, contrary to some pre-chemotherapy cell lines. The obtained results would aid in better understanding the different mechanisms that malignant serous EOC tumors undergo and the progression of the disease with respect to the different treatments. Such study would allow us to gain valuable insight into the optimal treatment decisions to take for different EOC patients.

1241	Facteurs associés à l’implantation d’un programme de formation interprofessionnelle au sein d’un Centre de santé et de services sociaux au Québec	INTRODUCTION: Interprofessional collaboration emerged as one of the key aspects that have to be consolidated to improve the organization of primary care and to ensure an appropriate access to available resources. In order to increase interprofessional collaboration, it has been suggested that health sciences professionals should be trained in an interdisciplinary fashion, especially during clinical training.  OBJECTIVES: The aim of this research is to measure the degree of implementation of an initiative in interprofessional education (IPE) which takes place in the Health and social service centre (HSSC) studied, as compared to the initially proposed model. Furthermore, the objective of this research is to understand how systemic factors, organizational factors and the training program’s attributes influence the IPE initiative’s implementation. METHODS: This is a case study based on an HSSC located in the greater Montreal region in Quebec, Canada. Data was collected through 11 semi-structured interviews performed with professionals and administrators responsible for the IPE initiative’s implementation, together with one student who participated in the IPE initiative during his clinical training. An analysis of administrative and clinical documents regarding the IPE initiative’s implementation was also performed.  RESULTS: The implementation of the IPE initiative is still an ongoing process as it is showed by the medium-high presence of the different elements which define the IPE implementation and the generally low intensity of these elements. Systemic factors, organizational factors and the training program’s attributes influence the implementation of the IPE initiative in a clinical setting and there is an interaction between all of these factors. An analysis of the different factors influencing the implementation of an IPE initiative in a clinical setting should also consider the different factors influencing the development of collaborative practice in this environment.	étude qualitative , interprofessional education , implementation analysis , qualitative research , interprofessional collaboration , clinical setting	en	5893.0
1242	Évaluation d'un nouveau complément à l'intervention en physiothérapie pour le torticolis postural chez les nourrissons	Postural Torticollis is a common condition in pediatric practices especially since parents have adopted “Back to Sleep” campaign’s guidelines. Parents are often instructed to carry out a home program of exercises; however there are few educational tools with comprehensive information about postural torticollis exercises. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of the addition of the new Torticollis Intervention Booklet (TIB) on torticollis resolution (attainment of full passive neck range of motion), parental stress level, parental satisfaction and adherence to treatment received. Fifty-eight infants referred to physiotherapy for a postural torticollis were recruited and randomized during their initial visit to two groups: Physiotherapy + TIB (n=29) or Physiotherapy + Standard Care (n=29). Blinded evaluators assessed the patients at 1 and 3 months after their initial visit, thirty minutes before their physiotherapy consultation. Passive neck rotation range of motion (ROM) was measured by an arthrodial goniometer. Parental stress level was evaluated using the Parenting Stress Index- Short Form (PSI-SF). Parents received the PSI-SF at the end of the baseline visit and were requested to complete it at home and return it at their subsequent physical therapy appointment or at the second scheduled study assessment time. Parental satisfaction was evaluated using the Measure of Processes of Care (MPOC-56) at 3-months. Adherence to treatment was evaluated as the length of time per day parents reported having their children in the prone awake position in the week before follow-up visits. Analysis consisted of descriptive analyses for each group;  t-tests to compare  passive neck rotation ROM change scores between the baseline and 1-month visits and baseline and 3-month visits; and to compare subscale scores for PSI-SF (parental stress) and MPOC-56 (satisfaction with care) between the two groups. The Chi-square test was performed to compare adherence between the two groups at 1 and 3-months. The results showed a tendency to greater passive neck rotation (ROM) change at 1-month in the TIB group (95% Confidence Interval = 95%CI = 1.97- 8.77; p=0.17) but not at 3-months. Parents in the the TIB group showed lower global stress scores after receiving the intervention tool (95%CI= 49.20- 57.94; p = 0.01) and reported greater satisfaction than controls in the “coordinated and comprehensive care” (95%CI= 6.7-6.8; p=0.03) and « enabling and partnership » subscales (95%CI= 6.3-6.9; p<0.001). Finally, adherence was higher in the TIB group than controls especially at 3-months (p=0.01).  The new Torticollis Intervention Booklet accompanied by physical therapy treatment has a tendency to lead to an earlier restitution of passive neck rotation ROM, may help decrease stress levels, increase satisfaction with treatment, and improve adherence.

1243	Efficacité d’un traitement intra-­mammaire prolongé à base de ceftiofur (Spectramast®) pour les mammites cliniques chez les vaches laitières	Little research has focused on extended therapy in lactating cows with clinical mastitis and none were with ceftiofur. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of an intramammary extended ceftiofur treatment for mild to moderate clinical mastitis, and to determine whether it would increase cure rates when considering any bacteria or more particularly Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and streptococci. Holstein dairy cows (n = 241) from 22 herds located in Quebec and Ontario, Canada, were included. The study was designed as a randomized clinical trial. For each case of mild to moderate clinical mastitis diagnosed, 125 mg of ceftiofur hydrochloride (Spectramast® LC) was administered intramammary once a day for 2 or 8 consecutive days. Clinical cure rate 21 days after the last treatment was identical in each group (89%; n = 98/110; p = 0.95). Bacteriological cure rates 21 days after the last treatment for the 2- and 8-day regimens were 32% (n = 15/47) and 61% (n = 25/41), respectively, for all bacteria (p < 0.01); 64% (n = 9/14) and 82% (n = 9/11), respectively, for streptococci (p = 0.50); and 0% (n = 0/20) and 47% (n = 9/19), respectively, for S. aureus (p < 0.01). There were no statistical differences between experimental groups for new intramammary infections. Extended therapy appears to be a reasonable choice for the treatment of mild to moderate clinical mastitis, particularly in cases where S. aureus is the pathogen involved.	ceftiofur , extended therapy , ceftiofur , clinical mastitis , bovine	en	5885.0
1244	Facteurs contextuels influençant l’implantation d’un modèle de hiérarchisation des soins en santé mentale : une étude de cas en milieu montréalais	The purpose of the present study was to compare the care model of one Montreal local territory to the stepped-care model and to investigate factors influencing the implementation of this model. A qualitative case-study approach was employed involving 13 semi-structured interviews with services providers and managers from primary and specialist mental healthcare. Results showed that the hierarchical care model in place in this territory is compared in several points with the stepped-care model. However, some elements of these models have to be integrated to improve efficiency and quality of care, including the introduction of objective evaluation criteria and the specification of evidence-based interventions. Furthermore, some factors influenced the implementation of this hierarchical care model. Thus, the presence of collaborative working and learning strategies were identified to be a key condition. However, some elements must be considered to facilitate its success like the standardization of the referral criteria and process, the clarification of the mental health guichet d’accès (centralized access point) roles and the general practitioners' adherence to the care model. In conclusion, the use of the reference and analysis frames of this study may guide managers on issues to be considered to support the implementation of an evidence-based care model which may facilitate mental healthcare efficiency and its adequacy with the population needs.

1245	Le droit de l'OHADA face au commerce électronique	Le droit de l’OHADA face au commerce électronique (OHADA law pertaining to e-commerce) is an epistemological reflection on the legal issues raised by e-trade conducted among members of the Organisation for the Harmonisation of Business Law in Africa (OHADA). This forward looking analysis of the organization’s legal framework governing e commerce draws upon relevant experiments carried out notably in North America (Canada-Québec) and Europe. In Africa, as elsewhere, the new information technologies pose certain legal challenges. During the past several years, various regional and national initiatives have addressed these challenges. However, the heterogeneous nature of the different laws implemented impairs the regional-level legal security sought by OHADA. Building on legal transplant, this dissertation proposes, within the context of OHADA, a true harmonization that will ensure that “African specificities” are taken into account while making the Common Court of Justice and Arbitration (CCJA) in Abidjan the highest community jurisdiction in matters of e-commerce.

1246	Des typologies mécaniques à l'expérience esthétique : fonctions et mutations du genre dans le jeu vidéo	This thesis provides an in-depth examination of the nature and application of the concept of genre for the video game. It is divided in three parts. Part one features an overview of genre theory in literature and film studies. The essential properties of genre as a concept are identified: it is an intuitive and “thumbnail” classification method, discursive rather than systemic in nature, and that owes its existence to a common cultural consensus rather than theoretical divisions. More importantly, the notions of tradition, innovation and hybridity are found to be central to genre.  In part two, these findings are applied to the case of video game genre. A few typologies are examined to show that authoritative classifications are impossible. A model of the development of genres is laid out, based on three modalities: imitation, reiteration and innovation. By studying the history of the first-person shooter, the traditional conception of genre being based on formal mechanics is replaced by a new definition centered on player experience.  Part three details experience as a theoretical concept and places it at the center of a new conception of genre, the pragmatics of generic effects. In this view, any object is a matrix of generic anchors bound to become generic effects, provided the player possesses the generic competences required to recognize them. This new approach is demonstrated through an examination of the survival-horror videogame genre. This case study showcases the potential of the pragmatics of generic effects for other fields, and provides a testimony for the recursion of the questions of genre between the video game, literature, and film.

1247	Plaidoyer pour une responsabilité intégrée de l'ONU : le cas des opérations de paix	It is with great complexity and ambiguity that the United Nations Peace Operations took place on the international scene during the last decade. Since their deployment reflects first and foremost one of the most fundamental goal of the Unites Nations Organization, namely: to maintain international peace and security (Section 1(1) of the Charter of the United Nations), it is predictable that the actions they undertake on the field may produce harmful effects for the third parties. The question raised by this thesis aims to discover if and to what extent the UN responsibility is governed by International Law when such third parties suffer from material and personal damages at the hand of UN Peace Operations troops. What does International Law provide? Are there any means of reparation for the victims? Searching for the UN responsibility includes the supposition that the Organization possesses the international legal personality, because its legal existence represents the basic postulate on which its responsibility will be based. The Advisory Opinion of 11 April 1949 of the International Court of Justice on Reparation for Injuries Suffered in the Service of the United Nations constitutes the exact moment of the personification of the UN on the international scene. From a more substantial perspective, the outlines of the UN responsibility in the peacekeeping context are being drawn around one crucial element: « the internationally wrongful act ». This element includes two parts; on the one hand, an objective component which consists of a specific conduct (action or omission) breaching an international obligation; and, on the other hand, a subjective component attributing to the Organization the breach of this international obligation. This framework of the UN responsibility will allow a better understanding of the extent to which the responsibility of the Organization can be retained for actions or omissions committed in a peacekeeping context. More importantly, it allows us to plead for a responsibility which encompasses not only the endogenous characteristics of each situation, but also a legal protection by International Law of the interest of each individual.

1248	Rôle du récepteur REG/EXTL3 dans l’inflammation et son implication possible dans l’ostéoarthrose (OA)	Osteoarthritis (OA) is an articular disease with a particularly high incidence in the elderly. This disease is characterized by the progressive degeneration of the cartilage followed by subchondral bone remodelling and a change in the soft tissues of the joint. Local chronic pain and joint malfunction are generally attributed to the inflammation of the synovial membrane, which in itself has been shown to significantly contribute to the pathogenesis of OA. In fact, the synthesis and expression of many proteolytic enzymes which degrade cartilage matrix are regulated by numerous cytokines originating from these inflammation sites. Two pro-inflammatory cytokines, the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and the interleukine-1β (Il-1β), play a major role in triggering inflammation associated with OA. These cytokines act on synoviocytes and chondrocytes by activating the transcription factor NF-κB, which in turn activates the cytokines’ genes. This positive regulating loop amplifies and maintains inflammatory responses. Recently, studies have shown that the over-expression of the REG receptor/EXTL3, a transmembranous receptor, enhances the activity of cytokine TNF-α in the activation of NF-κB. Unfortunately the mechanism involved in this process is still unknown. In addition, levels of EXTL3 and its ligand REG1B observed in OA patients suggest their possible involvement in the development of OA. Our goal was to study and elucidated the mechanisms used by EXTL3 to amplify NF-κB activation by TNF-α, as well as to examine whether the same phenomenon is occurring with IL-β. A human chondrocytes cell line called C28/I2 as experimental model. The techniques used for the current study were transfection assays, immunoflorescence (IF), immunoprecipitation (IP), and Western blotting (WB). Our transfection data have shown that EXTL3 was able to enhance NF-κB activity induced by TNF-α as well as by IL-1β. This result suggests that the enhanced NF-κB activity by EXTL3 is not specific to TNF-α. The IP experiments with TNFR1 and TRAF2 revealed the presence of EXTL3 in TNF-α/TNFR1 complex which is formed in the plasma membrane. Also, IF assay in combination with confocal microscopy allowed us to detect TNFR1/TRAF2/EXTL3 co-localisation on the nuclear membrane, suggesting the formation of TNF-α/TNFR1 complex on both the nuclear and plasma membranes. Somehow, REG1B, an EXTL3 ligand, and glucosamine were able to inhibit the formation of this complex at the plasma membrane. They were also able to abolish NF-κB activity enhanced by EXTL3. These results suggest that not only EXTL3 recruitment in the TNF-α/TNFR1 complex is required to amplify NF-κB activation by TNF-α, but also that REG1B ligand and glucosamine have the ability to modulate this activation by reducing or inhibiting EXTL3 and TNFR1 interactions. This study’s data represents a major advance in the understanding of molecular events controlling NF-κB activation by pro-inflammatory cytokines. These results could lead to the development of new therapeutics targets, in the treatment of disorders associated to OA and involving recurrent activation of NF-κB.	inflammation , NF-κB , EXTL3 , REG , glucosamine , Osteoarthritis	en	5524.0
1249	Association entre l'insécurité alimentaire et les apports en nutriments chez les Premières Nations de la Colombie-Britannique	The aim of this study was to verify the association between food insecurity and dietary intake of First Nations living on reservations in British-Columbia and to assess interactions of traditional food in the relationship between food insecurity and dietary intake. We analyzed data for 493 women and 356 men in 21 First Nations communities in British-Columbia using a 24h-food recall and the Health Canada adapted version of the HFSSM Food security questionnaire from the First Nations Food, Nutrition and Environment Study (FNFNES). We did not find any association between food security and total dietary intake for women and for men. However, traditional food was found to be interacting in the relationship between food security and total dietary intake for many nutrients for men and women. For First Nations women, diet quality could have a major impact in the relationship between food insecurity and dietary intakes. For men, differences in dietary behaviours could have been associated to a lack of traditional food in the worse cases of food insecurity. Moreover, interactions of traditional food in the relationship between food security and total dietary intake leave us to believe that men and women, from moderate food-insecure and food-secure households, add this kind of food to their daily intake whereas men and women from serious food-insecure households seem to replace commercial foods with traditional foods.

1250	Les migrations pendulaires à Montréal : analyse de l'offre de service des transports collectifs	Times change and the New Temporalities have modified the individual’s organization of time. The new information technologies combined with high car dependence contribute to urban sprawl and to the increase in distance for commuters. Thousands of daily moves made by commuters, moving in an urban territory, are not without consequences. A massive use of public transportation would lead to a decrease of inconveniences associated with daily commuting. Public transit companies have to provide commuters with excellent service. The offer has to be adapted to people’s needs, in order to reach a mass of users. The New Temporalities have modified the way most people use their time. The goal of this research is, then, to verify if the public transit supply of « La Société de Transport de Montréal et la Ville de Montréal» is adapted to today’s commuters’ needs.

1251	Study of cox1 trans-splicing in Diplonema papillatum mitochondria	Diplonema papillatum is a single cellular organism that lives in the ocean. Its mitochondrial genome possesses a special feature: all genes are fragmented in multiple pieces that are called modules and each module is encoded by a different chromosome. Expression of a gene requires trans-splicing that successfully assemble a full-length mRNA from all modules of the gene. It was previously shown that the cox1 gene is encoded in nine modules that are all located on different chromosomes; moreover, a stretch of six non-encoded Us exist between Module 4 and 5 in the mature mRNA [1]. No consensus sequence of known splicing sites was identified near the modules. We speculate that trans-splicing of the cox1 gene is directed by guide RNAs (gRNAs) via a mechanism that is similar to U-insertion/deletion editing in kinetoplastids, the sister group of diplonemids. We have detected populations of small RNA molecules that could come from mitochondrial. We found that the six Us were added to the 3’ end of Module 4 in a similar way to the Us added by the TUTase in kinetoplastid U-insertional editing. Sequence profiles of possible trans-splicing gRNAs were constructed in regular expressions based on our knowledge of known gRNAs in kinetoplastid RNA editing. According to the complementarity between the gRNA and the two adjacent modules, primers were designed for RT-PCR that aims to detect gRNA sequences. Among the results, we identified sequences that match or partially match the gRNA profiles. A pilot in vitro assay did not reconstitute trans-splicing of module 3, 4 and 5, suggesting that further technical improvements are needed.

1253	Système de superposition arborescente et aspect soliste (le vibraphone et le bending tone) : éléments de détermination d’un langage musical personnel	This doctoral thesis involves the analysis, scores and sound recordings of several composed and improvised musical compositions recorded during the years 2009 – 2010. Its main objective is the development of elements determining a personal musical language. To achieve this objective, different tools were put in place such as the development of a flexible harmonic and melodic system and the expansion of the multitude of sound effects of the vibraphone, both achieved by mastering the “bending tone”. The body of this document is divided in two parts devoted to the elaboration of a system of superposition of the different changes that can be brought to the core element and the aspect of the soloist searching for flexibility, virtuosity and the diversity of sounds linked to this particular instrument. The concepts elaborated are supported by illustrations, score references and targeted musical examples including jazz and western classical styles.

1254	Poly(ethylene-co-acrylic acid) random copolymers : amphiphilic properties and self-assembly in aqueous medium	The first objective of this research is to synthesize random linear copolymers of ethylene and acrylic acid (AA). The synthesis relies on the deprotection of the functional groups in the copolymer’s precursor, which is represented by poly(ethylene-co-tertbutyl acrylate). The synthesis of the precursor was realized by the catalytic approach, where Pd-based catalytic systems are frequently utilized nowadays. The deprotection was carried out by hydrolysis of the ester functionality using trimethylsilyl iodide agent. The second objective is to investigate and characterize the synthesized polymers in the bulk and in colloidal solution. A set of different precursor polymers with various degrees of molar incorporation of tertbutyl acrylate (from 4 to 12 mol %) was successfully synthesized and deprotected. The resulting poly(ethylene-co-acrylic acid) copolymers were found to be soluble in tetrahydrofuran THF, when the molar incorporation of AA reaches the value of 12 and more. This aspect gave the possibility to study the self-assembly of this copolymer in aqueous medium by slow THF to water exchange (dialysis). It was found that the copolymers self-assemble into nano-sized structures and these nanoparticles remain stable in colloidal solution for extended periods of time. Moreover, it was shown that the nanoparticles formed by the discussed copolymer possess thermo- and pH-responsive behaviour. The polymers synthesized were characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and infrared spectroscopies (IR) before and after deprotection. The bulk samples were analyzed by conventional differential scanning calorimetry and by X-ray diffraction iv technique. The molar percentages of AA were determined using a combination of NMR and conductimetric titration. Colloidal solutions of pE-co-AA copolymers were analyzed by dynamic light scattering and high-sensitivity differential scanning calorimetry techniques. The nanoparticles formed were visualized and characterized by transmission electron microscopy.	Nanoparticles , Pd-catalysts , Polyethylenes , Acrylic Acid , HS-DSC , HS-DSC	en	5389.0
1255	Modélisation de l'irradiance solaire spectrale dans le proche et moyen ultraviolet	We present a model for spectral solar irradiance between 200 and 400 nm. It is an extension of a model for total solar irradiance based on sunspots fragmentation and erosion. This model takes the observed sunspot position and area as input for every oneday time step whereas emergences on the far side of the Sun are injected stochastically. The model simulates the spot’s disintegration and fragmentation into smaller structures such as spots and faculae and produces a magnetic structures area distribution evolving with time. The model contains many free parameters controlling the spots fragmentation, the quiet Sun irradiance, etc. They are adjusted by comparing the model outputs with observations from satellites spanning approximately three activity cycles. The model for spectral irradiance is a modified version of the model for total irradiance. More precisely, the spots and faculae contrast calculation and the quiet Sun contribution are adjusted to account for their spectral dependance. First, the quiet Sun flux is interpolated on a non magnetic synthetic spectrum, while the spots contrast is calculated with the ratio of the flux from a synthetic spectrum colder than the non magnetic photosphere, and the flux from a quiet Sun spectrum. The facular brightening is calculated with a simple procedure using the black body theory. This procedure interpolates a temperature associated with the formation height of photons from faculae on a temperature profile resulting from model atmosphere calculations. The spectral irradiance time series calculated with the model are compared to data from SOLSTICE on UARS. The two data sets do not agree very well, especially when we consider the minimum irradiance level and the amplitude variations over a complete cycle. Therefore, we apply a correction on the quiet Sun level and on the facular temperature profile. Finally, using a genetic algorithm, we reconstruct an empirical facular temperature profile by maximizing the fitness with observations. We use it to reconstruct spectral irradiance time series starting in 1874 at wavelengths of interest for stratospheric chemistry and dynamics.	ultraviolet , Sun , spectral irradiance , ultraviolet , relative variability	en	5339.0
1256	Les trajectoires de l'intégration professionnelle des immigrants iraniens travaillant comme chauffeurs de taxi à Montréal	This study examines the integration trajectories of Iranian immigrants working as taxi drivers in Montreal, Canada. Participants in this study were still working as taxi drivers after five, ten and fifteen years or more after their arrival, although some had a university degree. Thus, the conclusions of this study differ from the results of other studies in the degree of success immigrants achieve in terms of professional insertion in the medium to long term.   This research emerged from a review of studies which focused on issues related to the integration of immigrants, specifically in Canada and Quebec. This paper presents broader results by recording, reporting, and investigating participant expectations and motivations prior to departure, and their experiences and motivations after their arrival in the country of reception. Using a qualitative methodology, data was collected on the life-experiences and the professional trajectories of forty immigrants working as drivers at a Montreal taxi company. The majority of the subjects were Iranian, which removed potential difficulties in the research process, and allowed the researcher to explore specific issues in greater depth.   The first part of this study aims to familiarize the reader with an overview of the history of immigration in Canada, and more specifically the history of Iranian immigration patterns in Canada, and to present the conceptual framework and methodological approach used in this research. The second part documents the participants’ stories and discusses the findings. After being denied access to subsidized post-secondary education, and after trying a number of low-level jobs, participants identified taxi driving as most advantageous in terms of income and working conditions.   The discussion of the results reveals a number of key phenomena that directly contribute to the low success rate of professional integration of Iranian immigrants into the Quebec economy. These phenomena include an initial lack of access to subsidized, post-secondary education for asylum seekers prior to the granting of permanent status in Canada; the inadequate level of French language preparation through government funded courses; the inadequacy of public job-seeking agencies to advertise anything other than low-level jobs; subtle post 9/11 discrimination in the employment market, and the inability of the relatively new Iranian community in Canada to provide social and professional support and resources to new immigrants as they seek appropriate professional employment.  A number of participants formed business partnerships with other Iranian immigrants.  However, these partnerships were between partners who barely knew each other, and in every case, a lack of technical expertise and business know-how led to the collapse of the businesses.  Frustration with their ongoing low level of professional integration in Quebec led a number of participants to leave Quebec in search of greater professional satisfaction.  These decisions were often made without considering the realities of the move and with little or no forethought to integrating into another new environment.  As a result, all of the participants who left Quebec have since returned.  While other studies have been critical of the cultural and work behaviours of Iranian immigrants, this study has found that these same characteristics, when observed within the parameters of a well managed work environment, have had a positive impact on the performance and functioning of the Montreal taxi company.    While it remained the wish of the majority of the participants in this study to find more satisfying, professional employment, in the final analysis, the findings of this study suggest that under the current conditions, the majority of these participants will continue to drive taxis.	immigration , professional integration , trajectory of immigrants , Iranian immigrants , asylum seekers , Canadian tuition fees , taxi drivers , Immigrants’ entrepreneurship , ethnic enterprises	en	5330.0
1257	Protocole de routage basé sur des passerelles mobiles pour un accès Internet dans les réseaux véhiculaires	The fast progression of wireless technologies has motivated the emergence of new communications system called VANETS (Vehicular Adhoc Networks). VANETS enable vehicles on the roadway to communicate with each other and with road infrastructure using wireless capabilities. The applications of VANETS include improving safety and comfort on the road. For example, by providing Internet to vehicles, traveling can be safer and more comfortable. To provide Internet connectivity, messages need to be exchanged between the vehicles. However, it is hard to design an efficient routing protocol for connecting vehicles to Internet with a reasonable cost due to high mobility in VANETS. Although, several existing routing protocols have been proposed in the open literature to extend Internet to VANETS, they generate considerable overhead. This leads to unfairly consumption of bandwidth decreasing network performance. We design a routing protocol to connect vehicles to Internet through mobile gateways with the objective to make efficient use of the network bandwidth. Indeed, the protocol significantly reduces the communication overhead required to establish and maintain the routes relying on the mobility of the gateways and the network’s load.

1258	Modélisation de facteurs associés à une perception d'insuffisance lactée	Few mothers achieved the international recommendation of 6 months exclusive breastfeeding even though it’s numerous benefits both for mother and baby. Perceived insufficient milk (PIM) is a frequent reason reported by mother for stopping breastfeeding or introducing commercial milk products, especially in the first 6 weeks. Although consensus about its prevalence exists in the literature, the origin of this perception is still unexplained. Does PIM result from breastfeeding mismanagement which interferes with lactation physiologic processes or does it results from a lack of maternal confidence? This critical gap in the knowledge of determinants of PIM limits nursing intervention development. The aim of this study is to determine the relative contribution of biological and psychological variables on PIM among a group mother’s 1st time breastfeeding. To allow a comprehensive understanding of the evolution of PIM, a predictive confirmative longitudinal design was implemented from birth to 6th week postnatal. PIM model was developed through theory synthesis and include the following key variables: birth events, infant capacities, maternal capacities, supplementation, breastfeeding self-efficacy, perceived insufficient milk and breastfeeding practices. This study’s sample consisted of 252 breastfeeding 1st time mothers that were contacted at 4 points in time. At T1, the first 24 hours following birth, the participants completed a questionnaire related to their intention to initiate and maintain 6 months exclusive breastfeeding. At T2 of the study, on the 3rd day postpartum, the women completed a 2nd questionnaire regrouping the different measures used for the PIM model key variables and hand-expressed breast milk sample. On the 2nd week, T3, the women completed a questionnaire comparable to the one at T2, which was sent by mail. Lastly, the 4th study time, at the 6th week, a semi-directed telephone interview was done regarding their breastfeeding practices. Statistical analyses included Pearson correlations, ascendant logistic regressions and SEM. The results suggest a simultaneous influence of infant capacities and breastfeeding self-efficacy on PIM on T2 and T3; breastfeeding self-efficacy exerting a mediating effect in between infant capacities and PIM at both T2 and T3. At T2, breastfeeding frequency was associated with a fall in Na+ breastmilk, indicating establishment of lactogenesis II. Interventions towards increasing breastfeeding self-efficacy should be developed.

1259	"La programmation régionale des services
ambulatoires de Laval : une avenue dans la
responsabilisation populationnelle des soins de santé"	Due to the continuous pressures on the health systems, many reforms are perpetually implemented to improve care process and consequently the quality of care in order to increase public’s health level. The ultimate goal of this health system’s reform is to optimize the services impact on population’s health by introducing the populational responsibility concept; an approach based on the conviction that health is collective, therefore necessary to maintain and develop. In addition, there are more and more consensus on the necessity to establish a direct and durable relationship between care providers and communities. Thus, a way to be able to consider the patient’s personal and social contexts along with his family, and to ensure continuous care. This thesis, based on the Regional Programmation of ambulatory services (PRSA) of Laval, analyzes this program as an innovative solution concerning the introduction of populational approach in healthcare. The research strategy combines an integrated literature review, which analyses the pertinence of the PRSA; a quasi-experimental study, to examine its effects; and finally, a synthetic research that allows grasping the PRSA’s evolution and to analyze the institutionalization of change in healthcare organizations. In the first article, we analyse the pertinence of the PRSA’s model or, in other words, the plausibility of the causal relation that is presumed by this model. The PRSA is a regional model that combines integrated healthcare networks, case management and a populational approach to achieve populational responsibility. We showed, based on an integrated literature review, that this program has indeed the potential to secure a regional integration using a populational approach to well assess its population’s needs. The second article analyses the PRSA’s populational effects in terms of length of stay (LOS) and regional retention. A quasi-experimental design was used. For the length of stay, no decrease could be noted for asthma or dementia. On the other hand, the PRSA’s implementation may have contributed to decrease the LOS for heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary embolism and breast cancer. Concerning the regional retention of patients, no significant changes were seen for COPD, pulmonary embolism and dementia though effects were observed for heart disease, asthma and breast cancer. Finally, in the third article, we look at the reasons that lead PRSA’s suspension. Based on the PRSA’s manager and the current services programs managers in Laval, we tried to get a better understanding of the factors that delayed the PRSA’s implementation. The results indicate that the frequent healthcare system leading structures reorganizations and the interference of several other reforms in the past years were obstacles in the PRSA’s implementation.  Considering the current context, in which health care system is going through several reforms and where the network approach and the populational responsibility are valued, the results of this thesis bring a valuable contribution to the comprehension and the implementation of these concepts.

1260	Geste, forme, couleur	This thesis concerns step behind the composition of electroacoustic and instrumental compositions during my doctorate in the Faculté de musique de l’Université de Montréal. It is first a matter of the importance of the sound recording as primordial composition know-how; I develop in this title five fundamental points inherent in creative sound recording and central to my musical practice. Then comes a technical skimming over of Gestugel, a tool of sound processing developed during my doctorate and which generated most of the sounds used in my com- positions . The five sound recording paradigms previously developed are then reminded and applied to the stage of audio processing, allowing the concept of extension of the sound recording, a concept of audio processing similar to the ap-close to the traditional sound recording and a direct application of which Gestugel is. Concrete examples are supplied to differentiate the extention of the sound recording of the conventional audio processing. A last part, more philosophical, tries to circumscribe the surnaturalist approach of the composer: the use of recurrent motives, of gestures, of sound causality and of sublimation (orchestration) of the acoustical sound tries to accomplish true sound paintings, a figurative music where one can see as much as he can hear.	color , sound recording , composition , electroacoustic music , intrumental music , gesture , figurative music , naturalism	en	5296.0
1261	Bcl-xL regulation and function in cell cycle checkpoints and progression	Accumulating evidence suggest that Bcl-xL, an anti-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family, also functions in cell cycle progression and cell cycle checkpoints. To further understand Bcl-xL regulation and function in cell cycle progression, we first expressed a series of single-point Bcl-xL cDNA phospho-mutants, including Thr41Ala, Ser43Ala, Thr47Ala, Ser49Ala, Ser56Ala, Ser62Ala and Thr115Ala in human cancer cell lines and investigated their impact on cell cycle progression.         Analysis of this series of phosphorylation mutants reveals that cells expressing Bcl-xL(Ser62Ala) mutant are less stable at the G2 checkpoint and enter mitosis more rapidly than cells expressing wild type Bcl-xL or Bcl-xL phosphorylation mutants, including Thr41Ala, Ser43Ala, Thr47Ala, Ser56Ala and Thr115Ala. Dynamic phosphorylation and location studies on phospho-Bcl-xL(Ser62) in unperturbed, synchronized cells and during DNA damage-induced G2 arrest revealed that phospho-Bcl-xL(Ser62) translocates into nucleolar structures in VP16-exposed cells during G2 arrest. Using in vitro kinase assays, pharmacological inhibitors and specific siRNAs experiments, we found that Polo kinase 1 and MAPK9/JNK2 are major protein kinases involved in Bcl-xL(Ser62) phosphorylation and accumulation into nucleolar structures during the G2 checkpoint. In nucleoli, phospho-Bcl-xL(Ser62) binds to and co-localizes with CDK1(CDC2), the key cyclin-dependent kinase required for entry into mitosis. These data indicate that, during G2 checkpoint, phospho-Bcl-xL(Ser62) stabilizes G2 arrest by timely trapping CDK1(CDC2) in nucleolar structures to slow mitotic entry. It also highlights that DNA damage affects the dynamic composition of the nucleolus, which now emerges as a key event in the DNA damage response.  In a second study, we describe that cells expressing Bcl-xL(Ser62Ala) are also more stable at a sustained spindle-assembly checkpoint (SAC) after exposure to taxol than cells expressing wild-type Bcl-xL or other mutants, an effect that appears to be independent of its anti-apoptotic activity. Bcl-xL(Ser62) is strongly phosphorylated by PLK1 and MAPK14/SAPKp38α at prometaphase, metaphase and the anaphase boundary, while it is dephosphorylated at telophase and cytokinesis. Phospho-Bcl-xL(Ser62) localizes in centrosomes with γ-tubulin, along the mitotic spindle with dynein motor protein and in cytosol with SAC signaling components. In taxol-exposed cells, phospho-Bcl-xL(Ser62) binds to the CDC20/MAD2/BUBR1/BUB3 complex, while Bcl-xL(Ser62Ala) does not. The data indicate that during SAC, Bcl-xL(Ser62) phosphorylation accelerates SAC resolution and cell entry into anaphase, even in the presence of unattached or misaligned chromosomes. Silencing Bcl-xL expression also leads nocodazole-exposed cells to tetraploidy and binucleation, consistent with a Bcl-xL function in SAC and genomic stability.      In the third study, the functional analysis of a Bcl-xL phosphorylation mutant series has revealed that cells expressing Bcl-xL(Ser49Ala) mutant are less stable at G2 checkpoint after DNA damage and enter cytokinesis much more slowly after microtubule poisoning than cells expressing wild-type Bcl-xL. These effects of Bcl-xL(Ser49Ala) mutant seem to be distinct from Bcl-xL function in apoptosis. Bcl-xL(Ser49) phosphorylation is cell cycle-dependent. In synchronized cells, phospho-Bcl-xL(Ser49) appears during the S phase and G2, whereas it disappears rapidly in early mitosis during prometaphase, metaphase and early anaphase, and re-appears during telophase and cytokinesis. During DNA damage-induced G2 arrest, an important pool of phospho-Bcl-xL(Ser49) accumulates in centrosomes which act as essential decision centers for progression from G2 to mitosis. During telophase/cytokinesis, phospho-Bcl-xL(Ser49) is found along microtubules and at midbody with dynein motor protein. In a series of in vitro kinase assays, specific small interfering RNA and pharmacological inhibition experiments, polo kinase 3 (PLK3) was implicated in Bcl-xL(Ser49) phosphorylation. These data indicate that during G2 checkpoint phospho-Bcl-xL(Ser49) is another downstream target of PLK3, acting to stabilize G2 arrest. Bcl-xL phosphorylation at Ser49 also correlates with essential PLK3 activity and function, enabling cytokinesis and mitotic exit.

1262	Exploration pathologique des souris transgéniques porteuses du gène VPU de VIH-1	The HIV-1 infection results in a severe immunodepression due to an increasing depletion of the CD4+T lymphocytes and in a neurodegeneration that leads to a motor/cognitive complex dysfunction. In addition to these pathological alterations, patients with AIDS may also develop additional complications including neoplasms, nephropathy, hematological abnormalities and opportunistic infections. None of these complications can be accounted for solely by the loss of CD4+T lymphocytes and several investigators have started to suspect the regulatory and accessory genes of possibly playing a role in the AIDS physiopathogenesis. However, studies on the pathological effects contributed by these genes have been hampered by the lack of laboratory animals susceptible to HIV-1 infection. These could have helped to dissect out the role of the different components of the viral genome and their pathogenetic mechanisms. To overcome this obstacle, several investigators have developed transgenic mice carrying either HIV-1 individual genes or partially deleted genome. The vpu gene, which is unique to HIV-1, encodes a membrane phosphoprotein with several known functions as determined by in vitro studies. It participates in virions release at the cell surface, induces CD4 degradation, MHC-1 downregulation, increases apoptosis susceptibility of infected T cells and promotes viral replication by inhibiting cellular antiviral mechanisms. In order to investigate the contribution of vpu to the complex pathogenesis associated with HIV-1 infection, our laboratory developed a transgenic mouse model carrying vpu under the RSV LTR promoter. Here, we described our results of the clinical and pathological investigation of this unique animal model. Our results demonstrate that the expression of vpu in the transgenic mice induces a pansystemic lymphoid hyperplasia, splenomegaly with follicular lymphoid hyperplasia that progress to premalignant and malignant lesions, with striking characteristics of Castelman like-disease, and a mesangial vi hyperplasia variant of HIVAN frequently observed in adult and pediatric AIDS. All lesions observed in this mouse model suggest that the vpu carrying mice develop a nonspecific chronic activation of the immune system with hyperplasia of perivascular metallophillic cells and deregulation of the IL-6 expression within the hyperplastic follicles. Following treatment with dexamethazone and LPS, we observed an increased apoptosis susceptibility of the lymphocytes of the spleen and thymus with slow lymphocyte repopulation of these lymphoid organs. In addition, the transgenic mice developed an exacerbated reaction to the induced Schwartzman reaction and demonstrated a more delayed experimental DTH reaction. Thus, this transgenic model reproduces several abnormalities present in HIV patients. It represents a very interesting and valuable model for studies on the pathology contributed by the vpu gene in the absence of the cumulative effects of the other HIV-1 genes and might help define new possible functions and mechanisms of vpu in the HIV-1 pathogenesis.

1263	Pro-fibrotic role of ERK3-MK5 during pressure-overload induced cardiac hypertrophy	There are 4 isoforms of p38 MAP kinase: α, β, γ, and δ. p38 signaling has been implicated in fibrosis and apoptosis during cardiac hypertrophy. MK5, originally identified as a p38 Regulated/Activated Protein Kinase (PRAK), is known to be downstream of p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK). Although highly expressed in the heart, the physiological roles of MK5 remain unknown. To determine if MK5 plays a role in mediating detrimental effects downstream of p38, we studied the effect of transverse aortic constriction (TAC)-induced chronic pressure overload in mice heterozygous for a knockout of MK5 (MK5+/-). Moreover, as MK5 is also activated by the atypical MAPKs, ERK3 and ERK4, the effects of TAC were also studied in ERK3+/- mice. Wild-type (MK5+/+; ERK3+/+) littermates were used as controls. Two wks post-TAC, heart weight/body weight ratios were significantly and similarly increased in both MK5+/- and MK5+/+ hearts. Trans-thoracic echocardiography revealed that pressure overload impaired left ventricular diastolic function in MK5+/+, but not in MK5+/- hearts. In addition, less collagen deposition, assessed by Masson trichrome staining, was observed in MK5+/- hearts 2 and 3 wks post-TAC. Furthermore, TAC-induced increases in collagen alpha1 type1 mRNA levels were significantly lower in MK5+/- hearts at both 2 and 3 wks post-TAC. Immunoprecipitation of MK5 resulted in co-immunoprecipitation of ERK3 but not ERK4 or p38α in either acute or chronic sham-operated and TAC hearts. In contrast, exogenous GST-MK5 pulled down endogenous ERK4 and p38α, but not ERK3, from mouse heart lysates. Neither exogenous GST-ERK3 nor GST-p38α pulled down MK5. These results suggest that MK5 associates with, and is regulated by ERK3, but not ERK4 or p38α in heart. At physiological expressional levels, all MK5 was bound to ERK3 and hence not available to bind exogenous protein. Along similar lines, mice heterozygous for an ERK3 knockout (ERK3+/-) also showed reduced or absent collagen deposition and lower collagen alpha1 type1 mRNA levels 3 wks post-TAC. This data suggests an important pro-fibrotic role of MK5-ERK3 signaling during chronic pressure overload.We also demonstrated the existence of 5 splice variants of (MK5.1-5), including the originally published form (MK5.1). MK5.2 and MK5.5 had a 6 base pair deletion in exon 12: MK5.3 lacked exon 12: and MK5.4 and MK5.5 lacked exons 2-6. Subsequently, expression of the splice variants at the mRNA level was quantified by real time qPCR. Although ubiquitously expressed, the relative abundance of each variant was tissue-specific (heart, kidney, pancreas, skeletal muscle, lung, liver, and brain). Additionally, the relative abundance of MK5 splice variants changed in the heart during pressure overload and post-natal development. Furthermore, immunofluorescence revealed MK5.1-5.3 localized to the nucleus and MK5.4-5.5 to the cytoplasm in unstimulated HEK 293 cells. Upon stimulation with anisomycin, which activates p38 MAPK, MK5.1-5.3 translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and small amounts of MK5.4-5.5 relocated to the nucleus. These splice variants may further diversify MK5-ERK3 signaling in the heart, but their exact role awaits further investigation. With the exception of p38δ, all p38 isoforms are expressed in the heart and α is considered to be the prominent isoform in this tissue. qPCR and western blot analysis revealed p38α and p38γ to be the predominant isoforms and p38β and p38δ are expressed at comparable levels in the adult heart. Confocal immunofluorescence studies revealed p38α and p38γ in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. However, in response to TAC, p38γ accumulated in the nucleus whereas the distribution of p38α remained unaffected. The high abundance of p38γ and its nuclear accumulation during chronic pressure overload suggest that this isoform may play a role in gene expression during pathological cardiac remodeling. In conclusion, we have shown for the first time a pro-fibrotic role for MK5-ERK3 signaling during chronic pressure overload. Moreover, comparable expression levels of p38γ with p38α, and differential localization of p38γ during acute or chronic pressure overload, suggest these isoforms play different roles during cardiac remodeling.

1264	Contribution de l'hypoxie à la cicatrisation cutanée anormale chez le cheval : méthodes physiques d'évaluation	Cutaneous wound healing in horse limbs is often perturbed by the development of exuberant granulation tissue while body wounds tend to repair uneventfully. A delay in healing is usually observed in horse limb wounds, which tend to develop exuberant granulation tissue and excessive scarring. The events leading to exuberant granulation tissue formation in horses are not fully elucidated. Tissue hypoxia has been proposed as a major contributing factor as it appears to contribute to the development of similar abnormal skin scarring in human.   The objective of this study was to investigate skin blood flow and tissue oxygen availability in normal / abnormal healing of full-thickness wounds created on the horse limb and body, using infrared thermography and near infrared reflectance spectroscopy. Six healthy, 3- to 4-year-old mares were used for the experiment. Three full-thickness cutaneous wounds were surgically created on the dorso-lateral surface of each metacarpal area (limb wounds) and on the lateral thoracic wall (body wounds). One randomly chosen distal forelimb was then left to heal by second intention without bandage, while the contralateral limb was bandaged postoperatively to induce the formation of exuberant granulation tissue and lead to excessive scarring. Thermal and spectroscopic data were collected from both anatomic sites (limb without bandage, bandaged limb, thoracic wall) at specific times following wounding.   Mean changes in skin blood flow and tissue oxygen availability at specific wound sites over time were compared by use of repeated measures ANOVA with anatomical location and wound management as within-subject factors. A priori contrasts, submitted to Bonferroni sequential correction, were then used to compare pre-selected individual means. The statistical analysis revealed that there were significant differences in skin blood flow and tissue oxygen availability within wounds. Skin blood flow and tissue oxygen availability were significantly increased within body over limb wounds (P<0.05). Skin blood flow was significantly increased within unbandaged limb over bandaged limb wounds (P<0.05). We have recently reported a greater occlusion of microvessels in limb wounds in horses. We report here that skin blood flow and tissue oxygen availability are significantly inferior in limb wounds in horses, especially when exuberant granulation develops. Taken together, these results suggest that equine limb wounds may suffer from altered vascular perfusion and tissue hypoxia, which could favor abnormal skin healing and exuberant granulation tissue development.	perfusion , skin healing , wound , oxygen , horse , spectroscopy , thermography , exuberant granulation tissue	en	5246.0
1265	Effet du bosentan sur les niveaux d'inflammation systémique et rénale chez des patients avec néphropathie diabétique traités par bloqueurs de récepteurs de l'angiotensine II	Apart from metabolic and hemodynamic factors, inflammation has recently been introduced as a potential key pathogenic mechanism involved in the development and progression of diabetic nephropathy (DN). The mechanisms by which renal inflammation occurs in DN are still poorly understood, yet increased renal activity of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and endothelin (ET) system may play a key role. The main objective of this mono-centre, double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study was to demonstrate that concomitant blockade of the RAS and ET system in patients with DN produces greater renal protective effects and exerts greater anti-inflammatory changes than those seen with blockade of the RAS system alone. The specific aim of the study was to evaluate whether administration of bosentan to patients with DN on angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) reduces systemic and renal inflammation and improves glomerular filtration. The work presented herein illustrates the results obtained in one type 2 diabetic patient with clinical DN and treated with ARB following the administration of bosentan for 16 weeks. The study protocol included 6 medical visits at 4 weeks interval, with the first visit (V1) being the screening visit and the second visit (V2) being the baseline and randomization visit. Blood and urine samples were taken at V2, after 8 weeks of treatment (V4), and at the end of the study (V6) for determination of serum and urinary inflammatory markers including ET-1, tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and C-reactive protein (CRP). Lipid profile was done at the beginning and end of the study. Renal function was assessed at V1, V2, V4 and V6 by determination of glomerular filtration rate and urinary albumin excretion (UAE). Routine biochemical analyses were done at each visit. Correlation between serum and urinary inflammatory markers and UAE was determined. Our results demonstrated that bosentan administration to this patient reduced UAE by 32% and 35% at weeks 8 and 16, respectively, without affecting blood pressure and glomerular filtration. The anti-proteinuric effect of bosentan was associated with a reduction in urinary levels of VCAM-1, ICAM-1, IL-6, TNF- and ET-1 and a reduction in serum TNF- levels. Change in UAE was positively correlated with changes in urinary levels of VCAM-1 (r=0.86), ICAM-1 (r=0.88), ET-1 (r=0.94), and TNF- (r=0.96) and with change in serum TNF- levels (r=0.98). Our data suggest that blockade of the ET system in top of RAS inhibition exerts additive renoprotective effects in DN. They support the notion that activation of the ET system, by promoting renal inflammation, may play a role in the pathogenesis of DN. The anti-inflammatory and anti-proteinuric effect of bosentan represents an interesting finding which may leads in the future to an alternate therapeutic and preventive for the treatment of DN.

1266	Towards an ethic of cultural harmonization : translating history textbooks in the province of Québec	Faced with the task of translating history textbooks from French to English for use in Québec’s English-language public school system, Michael Varga outlines a translation approach that circumvents classical translation theories based on binary constructs in favour of a model inspired by narrative theory as proposed by Mona Baker. Acknowledging the legitimacy of multiple parallel narratives as they pertain to different socio-cultural groups within the same society (Québec), he identifies source text sections that expose conflicts related to intercultural harmony.  He discusses how these conflicts may fall short of communicating appropriate cultural realities that conform to the norms and values that govern Québec society. With a focus on the educational context, he proposes translations that defuse these conflicts in a spirit of harmonization and respect for the pluralist cultural realities in evidence in Québec society.

1267	Essai d’amélioration du taux de rétention de la tétracycline dans un polymère à empreinte moléculaire formé de co-polymères fonctionnalisés de l’acide lactique	The veterinarian is helping the dairy farmer to keep his flock healthy. When a cow is sick, he may prescribe antibiotics. But in that case, the cow milk treated with antibiotics is discarded, and not sold for consumption. All milk products are analyzed before being pasteurized and processed to ensure that dairy products do not contain residues of antibiotics. If the analyses show that milk contains traces of antibiotics, it is discarded and the producer must bear the loss. On place, the current screening tests for drug residues are expensive and inapplicable.  To resolve this problem at the feet of the cow, the solution proposed in this project is the production of a detection kit based on molecular imprinted polymers. These are polymers whose molecular conformation is complementary to that of antibiotics. This project is about improving the effectiveness of screening tests for residues of tetracyclines by increasing the number of interaction sites between the antibiotic and polyester. Three polymers are used respectively, aromatic, carboxyl and hydroxyl groups.  A previous study in our laboratory had already shown a tetracycline retention percentage of 50% for a composition of 1 / 3 PLAOH-1 / 3 PLACOOH-1 / 3 PLAOBn. After variation in the polymers ratio, the percentage obtained is, 38.93 % for a composition of   1 / 4 PLAOH-1 / 2 PLACOOH-1 / 4 PLAOPh, 44.81 % for a composition of 1 / 4 PLACOOH- 1 / 2 PLAOH- 1 / 4 PLAOPh, 66.34 % for a composition of 1/4 PLAOH- 1/4 PLACOOH- 1/4 PLAOPh and 78.07 % for a composition of 1/6 PLAOH- 1 / 6 PLACOOH- 2 / 3 PLAPh. Our hypothesis was that the increase of the amount of the phenyl group, increases the number of specific interaction sites with the antibiotic, and so increases the percentage of retention of the antibiotic through the MIP. The results confirmed this hypothesis.	PLA , tetracycline , PLA , molecular imprinted polymer	en	5229.0
1268	Expression of steroidogenic proteins and genes in bovine placenta from conventional and somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) gestations	During pregnancy, steroid hormones have essential roles in regulating key physiological events such as maternal recognition, endometrial receptivity, early embryonic development, and maintenance of pregnancy. However, very little is known about the production of these hormones nor about the principal factors and intracellular pathways implicated in the steroidogenic process in bovine placenta, during early and advanced pregnancy. In addition, placental abnormalities in cattle following an improper steroid production in bovine placenta have not been yet demonstrated. The aims of this thesis were to: 1) determine the occurrence and localization of the principal steroidogenic proteins in bovine placenta from day 50 to day 120 of pregnancy; 2) compare the placental expression of a series of steroidogenic genes and proteins between somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) pregnancies and non-SCNT gestations; 3) investigate the impact of trophic hormone, and second messengers on steroidogenesis in bovine placenta at 140 +10 days of gestation.  Using immunohistochemistry, western blot and qPCR techniques, we evaluated the presence of a wide range of steroidogenic genes (STAR, CYP11A1, HSD3B1, CYP17A1 and SCARB1), that participate in the cholesterol transport and in the production of different types of steroids. In this thesis, we demonstrated the capability of the early bovine placenta to initiate steroidogenesis, and we also determined the principal cells implicated in this process. We found that maternal tissue expresses the principal steroidogenic markers suggesting it has a greater steroidogenic capacity compared to fetal tissue. Moreover, a complementary pattern of steroidogenic protein expression between the caruncle and the cotyledon were found, indicating that placental steroidogenesis requires cell to cell communication between the maternal and fetal cells. Having shown the principal cells involved in the synthesis of steroid hormones in bovine placenta during early pregnancies, we then studied possible alterations in steroidogenesis in cotyledonary tissue in SCNT at 40 days of pregnancy. We identified significant alterations in the expression of STAR, CYP11A1, HSD3B1, CYP17A1 and SULT1E1 transcripts. Therefore, we postulate that reduced expression of steroidogenic genes may cause an insufficient local biosynthesis of steroid hormones, which might contribute to the abnormal placental and fetal development in SCNT gestations at short or long term. Finally, we developed an efficient placentome explants culture model that allowed us to explore the specific mechanisms underlying placental steroidogenesis. We explored the stimulatory effect of trophic hormones and different second messengers on the expression of various steroidogenic proteins and the progesterone levels in placentome explants.  By RIA and qPCR techniques, we found that although LH-like hormones (hCG), had a stimulatory effect on multiple steroidogenic genes, the calcium ionophore was the principal modulator in the synthesis of progesterone. These results suggest that in bovine placenta, the synthesis of progesterone is modulated principally by intracellular calcium influx, and cyclic nucleotides do not seem to be controlling this process.  In conclusion, these studies significantly contribute to a better understanding of the driving mechanisms of placental steroid synthesis in early gestations and also provide new insights into the importance of placental steroids in the regulation of placental and fetal development.

1269	"Synthèse de nouveaux matériaux conducteurs
comportant des unités aromatiques conjuguées
et analyse de leurs propriétés physico-chimiques"	Conjugated materials have received much attention recently as they show promise for industrial applications. These materials are interesting because of the many new possibilities for devices combining unique optical, electrical and mechanical properties. The synthesis is the major difficulty in the fabrication of electronic devices. Usual methods to do so are electropolymerisation, Suzuki or Wittig coupling. Those techniques are full of constraints and are difficult to scale-up. Thiophenes, pyrroles and furans demonstrated good conductibility and low band-gap due to increased conjugation. Our main goal is to synthesize oligomers made principally of thiophene to characterize their spectroscopic, electrochemical and conduction properties. Synthesis is the most important step in the making of conjugated material. A synthetically simple and modular route to novel conjugated material consisting of heterocyclic units is presented. These complementary modules are linked by condensing aldehydes and amines leading to robust azomethine bonds. The resulting photophysical and electrochemical properties of these conjugated materials will be presented.   Through the use of different electron donor and acceptor groups, degree of conjugation or by using different heterocycles, the spectroscopic, electrochemical and band-gap properties can be tailored leading to materials with tunable properties. Those new molecules will be analysed to detect properties suitable for OLED fabrication. This presentation will also address the electrochemical reversible oxidation and polymerization of these compounds leading to the making of simple devices.

1270	Étude des mécanismes moléculaires menant à la migration cellulaire associée à Rac1 et ARF6	The ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6) and Rac1 are small GTP-binding proteins that regulate several signaling events ranging from vesicle trafficking, to modification of membrane lipids and reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. However, the molecular mechanisms by which ARF6 and Rac1 act in concert to control these different cellular processes remain unclear. Here, we show that in HEK 293 cells, ARF6 and Rac1 can be found in complex upon stimulation of the angiotensin receptor (ATR). In vitro experiments indicate that these two small G proteins can directly interact together, and that ARF6 preferentially interacts with the GDP-bound form of Rac1. Depletion of ARF6 by RNA interference leads to a marked PIX-dependent Rac1 activation in cells, independently of receptor stimulation, leading to uncontrolled cell migration. Arrestins, which are known for their role in G protein-coupled receptor desensitization, act as scaffold proteins toward Rac1 and ARF6, by directly interacting with the GTPases and by increasing their agonist-promoted association. Besides, arrestins allow p38 MAP Kinase activation, by releasing it, which regulates ARF6 activity and early association occurring between arrestins and ARF6. Taken together, this study shows that arrestins control ARF6 activity, by managing p38. ARF6 is an inhibitor of basal Rac1 activation to further allow the protein to be recruited and activated following angiotensin treatment. This study allowed us to precise how cell migration induction is regulated following G protein-coupled receptor activation. As a result, we identified some of the key players implicated in this process, providing new targets in the treatment of patho-physiological inbalance in cell migration.

1271	"Dégradation des membres de la famille du LDLR
par la convertase PCSK9 : troisième locus de l'hypercholestérolémie familiale"	Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the primary cause of death and morbidity worldwide, claiming about 900 000 lives yearly in North America alone. A high level of circulating LDL-cholesterol is a major risk factor positively correlated with premature development of complex CVD mainly due to a rapid buildup of lipid deposition in the arteries. In collaboration with Dre Boileau, we recently discovered that the convertase PCSK9 is the third locus of familial hypercholesterolemia. A study published in the New Eng J Med revealed that the absence of PCSK9 reduces the risk of CVD by ~88%, resulting from a strong reduction of cholesterol in the bloodstream (LDL-C). It has been shown that PCSK9 directly binds the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and by an unknown mechanism, reroutes it towards degradation in late endosomes/lysosomes, resulting in the accumulation of LDL-C particles in plasma.  In this thesis, we addressed three different aspects of PCSK9 biology: [1] What are the targets of PCSK9? [2] Which cellular trafficking components are involved in PCSK9-induced LDLR degradation? [3] How can we inhibit the function of PCSK9?  [1] We first demonstrated that PCSK9 induces the degradation of the LDLR and two of its closest family members. These include the very-low-density-lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) and apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (ApoER2) implicated in neuronal development and lipid metabolism. In addition, we demonstrated that these receptors enhance the cellular association of PCSK9 independently of the presence of the LDLR. This study represents the first evidence that PCSK9 could target other proteins for degradation, reinforcing its role as a key regulator of some members of the LDLR family.  [2] Since PCSK9 is a secreted protein, we decided to investigate the contributions of both the intra- and extracellular trafficking pathways in LDLR degradation. Using conditioned media derived from mice primary hepatocytes, we showed that endogenously secreted PCSK9 was not able to influence LDLR levels of PCSK9-deficient primary hepatocytes (Pcsk9-/-). By flow cytometry (FACS), we observed that overexpression of the gain-of-function PCSK9-D374Y, but not wild type PCSK9, decreases cell surface LDLR on adjacent cells suggesting that its spectrum of action is local. We also noticed that blockade of endocytosis in HepG2 cells (commonly used to study endogenous LDLR degradation by PCSK9) does not affect total LDLR protein levels. In contrast, disruption of the intracellular trafficking between the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and endosomes (siRNAs against clathrin light chains; CLCs) prevented LDLR degradation in a PCSK9-specific manner.   [3] By Far Western blotting, we identified that Annexin A2 (AnxA2) specifically interacts with the C-terminal domain of PCSK9, which is crucial for its function in LDLR degradation. Moreover, we determined that the R1 domain (amino acids 34 to 108) is responsible for the PCSK9AnxA2 interaction, which confers a new function for this protein. Finally, we showed that addition of AnxA2 prevents PCSK9-induced LDLR degradation.   In summary, this work allowed us to identify that PCSK9 induces the degradation of the LDLR and its closest family members, ApoER2 and VLDLR. We also highlighted that the integrity of the intracellular trafficking pathway is crucial for endogenous PCSK9-induced LDLR degradation. Furthermore, we discovered that AnxA2 is a unique, natural inhibitor capable of interfering with the action of PCSK9 in LDLR degradation. It is undeniable that PCSK9 is a genetically validated target to reduce circulating LDL-cholesterol and prevent CVD. This thesis brings forth important contributions in our understanding of the cellular pathways involved and opens the door for novel therapeutic approaches.

1272	Actin cytoskeleton regulates pollen tube growth and tropism	Fertilization in plants depends on the delivery of the sperm cells in the pollen grain through the pollen tube to the ovule. The pollen tube is a highly anisotropic, fast growing cellular protuberance. Because the pollen tube is non autotrophic, it requires a steady supply of carbohydrates and minerals supplied by the pistil to sustain its growth. These elements serve for the synthesis of cell wall material, delivered to the site of cell wall assembly in secretory vesicles that are transported along the actin cytoskeleton and deposited at the growing apex of the tube. The tube has to resist external deformation forces in order to maintain its cylindrical shape and to respond to various directional signals in order to reach its target. My objectives were to identify the role of the cytoskeleton in the anisotropic growth of the pollen tube and to determine how the tube responds to directional cues. The cytoskeleton in the pollen tube consists of microfilaments and microtubules, both forming long filamentous elements. For in vitro growing pollen tubes, carbohydrates and growth minerals have to be added to the growth medium in specific amounts order to sustain pollen tube growth. I optimized the growth conditions of Arabidopsis thaliana and Camellia japonica pollen tubes which, in addition to pollen from Lilium longiflorum, were used as model species for my experiments. I developed a microwave based, fast and efficient fixation and labelling protocol for pollen tubes. I used pharmacological, mechanical, molecular and microscopical tools to study the role of the cytoskeleton in pollen tube growth and tropism. I found that the actin cytoskeleton, and more specifically the subapical actin fringe, plays an important role in the regulation of pollen tube growth and architecture through the controlled delivery of secretory vesicles to the growing apex. I constructed a galvanotropic chamber that can be mounted on an inverted microscope to induce controlled tropic triggers. I found that the actin cytoskeleton is also involved in the ability of the pollen tube to change its direction. This tropic behaviour was shown to be dependent on the concentration of calcium ions in the growth medium and calcium influx through calcium channels. The cytosolic calcium gradient in the pollen tube regulates the activity of various actin binding proteins that are responsible for remodelling the actin cytoskeleton. Among these proteins are two Arabidopsis gametophyte-specific actin depolymerizing factors (ADFs) that I tagged with two intrinsically fluorescent proteins. I found that ADF7 and ADF10 are differentially expressed during microsporogenesis and pollen tube germination and growth and that they likely divide important functions between them.

1273	Design thinking and the precautionary principle : development of a theoretical model complementing preventive judgment for design for sustainability enriched through a study of architectural competitions adopting LEED	This thesis is a contribution to the general theory of design thinking.  In the prevalent demand for a sustainable development, the main objective of this research is the construction of a theoretical model of design thinking that contextualizes standard sustainability evaluation tools. The basis of these normative tools is analyzed in four dimensions: ontological, methodological, epistemological and teleological. Indications of potential counter-productive effects of these norms for design thinking confirm the need for a theory of qualitative judgment. Our central hypothesis revolves around the benefits of the underlying conceptual framework of the ‘precautionary principle’ for design thinking, the first formulations of which goes back to the early seventies in Germany, and was in fact created as a way to address the failures of traditional scientific evaluation tools or methods. The thesis comprises five parts. Beginning with a historical perspective, a review of classical models of design thinking, specifically focuses on the evolving approaches for addressing sustainable development. Theories of “green design” coming from the early sixties, theories of ecological design of the seventies and eighties are finally converging on the developing theories of “sustainable design” formulated in the early nineties.   The underlying theories of the precautionary principle are then reviewed and explored for the specific context of design within the perspective of sustainability.  Current methods of standard risk assessment methods are compared to a precautionary approach, revealing their conceptual limits for design thinking.  A preliminary theoretical model for design thinking is then constructed adopting the theories underlying the precautionary principle. This model represents a global vision for judging the design project in a context of sustainability, rather than on traditional approaches for risk assessment, which are purposive and instrumental.   The precautionary principle is further explored for the specific context of architectural design.  This exploration begins with a historical perspective of the classical notion of ‘prudence’ for guiding architectural judgment. In light of the contemporary issues related to sustainability, we then examine the challenges of judging architectural projects given the increasing international prominence of such standard evaluation methods (i.e. Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, LEED). The thesis proposes a reinterpretation of design thinking as proposed by Donald A. Schön is introduced such that the use of tools, like LEED can be contextualized. This exercise reveals an epistemological barrier, which shall be taken into consideration when reformulating the theoretical model.  In accordance with a constructivist epistemology, a new theoretical model is therefore confronted to the study and illustration of three contemporary Canadian architectural competitions adopting the standard evaluation method LEED. A preliminary set of ‘tensions’ identified in the judgment process and design thinking is further categorized into their conceptual counterparts. These are: (1) analogical/logical conceptualization; (2) epistemological/methodological uncertainty; (3) interpretive/analytic comparability; and (4) universal/contextual relevance of the proposal. These conceptual tensions are considered as vectors that come into correlation with the theoretical model, enriching it, yet without validating it, in the positivist sense of the word. These confrontations with the real, help better define the epistemological barrier identified above.  This thesis therefore highlights the often underestimated impact of environmental standards on the judgment process and design thinking, with particular, albeit non restrictive, reference to contemporary Canadian architectural competitions for public buildings. It concludes by stressing the need for a new form of “reflective prudence” in design thinking along with a more critical use of current evaluation tools for sustainability founded on a global integration rather than on the opposition of environmental approaches.	design thinking , sustainability , precautionary principle , prevention , judgment , reflection-in-action , technical rationality , complexity , systemic , architectural competitions , LEED	en	5174.0
1274	Possibilités d’une théologie évangélique postmoderne et pratiques des Églises évangéliques en contexte québécois	While a growing number of Anglo-Saxons evangelicals theologians define themselves as postmodernists, this Master thesis`s first aim is to understand what this means concretely. We will achieve this through the study one of the main reference books on the matter. We put forward that these postmodern theologians are developing a theology in opposition to the fondationalist theology. They also tend to oppose modernity’s absolute assumptions with postmodernism’s relativism. Yet, they argue in favor of a moderate relativism. This theological turn has concrete implication in regards to ecclesial practice, especially within emergent churches. However, these new trends of thoughts and practices are highly criticized by other evangelical theologians, bent on preserving the absolutes inherited from Cartesians, as well as consolidated ecclesial tradition. This Master’s thesis second aim is thus to study and to resume criticism emanating from these other theologians. Since this research is developed within Quebec’s context, we have also delved into Quebec’s evangelical theologians take on postmodernism. This constitutes the third element of this Master’s thesis. From this literature we chose to resume one article that stemmed from a conference presented at a 2007 Montreal convention on emergent churches. We also conducted interviews to understand the ecclesial practices related to emergent churches in the Quebec context. The first interview has been conducted with a Quebec evangelical theologian who has adopted postmodernism. The second interview has been conducted with a small group of members of an emergent church. To conclude, we make a final analysis of the literature brought to bear in this Master’s thesis, and we make our own contribution in favor of a postmodern evangelical theology and postmodern ecclesial practices in Quebec’s context.

1275	L'évolution du phagosome	Phagocytosis is a cellular process by which large particulate material are internalized in a newly formed vesicule, the phagosome.  Once formed, the phagosome acquires its functional properties through a complex maturation process called phagolysosome biogenesis.  This pathway involves a series of rapid interactions with organelles of the endocytic apparatus, enabling the gradual transformation of newly formed phagosomes into phagolysosomes in which proteolytic degradation occurs.  The amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum uses phagocytosis as a predation mechanism for feeding, whereas multicellular organisms utilize this process as an immune mechanism where specialized cells named phagocytes internalize, kill and degrade phatogens found through the host, forming the basis of innate immunity.  In jawed verterbrates however, the phagosome links innate and adaptive immunity by processing and presenting antigenic peptides.  Despite its crucial role in immunity, little is known about the composition and the functional organization of the phagosome.  It is therefore essential to characterize in details the functional properties that are recruited to the phagosome.   High-throughput proteomics analysis of isolated phagosomes has been tremendously helpful for the molecular comprehension of this organelle.  Studies of our lab notably have revealed the first proteomics identification of mouse phagosomes without determining the roles of these proteins through the complex process of phagocytosis (Brunet et al, 2003; Garin et al, 2001).  In the first study of this thesis (Stuart et al, 2007), we characterized the functions of the entire drosophila phagosome proteome by combining high-throughput proteomics, interactive networks and RNAi.  By applying this strategy, we’ve identified 617 phagosomal proteins by mass spectrometry from which we’ve expanded this list by building the phagosome interactome.  The contribution of each protein to bacterial internalization was tested and validated by RNAi and led to the identification of a new regulator of phagocytosis, the exocyst complex.  In generating this 'systems-based model', we show the power of applying this approach to the study of complex cellular processes and organelles and expect that this detailed model of the phagosome will provide a new framework for studying host-pathogen interactions and innate immunity.      In the second study of this thesis (Boulais et al, 2010), we characterized some of the key steps that contributed to the remodeling of phagosomes functional properties during evolution. To do so, we isolated this organelle from three distant organisms: the amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, and mouse (Mus musculus) that use phagocytosis for different purposes.  By performing and comparing proteomics and phosphoproteomics analyses of isolated phagosomes from the three species, we identified an ancient core of phagosomal proteins around which the immune function of this organelle have likely organized.  Our data indicate that a larger proportion of the phagosome proteome, has been acquired through gene duplication at periods coinciding with the emergence of innate and adaptive immunity.  Our study also characterizes in detail the acquisition of novel proteins and the significant remodeling of the phagosome phosphoproteome that contributed to modify the core constituents of this organelle in evolution. Our work thus provides the first thorough analysis of the changes that enabled the transformation of the phagosome from a phagotrophic compartment into an organelle fully competent for antigen presentation.

1276	Sélection de mutations affectant la formation de biofilm chez Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae	A. pleuropneumoniae (App) is the causative agent of porcine pleuropneumonia, a contagious pulmonary infection in swine. Among the numerous virulence mechanisms found in bacteria, the formation of biofilms often plays an important role in pathogenesis. It has been recently demonstrated that App has the ability to form biofilms in vitro. In our laboratory, the formation of biofilms by App has been evaluated in microplates under different growth conditions. We showed that the reference strain of serotype 1 is capable of forming biofilms when cultured in a specific growth medium. The objective of this work is to identifiy genes implicated in the biosynthesis and regulation of biofilm formation in App. The objective of this study was to generate a mutant library of App using the mini-Tn10 transposon. A total of 1200 mutants has been screened with the help of in vitro models for biofilm formation which use microtiter plates or test tubes; 24 mutants exhibited modified biofilm formation when compared to the parental strain 4074NalR. The selection and identification of these mutants allowed the identification of the insertion site of the transposon. Analysis revealed novel genes implicated in biosynthesis and regulation of the biofilm formation in App. Our screen allowed the identification of genes already associated in biofilm formation of App (hns) or other pathogens (potD2, ptsI, tig and rpmF). Genes (APL_0049, APL_0637 and APL_1573) that have not yet been associated with biofilm formation were also identified. Further characterization of the genes mentioned above would permit a greater understanding of the mechanisms implicated in biofilm formation of App.	biofilm , screen , mutagenesis , genes	en	5161.0
1277	Contrôle de l'expression de la protéine PHEX et rôle de PHEX et FGF23 dans la minéralisation par les cellules MC3T3	PHEX is an important protein in the process of osseous mineralisation. Mutations or deletions of a part of the PHEX gene cause X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH). This disease is characterized by hypophosphatemia, accompanied by defects of bone mineralisation, rickets and osteomalacia. With the hypophosphatemia, the circulating levels of vitamin D should be increased, which is not the case where an abnormal regulation of the production of vitamin D takes place. However, in spite of the fact that this protein is a peptidase, no physiological substrate has been identified. PHEX is a membrane type II integral protein member of the M13 family of zinc metalloendopeptidasee. These proteins have a short N-terminal cytosolic domain, a transmembrane domain of approximately 20 amino acids and a large extracellular C-terminal portion where the active site of the enzyme is located. PHEX is expressed predominantly in bones and teeth in osteoblasts and odontoblasts, respectively. PHEX is expressed at initiation of mineralization. Patients suffering from XLH and the Hyp mouse, which has been used widely as an animal model of the human disease, show large quantities of the FGF23 protein. Moreover, FGF23 is implicated in another disease connected to phosphate metabolism, the autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets (ADHR) where activating mutations in FGF23 cause roughly the same symptoms as XLH. FGF23 is produced mainly by osteoblasts and osteocytes. FGF23 causes hypophosphatemia by decreasing the expression of the type II sodium phosphate cotransportor, partly responsible for renal phosphate reabsorption. The hypothesis suggested in the literature would be that PHEX would activate or inactivate important peptides for osseous mineralisation. More specifically, the activation or the inactivation of these peptides would have a role in the control of FGF23 expression. According to the assumption mentioned previously, the regulation of PHEX could thus have an effect on mineralization. An increasing quantity of data on the regulation of PHEX is now available. For example, vitamin D decreases the expression of PHEX while glucocorticoids and growth hormone increase its expression. In a first study, we examined the possibility that a peptide connected to osseous mineralization could control the expression of PHEX. We determined that PTHrP1-34 can control in a negative way the expression of PHEX in UMR-106 cells, a cell line of osteoblastic origin. This regulation involves the cAMP/protein kinase A pathway. Moreover, this decrease in PHEX expression is also observed at day 7 in primary cultures of mineralizing rat osteoblasts. Next, we looked more closely at PHEX cellular localization. We used a mutant of PHEX, mutant E4Q identified in an XLH patient, where the mutated amino acid is found in the cytosolic domain of PHEX. This change does not interfere with the catalytic site of the enzyme since this PHEX mutant can still cleave a synthetic substrate as well as wildtype protein. This mutation disrupts a di-acidic motif present in the cytosolic domain of PHEX. We showed that this di-acidic motif is reponsible for the interaction of PHEX with COPII, a protein complex involved in the formation of secretion vesicles. Moreover, it would seem that this di-acidic motif is important, probably by its interaction with COPII, to the incorporation of PHEX in matrix vesicles, which are important in the mineralization process. Finally, competition assays showed that mineralization could be disturbed when the wildtype PHEX cytosolic tail is overexpressed, as opposed with the mutated cytosolic tail. This suggests that the interaction with COPII and the subsequent incorporation of PHEX in matrix vesicles or other proteins that possesses this motif could be important for mineralization. Finally, the last study examined the role of FGF23 on mineralization. We showed, by the overexpression of FGF23 in the mouse MC3T3 osteoblast cell line, that FGF23 can cause senescence of these cells. On the other hand, proliferation is not affected. Moreover, differentiation seems to occur at a faster rate, as indicated by earlier mineralization. Overexpression of FGF23 would accelerate differentiation and induce senescence. This is in agreement with the literature where KLOTHO, a FGF23 cofactor that increase the affinity of FGF23 for its receptor, when inactivated, shows a similar phenotype that includes senescence and aging.

1278	Questions à mouvement multiple en bulgare	This study examines multiple Wh-interrogatives in Bulgarian, with particular reference to the mechanisms responsible for the order of fronted Wh- phrases. Apart from describing an interesting and quite complex linguistic phenomenon, this study offers a critical review of the main hypotheses that have been adduced to account for the properties of multiple interrogatives. First, we discuss the different approaches that attribute the order of fronted Wh-phrases entirely to syntactic rules. Next, we examine those analyses which seek to explain the phenomenon by appealing to specific features pertaining to Wh-phrases, namely [animate] or [discourse-linked]. Other topics discussed in the present study include the role of topicalization and focalization in multiple interrogative formation, the possibility that the functional projections of the Bulgarian left periphery may host various Wh-phrases, as well as the role and distribution of resumptive pronouns.

1279	Exploración y análisis de las políticas educativas relativas a la educación rural en Centroamérica : casos de Costa Rica y Nicaragua	Various international organizations have studied rural schools in developing countries and the majority of the research shows that these schools do not offer an education adapted to the community in which they are located. This is primarily due to the fact that the schools are integrating administrative and teaching structures of urban schools without taking into consideration the characteristics of child populations in rural zones. In response to the identified difficulties, these organizations proposed various solutions or recommended policies adapted to this particular context.  The goal of this research is to study how these recommendations translate into educational policies and their impact on daily life of rural schools in two Central American countries, Costa Rica and Nicaragua. For this purpose, we’ve created an analysis framework with six categories: socio-economic status, curriculum and pedagogy, school and community relationships, teachers, technology, and lastly, management and governance. With this intention, we’ve analyzed the recommendations made by various international organizations and other organizations from developed countries related to rural education. We’ve compared this information to the political decisions on educational development in rural communities made in the last twenty in these two countries. Lastly, we’ve completed the research with field observations, studying the day-to-day work in rural schools. Working from the hypothesis that there exists sufficient valid information and recommendations to issue appropriate policies that improve conditions in rural schools, this work presents a multi-level analysis (global recommendations, national policies and school practices) by determining convergences and divergences in each of these levels.  The main results of the research show that there is a convergence between school practices and education policies created by the countries, with some minor exceptions. When it comes to convergence between global recommendations and the countries’ policies, we cannot speak of convergence in general. This research proposes the use of national policy profiles for each country, depending on how they deal with the challenges of rural education: assigning resources to extend standard educational services to all children, or generating targeted policies, creating specific programs that highlight the difference of the rural world.

1280	Rôle des récepteurs glutamatergiques dans l'activité épileptiforme des interneurones inhibiteurs de l'hippocampe	Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients, as well as kainic acid (KA)-treated rodents, display similar pathophysiological patterns of behavioural seizures, hippocampal sclerosis and loss of certain neuronal types in the hippocampus. Among the cell types selectively vulnerable in the experimental KA model of TLE are certain inhibitory interneurons of the CA1 hippocampal region. Specifically, interneurons located in the oriens and alveus layers (O/A-IN) are lost following KA injections, whereas interneurons found in the radiatum/lacunosum-moleculare layers (R/LM-IN) are resistant. Although it has been shown that the group I metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR1/5) inhibitors can block this cell loss seen in the KA model, the precise cause of the selective O/A-IN vulnerability remains to be clarified. In this thesis, we have performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings with simultaneous calcium imaging in an effort to elucidate the cause of the selective vulnerability of O/A-INs. We first determined the effects of acute KA applications on membrane properties and intracellular calcium rises in hippocampal slices to see if they might be different between O/A-INs and R/LM-INs. Our results reveal similar -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxasole propionic acid (AMPA) receptor dependent membrane depolarizations, input resistance variations and calcium reponses in these cells following KA applications, suggesting that acute KA actions may not cause the selective vulnerability of O/A-INs. Furthermore, we evaluated the contribution of mGluR1/5 to epileptiform discharges evoked in a disinhibited slice model, comparing responses between O/A-INs and R/LM-INs. Our data show an important role of synaptically activated mGluR1/5 during epileptiform discharges specifically in O/A-INs. In addition we show that the synaptic currents underlying these discharges involve ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors.  In the presence of antagonists of ionotropic glutamate receptors, synaptic currents are biphasic and composed of fast and slow components. mGluR1 and mGluR5 are involved differently in these components with mGluR5 implicated in fast and slow components and mGluR1 in the slow component only. Our findings therefore suggest that mGluR1 and 5 contribute differently to epileptiform discharges, and do so specifically in O/A-INs, suggesting that their activation may contribute to the selective vulnerability of these interneurons in the KA model of TLE.

1281	Causes multiples de décès chez les personnes âgées au Québec, 2000-2004	To this day, mortality analysis has primarily focused on the underlying cause of death which represents the disease or injury which initiated the sequence of morbid events leading to the death. But since death is due to a complex process, especially at advanced ages, analysis based solely on this concept has its limitations and some causes are more likely to be identified as the underlying cause than others. Selecting only one cause per death may influence the relative importance of the various causes of death. Multiple causes of death statistics provide a more complete view of mortality patterns.   The analysis of multiple causes of death among the elderly in Quebec for 2000-2004 identifies certain conditions that contributed to death, but have not been selected as the cause that initiated the disease process. This is particularly the case of hypertension, atherosclerosis, sepsis, influenza and pneumonia, diabetes mellitus and nephritis, nephrotic syndrome and nephrosis.   This research therefore demonstrates the importance of taking into account multiple causes in order to provide a more accurate portrait of Quebec's mortality at older ages that allows analysis of the underlying cause alone.

1282	Nature et fonction du consentement au sein de l’éthique de la sexualité	What are the conditions under which we can say that sexual acts are morally permissible? More specifically, what role should consent play in determining the moral permissibility of sexual acts? I will first expose the nature of consent and outline its performative character as well as its essential components, whose absence would invalidate consent. On this basis, I will then establish three possible structures: the first structure takes consent to be a sufficient and necessary condition of the moral permissibility of sexual acts; the second structure considers that consent is necessary but not sufficient to moral permissibility; and, according to the third structure, consent is neither sufficient nor necessary to moral permissibility. I will then try to see what other conditions are required to complement or replace the condition of consent. More specifically, I will discuss a theory that Raymond Belliotti proposed in his 1993 book Good Sex, a theory that seems to comply with the second structure. To conclude, I will argue that most conditions that complement or replace the condition of consent in the sexual realm could be thought of either as redundant because they are already included in the initial definition of consent, or as a restriction of the individual freedom inherent to liberal ethics.

1283	Analyse des tendances et configurations de la criminalité au Québec à l’aide d’un indice de gravité de la criminalité	"The traditional measure of the criminality (rate for 100 000 inhabitants) raises problem in the analysis of the variations of the criminality in time or space. The problem is due to the fact that the rate of criminality is essentially determined by less serious and very frequent crimes. The present study allowed testing the utility of a new tool developed by Statistics Canada which gets an index of ""severity of criminality"" in which every crime is weighted by its score of severity (based on the sentencielles decisions average in Canada from 2002 till 2007 for every kind of crime. Applied to the official statistics of Quebec from 1977 till 2008, our analyses show that the indication of gravity turns out to be a useful measure to draw up a more realistic portrait of the trends of violent crimes from one year to the next. More precisely, the crime seriousness index shows that the rate of violent crimes remained stable from 1977 till 1992, on contradiction to what is shown by traditional rate which rather demonstrates a huge rise during this period. Crime seriousness index can also be used towards violent crimes, in order to compare more adequately territories, to establish those who show more serious crimes. However, among global criminality and crimes without violence, the indication of gravity is of no utility and presents the same reading of the criminality as traditional measures. It explains that it is always the same crimes (thefts, mischief and breaking and entering) that contribute mainly to each of both measures of the criminality."	crime analysis , trends of criminality , crime seriousness , weighted crime severity index	en	5048.0
1284	Étude du travail collaboratif dans les blogs au sein d’un cours à l’Université de Montréal	New operations of distance learning represent new education’s modalities in higher education. These operations imply use of adapted learning environment, which promote collaborative work situations. Collaboration within these tools result from interaction between students and also from modalities work and support put in place by teachers in order to make sure that these interactions are clear for students. Thus, the question that leads this study case is as follows. What characterizes the collaborative work of students in blogs under ETA 6538 course? Specifically, we want to understand how students collaborate within blogs and what indicators are conducive to such collaboration. Following our study, we propose a list of recommendations to promote the establishment and conduct of collaborative work in blogs, as well as indicators that can be used for evaluation of the collaboration. The concepts used in this thesis are related to the process of acquiring knowledge from the collaboration from the interactions among ICT, online learning systems, especially blogs. We used a type of both quantitative and qualitative analyses. Blogs of eight students were tested. The results of these studies show that students have collaborated in blogs and together they have emerged from new knowledge and skill.

1285	Influence du financement sur la performance des systèmes de soins	The aim of this thesis is to investigate the influence of health care financing on the performance of health care systems when organizational characteristics of health care system contexts are taken into consideration. It focuses on the following three objectives: 1) to characterize health care financing across the various models emerging in high-income countries; 2) to assess the performance of these health care systems by identifying the different profiles seen in these countries; and 3) to examine the relationship between health care financing and system performance, taking into account the moderating influence of the organizational context of health care. Inspired by the revenue flow process in health care systems, the approach adopted consisted in first classifying the countries studied – using configurational analysis operationalized through multiple components analysis (MCA) and ascending hierarchical classification (AHC) – into typical models, each representing a particular configuration of health care financing processes (article 1). Analysis of data collected on 27 high-income OECD countries from the Health Care in Transition reports produced by the WHO Regional Office for Europe, the 2007 Éco-Santé OCDE database and the 2008 WHO statistics revealed five financing models. These models differ among themselves in terms of the functions of collecting money (collection), pooling the collected funds (pooling), distributing the collected and pooled funds (allocation) and paying the professionals and health care establishments (payment). The models thus developed, which extend beyond the simple process of collecting money, provide a more complete picture of the health care financing process. As such, they enable a better understanding of the internal coherence that exists among the four health care financing functions that will impact any change in a country’s health care financing system. Next, based on a multidimensional conception of health care system performance, we classified the same 27 countries according to three parameters: (1) their levels of resources mobilized, health care services provided and health outcomes achieved (absolute performance); (2) the efforts they invested to achieve higher levels of health outcomes in proportion to resources mobilized and health care services provided, in terms of efficiency, efficacy and productivity (relative performance); and (3) the overall performance profiles that emerged when absolute performance and relative performance were combined (article 2). The analyses we carried out on the data collected for these 27 countries produced four profiles that were differentiated in their multidimensional and overall performance. The results thus obtained allow us to compare overall health care system performance among high-income countries. Finally, to answer the question of what financing modalities would generate the best performance, and in what types of health care organizational contexts, we carried out an in-depth analysis of the relations between health care financing and health care system performance (as defined above), taking into account the organizational characteristics of the health care contexts (article 3). The analysis revealed almost no direct relations between health care financing and health care performance. However, when we looked at interactions between financing and health care organizational contexts to capture the level of system performance, some relevant relations emerged. Thus, in terms of performance, some health care financing modalities would appear to be more appealing than others, depending on the organizational characteristics of the health care context. These results can help health care system stakeholders to understand that there is only an indirect relationship between financing and system performance, due to the interaction between health care financing and the organizational characteristics of health care contexts. One original aspect of this thesis lies in the fact that very few studies have attempted to operationalize the concepts of health care system financing and performance using multidimensional approaches before analyzing any relationships that might exist between them. Furthermore, despite the relevance of taking into account the organizational characteristics of health care contexts in health system reforms, this thesis is the one of the first to analyze the impact of the interaction between health care financing and organizational contexts on health care system performance.	performance , interaction , Health care systems , financing , performance , organizational context , models , profiles , interaction , configurational approach	en	5038.0
1286	Reproduction et échanges génétiques horizontaux chez les champignons mycorhiziens à arbuscules	Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi (AMF) have a particular and complex genetic structure. Yet, many aspects of their genetics are still misunderstood and poorly documented. These organisms reproduce by asexual multinucleate spores. In this study, I investigated the mechanisms of genetic inheritance of nuclei through asexual reproduction in AMF. First, I determined the number of nuclei in mature and juveniles spores; I used statistical analysis to determine the relationship between the number of nuclei and the spore diameter. Four species from the genus Glomus were observed with a confocal microscope. The results showed that the number of nuclei has a significant positive relationship with spore diameter and more importantly, surprising heterogeneity in the number of nuclei among sister spores was found. To determine the number of nuclei in extraradical phases, three different structures from the mycelia were carefully examined with a confocal microscope. All the structures possessed more than one nucleus and showed that AMF probably lack a single-nucleus stage during their extraradical phases. To study the nuclei’s heritance, two different approaches were used: (i) Glomus irregulare was grown on medium complemented with aphidicolin to inhibit the mitosis. Observations with a confocal microscope permit to count the nuclei that come from the hyphae and not from the mitosis. The results showed that massive nuclear migration and mitosis are the mechanisms by which AMF spores are formed. (ii) The second approach confirm these results because with time-laps live cellular imaging of young spores of Glomus diaphanum it was possible to see many  nuclei to get in the spores. In a second part of this thesis, I studied horizontal gene exchanges among AMF isolates through anastomoses. Thus, four isolates of the species G. irregulare were used in in vitro crossing experiments, in total six combinations using two isolates per crossing experiment. These crossing co-cultures were maintained over two years by subculturing. Spores of two different isolates were confronted in vitro prior to observation of anastomoses. 13% of spores formed anastomoses suggesting the occurrence of genetic exchange between two isolates. A mitochondrial molecular marker referred as Indel 5, was used to genotype individual spores of crossing progenies. A 39 bp deletion occurs in the marker among different isolates and is clearly discriminated by PCR. PCR patterns showed that some spores seem to have both parental markers demonstrating that genetic exchange could occur between the two isolates used in crossing experiment. Even though hyphal fusions occur between germinating spores, subsequent research needs to be done to confirm genetic exchange among different isolates from different geographic areas. The finding that AMF lack a single nuclear stage in their extraradical phases and that mitosis and nuclear migration are the mechanisms by which AMF spores are formed reduce genetic drift that acts on these organisms during asexual reproduction. Anastomoses are likely a mechanism that maintains the genetic diversity in AMF. These genetic characteristics of AMF were very important during their evolution to maintain a high genetic variability that allows their adaptation to many different ecosystems.

1287	L’amélioration de la performance et de la structure cardiaque par la moxonidine chez les SHR est accompagnée d’une diminution des cytokines, de la MAPK p38 et de l’Akt	Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is an adaptive and compensatory process that develops in hypertension to oppose the chronic elevation of blood pressure. LVH is characterized by hypertrophy of cardiomyocytes following the increase in DNA synthesis, proliferation of fibroblasts, increased collagen deposition and alteration of the extracellular matrix (ECM). These changes generate relaxation and diastolic dysfunction which reduced cardiac performance. The overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system plays an essential role in the development of hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy pathogenesis due to the excessive release of catecholamines and norepinephrine spillover and their effects on the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and hypertrophic signaling pathways. Antihypertensive treatment with moxonidine, a centrally acting sympatholytic imidazoline compound, results in prevention of left ventricular hypertrophy, resulting from a sustained reduction of DNA synthesis and transient stimulation of DNA fragmentation that occur early after treatment. Due to the interaction between LVH, inflammatory cytokines, the SNS and their effects on hypertrophic signaling proteins, the objective of this study is to detect in an animal model of hypertension and LVH, the different signaling pathways associated with regression of LVH and cardiac performance. Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR, 12 weeks old) received moxonidine at 0, 100 and 400 µg/kg/h, for 1 and 4 weeks, via subcutaneously implanted osmotic minipumps. After 4 weeks of treatment, cardiac performance was measured by echo-Doppler. Then the rats were euthanized, blood was collected for measurement of plasma cytokines and hearts for histologic determination of collagen deposition and for measurement of left ventricular expression of downstream signaling proteins. Treatment for 4 weeks had no effect on systolic parameters but improved diastolic parameters and global cardiac performance. Compared to vehicle, moxonidine (400 µg/kg/h) transiently increased plasma IL-1β after 1 week and reduced left ventricular mass. Similarly, there was a decrease in collagen deposition and plasma concentrations of IL-6 and TNF-α, and decreased phosphorylation of p38 and Akt in the left ventricle after 1 and 4 weeks treatment, in association with reduced blood pressure and heart rate. Interestingly, the anti-hypertrophic, anti-fibrotic, and anti-inflammatory effects of moxonidine were observed with a sub-hypotensive dose (100µg/kg/h). These results suggest the beneficial cardiovascular effects of moxonidine associated with improved cardiac performance, regulation of inflammation by decreasing pro-inflammatory plasma levels, inhibition of p38 MAPK and Akt, and allow us to suggest that besides inhibiting the SNS, moxonidine may act on peripheral sites.

1288	Intégration de la visualisation à multiples vues pour le développement du logiciel	Nowadays, software development has to deal more and more with huge complex programs, constructed and maintained by large teams working in different locations. During their daily tasks, each developer may have to answer varied questions using information coming from different sources. In order to improve global performance during software development, we propose to integrate into a popular integrated development environment (Eclipse) our new visualization tool (VERSO), which computes, organizes, displays and allows navigation through information in a coherent, effective, and intuitive way in order to benefit from the human visual system when exploring complex data. We propose to structure information along three axes: (1) context (quality, version control, etc.) determines the type of information; (2) granularity level (code line, method, class, and package) determines the appropriate level of detail; and (3) evolution extracts information from the desired software version. Each software view corresponds to a discrete coordinate according to these three axes. Coherence is maintained by navigating only between adjacent views, which reduces cognitive effort as users search information to answer their questions. Two experiments involving representative tasks have validated the utility of our integrated approach. The results lead us to believe that an access to varied information represented graphically and coherently should be highly beneficial to the development of modern software.

1289	"Les relations entres les générations, les valeurs au travail et les comportements de 
citoyenneté organisationnelle"	Our research aims to better understand organizational citizenship behaviors and in particular, which individual values can promote or disadvantage them. We selected five such behaviors for sour research: civic virtue, sportsmanship, conscientiousness, courtesy and altruism. We chose to study influence of 28 individually-hold work-related values on these five organizational citizenship behaviors. We also chose to include generations as an antecedent of work values. Respondents were sorted into four generation still active in the labor market (i.e., Veterans, Baby Boomers, X, Y. We also investigated whether belonging to a generation rather than another has an impact on organizational citizenship behaviors.  Data were collected by a survey firm called Observateur. In total, 278 questionnaires were used in the context of our research. Hierarchical regression analysis was used to assess the explanatory power of values on organizational citizenship behaviors. Post hoc Scheffé tests verified the existence of differences in values between generations and an analysis of variance allowed us to check the influence of generations of organizational citizenship behaviors.  The results suggest significant associations between values and organizational citizenship behaviors thus confirming the positive or negative influence of certain values on five organizational citizenship behaviors. With respect to the differences in values between generations, the results reveal that they are much smaller than the literature suggests. Finally, our results show that  belonging to a generation rather than another has no significant impact on organizational citizenship behaviors.

1290	"Association de polymorphismes dans le gène
GPIHBP1 avec l’hypertriglycéridémie"	Hypertriglyceridemia (hyperTG) is a frequent dyslipidemia referring to an increased fasting plasma triglyceride (TG) level ≥ 2 mmol/L. HyperTG is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, such as coronary artery diseases. Several environmental and genetic factors have been associated with hyperTG. Although several gene factors were associated with hyperTG, nearly 90% of cases of primary hyperTG are still incompletely characterized at the molecular level. Recently, few cases of rare and severe hyperTG have been associated with some rare polymorphisms in the gene coding for GPIHBP1 (glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored high-density lipoprotein-binding protein 1). This manuscript resumes our research regarding the identification of new molecular bases associated with the expression of frequent hyperTG subtypes in the gene locus GPIHBP1.  Our results show that the GPIHBP1 g.-469G>A polymorphism (rs72691625), whose the minor allele frequency was estimated to 19.6% in our sample, was associated with the expression of hyperTG (TG ≥ 2 mmol/L) in a French-Canadian population. Subjects heterozygous and homozygous for this polymorphism respectively had a 1.67-fold and 5.70-fold increased risk to exhibit plasma TG levels ≥ 2mmol/L as compared to non-carriers. This increased risk of hyperTG observed in g.-469A carriers seems to be exacerbated by the concomitant presence of a frequent loss-of-function lipoprotein lipase gene variant. This polymorphism seems also particularly associated with dysbetalipoproteinemia and familial hypertriglyceridemia.   The g.-469G>A polymorphism is the first common polymorphism in the GPIHBP1 gene promoter to be associated with the expression of hyperTG. GPIHBP1 emerges as a significant candidate for the molecular based of primary hyperTG.	GPIHBP1 , Polymorphism , Hypertriglyceridemia , Lipoprotein lipase , Lipid-lipoprotein metabolism	en	5003.0
1291	"La Métamorphose, un opéra en trois actes
Genèse, analyse et formalisation d’une démarche compositionnelle"	Composed between 2007 and 2009, the opera La Métamorphose is ambitious by its size, but also by its first intention to get closer to the ideal of a total artwork. To do so, efforts have been multiplied to assure a professional production that would not only allow a correct performance of the work, but also give out the necessary funding to work as a team during the conceptualization process.   Although the professional production of this work has not taken place as planned, due to a last minute disengagement of the main producer, the creative team still managed to work together one whole year, which greatly helped to synthesize artistic decisions linked to this piece.  More than being a be-all and end-all, this opera project has become a vehicle allowing a further deepening and appropriation of many new compositional techniques with the help, amongst others, of Computer Assisted Composition: morphing, spectral analysis based harmony, resonance model based harmony, melodic profiling etc.  The first chapter of this thesis approaches the genesis of La Métamorphose including all of the research preceding the composition of the work: mastering visual programming tools (MaxMSP, Openmusic), writing of the libretto, first drafts, conceptualization work as a team (composer, librettist, stage director, producer).  The second chapter presents an analysis of La Métamorphose, putting the emphasis on compositional techniques isnpired by the universal theme of transformation.  The last chapter demonstrates the gradual formalization of my musical reasoning and proposes a synthesis of the new knowledge acquired during the composition of La Métamorphose.

1292	Enjeux éthiques, défis dans les soins de santé et prise de décisions pour les patients souffrant de troubles neurologiques de la conscience	Coma, the vegetative state and the minimally conscious state are classified as “disorders of consciousness”. The common characteristic of these diagnoses is an altered state of consciousness. Technological advances now allow us to keep people afflicted with these diagnoses alive. The very nature of their condition and the type of care available to them has lead to important medical and ethical dilemmas.  First, this thesis proposes a literature review of the ethical and social issues related to disorders of consciousness. Certain issues have persisted for years and others have emerged more recently as that relating to the use of neuroimaging.  The second part proposes a qualitative study examining the perspectives and experiences of healthcare professionals dealing with ethical issues in the management of these patients; these aspects are so far poorly documented. We conducted this study using a short questionnaire and semi-directed interviews. The interviews were taped and analyzed using qualitative analysis software Nvivo.  Our study showed that our participants experienced a high degree of certainty about the diagnosis, although the latter is often reported as a major challenge in the literature. The prognosis is a critical challenge, including its disclosure to relatives. Finally, the relationship with the family is a key element in the care of patients and it is influenced by multiple factors.

1293	Étude de l’interaction entre le champignon mycorhizien Glomus irregulare et les bactéries du sol	In this study, we isolated and cultivated bacterial cells intimately associated with Glomus irregulare spores in a natural soil Agrostis stolonifera rhizosphere. Sequencing of the 29 morphotypes isolated revealed the presence of only seven bacterial taxa (Variovorax paradoxus, Microbacterium ginsengiosoli, Sphingomonas sp., Bacillus megaterium, B. simplex, B. cereus and Kocuria rhizophila). These seven isolates were cultivated in vitro on the mycelium of G. irregulare to allow microscopic observation of growth and attachment to the mycelium in absence of nutritive sources other than those derived from the fungal mycelium. All isolates but B. cereus were able to grow on the experimental system and to attach to the mycelium to form biofilm-like structures on their surface. However, B. simplex formed these structures more quickly, in 15 days, than the remaining isolates that have formed them only after 30 days (K. rhizophila and B. megaterium) or 45 days (V. paradoxus, M. ginsengiosoli and Sphingomonas sp.). In addition, PCR-DGGE was used to compare bacterial diversity. The bacterial biodiversity associated with spores of G. irregulare that were isolated and cultured in vitro was significantly lower than that present on the spore surface, while total soil bacterial diversity was much higher. The bacteria associated with mycorrhizal fungi probably have an important role in the ability of plants to withstand biotic and abiotic stresses to which they are submitted.	biofilm , Arbuscular mycorhizal fungi (AMF) , bacteria , biodiversity , microscopy	en	4986.0
1294	Mécanismes de déformation de nanoparticules d’Au par irradiation ionique	Abstract  In the present thesis, we study the anisotropic deformation of gold nanoparticles embedded in amorphous silica or crystalline aluminum arsenide, under ion bombardment. We try to comprehend the mechanism responsible for this deformation and to remove any ambiguity related to the explanation of this phenomenon.  A hybrid process combining sputtering and plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition was used to fabricate Au/SiO2 layers on fused silica substrates. Structures with single and multilayer were obtained. Heating during or after deposition activates the Au atom agglomeration and favours the growth of the nanoparticles. Also, a Au/AlAs nanocomposite was obtained by ion implantation of AlAs films, followed by rapid thermal annealing. The samples of the two nanocomposites, cooled with liquid nitrogen, were irradiated with 2 to 40 MeV Cu, Si, Au or In ion beams, at fluences ranging from 1×1013 to 4×1015 ions/cm2, using a Tandem or Tandetron accelerator.   The structural and morphological properties of the Au/SiO2 nanocomposite were extracted by optical means; the frequency and the width of surface plasmon resonance band depend on the nanoparticle shape and size, their concentration, the inter-particle distance and the dielectric properties of material in which the particles are embedded. The aluminum arsenide crystallinity was studied by two techniques: Raman spectroscopy and Rutherford backscattering spectrometry in channelling configuration (RBS/ channelling). The Au concentration in the nanocomposite layers was deducted from RBS results. The size distribution and metallic nanoparticles shape transformation in both nanocomposites were observed by electronic transmission microscopy.  The results obtained within the framework of this work are the subject of three journal papers. The first publication shows the possibility of manipulating the width and spectral position of the gold nanoparticle absorption band in Au/SiO2 nanocomposites by modifying their structure (form, size and inter-particle distance). The obtained Au nanoparticles are nearly spherical. The surface plasmon (PS) absorption band corresponding to the distant particles is located at 520 nm. After ion irradiation, the spherical nanoparticles transform into ellipsoids aligned along the ion beam. The absorption band splits into two bands: transversal and longitudinal. The band corresponding to the ellipsoids small axis (transversal) is blue-shifted and that corresponding to the long axis (longitudinal) is red-shifted indicating the elongation of particles in the beam direction. The second paper is consecrated to the crucial role of the plastic deformation of the matrix and to the importance of the metal atomic mobility in the anisotropic nanoparticles deformation in Au/SiO2 nanocomposites. Our measurements show that a threshold value of 2 keV/nm (electronic stopping power) is necessary for the deformation of Au nanoparticles. This value is close to that required for silica deformation. Mobility of the Au atoms at the time of the ion passage is confirmed by temperature calculation within the ionic track. The third paper treats the attempt of formation and deformation of Au nanoparticles in crystalline aluminum arsenide matrix known by its high resistance to amorphisation and deformation under ionic bombardment. The principal result of the last article confirms the essential role of the matrix. It proves that the anisotropic deformation of surrounding material is indispensable for gold nanoparticles deformation.  The experimental results mentioned above and temperature calculations within ionic tracks allowed us to propose the following anisotropic deformation scenario of Au nanoparticles embedded in Au/SiO2 nanocomposite:  - Each ion crossing the silica melts (very briefly) a narrow cylinder around its trajectory forming thus a latent track. This is consistent with the observed threshold value in the electronic stopping power. - The cumulative effect of many separate ion impacts leads to the anisotropic growth of the silica matrix which contracts in the direction of the beam and elongates in the perpendicular direction. The overlap model of the ionic tracks was used to validate this phenomenon. - The deformation of silica generates strains which act on the nanoparticles in the plane perpendicular to the ion trajectory. In order to accommodate these strains, the Au nanoparticles deform in the beam direction.  - The deformation of nanoparticles occurs each time an ion traverses the gold particle and melts a cylinder around its trajectory. The mobility of the gold atoms was confirmed by a calculation of the equivalent temperature from the deposited energy in the material by incident ions.   The scenario above is compatible with our experimental data obtained in the case of the Au/SiO2 nanocomposite. It is further supported by the fact that the Au nanoparticules do not deform when they are integrated in AlAs which is resistant to the deformation.	nanoparticules , Au , ion irradiation , nanoparticles , Au , electronic stopping power , surface plasmon resonance , elongation , silica , aluminum arsenide	en	4985.0
1295	"Les enjeux éthiques de l’ambiguïté du terme ""communauté"" dans les documents officiels de santé publique au Québec sous une perspective de justice distributive"	To reduce social health inequalities, the Quebec government has introduced a strategy to support community development. However, official Quebec government documents in the public health sector are ambiguous in their use of the term “community”, which raises issues of fairness and justice. First, the ambiguity of this concept points to a lack of effort to make community development functional, which suggests a lack of seriousness with regards to reducing associated health inequalities. There is also an issue of fairness, because the rationale for the selection of communities that can expect support in community development cannot be justified if  we do not know what “community” means. In the first chapter, this thesis employs a content analysis of Quebec public health documents to confirm the hypothesis that  these official documents do not make sufficiently clear the concept of “community”. The second chapter explores understandings of this term in the social sciences.  Vibert’s typology is proposed to account for the socio-historical richness of the term “community”, the issues that this term raises and a possible means for enabling health professionals to make better-informed choices about the communities they support in their practice. Finally, if multiple uses or understanding of the term “community” are acceptable in Quebec public health, then by what criteria are communities selected for support? The third chapter examines the model of procedural justice developed by Daniels and Sabin to respond fairly to disagreements related to rationing in health.

1296	Champ d'application de la Convention des Nations Unies sur les contrats de vente internationale de marchandises	The scope of application of the 1980 Vienna Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is a very delicate issue. Indeed, its abstract and supplementary nature has given rise to markedly divergent judgements and rarely agreeing doctrine. The difficulties arising from the application of the CISG clearly exemplfy its limited ability to adap to novel international sale of goods contracts. Are these difficulties attributable to faulty interpretations of the provisions of the CISG?  Would it be opportune to compensate for the CISG's shortcomings by resorting to other instruments, such as the UNIDROIT rules or the principles of European contract law? Is it necessary to look beyond the Vienna Convention? All these questions must be considered in order to properly analyse the scope of application of the CISG.

1297	Identification et caractérisation de facteurs impliqués dans la réplication et la stabilité des génomes des organelles de plantes	Compared to the nuclear genome, very little is known about the genomes of the two plant cytoplasmic organelles, the plastid and the mitochondria. Indeed, very few factors involved in either the replication or the repair of these genomes have been identified. Here we show the implication of the Whirly protein family in the maintenance of organellar DNA. Indeed, mutations in Whirly genes lead to DNA rearrangements in both Arabidopsis thaliana and Zea mays plastids. These rearrangements are the product of microhomology-mediated break-induced replication that rarely occurs in wild-type plants but increases in absence of Whirly proteins. In a mutant plant devoid of plastidial Whirly proteins, these new DNA molecules can be amplified up to fifty times the normal DNA level and cause a variegated phenotype. In the course of the study of the Whirly mutant plants, we developed a strategy, based on the use of the antibiotic ciprofloxacin, to induce DNA double-strand breaks specifically in plant organelles. The Arabidopsis mutant plants without Whirly proteins in the plastids are more sensitive to the antibiotic ciprofloxacin than wild-type plants. Accordingly, there is a much larger increase in the number of rearranged DNA molecules in the plastids of the mutant plants than in the control plants. Surprisingly, while the mutant plants devoid of Whirly proteins in the mitochondria do not show increased sensitivity to the drug, they do accumulate more rearrangements in their mitochondrial DNA compared to wild-type plants. These results suggest that the Whirly proteins are involved in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks in the plant organelle genomes. Our study of the plant organelle genome stability has lead us to a family of proteins homologous to the DNA polymerase I in bacteria. This family has been proposed to be responsible for most of the DNA-synthesis activity in the plant organelles. We bring genetic proof to support this hypothesis using mutants of the two PolI genes of Arabidopsis. The combined mutation of both genes is lethal and the single mutations cause a decrease in the relative DNA levels in the organelles, thus confirming the involvement of both genes in DNA replication. Interestingly, mutants of the PolIB but not PolIA gene shows increase sensitivity to ciprofloxacin suggesting a function in DNA repair. In line with these results, a cross between a PolIB mutant and the mutant of plastid Whirly genes resulted in plants with severe growth defects and numerous rearrangements in the plastid DNA. In conclusion, we have identified two factors involved in the metabolism of organelle DNA and proposed a simple model of how these genomes are maintained in the plant cell.

1298	Capacité de deux accéléromètres (SenseWear Armband et l’Actical) à estimer la dépense énergétique totale chez les adultes sains	The increase in energy expenditure by the increase of physical activity contributes to maintaining and improving health. The large-scale measurement of total energy expenditure in general and physical activity in particular, is faced with difficulties of data collection, validity and cost. Although literature suggests that many accelerometers are used to estimate total energy expenditure, there are still limits as to the measurement of the intensity of physical activity, which is one of the factors that influences the energy balance and health benefits of physical activity. In addition, few comparisons between the different accelerometers are available. This study aimed to evaluate the ability of two accelerometers (Actical and SensWear Armband) to estimate total energy expenditure compared with the technique of doubly labelled water; to assess the correlation between the two accelerometers in the measurement of resting energy expenditure, compared with the technique of indirect calorimetry and finally to assess energy expenditure linked to physical (walking and cycling) at different intensities, in comparison with the indirect calorimetry technique. The results show a very good correlation between indirect calorimetry and the two accelerometers(r > 0.80, p<0.001) in the measurement of resting energy expenditure and a good correlation between accelerometers and the gold standard technique (doubly labeled water) in the measurement of total energy expenditure(r>0.75, p<0.001). To measure the intensity of physical activity, Actical is more accurate than SensWear Armband(r=0.80, p<0.001) at low intensity while the SensWear Armband is better at higher intensity (r=0.80, p<0.001). This study provides evidence that these two accelerometers are suitable alternatives for measuring energy expenditure.

1299	Les tests de causalité en variance entre deux séries chronologiques multivariées	Time series models with conditionnaly heteroskedastic variances have become almost inevitable to model financial time series. In many applications,    to confirm the existence of a relationship between two  time series is very  important. In this Master thesis, we generalize in several directions and in a multivariate framework, the method developed by Cheung and Ng (1996) designed to examine causality in variance in the case of two univariate series. Based on the work of El Himdi and Roy (1997) and Duchesne (2004), we propose a test based on residual cross-correlation matrices of squared residuals and cross-products of these residuals. Under the null hypothesis of no causality in variance, we establish that  the test statistics converge in distribution to  chi-square random variables. In a second approach, we define as in Ling and Li (1997)  a transformation of the residuals for each  residual time series. The test statistics are built from the cross-correlations of these transformed residuals. In both approaches,  test statistics at   individual lags are presented and also portmanteau-type test statistics. That methodology is also used to determine the direction of causality in variance. The simulation results show that the proposed tests provide satisfactory empirical properties. An application with real data is also presented  to illustrate the methods	Tests , Causality , Heteroscedasticity , Portmanteau , Correlation , Test , Variances , Multivariate , Time , Series , Conditionnal , Variance	en	4949.0
1300	"Développement et caractérisation de nouveaux 
modèles du cancer épithélial de l’ovaire"	The epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the most lethal of gynecological cancers. This complexe and heterogenous disease progresses rapidly and is almost asymptomatic in early stages. The survival rate of patients with late stage diagnosis remains low albeit cytoreductive surgery and chemotherapy. In order to study the EOC disease in an ex vivo context, the use of different cellular models is necessary. EOC cell lines derived from long-term passages of malignant ovarian cancers are useful tools for molecular and cellular research but it is not clear how culture conditions affect overall gene expression and oncogenic potential as compared to the original tumor. The main goal of this research was to develo and characterize new in vitro model systems that will recapitulate more closely some of the growth conditions encountered by tumor cells in vivo. In order to develop an in vitro tridimensional EOC spheroid model, we have used cell lines previously established in our laboratory. Spheroids were generated using the hanging droplet method, which was innovative for the culture of cancer cells. Comparative gene expression profile analysis of monolayer cultures, 3D spheroids and in vivo xenografts were performed and we have shown that the spheroid transcriptome more closely reflects expression patterns of the in vivo model compared to that of monolayer cultures. Among the best candidates, S100A6 gene over-expressed in the 3D models versus monolayer cultures was chosen for further analysis. To begin to address how S100A6 might affect EOC growth parameters, we have inhibited its expression in our in vitro models. The loss of S100A6 in the spheroid model results in an reduction of cellular migration, which seems to be in line with previous in vivo results published by other researchers. Always with the objective of developing the most relevant to the in vivo disease model systems, we have also succeeded in developing a unique EOC cell lines derived from patients with the most frequently diagnosed serous type of cancer. Very few cell lines derived from this type of cancers and from chemotherapy naïve patients are available. Moreover, we characterize for the first time EOC serous type cell lines derived from the ascites and the solid tumor of the same patient.

1301	Le paratexte et la traduction du Popol Vuh de l’abbé Brasseur de Bourbourg	The Popol Vuh is a historical tale of the Maya Quiché people which has been translated many times. Until the mid 20th century, many of those translations were based on Brasseur de Bourbourg’s version published in 1861. In order to situate the translator’s work, we approached his translation from the perspective of paratext, i.e. what ccompanies the text (title page, preface, footnotes, illustrations, etc.), rather than comparing the source text to the translation. In order to do so, we have established the paratext’s theoretical framework, based on the works published by Genette and Lane, and we have applied it to Brasseur de Bourbourg’s translation of the Popol Vuh. Brasseur de Bourbourg’s paratext is colossal; it allows us to understand what motivated his work and what he has done. The study of the translator’s preface clearly demonstrates that his goal was to present the culture of the Americas from a different standpoint, and the Popol Vuh is, for him, the perfect example of a rich literary, historical and cultural heritage that has long been overlooked. The preface to the translation prepares the reader to read the text, whereas the many footnotes guide him when he’s reading the translation. Nevertheless, the amount of paratext is so imposing that it overshadows the actual translation. In short, paratext analysis allows us to look critically and advisedly at Brasseur de Bourbourg’s translation, with a good knowledge of what paratext actually tells us. Therefore, reading the paratext and being aware of its meaning should transform a simple reader into a well-informed and critical reader, whether it is a translation or any other kind of document.

When mentioned in history books, the fragmented screen is quickly eluded. And yet its appearances are numerous. This Master thesis aims at rectifying a number of pre-established ideas by exposing the history behind this visual manifestation, from early cinema to the arrival of digital films.

1303	"Le ""métier"" de parent : au-delà des compétences et des performances"	"Books and programs on early childhood are multiplying and, more and more, the emphasis is put on the early years of the life of the child as much by the experts that the State. The focus seems to be set on parenting skills to stimulate cognitive and motor development of the offspring, with the objective to prevent trajectories considered ""deviant"".   However, this focus reaches parents in a different way within the same society. While it’s addressed to a small group of parents who perhaps do not stimulate their children enough in the way promulgated by the State, some authors put forward a trend of other parents who overstimulate their child (Corwin, 2006; Guthrie et Matthews, 2002; Duclos, 2006; Proulx, 2004; Elkind, 1983; Honoré, 2008; Rosenfeld et Wise, 2000). For others, the injunction to ""produce"" a “competent” child is added to existing stress, such as poverty or work pressure.   The tendency to overstimulate, overprogram or “surautonomiser” (to render overly autonomous) children in order to ""produce"" “competent” children is described as hyper-parenting, excessive parenting or overparenting and is reminiscent of the race towards performance studied in adults by Ehrenberg (2001[1991]) or De Gaulejac (2005). Following this last author or Perrenoud (2008) to whom the trend of managing the family as a company comes as a ""contamination"" from the workplace, this research examines the relationship between the manner in which parents consider the progress of their child and their own work experience, in comparison with the discourse of experts and the State."

1304	De la typicité des différentes mesures de tendance centrale dans la représentation mentale des catégories implicites	What is the nature of the representations people form of the categories they learn? It is generally accepted that the type of learning task has an influence on the answer to that question. That being said, most of the categorization theories elaborated during the last decades have focused almost exclusively on classification-learning tasks. The master thesis presented here had four objectives. First, to verify if a classification-learning task leads to the integration of more diagnostic dimensions than an inference-learning task in the context of implicit categories. Second, to verify if an inference-learning task leads to the integration of more typical dimensions than a classification-learning task, once again in the context of implicit categories. Third, to evaluate if a prototype enhancement effect can be observed in an inference-learning task. Fourth, to clarify which central tendency measure really presents a prototype enhancement effect: the mode, the median or the mean. Given the results obtained, implications for three categorization theories are discussed. The three theories are prototype theory, exemplar theory and decision-bound theory.

1305	O6-Methylguanine-DNA-Methyltransferase methylation: prevalence and predictive value in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma	Background: The O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) gene encodes a specific DNA repair enzyme that protects cells from toxicity of alkylating agents. Thus, MGMT activity is a major mechanism of resistance to alkylating drugs. It has been shown that decreased MGMT gene expression by promoter hypermethylation results in improved survival in patients with certain types of tumors that are treated with alkylating chemotherapeutic agents. Objectives: To determine the prevalence of MGMT methylation in patients with locally advanced Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) treated with chemoradiation therapy and to evaluate the impact of this methylation on survival. Methods: Out of 428 consecutive patients treated with chemoradiation therapy at our institution and followed for a median of 37 months, 199 paraffin embedded biopsy or surgical specimens were retrieved. DNA was extracted and subjected to bisulfite treatment. A methylation specific PCR (MSP) was conducted to assess the methylation status of the MGMT gene promoter. Laboratory data was correlated with clinical response. Statistical analysis was performed using Fisher’s test for categorical data and Kaplan-Meier’s curves and logrank statistics for failure times. Results: From the initial 199 DNA extracts, 173 (87%) were successfully modified with bisulfite. Out of these, 71 (41%) demonstrated hypermethylation of MGMT. For MGMT methylated cases and nonmethylated cases, patients characteristics were not significantly different. Response rates were 71 and 73% (p=NS), respectively. Local control rate (LCR) was respectively 87 and 77% (p=0.26), Disease-free survival (DFS) was 80 and 60% (p=0.38), distant metastasis free survival (DMFS) was 92 and 78% (p=0.08) and overall survival (OS) was 64 and 62% (p=0.99) at 3 years respectively. Conclusions: MGMT methylation status is highly prevalent (41%) and seems to have a possible beneficial impact on survival when chemoradiation therapy is given to patients with advanced stage HNSCC.

1306	Writing : a concrete strategy to facilitate the integration of conflicting identities into the self	More and more, people must learn to integrate new identities in their self-concept, which is often the source of identity conflicts. To reduce these identity conflicts, previous research suggests that high levels of identity integration increases psychological wellbeing (Amiot, de la Sablonnière, Terry & Smith, 2007; Benet-Martinez & Haritatos,2005; de la Sablonnière, Amiot, Sadykova, Cardenas, & Gorborukova, 2010). So far, no strategy to promote identity integration was suggested. In parallel, the action of writing about a negative experience demonstrates that writing helps organize and structure ideas while enhancing psychological well-being (Lyubomirsky, Sousa & Dickerhoof, 2006; Pennebaker & Graybeal, 2001; Pennebaker & Seagal, 1999; Smyth, 1998). Thus, we hypothesize that writing will facilitate the integration of conflicting identities into the self. Studies 1 and 2 reveal that writing about identity conflicts, as compared to writing about a neutral topic or no writing, is associated with superior levels of psychological well-being only for participants scoring high on identity integration. Studies 3 and 4 confirm that several writing sessions using clearer writing instructions helped participants to increase both levels of identity integration and psychological well-being regardless of the initial level of identity integration. Analyses of participants’ written content were performed to deepen our understanding.	identity , integration , conflict resolution , writing , psychological well-being	en	4897.0
1307	Résilience familiale en tant que processus au sein de couples dont la femme est atteinte d'insuffisance cardiaque	The purpose of this study is to propose a conceptualization of family resilience as a process undertaken by couples where the woman is suffering from chronic heart failure (CHF). Year after year, this chronic disease afflicts not only a growing number of women, but also, and just as much, their life partner. There is increasing recognition that the experience of these women differs from that of their male counterparts. The experience of the male partner as well as the experience of the couple are not often discussed in the literature. The couple consisting of a woman with CHF faces many difficulties inherent in the CHF, difficulties that may require the couple to show family resilience. To achieve our goal, a grounded theory approach was chosen. Data collection used joint semi-structured interviews with 12 couples. As well, a sociodemographic questionnaire and field notes were used. Rigorous analysis of the data permits the proposal of a conceptualization of family resilience as a process undertaken by these couples. In fact, the CHF of the woman is a difficult experience for the couple. Each one faces a shock incurred by the many upheavals associated with CHF that disrupt forever all the plans of their life together. In such an unfavorable life situation, they are called to engage in a process of family resilience. According to two perspectives of family resilience, their commitment to such a process is actualized by the implementation of many strategies, most of which are marital, though a few of them are carried out separately by each member of the couple. Indeed, according to the first perspective, couples bounce back in facing the shock of the diagnosis both individually and as a couple. Individually, each member of the couple tends to take charge while retaining his or her autonomy. To do this, women with CHF take control of the illness and its symptoms, and take care of themselves both physically and psychologically. To do so requires managing their energy, discovering inventiveness and taking responsibility for the CHF. Meanwhile, their male partner prefer the single individual strategy of becoming open to other ways of doing things. As for couple strategies, couples tend to maintain both their independence and their complicity in the experience related to the CHF. To this end, they use their reciprocity of care and work to strengthen and reaffirm their conjugal autonomy by being more open to extended family and community and by carefully measuring how much place the CHF will have in their relationship. According to the second perspective, couples bounce back, this time in growing as a couple by discovering new ways of behaving and finding meaning in their experience of living with CHF. To discover new ways, they revisit together all previous activities. To find meaning, they relativize the upheavals of the CHF by such strategies as a life review of their experience as couple and family, the adoption of suitable leitmotifs and, finally, the discovery and appreciation of grandchildren.  In our opinion, the findings of this study make an important contribution to nursing knowledge. This should help nurses to better understand the process of family resilience as a process and contribute to the improvement of nursing practice with couples struggling with CHF in women.

1308	La plasticité cérébrale dans le vieillissement normal : effet de l’éducation formelle et de l’entraînement cognitif sur les mesures de potentiels évoqués	Normal aging usually has a negative connotation for cognitive functioning. However, positive changes have been reported in the literature concerning the elderly. Indeed positive plasticity associated with protective factors has been found to have an impact on cognition. This plasticity was observed using magnetic resonance imaging which gives precise information concerning the localization of cerebral activations, but event-related potentials have not been used to evaluate this plasticity. Certain factors have been found to induce positive changes in the elderly; cognitive reserve factors, such as education, have been found to protect against deleterious effects of aging. Additionally, training programs aiming to improve various cognitive processes, such as attentional control, have been described to increase performance in the elderly and to induce changes in cerebral activity.  The following thesis describes two studies that use event-related potentials (ERP) in which we evaluate the impact of education and attentional control training on cerebral plasticity in normal aging. Based on a literature review, Chapter 1 will describe ERP techniques, attentional control in aging as well as the different protective factors in aging and their impact on plasticity. This literature review will also highlight the lack of studies using the ERP technique. To address this dearth, chapter 2 will present a study that uses ERP to evaluate the effect of educational level on cerebral plasticity in aging populations. This reserve factor was studied using two tasks involving attentional control while recording ERPs to define the plasticity associated with it. Results indicate that the P200 component of event-related potentials serves as an index of plasticity, when this plasticity is related to the level of education. Additionally, cortical thickness analyses show a thicker anterior cingulate cortex with higher education. Chapter 3 examines the impact of three attentional training formats: focused attention, divided attention and attentional modulation formats. These formats have been reported to improve performance in the elderly in different attentional processes. Before and after being assigned to one of the training formats, participants underwent an EEG recording while performing an attentional control task. Behaviorally, all groups improved, but only attentional modulation training induces changes in attentional control. Event-related potentials reveal the N200, as an index of plasticity associated with cognitive training. Changes in the N200 component after training were shown in all testing conditions only for the group having received attentional modulation training. Results confirm that positive plasticity exists in aging and that some ERP components can serve as indexes of plasticity. However, this index differs depending upon factors responsible for the plasticity. Chapter 4 discusses the impact and limitations of the findings, as well as future areas of research.

1309	Communication, développement et appropriation des médias émergents en Afrique francophone subsaharienne : approche critique	"This thesis addresses the appropriation of the Internet and of multimedia in the university population of French-speaking Africa, in the year 2001. It deals with six sub-Saharan countries: Benin and Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Ivory Coast, Mali and Togo. The research is specifically interested in the inventory of demographic research centers in sub-Saharan French-speaking Africa and the investigation with the universities of Yaoundé II and Douala in Cameroon.  The question of access and use is central to our approach. Articulated as a research question, the focus is as follows: ""In a context dominated by the representations of the ICTs as symbols of modernity and ways of integrating the world economy, what are the modalities of appropriation of these technologies by academics within postsecondary institutions of teaching and research in Africa considered in this study?"" Two theoretical approaches were adopted to deal with the empirical data : theories of development tied to the (new) media and the sociology of technological innovations.   Rooted in the thought of the Enlightenment, completed and refined by the evolutionist approaches inspired by Spencer, Parsonian functionalism and the political economy centered on the thought of W.W. Rostow, theories of development have made much use of theories of the communication in order to achieve their objectives. Even as the crisis of Western modernity threatens to delegitimize these paradigms, the emergent technologies give them a new lease on life: in continuity of the thought of Auguste Comte, development is henceforth thought in terms of integration within a new social structure, the information society. This new eschatological promise and this faith in technology as the factor of integration within society and the network economy animate all the projects undertaken on the continent, whether it is the NEPAD, the Digital Solidarity Fund, the $100 Computer Project for Deprived Children or the Pan-African project of satellite sideboard, the RASCOM.  The second part of our theoretical framework is centered on the sociology of technical innovations. We make use of the socio-political approach to usage developed by Vedel and Vitalis to re-introduce critical reason into the debate on the development of the African continent, with a view to showing how political prerogatives at the State-level still have their place, if we want to develop digital resources that satisfy social demands and respond not only to demands deemed solvent and essentially arising out of urban areas. By refusing the technical determinism so current in thinking about development, we would like to show that the future of technology is not inscribed in its essence, like a shadowy presence, but that human action, notably political action, can reorient the trajectory of technological innovation in the direction of responding to the aspirations of citizens.  Methodologically, our approach combines quantitative methods and qualitative methods. The former will allow us to measure the presence of the Internet and multimedia in the environment of those concerned. The latter will help us to grasp the representations developed by the users in contact with these tools. Within a socio-constructivist perspective, these discourses are constitutive of these technologies, inasmuch as they are so many modalities of appropriation, of the social construction of usage. Ultimately, the integration of the technical language specific to these multimedia tools into the every day language of the users signals the last stage of this appropriation. Through this research, it became evident that few users utilize audiovisual technologies in a professional context. As for the Internet and multimedia tools, their presence and their use remain limited, physical access not yet being guaranteed to all the respondents of the study. The Internet, while creating large expectations, also remains largely inaccessible in a professional context, the majority of the users making use of public spaces such as cyber-cafes to mitigate the lack of resources within their own institutions. As far as representations go, they remain still widely dependent on the dominant political and institutional discourses, according to which the future will be digital or will not be. The thesis, however, goes beyond this data in order to draw up the current digital map of the continent, by integrating within the technological landscape the phenomenal rise of mobile cellular technology.  It appeared to us that the Internet, the availability of which on the continent has been modest at best, could widely take advantage of the emergence on the continent of the mobile culture, which facilitates in particular the convergence between netbooks and mobile telephones (smartphones)."

1310	Étude et modélisation de la cinétique orale de l'amoxicilline chez le porcelet	It was reported that the oral bioavailability of amoxicillin in swine is about three times lower than in human beings. To elucidate the reasons for this difference, arterial, portal venous and urinary pharmacokinetics was documented at intragastric dose amounts ranging between 4 and 30 mg/kg, and several physiologic compartmental models were developed for data analysis. The maximum oral bioavailability of amoxicillin was recorded at 4mg/kg with a mean value of 52%. The portal-systemic plasma concentration differences of amoxicillin and its urinary clearance revealed an increase in hepatic clearance up to the 30 mg/kg dose. A compartmental model with two parallel absorption route (time-constrained Michaelis- Menten and first-order processes), two distribution compartments (central and peripheral) two elimination pathways (urinary and biliary excretions) best fitted the experimental data. These results highlight the paramount role of the PepT1 carriermediated, saturable absorption at low oral amoxicillin doses, as well as the increasing role of passive absorption at high doses.

1311	Musique mixte et vidéo : intégration et interaction, piste vers une nouvelle esthétique	In this research, we shall address a hybrid genre born from the mixture of mixed music and videomusic. Contrary to videomusic which is on a fixed medium, the video approached in this project is interactive. This interaction will figure as the main aspect of this research because it is necessary to achieve a good integration between the performer and the video.  We will dwell more specifically on the methods allowing the video to follow the music because it is the field in which there is more to discover. We are going to analyze four little experimental pieces composed in such a way as to find which methods are the most efficient, elegant and versatile. We will draw our conclusions.  A final piece has been composed from these conclusions and we are presenting a detailed analysis. This last piece is a larger-scale piece for a bigger ensemble with a longer length. The main goal was to communicate a poetic vision in the most efficient way.  We also thought about the visual integration of the performer and the video to allow a unified visual composition between them.

This dissertation aims to show the contribution of Mohammed Dib (Habel, 1977), Abdelwahab Meddeb (Phantasia, 1986) and Annie Cohen (L’Édifice invisible, 1988) to new representations of Paris that appeared in the social imaginary after decolonization. Given the supremacy of French culture, the protagonists offer a radical openness to alterity and question the alienation process and the status quo in the matters of culture and identity. A theme common to the three novels analyzed, the “promenade” leads their authors to work on the formatting of the story while placing the heroes in opposition to the changing urban and consumerist Western society.

1313	Confesser un homicide : le rôle de l’enquêteur et de la preuve	The studiess on factors influencing a suspect’s decision to confess his crime during a police questioning, reveal that the strength of evidence (Moston et al., 1992 and Des Lauriers-Varin and St-Yves, 2006) and the detective’s behaviour (Holmberg et Christianson, 2002 et Kebell et al., 2005) are considered key factors. However, past studies show notable contradictions. The present work focuses on the role of the two aforementioned factors, in the suspect’s decision to confess a crime and the potential interaction effect among them. The data were obtained by visioning and analyzing 50 questionings of a suspect linked to a homicide investigation. The logistic regression’s results show that the detective’s behaviour is the predominant factor in obtaining a confession from a suspect. Theses results are maintained when both the characteristic of the suspect and the weight of evidence are controlled for. Moreover, our results suggest that a “positive” attitude from the detective’s part is associated with a greater propensity toward confessing. Also, the results indicate that the greater available evidence to support the case, will translate into more “dominant” style of questioning from the detectives. The results are discussed in relation to the effects of the different dynamics taking place between the detective and the suspect during the questioning.	police interrogation , confession , detective’s behaviour , police evidence , police investigation	en	4768.0
1314	Phylogéographie comparée d’un système multitrophique : les parasitoïdes du genre Horismenus spp. ont-ils échappé au processus de domestication du haricot au Mexique?	This study aims to compare the evolutionary history of Horismenus parasitoids (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) to that of their bruchid beetle hosts (Coleoptera: Bruchidae) and their domesticated host plant (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) in the context of traditional agriculture within their Mesoamerican center of domestication. We analyzed the genetic structure of 23 populations of four Horismenus species in Mexico using COI mitochondrial gene fragments and compared the structures to previously published data on bean plant and beetle hosts. We predicted that because parasitoids complete their development within their beetle hosts, within the bean, the genetic structure of both the host and the parasitoid would be similar and equally influenced by human-mediated migration (HMM). Furthermore, because of reproductive manipulation strategies often used by the alpha-proteobacteria endosymbionte Wolbachia spp. to ensure its transmission, the genetic structure of parasitoid populations inferred from mitochondrial genome would be bias consequently to the conjoint transmission of mitochondria and the bacteria according to propagation of the infection within parasitoids populations. The populations of H. missouriensis parasitoids are infected by Wolbachia spp. As predicted, these populations are not differentiated (FST = 0.06) which prevents us to infer on a parallel evolutionary history. Unlike their bruchids hosts, Acanthoscelides obtectus and A. ovelatus, the HMM is not a contemporary process influencing H. depressus population genetic structure according to the strong populations differentiation (FST = 0.34). The genetic structure observed within H. depressus populations is similar to that of its host plant (i.e. historical random dispersal from a highly diversified ancestral gene pool) and is probably the result of extensive gene flow from parasitoids associated with wild beans populations adjacent to crop fields. The study of evolutionary history integrating multitrophic levels has proved to be fruitful in detecting different evolutionary responses among members of the trophic module face to human and parasite interactions, but also points out the pertinence of analyzing ecological systems as a whole.

1315	Justice pour les crimes contre l’humanité et génocides : point de vue et attentes des victimes	Human rights violations cause thousands of victims every year. Justice mechanisms, such as the International Criminal Court, have been developed to respond to these crimes, but victims remain under consulted. In this study, semi-structured interviews were conducted with Rwandan and Cambodian victims of crimes against humanity. Using social justice theories as a theoretical framework, this study examines victims’ perceptions of justice. The results show that while criminal justice is central in victims’ definition of justice, reparation and truth also are essential components. However, the criminal court’s ability to achieve truth is criticized by respondents creating a gap between the truth that they seek and the truth that they obtain. The quality of decision-making as well as how victims are treated also contribute to victims’ perception of justice. However, victims’ justice objectives vary according to the social and historic context.	justice post-conflit , Rwanda , victims , crimes against humanity , international criminal justice , post-conflict justice , procedural justice , distributive justice , Cambodia , justice distributive	en	4752.0
1316	Régulation de l’identité des membres postérieurs par le facteur de transcription à boîte T Tbx4	Forelimbs and hindlimbs are a classical example of serial homology, suggesting they share an evolutionary common generic program that directs their formation. Identity is presumably derived from specific modulations of that program in different limb type. Transcription factors are prime candidates to link these structural differences to specific modulations and three factors with limb-specific expression have been identified. Pitx1 and Tbx4 expression is restricted to the hindlimbs while Tbx5 is restricted to the forelimbs and they have all been ascribed functions in both growth and identity from knockout and overexpression studies. Recent studies have produce evidence that Tbx4 and Tbx5 are interchangeable, sharing identical properties to support growth but not identity of the limbs, the latter being a direct consequence of Pitx1 expression. Indeed, Pitx1 deficient mice have been previously described as undergoing a hindlimb-to-forelimb transformation in addition of growth defects.  To better assess the shared and specific properties of Tbx4 and Tbx5, we assessed their capacities to rescue identity and growth defects by expression studies in Pitx1-/- hindlimbs. Specifically, previous studies had shown that Pitx1 deficiency causes the loss of hindlimb features, the transformation of hindlimb features toward forelimb-like morphology, the gain of a forelimb feature and the asymmetric loss of growth at the level of the femur. Targeted expression in the limbs of both Tbx4 and Tbx5 rescued the growth defects similarly. Interestingly, only Tbx4 was able to restore identity features affected in absence of Pitx1. To further assess these shared and specific properties, we conducted transcriptional assays that revealed the presence of a shared and conserved transactivating domain in the C-terminal moiety of these proteins. Moreover, we could identify a repressor domain specific to Tbx4. Human small patella syndrome maps to TBX4 and a coding mutation, TBX4Q531R, that specifically inactivates the repressive properties of Tbx4 prevents it from rescuing identity to the Pitx1-/- hindlimbs but not from rescuing growth. We also conducted a yeast two-hybrid assay that allowed the identification of putative co-factors of Tbx4, of which one seems to act as a co-repressor.  Together, our results support the presence of a Tbx4/Tbx5 conserved activating domain required for limb outgrowth that is an integral part of the limb bauplan. Importantly, we identified a molecular basis for the determination of limb identity through the Tbx4-specific repressor domain and reveal a novel path through which limb identity may have emerged during evolution.

1317	"Le rôle des émotions dans le processus de sensemaking : l’analyse communicationnelle de récits d’expériences de personnes travaillant
dans une résidence pour personnes âgées"	Over the past decades, scholars have stressed the importance of investigating emotions and Weick’s (1995) sensemaking in organizational settings. However, few studies have examined the intricate relationships between these concepts. To address this issue, this interpretive study explores the role of emotions in processes of sensemaking in the context of a nursing home, based on an in-depth analysis of experiences histories of 6 of its employees. This narrative analysis reveals key differences and similarities in the way emotions color these employees’ sensemaking of everyday work interactions. In turn, this research shows that a focus on emotions can shed light on particular aspects of organizational sensemaking that otherwise remain taken for granted (or hidden).	sensemaking , interaction , emotion , interaction , organizational communication , experiences stories	en	4748.0
1318	Structures photoniques à base de nanocristaux de silicium	There are indications that silicon nanocrystals (nc-Si) exhibit an optical gain that is potentially large enough to enable optical amplification in the wavelength range where intense photoluminescence (PL) is measured (600-1000 nm). We fabricated optical cavities on fused silica pieces ion-implanted with Si in order to form a nc-Si layer with a thickness of about 1 μm. Si was implanted at four energies between 1 MeV and 1.9 MeV to obtain an excess atomic concentration varying between 25% and 30%. The pieces were sandwiched between dielectric mirrors consisting of multilayer interference filters. Over a wavelength range of about 200 nm wide, one filter reflects nearly 100%, while the other one shows an average reflection of 90%. We measured and compared the PL spectra of three samples: the first one with no mirrors, the second one with filters reflecting around 765 nm (between 700 nm and 830 nm), and the third one with filters acting around 875 nm (between 810 nm and 940 nm). When exciting the samples with a pulsed laser, timeresolved PL measurements exhibited faster decay rates in the wavelength domain where the reflection of the mirrors is maximal compared to samples without mirrors. Also, PL intensity as a function of excitation flux showed a faster increase in the presence of mirrors, although the increase remained sub-linear. From this, we conclude that stimulated emission could be present in the optical cavity, but does not dominate the other emission and loss processes.	nanocrystals , silicon , photoluminescence , photoluminescence , stimulated emission	en	4741.0
1319	"Addition stéréosélective de nucléophiles sur un centre acétal : synthèse de
nucléosides 1’,2’-cis"	Many therapeutically relevant nucleoside analogs (Ara-C, Clofarabine) for the treatment of leukemia have a 1’,2’-cis arrangement between the nucleobase attached at the anomeric center and the non-hydrogen substituent at C-2’. Recently, our laboratory has developed a versatile approach to the synthesis of 1’,2’-trans and 1’,2’-cis nucleoside and thionucleoside analogues from acyclic scaffolds. This work will present a new methodology to access efficiently 1’,2’-cis nucleoside analogues from cyclic furanoside. Activation of various anomeric groups by Me2BBr was investigated, and under kinetic control acyclic substrates or cyclic ones could be generated selectively. Trapping the kinetic product of methyl furanoside formed in presence of Me2BBr by thiol in the presence of base led to the formation of acyclic thioacetal in good to excellent diastereoselectivity. The results obtained are in accordance with total retention of the stereochemical information of the acetal moiety and thus suggested that the mechanism of these two reactions is two successive SN2 displacements. The objective of synthesizing nucleoside analogs from methyl furanoside was unsuccessful. As shown recently by Dr Michel Prévost, activation of all four furanoside lactol scaffolds by Me2BBr with an in situ addition of silylated nucleobase afforded 1’,2’-cis pyrimidine nucleoside analogues in very good yields and with diastereoselectivities greater or equal to 20:1. Expending this methodology to other scaffolds provided evidence of stereoelectronic control of the C-2 electron-withdrawing substituent. Other Lewis acids such as TMSBr can be used. This methodology was also applied to other nucleophiles such as allyl Grignard and silylated enols ethers, which were successfully alkylated in good yield and 1,2-cis diastereoselectivity.

1320	Le Mur dans la tête, vingt ans plus tard : législation sur l'avortement et discours féministes	This MA thesis is about abortion in Germany over the past twenty years. The first part will focus on one hand on the different laws regarding abortion in the two German states before the events of 1989 and on the other hand on the analysis of the discourse held by West and East German feminist movements regarding abortion. The second part will examine the debate surrounding abortion during the Reunification process. Indeed, the abortion law of the German Democratic Republic was much more liberal than the one of the Federal Republic of Germany and the majority of citizens and politicians of the former GDR refused that the West German restrictive law was simply to be extended to the reunified Germany. A debate followed that quickly became a kind of symbol of the division that existed between East and West Germans but also between feminists from the new and old Länder. Finally, in 1995, a new law was passed by Parliament, legislation that still governs abortion today. Twenty years after the Berlin Wall fell, the debate about abortion rose up in the headlines again with a new bill aimed at restricting abortion access after the 12th week of pregnancy. The third part will therefore focus on this more topical debate and examine whether the East-West division regarding abortion at the time of the Reunification still exists today in Germany which, according to the findings of this MA thesis, seems to be quite the case.

1321	Régulation transcriptionelle du développement de l'hypothalamus chez l'amphibien	The paraventricular nucleus PVN of the hypothalamus regulates a series of physiological phenomena including the maintenance of energetic balance and arterial blood pressure. We have previously identified a cascade of transcription factors that control the development of the PVN. Sim1 and OTP act in concert to mediate the terminal differentiation of at least five types of neurons identifiable by their production of OT, AVP, CRH, SS and TRH. These transcription factors control the development of the OT, AVP and CRH producing neurons by maintaining the expression of Brn2, which is in turn required for the terminal differentiation of these cell lines. The transcriptome analysis of the PVN allowed us to identify a handful of genes that are potentially implicated in the development of this brain structure. Our goal is to develop a loss of function paradigm that would allow a high troughput study of these candidate genes. The main goal of this project is to characterize the developing PVN in the amphibian in order to use this model in our functional studies of these genes. We have cloned fragments of cDNA of Sim1, OTP, Brn2, Sim2, CRH, TRH, AVP and OT using Xenopus laevis total RNA. We have also adapted our in situ hybridization technique to characterize the expression of these genes in stage 33-39, 44, 51, 54, 60 and adult amphibian brain. Sim1, OTP and Brn2 are expressed in the prospective PVN as soon as stage 33. The expression of the terminal differentiation markers become detectable between stages 37-39. Interestingly, the PVN is initially restricted to a more globular domain and begins to extend along the dorso-ventral axis at around stage 44. This vertical extension translates into a column organization that we do not observe in rodents.  The development of the PVN is well conserved in the amphibian in the sense that the relation between the expression of the different transcription factors and the terminal differentiation markers is conserved. We can also observe some topographical differences between the mammalian and amphibian PVN. The column organization the different PVN cell types might correspond to the tangential migration that is observed in the mouse. We are now well equipped to test the function in the PVN of the known transcripton factors as well as the candidate genes previously identified in our lab using a morpholino-mediated gene knock down.

1322	La mise en exposition des œuvres d'art spoliées par les nazis : étude de cas de l'exposition de la collection de Jacques Goudstikker	This thesis, dedicated to the display of looted art by Nazis after World War II, is particularly dedicated to the wave of current exhibitions operating from 2005 till 2010. Throughout this unique museum event, which consists of one temporary exhibition per year on average, a renewed interest for the events pertaining to World War II prevails. Considering this singular statement, we examined the major current stakes in these exhibitions. This thesis presents a retrospective of these exhibitions from 1946 till 2010.    Looted art exhibitions in France have been the object of important research by the influential art historian Reesa Greenberg and were presented in a museographic periodisation from which arise three phases contained between 1933 and 2004, the year of her article’s publication. The addition of two cycles based on French public restitution policy by the historian Claire Andrieu, besides the one proposed by Reesa Greenberg, was included in our analysis.  In embodying these two sources, we have testified to two important phases of restitution dealing with exhibition, beginning after 1945 for the first one and at the end of the 1990s for the second one, bringing to light numerous associations between the artistic plunder and the Holocaust, the manifold persecutions against Jews and the evolution of our perception on these events.  The pursuit of this reflection was made possible thanks to the case study dedicated to the exhibition of the art collection that was partly returned in 2006 by the Netherlands’government to the daughter-in-law of the Jewish collector Jacques Goudstikker, whose gallery was looted in 1940 in Amsterdam by Hermann Göring. Therefore, a visit of the exhibition at the Jewish Museum in New York in 2009 was included in the global analysis in order to facilitate our understanding of the current exhibitions. Within this new phase of exhibition, where the reclaiming of the looted paintings is regularly disputed, the relation between memory, the dead and the missing persons who have become the ghosts of the Holocaust and their stolen properties is omnipresent. Thus the exhibitions, at this beginning of the XXI century, allow us more than ever to assert that the events bound to the artistic plunder are still a part of a yet unfinished chapter.	restitution , Jacques Goudstikker , Exhibition , looted art , restitution , XXI century	en	4712.0
1323	"Les facteurs ayant une influence négative sur la qualité alimentaire chez les
personnes âgées vivant dans la communauté au Québec"	In Canada, the proportion of the population aged 65 and over has increased since 1980. Although under nutrition is not inevitable with aging, some changes and physiological factors, environmental and psycho-socio-economic conditions may cause deterioration in food choices and in the quality of life of seniors [1]. Several studies show the link between nutritional status and morbidity as well as functional capacity [2]. These observations justify the importance of prevention and treatment of under nutrition so as to optimize food intake and improve the health of this population. Objectives : 1) Exploring individual and socio-environmental barriers, whether it is real or perceived that may lead to deterioration of choices and quality food and cause under nutrition in the elderly living at home. 2) Examine the connection of these factors in the population being studied. 3) Examine the relationship between these factors so as to be knowledgeable about the negative determinants of nutrition in older adults to better understand the barriers to a healthy food intake. Methodology: This is a secondary analysis conducted using data collected from participants (n = 1 602), aged between 67 and 84 years in the Quebec’s Longitudinal Study on Nutrition and successful aging (NuAge) that began in 2003 with follow-ups planned over the following five years [3]. The main goal of NuAge was to determine the role of nutrition in the achievement of successful aging. The data include nutritional, functional, social, medical and biological measurements. From a theoretical model of determinants of food intake in the elderly population, these data have been linked to food quality. This was determined by the Canadian adaptation of the Healthy Eating Index (C-HEI) calculated from data of food and nutrition obtained by food frequency questionnaire administered to participants at T1 or their entry into the study. Results : The barriers that might inhibit food quality in women include a fragile emotional status and limited social functioning. What emerges as barriers of the C-HEI among men is an income considered insufficient to meet one’s needs, the use of dentures and eating at restaurant repeatedly. Surprisingly, the number of positive attitudes about nutrition and a higher score of the mental component of SF-36 are predictors of a lower C-HEI. The nature of self-reported responses could explain these results. Conclusion : The results of this research allow the better understanding of the barriers to healthy eating within a healthy community-dwelling elderly population. It is hoped that the results will contribute to the development of effective interventions targeting the older population to promote nutritional and optimal health.

1324	Analyse fonctionnelle du gène BMP-2 lors de la régénération du membre chez l’axolotl	Urodele amphibians (e.g. the axolotls) have a remarkable ability to regenerate parts of their body. They will, among other things, fully regenerate an amputated limb by epimorphosis, a biphasic process comprising a preparation phase, specific to the regeneration, and a redevelopment phase, common to epimorphosis and embryonic development. During the preparation phase, the cells of the stump dedifferentiate into embryonic-like cells, proliferate and migrate distally from the level of amputation to form a regeneration blastema. Among vertebrates, the process of dedifferentiation is unique to urodeles. To better understand the molecular control of regeneration in urodeles, we chose to study BMP-2, a growth factor, because of its involvement in mammalian digit tip regeneration. The transcription factor MSX-1 has also been selected because of its ability to induce cellular dedifferentiation in vitro and its potential interaction with BMPs signaling. The results presented in this thesis show that BMP-2 and MSX-1 are expressed during phases of preparation and redevelopment of epimorphosis, and their spatio-temporal expression profiles are very similar at each stage of epimorphosis, suggesting an interaction of their signals during regeneration. In addition, in tetrapod amniotes, the expression of Shh is restricted to the posterior mesenchyme of developing limbs and overlaps with the expression of BMP-2. However, the expression of BMP-2 is not restricted to the posterior region but forms a posterior-anterior gradient. Shh is the main regulator of the anterior-posterior pattern formation of developing limbs. Given the overlapping expression domains of Shh and BMP-2, and the expression restriction of Shh in posterior, Shh is believed to iv regulate the pattern formation of developing limbs by the activation of BMP-2 expression. Interestingly, the axolotl also expresses Shh in the posterior region, but the limb develops from anterior to posterior rather than posterior to anterior as in other tetrapods, and this, during development and epimorphosis. We used this feature of the axolotl to demonstrate that Shh signaling does not regulate pattern formation through BMP-2. Indeed, the expression of BMP-2 is not regulated by the inhibition of hh signaling, and its expression is opposite to that of Shh during development and regeneration of the axolotl limb. It was observed, during limb development in mice that MSX-1 is regulated by Shh signaling. Our results suggest that in the axolotl, MSX-1 is not regulated by the inhibition of Shh signaling during limb regeneration. Furthermore, we demonstrated that unlike the expression of Shh, the expression of BMP-2 is correlated with the order of formation of the phalanges, is involved in cell condensation and apoptosis preceding chondrogenesis. Taken together, these results suggest a role for BMP-2 in the initiation of endochondral ossification. Finally, we demonstrated that BMP signaling is essential for the redevelopment phase of limb epimorphosis.	Regeneration , Axolotl , Axolotl , BMP-2 , BMP-2 , MSX-1 , MSX-1 , blastema	en	4699.0
1325	La compétence orthographique d'élèves dyslexiques du primaire	Learning to spell is very difficult for dyslexic children. Their difficulties to spell are known to be persistent. It can be explained by a deficit in processing phonological information. However, in order to spell correctly in an alphabetic language as French, phonological knowledge is required, as spelling is based on the connections between oral and written language. In addition to phonological knowledge, the orthographical system of French demands from the speller to acquire visual-orthographic and morphological knowledge. The majority of studies aimed at describing dyslexic children’s spelling abilities refers to English and to reading.   The general goal of this study is to describe the spelling performance, in an explanatory viewpoint, of 26 dyslexic children, French-Canadian and aged 9 to 12 years old. The specific goals are to describe the spelling performances of these pupils in context of free productions and to compare them to those of 26 normally achieving children matched on age (AC) and to those of 29 younger normally achieving children matched on reading-level (RC). To do so, errors were classified according to phonological, visuo-orthographic and morphological properties of French written words. The results indicate that the dyslexic pupils made performances lower than those of the CA, but sometimes also than those of the CL. The results are discussed according to the types of knowledge required to spell correctly in French and to special-education intervention avenues.

1326	Évaluation échocardiographique des effets du pimobendane dans le traitement des maladies valvulaires dégénératives canines asymptomatiques	Background: Mitral Valve disease (MVD) is the most common acquired cardiac affectation of the dog, and is therefore associated with an undeniable clinical and economical importance for veterinarians and pet owners. Despite active research, at this time no known treatment has been proven to delay the onset of congestive heart failure. Pimobendan is a novel inodilator that has shown promising results in the treatment of advanced MVD, but little is known about its hemodynamic effects, especially regarding the mitral regurgitant volume in naturally occurring asymptomatic MVD. Hypothesis: Administration of pimobendan decreases the regurgitant fraction (RF) of dogs with asymptomatic MVD. Animals: Twenty-four client-owned dogs affected by ISACHC class Ib MVD. Methods: Prospective, blinded, controlled clinical trial. Dogs were assigned to a pimobendan (0.2-0.3 mg/Kg q12h) treatment group (n=19) or a control group (n=5). Echocardiographic evaluations were performed over a 6 month study period. Results: Administration of pimobendan to treatment did not decrease the RF of dogs affected by asymptomatic class 1b MVD over the study period (p=0.85). There was a significant increase in the ejection fraction of the pimobendan treated dogs at day (80.8 +/- 1.42 vs. 69.0 +/- 2.76, p=0.0064), and a decrease in systolic left ventricular diameter (p=0.011). However, this improvement in systolic function was not sustained over the 6 month trial period.	valve , PISA , echocardiography , dog , mitral , valve , pimobendan , Asymptomatic , PISA	en	4691.0
1327	Die Wahrnehmung des Fremden im Caoba-Zyklus von B. Traven	"The fictitious retelling of the events of the Mexican Revolution in the six novels of the Caoba cycle shows the consequences of colonialism. It also shows the social and economic injustices under which Mexican indigenous peoples suffered. The distinctive character of the native is well shown in the context of the cultural conflict between the colonizer and the colonized. The examination of the portrayal of the native section of the population is the major aim of the following thesis, which combines a narratological and postcolonial approach. The examination of selected text extracts shows, how and to what extent the German-speaking author is detached from a colonial discourse and if he can be seen as a forerunner of postcolonial discourses. The following central questions guide the analysis: To what extend does the representation of indigenous characters correspond to the one of the ""noble savage""? How are the different groups of society portrayed (as individuals, type or allegory)? Which methods does the author employ in order to give the European or Western reader an understanding of the foreign culture? Traven's narrative technique of showing the various societies from different perspectives plays an important role in this respect. In his desire to show societal situations as oppression and exploitation, Traven writes from the perspective of the colonized; but he narrates from the perspective of the colonizer with the intention to understand the dictatorial system. This approach corresponds to the ""contrapuntal"" method described by Edward E. Said in his work Orientalism. I want to show to which extent the author utilises the ""contrapuntal"" method in his postcolonial criticism and to which extent it is a real postcolonial criticism. Furthermore, the thesis draws on Homi K. Bhabhas theory of the hybrid contact zones to assess the importance Traven gives to transcultural, viz. reciprocal influences?"

1328	Étude de la fonction anti-apoptotique de la sous-unité R1 de la ribonucléotide réductase des virus de l’herpès simplex	Elimination of infected cells by apoptosis constitutes an ancestral mechanism of host defense against viral infection. Herpes simplex viruses (HSVs) encode several viral factors to counteract the apoptotic antiviral response. Among them, the R1 subunit of HSV type-2 ribonucleotide reductase (HSV-2 R1, also named ICP10), protects cells by interrupting death receptor-mediated signaling at, or upstream of, caspase-8 activation. Since protection against tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα)-induced apoptosis is decreased un cells infected with an HSV type-1 R1 null mutant, it has been proposed that HSV-1 R1 (ICP6) could also possess an antiapoptotic activity. The fundamental goal of this thesis is to better understand the mechanism and the potential of the HSV R1s antiapoptotic activity.   In a first study, we investigated the mechanism of the antiapoptotic activity of HSV R1s by using TNFα and Fas ligand (FasL), two death-receptor inducers involved in anti-HSVs immune response. From this work, we report three main findings on the antiapoptotic activity of HSV R1s. First, HSV-1 R1 like HSV-2 R1 has the ability to protect cells against TNFα- and FasL-induced apoptosis. Second, HSV-1 R1 contributes in protecting infected cells against FasL. Third, HSV R1s and procaspase-8 interact in a way that inhibits the dimerization/activation of caspase-8. These results suggest that in addition to counteracting death receptor-induced apoptosis, HSV R1s could inhibit apoptosis induced by other signals that trigger caspase-8 activation during HSV infection. Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) are viral intermediates notably produced by HSVs and have been shown to induce apoptosis via caspase-8 activation. We tested in a second study whether HSV R1s have the ability to counteract apoptosis triggered by polyriboinosinic : polyribocytidylic acid (poly(I:C)), a synthetic analog of dsRNA that triggers caspase-8 activation. We showed that HSVs infection protect epithelial cells from apoptosis induced by poly(I:C). We established that HSV-1 R1 is essential for the protection of HSV-1-infected cells against poly(I:C)-induced caspase-8 activation. HSV R1s interact not only with procaspase-8 but also with the receptor interacting protein 1 (RIP1). The interaction between RIP1 and HSV-2 R1 inhibits the binding of RIP1 to the Toll/interleukine-1 receptor-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon β (TRIF), the adaptor of Toll-like receptor 3 that is an extracellular dsRNA sensor, which is required to activate caspase-8 following extracellular poly(I:C) stimulation and TRIF overexpression. Thus, HSV R1s have the ability to inhibit poly(I:C)-induced apoptosis at several levels by preventing caspase-8 dimerization/activation and TRIF RIP1 interaction. This work sheds light on the ability of HSV R1s to manipulate apoptosis.

1329	"Défis technologiques et pédagogiques rencontrés par des enseignants lors de la mise en place d'un ""projet portable"" dans une école primaire de milieu défavorisé"	During the past decade, the presence of ICT and technology in general has increased significantly in many areas of society. Education was no exception, and MELS has even created a transversal competency for that matter under the Programme de formation de l'école québécoise. ICT integration was made through various means, including computer labs, computers in the classroom and, more recently, by the introduction of ubiquitous computing projects, in which each student and the teacher have their own computer. In order to complete this research project successfully, it has been included within a broader project subsidized by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada. This project is taking place in a disadvantaged community elementary school of Montreal. Ubiquitous computing asks for rigourous planning and ongoing follow-up by teachers, administrative and IT staff. Moreover, such a project obviously presents some technical and pedagogical challenges for teachers. Regarding this matter, three major categories of factors that can impact success of ubiquitous computing projects in education were identified. Those categories can be described as follows : factors that are internal to the teacher (personal matter), factors that are related to work, as well as factors related to infrastructure and equipment. Several concepts, dimensions and indicators are explained in this paper and correlated in order to better understand the challenges that can arise in such projects.  Regarding the methodoly used in this research, three teachers accepted to participate in individual interviews, and also answered an online questionnaire. Furthermore, the e-mails exchanged between the research group and the teachers were also analyzed. All data coming from those three sources was subject to a qualitative analysis. The data analysis showed that the dominating category of factors was the one with factors related to work, by a vast majority. Challenges, however, were identified for all dimensions and categories.

1330	Variabilité stylistique des occupations du Sylvicole moyen ancien (400 av. n.è. – 500 de n.è.) sur la station 3-arrière de Pointe-du-Buisson : approche typologique	This thesis focuses on the variability observed within an assemblage, made up of lithic and ceramic artefacts, that is felt to be representative of the largest collection dominated by an Early Middle Woodland component known in Quebec. The characteristic traits of the pots transported, discarded, and partly manufactured on the station 3-arrière of the Pointe-du-Buisson complex, are apprehended via a holistic understanding of the notion of «style» which includes all aspects of the attributes it covers, i.e. technological, morphological, decorative and functional ones. Thanks to the application of a typological method, a long forsaken approach, at least in eastern north America, whose specific merit resides in its ability to treat the artefact as a whole, behavioural (cognitive and procedural) patterns visible on the decorated rim sherds have been identified. These are intimately related to the decorative techniques used by the makers, and seem to have changed through time as follows: «vertical or simple» type, preceding the more recent «push-pull» and «rocker-stamp» types.  A comparative analysis, based on a sample of sites located in the Upper St-Lawrence and neighbouring regions, has also revealed great similarities between the ceramic assemblage of the Early Middle Woodland component of BhFl-1d’ and those of Vieux-Pont (Eastern Townships, QC), Oka (Ottawa River), Pointe-du-Gouvernement (Upper Richelieu) and Winooski (Lake Champlain area, Vermont) sites. These results argue for the existence of a cultural manifestation that is very closely related to both the Canoe Point and Winooski phases of the Point Peninsula tradition.  Following the aforementioned conclusions and based on others resulting from recent inquiries, further taxonomic considerations have emerged. While a complete overhaul of the Middle Woodland pattern would be premature, rethinking this taxon appears necessary. Therefore, taxa such as Early Horticultural Period (Snow) or Initial Woodland (Wright, Clermont) are revived and discussed since they may prove to be useful in defining more general, but also maybe more appropriate, anthropological traits concerning the populations that lived along the Saint Lawrence River and its tributaries from the Early Woodland to the end of the Late Middle Woodland.

1331	La voix-over dans le cinéma documentaire	This exploratory thesis examines the various practices of voice-over in documentary  film. Questioning the highly heterogeneous nature of voice in the over register, I first discuss  it with respect to the material aspects of sound before examining it’s functions in the  elaboration of documentary discourse. Because this is a new undertaking, I will travel back-  and-forth between the rare studies concerning voice-over–almost exclusively confined to  fiction film (Kozloff, Châteauvert, Boillat)–and works proposing different theoretical and  critical views on the representation of reality in documentary films (Nichols, Niney,  Gauthier). This will help bring to light the specificities of documentay cinema where voice-  over is used less towards the production of a narrative and more towards the articulation of  discourse.    With the help of examples from a range of documentary films, I will show how speech  (both as an occurrence of sound and as a means of producing meaning) is placed over the  images, in a sometimes converging, but sometimes diverging, interdependent relationship.  This will help demonstrate that the specific use of voice-over in documentary film makes  manifest the act of speech of the sensitive, thinking subject who offers, no more no less, than  an interpretation of the world. Also, this thesis is a diptych and needs to be considered in  correspondence with the documentary film D'où, chose étonnante, rien ne s'en suit that  constitutes second part of the work.

1332	Évaluation environnementale de systèmes de construction de cloisons résidentielles : réflexions sur l'adaptabilité et la flexibilité	The introduction of sustainable development brings new environmental concerns on an important Canadian market industry: construction and residential renovation. Not only does the current concept have a considerable impact on the environment, it also can’t follow up with the development of practices, technologies and occupants’ lifestyle. First, a literature review draws a picture of the construction, renovation and demolition industry (CRD) in Canada and it outlines the CRD rubbles management profile. Then a documentary analysis drafts different concept tools that were developed to improve the industry’s performance. They are 3RV-E, ecodesign, sustainable construction and LEED®. The papers review also explores the adaptability and flexibility concepts on the construction sector and on the emerging architectural trend. This approach brings us to the hypothesis that the integration of the adaptability and flexibility criteria to the housing sector will improve the adequacy between the progressive needs of the occupants and the new environmental issues. On a methodological perspective, the simplified lifecycle analysis performed with the Eco-indicator99 overviews the environmental analysis of three types of partition construction. The outcome of this evaluation is that the one with the less environmental impact is the traditional construction with a wooden framework, followed by the construction with an aluminum framework which is adaptable and flexible, and in third place, the construction with a steel framework which is the most harmful to the environment. On the other hand, adding the time factor to this analysis demonstrates that the integration of the adaptability and flexibility criteria brings a number of renovation and life cycles to the product and its components. In the end, these concepts present us with a potential of reducing the impacts of construction and renovation on the environment and that’s an assessment that would need to be approached systematically.

1333	D'objet de risée à symbole de l'Amérique : la télévision à travers le cinéma américain (1970 à 1999)	This analysis examines the multiple representations of the television in the American movie from 1970 to 1999. Four angles have been studied: the television set, the TV viewer, his content and the work environment.  The hypothesis are theses: all the representations are negative, these representations are placed in a particular social context and there is a consensus between intellectuals and cineastes about the cathodic screen. Even if there are similarities between each decade, there is an evolution of the television representation. In the seventies, the cineastes laugh about the television. They show that the content is ridiculous and the TV workers are incompetent. In the eighties, the television is show like a dangerous object. His great popularity allows the owners to use the television as an ideological device. This popularity is used in the nineties like a pretext for the cineaste to talk about the United States over the television. The America’s portrait is negative:  a violent and corrupted country. This analysis also shows that during these years, the same conclusions go through literature and cinema. Finally, this attitude toward television is symptomatic of an intellectual elite forward the popular art.	Movie , United States of America , television , representations	en	4608.0
1334	Qu'est-ce qu'une pensée-cinéma? : retour sur les présupposés de l'analyse figurative	What is a cinematographic thought? A film theorized with images and sounds what it is dealing with. The methodology of film analysis which reveals that close relationship between images, sounds and thought is figurative. It was exposed in Nicole Brenez De la figure en général et du corps en particulier in 1998. First, the analyst must consider that the film is more important than its context. Next, its components shall be understood as elements. Then, those elements are regarded as questions. Finally, the film has to be considered as an interrogation of its subject. However, those four steps aren’t necessarily clear. They lead to a double thought: the film forces the analysis to include elements that are only made visible with the analysis. This double thought goes beyond the film and questions cinema itself. This study’s aim is to prove that a figurative analysis finds its foundations within the history of cinema, and due to these analyses, the changes regarding the construction of the image, editing, and character can be revealed. This methodology lies on an historical and aesthetic study of the cinematographic forms. Those forms are the way cinema thinks. Emerging from this relationship of a form, its expression, and its analysis is a sensitive field of experimentations: a cinematographic thought.

1335	Comparaison de quatre méthodes pour le traitement des données manquantes au sein d’un modèle multiniveau paramétrique visant l’estimation de l’effet d’une intervention	Missing data are common in empirical research and can lead to significant errors in parameters’ estimation. This dissertation in the field of methodological sociology addresses the influence of missing data on the estimation of the impact of a prevention program. The first two sections outline the potential bias caused by missing data and present the theoretical background to describe them. The third section focuses on methods for handling missing data, conventional methods are exposed as well as three recent ones. The fourth section contains a description of the Montreal Longitudinal Experimental Study (MLES) and of the data used. The fifth section presents the analysis performed, it contains: the method for analysing the effect of an intervention from longitudinal data, a detailed description of the missing data of MLES and a diagnosis of patterns and mechanisms. The sixth section contains the results of estimating the effect of the program under different assumptions about the mechanism of missing data and by four methods: complete case analysis, maximum likelihood, weighting and multiple imputation. They indicate (I) that the assumption on the type of MAR mechanism seems to affect the estimate of the program’s impact and, (II) that the estimates obtained using different estimation methods leads to similar conclusions about the intervention’s effect.

1336	"Exploring food choice as social practice :
appreciating the context of family feeding in Kahnawake, Québec, Canada"	Models of individual-behaviour currently represent the dominant understanding of food choice in public health nutrition. This model frames food choice as a dietary intake behaviour rationally decided by individuals in response to multiple personal and environmental determinants. While useful in describing determinants of individual dietary behaviours, the model cannot explain food choice as a social process shaped in relation to  people and places associated with diverse contexts. This thesis presents the Food Choice Practice Framework to explore food choices as social phenomena. Using the concept of social practice, food choice is proposed as an interplay of social structure and agency. The framework provides a means for identifying food choices as activities patterned among, and constituting, day to day life. It furnishes concepts to identify how social structures reinforce routinized food choice activities. Social structure is examined using Giddens' notions of rules and resources and operationalized as: shared systems of meanings, social norms, material resources, and authoritative resources that enable or constrain desired food choices. The empirical work from two studies supports the proposition that food choices are social practices. The first study in the thesis examines food choice practices in families. We identified food choices as five distinct routinized activities integrated among the usual feeding activities of 20 families with young children. The second study elaborated the rules and resources of food choice practices from the study families. We then analyzed how rules and resources could explain both enabled and constrained food choice practices experienced by families in the specific routine of creating regular meals and snacks. Adequate allocative and authoritative resources helped explain enabled routine food choice practices, while challenges could be understood as coming about through limited resources. Rules could constrain or enable food choice practices through sanctioning norms and meanings associated with creating meals. The empirical work supports understanding food choices as routinized activities that are socially structured and which characterize families. According to Giddens' structuration theory routinized practices that endure through time form social institutions. Therefore routinized food choice practices shape characteristic styles of eating patterns in families, as well as contribute to the constitution of families themselves. This understanding identifies new directions for the way food choice is conceptualized in public health. Health Promotion programs designed to improve nutrition are key strategies for the prevention of chronic disease and improvement of population health. Food choices can be approached as shared activities that describe social groups, and explained as socially structured by rules and resources present in the contexts of food choice practice.	nutrition , structure sociale-agence , Giddens , routines , health promotion , nutrition , family food practices , social structure-agency , Giddens , social practice , routines , social context , food choice , public health	en	4569.0
1337	"Effet des changements du ratio alimentaire oméga-3/oméga-6 dans un modèle d’infarctus du
myocarde reperfusé chez le rat"	Apoptosis occurs in the limbic system by a mechanism involving inflammation after a myocardial infarction. Omega-3 are essential fatty acids known for their benefits in cardiovascular health and to reduce inflammation, whereas, omega-6 and their metabolites are more inflammatory. Since these two essential fatty acids are metabolized by the same group of enzymes, the resulting competition would affect the inflammation and thus indirectly the apoptosis. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of different omega-3/6 ratios on the infarct size, inflammation and apoptosis in the limbic system after myocardial infarction. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided randomly between three diet groups containing 1:5, 1:1 and 5:1 omega-3/6 ratios. Rats were fed for two weeks followed by a left anterior descending coronary occlusion for 40 min and by reperfusion time (15 min or 24 h). Infarct size was significantly reduced by 32% and Akt activity, implicated in RISK cardioprotection pathway, enhanced by the 5:1 and 1:1 in comparison to the 1:5 diet ratios. They also reduced TNF-D plasma concentration. In the limbic system, caspase-3 enzymatic activity was doubled in CA1 after 15 min and in CA1 and dentate gyrus (Dg), after 24 h, in the 1:5 compared to 1:1 and 5:1 groups. Caspase-8 enzymatic activity was increased in Dg and capase-9 was enhanced in the CA1 at both reperfusion time in the 1:5 against the 1:1 and 5:1 groups. Conclusion: High omega-3 dietary ratio helps to reduce infarct size, inflammation and to prevent apoptosis in the limbic system.	inflammation , Omega-3/6 ratio , Diet , Myocardial infarction , Apoptosis , Limbic system , Inflammation	en	4564.0
1338	Étude de l’infection lytique du Virus Epstein-Barr dans le développement de tumeurs post-greffe	Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is an opportunistic pathogen in immunocompromised transplant patients. In these patients EBV infection can lead to malignant B-cell lymphoproliferation, called post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD). This thesis project aimed to investigate the role of lytic EBV infection in the genesis of PTLD. The first experimental objective was to provide in vitro proof that EBV could induce productive replication upon acute in vitro infection of B cells. Data obtained through study of viral DNA replication and transcription during the first 96 hours post-infection indicate that lytic infection does occur. These results provided justification for proceeding to the second experimental objective which involved the characterization of an anti-gp350 human-mouse chimeric antibody for its capacity to recognize and neutralize EBV.  Results showed that this antibody did possess neutralization activity. Further study of this anti-gp350 chimeric antibody in SCID mice is necessary in order to evaluate its in vivo efficacy against PTLD.

1339	Perception de la force musculaire et de la distribution du poids lors d’activités motrices chez le sujet sain	Results of recent studies support the idea that perception of force would have an important role in performing functional tasks such as sit-to-stand (STS). However, very few studies have focused on the quantification of the accuracy with which healthy individuals are able to perceive muscular force. Furthermore, no study has assessed the perception of weight-bearing distribution during the STS in healthy individuals. The purpose of this study was to provide evidence on the capacity to perceive muscular force and weight-bearing distribution in simple and complex tasks in healthy individuals. This study was conducted with 31 individuals, divided into two main age groups (<50 years > 60 years). Its first objective was to quantify the errors in perception of force during a static contraction of knee extensors and to compare these errors between young and elderly groups. Results showed that the absolute and raw errors are greater for force levels higher than 50% of maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) and that raw errors are greater in young participants for high force levels. This study’s second objective was to assess the effect of different sensorimotor references on the magnitude of errors of force perception. The results showed that a reference of 50% MVC presented to the participant beforehand or a simultaneous contraction of hand grip muscles reduced the raw and absolute errors of perception at the level of 70% MVC. A third objective was to quantify the errors of perception of weight-bearing distribution during STS and to measure the effect of age on these errors. The results showed that younger and elderly participants have an ability to perceive their weight-bearing distribution with absolute and raw errors varying respectively from 2.9% to 9.4% and from -5.7% to 5.7%. The intra-class correlation coefficient was higher than 0.75 between the weight-bearing distribution produced and that perceived during STS. The results contribute to extend knowledge about perception of force and weight bearing distribution in young and elderly healthy individuals. This data will be used for comparison in studies conducted with hemiparetic individuals in order to assess if the latter have perceptual problems which may explain the recurrent asymmetry they present in functional tasks.	perception , force , weight-bearing distribution , static contraction , sit-to-stand , rehabilitation	en	4558.0
1340	Pauvreté, criminalité et problèmes de santé mentale : une évaluation qualitative et quantitative des interventions communautaires et policières dans un taudis mal famé	"Models of problem-oriented policing and community policing are often shown in opposition to each other. This thesis presents an evaluation of a police crackdown, combining elements of the above mentioned models and aimed at ending disorder outbreaks caused by tenants of a troublesome flophouse. Analyses are based on both qualitative and quantitative evaluations of community and police interventions conducted in a building known as the ""Motel"".  Results obtained through discussions with community organizations, police and neighbourhood residents have lead to better understanding the phases of this police and community operation. They also provided the operation mode on property buyback by a municipal administration and assessed its impact by means of a preventive perspective. The results also helped to acknowledge the importance of flophouses for a number of helpless tenants in this district, but also the reputation that follows. The management process for this category of building is in close correlation with the type of tenants who live there. A field analysis, conducted three years after the operation, has made it possible to identify the type of problems afflicting the majority of tenants living in flophouses that are privately managed. In this case, the problems are linked to mental health.  Results of the quantitative evaluation have demonstrated that intensive patrol surveillance increases residents’ propensity to place 9-1-1 calls and the strategy to reduce disorder in the general neighbourhood by targeting notorious slums has not been particularly conclusive on the site observed."

1341	La razón de los tontos : protagonismo de los grupos subalternos en la formación de una conciencia de unidad nacional en Latinoamérica	This dissertation represents a study of subaltern groups in Latin America focusing mainly on the study of the literary production that these groups inspired but also on the social, ideological and cultural tensions derived from their presence within a nation. These groups, which I identify methodologically as Subaltern Groups, appeared in the literary and political panorama in an uncommon way, originating more from their negativity in relation to the modern project of positivist institutionalization than through the distinct characteristics of their culture. Nevertheless, they went on to become the iconographical symbol of national identity in their respective countries. Although, by definition destined to be forgotten historically, they later became protagonists of the “guiding fictions” forming an awareness of national unity.  The texts chosen for review in this research project reveal, paradigmatically, the reality and modalities of existence of these communities, characterised by their negativity in relation to the norms of modern hegemonic thought within the socio-cultural and political space of Latin America. These texts reveal a deviation in the course of the countries’ historical-discursive evolution with regards to the vision that the new Nation-states’ ideological artisans wished to impose on these groups at the end of the 19th century. In this study, two paradigmatic examples are analysed: that of the Canudos community in Brazil presented in Da Cunha’s Os sertões and that of the gauchos in Argentina, as portrayed in José Hernández’.  The first part of this thesis gives a general outline of the historical and socio-political references corresponding to the ideologies that lead to the modernisation of Latin America. I also put forward critical concepts the analysis of subaltern groups. In the following chapters, I proceed with a close reading of the above-mentioned texts, while considering, at the same time, the necessity of this analysis, the inherent challenges related to the problems as well as the nature of the subject. In this context, the thesis also characterizes the place that subaltern groups hold in the literary representations of their own countries as well as the impact that have had on the development of their nation’s collective imaginary. By reflecting on the data generated by the analysis, the conclusion of this thesis addresses the epistemological and ideological consequences caused by the discursive regime of the Latin-American Nation-state.	subaltern groups , nationalism , Os Sertões , Os Sertões , The war of the end of the world , Brazil , Argentina	en	4538.0
1342	Entre vulnérabilisation et revictimisation : les victimes de traite d'êtres humains face aux politiques nord-américaines	In North America, the fight against human trafficking is of the utmost complexity. In order to tackle the numerous aspects surrounding this phenomenon, States must develop strategies using a holistic, interdisciplinary and long term approach. North American trafficking prevention strategies comprise many deficiencies which cause certain groups of individuals to be more vulnerable. While the measures already in place fail to target the root causes of the phenomenon, many reforms essential to the diminution of those persons ' vulnerability, namely the alleviation of restrictive migration policies, have yet to take place. Similarly, deficiencies existing in protection strategies increase the risks of revictimisation of human trafficking victims. On the one hand, state authorities fail to adequately identify all the victims. On the other hand, some victims, although identified as such, remain without protection, either because it is granted on a conditional basis or because support mechanisms remain insufficient.

1343	Régulation transcriptionnelle du gène HSPG2 codant pour Perlecan et son implication dans l’ostéoarthrite	Recent work has shown an increase of Perlecan production associated with the terminal stage of osteoarthritis (OA). Dr Moreau’s team demonstrated a loss of expression of the transcription factor Pitx1 in osteoarthritis suggesting its putative role as a negative regulator of the HSPG2 gene coding for Perlecan. To study the transcriptional regulation of this gene, promoter fragments were cloned upstream of a luciferase reporter gene and tested in transient transfection assays. Co-transfections with variable quantities of pSI-mPitx1 and with constructs made with fragments of different lengths of the mHSPG2 promoter demonstrated a transcriptional activity and enhancement of this activity in presence of Pitx1, with variable results depending on cell types. In addition, expression analysis by qPCR on transgenic mice osteoblasts that overexpress Pitx1 showed that the overexpression of Pitx1 correlates with an augmentation of p53, a known Pitx1 target and Perlecan expression. The link between Pitx1 and Perlecan is still poorly understood and a clear pathway involving those two players is not yet established. A better understanding of mechanisms regulating normal and pathological transcription of the HSPG2 gene encoding for Perlecan would allow a better comprehension of osteoarthritis development and the putative role of Perlecan in its progression.

1344	Portée et limites de la participation délibérative : le cas de la Commission d'étude sur la gestion de la forêt publique québécoise	This master’s thesis addresses the scope and limits of public participation in the management of natural resources. More precisely, a case study of the Commission Coulombe is made to determine, on one hand, how deliberative participation has encouraged the emergence of new discourses and what the political effects of this recognition were. The theoretical approach underlying the argument made in this dissertation is both discursive and institutional. It is based on Bas Arts and Pieter Leroy’s “political arrangement” notion.  The analysis of the Coulombe Commission reveals that deliberative participation reinforced the legitimacy of state institutions, encouraged the emergence of new concerns and concepts, had effects on the elaboration of rules, policies and programs and fostered – to an extent – a redefinition of the power relations among the actors of Québec’s forest regime. However, its effects on the democratization of public management remain limited. Government officials made use of the Coulombe Commission to reestablish their credibility, to justify unpopular decisions and push forward the principal orientations of their government. Furthermore, the social actors who gained the most power and the issues who became prominent are those who were advantaged by Québec’s political agenda of state modernization.	controverse , discours , institutions , governance , public participation , forest management , deliberation , controversy , discourses , institutions	en	4469.0
1345	Perceptions de néphrologues transplanteurs et référents face à la quantification du risque immunologique global en transplantation rénale	Background: The overwhelming scarcity of organs within renal transplantation forces researchers and transplantation teams to seek new ways to increase efficacy. The Groupe de recherche transdisciplinaire sur les prédicteurs du risque immunologique is attempting to put in place a scientifically precise method for determining the global immunological risk (GIR) of rejection for each patient waiting for a renal transplant. The quantification of the GIR is based on scientific factors, such as biological, immunological, clinical and psychosocial. The precise and global determination of the GIR could change the way patients are selected for renal transplantation. This selection will be based thus on scientific and quantifiable criteria. The advantages of the use of this method for selecting potential allograft recipients could be improvement in the efficacy of the process and the individualization of immunosuppressive therapy. In spite of these numerous advantages, this approach raises several ethical questions to explore with nephrologists working in kidney transplantation.  Aims of the study: The aims of this study is to explore the views of transplant and referring nephrologists on the use of personalized medicine tools to develop a new method for selection potential recipients of a renal allograft. The results of this research could contribute to determine the acceptable use of this method in renal transplantation and to study the link between science and medicine. Methods: Twenty-two semi-directed interviews, using short clinical vignettes, were conducted with nephrologists in the province of Quebec between June 2007 and July 2008. The semi-directed interviews were analyzed qualitatively using the content and thematic analysis method described by Miles and Huberman. Results: The results demonstrate a general acceptance of this approach amongst the participants. Knowledge of each patient’s immunological risk could improve treatment and the post-graft follow-up. On the other hand, the possibility that patients might be excluded from transplantation poses a significant ethical issue. It could be more effective than the method presently used. The method must be validated scientifically, and must leave a role for clinical judgment.  Conclusions: The use of personalized medicine within transplantation must be in the best interests of the patient. However, in spite of the use of such scientific data, a place must be retained for the clinical judgment that allows a physician to make decisions based on medical data, professional expertise and knowledge of the patient. An ethical reflection is necessary in order to focus on the possibility of patients being excluded, as well as on the resolution of the equity/efficacy dilemma.

1346	L'effet des dons des entreprises privées sur les organisations-non-productrices-de-profit : le cas des universités de Montréal	Donations made by private companies seem to have long term effects on the different receiving non profit organizations.  Those companies that want to do what’s best in the communities they support also want to improve their image in those very same communities.  Non profit organizations have to juggle between serving the populations while being accounted for their actions before them at the same time they have to conform to certain conditions that accompany corporate donations.  They have to work in an environment that involves short term financing, numerous accountability measures imposed by donating companies and far from discreet donators.  This results in a business-like identity in non profit organizations that is blurred with corporate discourse, motives and actions.  This study tries to evaluate the impact of corporate donations of students from the four main universities in Montreal.  These students are likely to buy from donating companies as well as working for them.  They also consider themselves more as consumers of university products and services than participants in the development of their institutions.  Therefore, they seem to take on an identity that companies want from them because they are getting a financial return on their donations.

d’amitié des enfants selon la méthode des différences entre jumeaux monozygotes"	This study used the monozygote twin differences method to analyze the links between positive or hostile maternal practices by the mother at 29 months and children’s friendship quality at 6 years of age. This new methodology can control for any possible genes-environment correlations. We also controlled for temperament, weight at birth, gender and socioeconomic status and we tested whether gender moderated the link between variables. Results are unexpected: 1) the twin who received the most positive maternal practices had the friend who evaluated the most negatively their friendship, 2) the twin who received the most hostile practices from his mother had the friend who evaluated the less positively their friendship. We propose different explanations to understand the results and we make suggestions for future studies.

1348	La Grande Guerre dans le cinéma français de 1918 à 1939 : le discours d’une génération	The main focus of this study is based upon the views and opinions on the Great War from the point of views of the soldiers whom fought in the Great War through the medium of French cinema between 1918 and 1939. The objective is to give an alternative perspective of allowing the soldiers to give their point of view of the events and experiences during the four years of the great war of 1914-1918. Using first hand experiences from being on the front line, the filmmaker becomes a historian as he tells the story of the war veterans; the film can then be used as a way to preserve the memory of these events. There has been an omission of these testimonies from official historical documentation and so these films allow for some inaccuracies to be resolved. Meanwhile, the political and social context influences the interpretation of the conflict, giving rise to films or politicized memorials. More broadly, this study examines the continuities and ruptures in the discourse during the period between the two World Wars. It can be seen that fiction can simultaneously be a historical viewpoint of the Great War and a representation of the times, providing a reinterpretation of events.

1349	Turbulences et changements institutionnels au sein de la Société internationale : une perspective historique	Turbulence and institutional changes within the international Society: an historical perspective Our inquiry has its origins in the acknowledgement that the current international society appears, more than ever, deficient and lacking legitimacy in its management of emerging threats which affect its security. This dissertation aims to verify whether the present difficulties to manage the interstate order are precursors of a period of systemic turbulences. We propose as our principal research hypothesis that a loss of legitimacy within the law and order mechanisms of a Westphalian society will generate a rather long period of systemic turbulences, creating a return to an antihegemonic system characterized by the establishment of a new a new system of societal law and order. To test this hypothesis, we have joined the theoretical framework of the English School which observes the interstate relations by assessing the character of the order that governs them. Its followers succeed in studying the forces that create the maintenance of an antihegemonic international environment, and the nature of the interstate reciprocities that emerge from it. Then, by observing the institutions created to manage the law and order, they are in a position to better understand the evolution, the diffusion and the perpetuation of a society of States. This approach allows us to construct an explanatory model of our societal dynamic. In order to answer our initial query, we propose to analyse the status of various international societies from different epochs, each one containing a period of systemic turbulences followed by the return of societal regime. We intend to establish if any analogies can be drawn between their transformative processes, and thus determine whether these processes can be applied to the transformations taking place within the current international society. An historical comparative analysis proves to be an appropriate tool for our type of research. The periods selected for this research are the Thirty Years' War, the Napoleonic Wars, and the First World War including the ‘inter-war’ period.  The antihegemonic nature of a society of States, in addition to maintaining an anarchic environment, creates a climate of rivalries which generate transformation within the law and order dynamic. This transformative factor was introduced under the concept of societal progress, which generates, within the societal law and order mechanisms, institutional obsolescence that can create a period of systemic turbulences. To observe this phenomenon, we have adopted institutions as analytical tools. Institutions will allow us to be more critical, and will facilitate comparisons between them, considering their longevity. Our findings indicate the existence of a lasting dynamic of transformation within Westphalian societies, generating levels of societal turbulences, which vary according to their intensity. We also observed that despite the legal equality that sovereignty provides in a society of States, the Great powers remain the principal architects of their society. Their innate aptitude toward unilateralism was often associated with the emergence of systemic turbulence. Our research shows that interstate interdependence and cooperation were also fuelled by the expansion of a liberal economy. In a societal environment, as interdependence and multilateralism intensify, the propensity for societal progress is more inclined to take the aspect of a progressive type of systemic transformation than of a period of violent revolutionary systemic turbulence. Our international society of States has always been under the influence of societal progress since its inception. Stability of its future is tied to its ability to counter external threats and that of the Great powers’ capacity to limit their propensity to unilateralism. Law and order mechanisms must then be able to integrate societal progress to allow the maintenance of legitimacy and the avoidance of a revolutionary systemic transformation period.

1350	Effets d’un dispositif de formation exploitant des vidéos d’exemples de pratiques sur le développement d’une compétence professionnelle chez des enseignants du primaire	The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of a web-based professional teacher development application called “Zooming in on Teaching Expertise”. More precisely, our aim was to evaluate the effect of a training course entailing examples of practice on video and created within the application. In particular, the study focused on participating elementary school teachers’ learning and their intentions to modify their practice with respect to the professional competency: “To pilot teaching/learning situations”. The education reform that has been progressively introduced since 2001 has been changing the direction of teacher training considerably. Its success relies particularly on the acquisition of new professional competencies that are often difficult to develop for in-service teachers. However, the training methods in place at the start of the reform did not seem to be meeting this need as well as expected. The web-based application used in this research project was developed to support teachers embrace this pedagogical renewal by proposing new training strategies based primarily on the observation and analysis of filmed practices, along with a variety of tools aimed at stimulating reflection on the teaching practice itself. The application emerged along others with a similar nature. Yet, still today, little is known about their effectiveness on the professional development of teachers. To examine these questions, we developed a training course that was then undertaken by six teachers. These teachers also participated in two semi-structured interviews and shared notes taken during training. Grounded in an evaluation based theoretical framework, the following three research questions emerged and were pursued: First, in what ways did the model have an effect on the development of the teacher competency it was intended for? Second, what was its effect on teachers’ intentions to change their practice? And third, in what ways could the professional teacher development application be improved in better supporting teachers’ professional development? This framework was later used to guide the analysis and interpretation of the data collected. A substantial amount of data was collected, enabling us to document and increase our understanding of the role of this web-based video mediated application. This allowed us to confirm the positive effect of online video based professional teacher development applications. In particular, we observed that the teachers were able to define the components of the targeted competency more clearly. The participants confirmed having learned from the video examples and training and expressed the intention to bring change in their own practice. All teachers greatly appreciated the training course and its videos, particularly the opportunity to observe peers who struggled like them, and to explore ways of putting the knowledge into practice in their own classrooms. In addition, the participants’ comments and suggestions helped identify areas for improvement of the application, such as reducing the number of videos and competency elements presented, or increasing the complementary educational content accompanying the videos. These suggestions for improvement should however still be further explored and discussed, and may lead to new research questions and further follow-up studies.

1351	"Analyse fonctionnelle de deux nouvelles mutations récessives de l’AQP2
impliquées dans le diabète insipide néphrogénique par expression dans les
ovocytes de Xenopus laevis"	The autosomal nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) is caused by mutations of the gene coding for the water channel aquaporine-2 (AQP2). An oftenly used model for the study of membrane proteins such as AQP2 is the heterogenous expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Unfortunately, the existing techniques of plasma membranes purification are either too long, too difficult or require too much material, which does not allow adequate analysis of targeting of the native and mutants forms, which is crucial for this type of study. We developed a fast and effective plasma membrane purification technique which combines partial digestion of the vitellin membrane, its polymerization with the plasma membrane followed by a serie of low speed centrifugations to collect the purified membranes. We used this technique to study of two new family cases of heterozygote patients carrying the V24A and R187C mutations in a case and K228E and R187C in the second case. For each mutation, we analyzed the functionality and the parameters of expression of the mutant proteins. The membrane permeability experiments show that the oocytes expressing AQP2- V24A (Pf = 16.3 ± 3.5 x 10-4 cm/s, 10 ng) and AQP2-K228E (Pf = 19.9 ± 7.0 x 10-4 cm/s, 10 ng) have similar activities to the oocytes expressing the native form (Pf = 14.4 ± 5.5 x 10-4 cm/s, 1 ng), while AQP2-R187C (Pf = 2.6 ± 0.6 x 10-4 cm/s, 10 ng) doesn’t seem to have any activity like the un-injected oocytes (Pf = 2.8 ± 1.0 x 10-4 cm/s). The coexpression studies showed an additive effect when AQP2-V24A and -K228E are injected with the native form and an effect being associated with negative dominance when AQP2-R187C was injected with AQP2-V24A, -K228E and the native form. Western blot results confirmed what was observed in the functionality studies. However, when the mutations were expressed in mIMCD-3 cells, there was a slight expression of the K228E mutation to the plasma membrane and a total absence of the mutations –V24A and R187C at the plasma membrane. The results of our studies showed that depending on the expression system the mutations –K228E and -V24A can be used in targeting studies using chemical chaperones.

1352	Caractérisation fonctionnelle du gène AP1S1 mutant associé au syndrome de MEDNIK	Intracellular protein transport between organelles is mainly mediated by clathrin coated vesicles. Clathrin adaptor protein (AP) complexes participate in clathrin coated vesicle formation and in sorting protein cargo. We studied 5 families with MEDNIK syndrome, which is characterized by mental retardation, enteropathy, deafness, neuropathy, ichtyosis and keratoderma. All families affected with this autosomal recessive syndrome originate from an isolated population in the Kamouraska region of Quebec. The candidate genes identified in the positive region were sequenced and a founder mutation was identified in the acceptor splice slice of intron 2 of the AP1S1 gene. This gene encodes for the small subunit σ1 of the complex adaptor 1 (AP1). This splicing mutation leads to a premature stop codon, which is predicted to alter the normal function of this protein. To validate the pathogenic effect of this mutation we blocked the AP1S1 protein translation in zebrafish by injecting an anti-sense oligonucleotide designed against AP1S1. At 48 hours post fertilisation, the knockdown larvae showed reduced pigmentation, perturbation of skin formation, and severe perturbation of motor development and function motor development. Over expression of the human AP1S1 rescued the normal phenotype whereas the expression of the mutant AP1S1 did not. These results show that this mutation is causative for MEDNIK syndrome and demonstrates a critical role of the small subunit σ1 in epidermal organisation and in the development of the spinal cord.

1353	Les caractéristiques de la déviance des adolescentes judiciarisées à Dakar (Sénégal) en comparaison aux adolescentes judiciarisées de Montréal (Canada)	Despite problems caused by juvenile delinquency in Senegal, authorities'answers seem not to be very efficient, in particular with delinquent girls. This study aims to describe the family, the school and the peers of adjudicated adolescent females in Dakar and compare these features with those of adjudicated adolescent females in Montreal. The study occurs in Dakar with thirty adolescent girls interviewed with a questionnaire adapted from the MASPAQ. The similarities between the two samples are the girls' average age, their judiciary status, their socio-economic status which is disadvantaged and their family's structure which is for most of them a single-mother one. The other results describe the social bonds which are stronger for the Senegalese sample whereas the deviant behaviour is more important for the Montreal's girls. The social bonds may serve as a protection against deviance. The cultural context, as it facilitates social control, may also develop more internal constraints, which  constitute another protection against deviant conduct. One possible perspective is to replicate the study using the same questionnaire among samples of male offenders.

1354	Amphilochos : étude sur la légende du héros grec et le sanctuaire oraculaire de Mallos	The Greek hero Amphilochos, the mythical descendant of the famous family of the Melampodides hero-prophets, was, like his father Amphiaraos, a recognized soothsayer and a soldier with formidable military skills. After taking part in the second expedition against Thebes and the Trojan War, he is said to have wandered in many a land and founded several cities lying between Spain and Syria. Soon after his sudden death in a single combat with another seer named Mopsos, he was elevated to the rank of oracular divinity in Mallos of Cilicia, a city which he himself founded. During the Roman period, Amphilochos, indued with increased ontological status, got into high repute in this region where he gave oracles to the pilgrims who came and visited him by themselves in his abode. This research, which aims first to explore exhaustively the legend of Amphilochos, attempts above all to determine the terms of the oracular revelation in the sanctuary of Mallos of Cilicia, in spite of little compelling evidence.

1355	Le discours de guerre tenu aux enfants montréalais au sujet de la Première Guerre mondiale entre 1914 et 1918	Canadian historians have neglected World War I’s discourse of war aimed at Montréal children between 1914 and 1918. Yet, through an analysis of Montréal newspapers, Québec pedagogical magazines, and some governmental publications, it is possible to understand how the war is explained to children.   This thesis aims to highlight the characteristics and objectives of the discourse of war aimed at primary-age children in Montréal. The first chapter focuses on the factual information transmitted to children to determine how the origins of the war were explained to them. We observe the establishment of a triple discourse: a discourse of fear, a reassuring discourse, and a discourse to encourage guilt to sensitize children to the Canadian war effort. The following chapter analyses the principal characteristics of war stories for children. Thus, we will be able to distinguish the objectives of these types of stories. Finally, we will see the role of the child in the discourse of war. We will show how the child in war narratives becomes an actor in the conflict and how the publications use children’s heroic acts.   In this war that stresses the mobilization of the entire population, the discourse is addressed to girls and boys, but especially the latter. The First World War is a rich subject in as much as it serves as a pretext for inculcating children with certain traditional and newer knowledge. It finds its way into children’s daily routines, into their leisure activities and household tasks. Children must develop their patriotism and the “natural” virtues appropriate to their gender: boys must learn to make war and girls to support them.  The discourse of war seeks to draw the child into the Canadian war effort. It stresses a number of new themes not previously part of an ordinary education, such as Belgium’s geopolitical situation. It encourages young Montrealers to become model future citizens who, when the occasion arises, will know how to give their life for their country, but, in the shorter term, it particularly encourages them to participate in the war effort.

1356	BA'S : The practice and law of bankers' acceptance	"When dealing with a BA transaction several types of relationships may develop, some more direct than others. In any given transaction, aside from the customer and bank, there may be one or more participating banks, investment dealers, or multiple investors, who become holders of the BA. The situation may be complex and the legal relationships may become quite intricate. However, it is important to identify whether the relationship is established through the BA instrument, or whether it exists by ordinary contractual relationship or by operation of law. Proper analysis of the surrounding circumstances, the connecting factors, and the obligations and the rights which exist between the parties, will be necessary in determining whether or not the contractual rules of the provinces, or federal law rules apply, and to what extent. Granted, the BA instrument is clearly governed by the Bills of Exchange Act. Any solution introduced to a problem involving a BA must, in principle, respect the inherent nature of the BA as a negotiable instrument, governed by federal law. In the case of BAs, either the Bills of Exchange Act or the Depository Bills and Notes Act will apply to the instrument. Since there are applicable federal rules to BAs, the purpose of our study is to determine if, and under what circumstances, provincial law, such as the Civil Code of Quebec, would find application with respect to BAs and complement the provisions of the Bills of Exchange Act where the statute is silent or ambiguous. The simple solution would be to apply provincial law to those matters not addressed in the Act, as provincial law typically compliments federal legislation. However, the Bills of Exchange Act contains a peculiar provision, namely section 9, which provides: “9. The rules of the common law of England, including the law merchant, save in so far as they are inconsistent with the express provisions of this Act, apply to bills, notes and cheques.” This provision has created confusion as to the appropriate application of Quebec civil law to matters of bills of exchange. Indeed, there is doubt as to whether section 9 is in fact an incorporation by reference that effectively precludes the application of civil law. The problem continues to be a contentious issue in the doctrine and jurisprudence. The ""inexorable character"" of the problem created by the interpretation of this provision has given rise to a number of diverse theories regarding the extent of the applicability of common law to matters of bills of exchange. As we can clearly conclude from a review of the jurisprudence, the courts, for the most part, have been conciliatory to the application of provincial law in issues involving bills of exchange. The majority of judges express a hesitance to jeopardize the integrity of the provincial law as complimentary law in order to accommodate the idea that Parliament's desire was to enact an extensive and far-reaching law of bills and notes. The position of most doctrinal writers is very much the same. The essential question of our analysis is which rules will govern the issues, which emerge within BAs - the Civil Code of Quebec or the common law of England? From a Canadian perspective, understanding which law is applicable to BAs is of paramount importance, since courts are dealing with an increasing amount of banker's acceptance transactions. To answer this question, we will begin with an examination of the origin and evolution of the banker's acceptance. In Chapter Two, we will also analyze the nature and legal character of the BA. This will establish the framework through which we can identify the rules and principles that apply to the various aspects of the BA transaction. In Chapter Three, we examine the mechanics of the BA operation step-by-step, paying close attention to the requirements imposed by legislation. We look at the laws applicable to the BA and describe the various agreements pertaining to the BA. Having examined the legal nature of the BA as being a negotiable instrument governed by federal law and a contract and moveable pursuant to the Civil Code of Quebec, we will proceed in Chapter Four to consider the applicability of provincial law to aspects of the BA transaction. To this end, we examine different approaches to understanding the Bills of Exchange Act, particularly the problematic section 9, as well as the applicable law as understood in Quebec jurisprudence during the past century. Judges and jurists alike have attempted to understand what was meant when the legislator stated in section 9, ""[t]he rules of the common law of England, including the law merchant, save in so far as they are inconsistent with the express provisions of this Act, apply to bills, notes and cheques."" Is this section to be interpreted literally, requiring us to apply English common law to every issue that might arise in connection with bills and notes? Does Parliament intend this provision to apply equally to Quebec, whose private law is based on the civil law system? Our study will look to interpretive approaches offering a variety of different solutions to the problem of section 9. Finally, given new legislative developments, in Chapter Five, we offer a proposed method to determine the law applicable to various aspects of the BA transaction. Our analysis has lead us to adopt the result advocated by the majority of jurists, but with the recognition that our approach to section 9 is based on reasons of policy. We have adopted the strict/wide dichotomy, (as a negotiable instrument on the one hand, and as a specie of contract and property on the other hand) realizing the difficulties inherent in determining where one ends and the other begins. Therefore, in our opinion there exist two solutions. Firstly, there is the possibility that section 9 could be repealed. In this case, all matters not expressly dealt with in the Act would fall to be governed by provincial law, as is the case with other federal legislation. In these situations, Quebec civil law takes on a suppletive role in applying a federal law in Quebec. Secondly, there is the possibility of modifying rather than repealing section 9. Incorporating the strict/wide dichotomy into section 9 itself seems to us to be a more preferable solution. The provision could read, ""The rules of the common law of England, including the law merchant, save in so far as they are inconsistent with the express provisions of this Act, apply to bills, notes and cheques in a strict sense. For greater certainty, bills and notes in a strict sense include the form, issue, negotiation and discharge of bills, notes and cheques."" Alternatively, a Law Reform Commission could draft an Act that defines section 9 according to the strict /wide dichotomy. These types of changes would prove to be an important step to clarifying the law, and strike the appropriate balance between the application of federal and provincial law to bankers' acceptances."

1357	La responsabilité des intermédiaires techniques en droit pénal canadien, à la lumière des pratiques internationales	Criminal liability of technical intermediaries is a central and actual issue in the regulation of cyberspace. Not also their vast economic implications in the cyberspace are in question, but also their entire legal framework regarding criminal liability of technical intermediaries is an unresolved issue. This is because a liability allegation to the author for an illicit activity can be difficult or impossible thanks to the complex nature of cyberspace and the insolvent status of the technical intermediaries Considering their state of solvency and identification facility, taking legal actions against the technical intermediaries will be a conceivable solution to the jurists. Having implied legal proceedings, even the fact that a judicial action will be taken against them will prevent them from involving illicit activities. Non-existence of a liability regime which is specifically applicable to the technical intermediaries in the Canadian legislative corpus makes us obligated to apply to the «guiding principles» of imputability which can be released from several national and international texts. In this essay, we will study, at first, the conditions of applicability of the criminal liability for the technical intermediaries with regard to Canadian Criminal Law and, in second time, will answer the following question: Is Canadian Criminal Law complied with guiding principles arising from International norms and practice in terms of imputability of the technical intermediaries?

1358	Ethical Principles as a Guide in Implementing Policies for the Management of Food Allergies in Schools	Food allergy in children is a growing public health problem that carries a significant risk of anaphylaxis such that schools and child care facilities have enacted emergency preparedness policies for anaphylaxis and methods to prevent the inadvertent consumption of allergens. However, studies indicate that many facilities are poorly prepared to handle the advent of anaphylaxis and policies for the prevention of allergen exposure are missing essential components. Furthermore, certain policies are inappropriate because they are blatantly discriminatory. This article aims to provide further guidance for school health officials involved in creating food allergy policies. By structuring policies around ethical principles of confidentiality and anonymity, fairness, avoiding stigmatization, and empowerment, policy makers gain another method to support better policy making. The main ethical principles discussed are adapted from key values in the bioethics and public health ethics literatures and will be framed within the specific context of food allergy policies for schools.

1359	La gouvernance des projets d’architecture : une typologie de la multi-organisation temporaire	Traditional approaches to ethics in architecture have focused on three characteristics of the object: durability, convenience and beauty (firmitas, utilitas and venustas). On the other hand, recent knowledge derived from the fields of project management and sustainable development has made significant contributions to the understanding of project governance. However, the relationships of governance within architectural projects are linked to the characteristics of the construction industry, a sector that operates through the creation of temporary teams formed by highly specialized organizations. We present in this article some of these characteristics and their influence on the relations between project participants. A systems approach based on the review of case studies helps us identify the complexity of the temporary teams involved in archi- tectural projects. The identification of various types of organizational configurations highlights some ethical issues related to formal and informal relationships between stakeholders and those between the architect and complex construction clients. We argue that the architect is faced with the challenge of working on an architectural project that is —increasingly— the subject of negotiation between stakeholders. Faced with this challenge, it is crucial for the architect to understand the complexity of the relationships between participants within the project social system and to create the appropriate mechanisms of participation, negotiation and exchange between them.	architecture	en	4341.0
1360	Imagining Others	It is often argued that the ability to imagine what others think and feel is central to moral functioning. In this paper, I consider to what extent this is true. I argue that neither the ability to think of others as having representational mental states, nor the ability to imagine being in their position, is necessary for moral understanding or moral motivation. I go on to argue that the area in which thinking about others’ thoughts and feelings appears to play the largest role is that of supererogatory actions. Being able to get on well with others seems to be importantly predicated on our ability to think about their thoughts and feelings and being able to take up their perspective. However, when it comes to grosser moral norms and restrictions, such as harm norms, there is little reason to think that thinking about others’ thoughts and feelings plays a central role in understanding such norms or being motivated by them.	imagination	en	4326.0
1361	Zone d'attente pour personnes en instance : une ethnographie de la détention frontalière en France	This ethnographic study of border detention in France investigates how, in response to trends in transnational migration, borders are governed through practices such as the confinement and deportation of foreign migrants. In particular, the increasing prominence of camps or other restricted areas in which migrants or illegal aliens are held for varying lengths of time highlight a new distribution of power, defined by access to mobility. Focusing on a specific form of control – the “waiting zone” at an airport's borders – this empirical study offers an in depth meditation on this power dynamic, which reflects, in itself, another political topography of globalization. The research investigates how democratic governments manage non citizen populations, and examines the ways in which the types of restriction and surveillance brought to bear on these people reconfigure physical, moral and political boundaries. The ethnographic components of the study seek to explore the everyday experience of the people who become subject to these tangled legal and humanitarian procedures. The research interweaves several key issues which shape policy on border detention: confinement, albeit in a humanitarian form, constructed through judicial activism and the administrative application of different standards of rights for various alien populations; the conflation of humanitarian care and control for populations identified as vulnerable; the redrawing of frontiers through networks and zones; and, lastly, the experience of mobility produced by the differential management of movement within the modern archipelagos of surveillance, of which waiting zones are part.

1362	"Modèle informatique du coapprentissage des ganglions de la base et du cortex :
l'apprentissage par renforcement et le développement de représentations"	Throughout lifetime, the brain develops abstract representations of its environment that allow the individual to maximize his benefits. How these representations are developed while trying to acquire rewards remains a mystery. It is reasonable to assume that these representations arise in the cortex and that the basal ganglia are playing an important role in reward maximization. In particular, dopaminergic neurons appear to code a reward prediction error signal. This thesis studies the problem by constructing, using machine learning tools, a computational model that incorporates a number of relevant neurophysiological findings.  After an introduction to the machine learning framework and to some of its algorithms, an overview of learning in psychology and neuroscience, and a review of models of learning in the basal ganglia, the thesis comprises three papers. The first article shows that it is possible to learn a better representation of the inputs while learning to maximize reward. The second paper addresses the important and still unresolved problem of the representation of time in the brain. The paper shows that a time representation can be acquired automatically in an artificial neural network acting like a working memory. The representation learned by the model closely resembles the activity of cortical neurons in similar tasks. Moreover, the model shows that the reward prediction error signal could accelerate the development of the temporal representation. Finally, it shows that if such a learned representation exists in the cortex, it could provide the necessary information to the basal ganglia to explain the dopaminergic signal. The third article evaluates the explanatory and predictive power of the model on the effects of differences in task conditions such as the presence or absence of a stimulus (classical versus trace conditioning) while waiting for the reward. Beyond making interesting predictions relevant to the timing literature, the paper reveals some shortcomings of the model that will need to be resolved.  In summary, this thesis extends current models of reinforcement learning of the basal ganglia and the dopaminergic system to the concurrent development of representation in the cortex and to the interactions between these two regions.

1363	Établissement des travailleurs immigrants sélectionnés au Québec : mobilité professionnelle et présence en emploi qualifié au cours des premières années suivant l’arrivée	"Studies on the adequacy between the level of education of individuals and that required for the job held have rarely addressed the temporal dimension of this relationship. Moreover, few have addressed the issue among Canadian immigrants, and fewer still for skilled workers in Quebec. One study examining the subject from a longitudinal perspective has been identified, but is limited to the access of skilled workers to a first job corresponding to their skill level. This thesis seeks to go beyond the first transitions to the labour market and aims to better understand the evolution of the relationship between education and employment over the course of settlement. More specifically, the objective is to better define the progression of this relationship during the first years after the migrant’s arrival, to identify its determinants, but also to see the impact of this relationship on other dimensions of job quality: socio-economic status and salary.   This thesis considers the contribution of sociological and economic theories in order to better understand the determinants of having jobs that match one’s level of skills and jobs for which the individual is over-educated, as well as their respective impacts on employment status and salary. On the one hand, various theories disagree regarding the temporary or permanent nature of over-education. In so doing, they highlight the potential impact of past job experiences on the job course and the need for a longitudinal view of labour market integration. On the other hand, other approaches underline, in addition to individual determinants, the role of the social and institutional context in which the individual belongs.   These different approaches are reflected in the empirical perspective of the life course that allows us to consider the interrelationship between micro, meso and macro social factors and to represent individual histories through time. Data from the ""Enquête sur les travailleurs sélectionnés"" (ETS) includes both administrative data on the pre-migration situation of immigrant workers, as well as information on each job held after migration, making possible the study of pathways into employment for this immigrant category which is selected based on its potential for integration into Quebec society. The analysis was conducted in three phases, including a description of the relationship between educational attainment and employment, the study of the determinants of the education-job relationship and finally, the study of wages and the effect of the education-job relationship on them. Each of these three components is presented in the form of articles ready to be submitted for publication.   The results show that the proportion of individuals in jobs that match their skill level increases with time spent in the host society. However, over-education is a phenomenon present among the skilled worker immigration category. As such, the first job experiences are critical since they have an impact not only on the evolution of the relationship between education and employment, but also on wages and the socio-economic status of jobs obtained by new immigrants.  The selection grid, a central element of the process through which a candidate can become an immigrant in Quebec, also helps shape the job course through the attributes of the individuals that it retains. Region of origin distinguishes immigrants as well, all things being equal. Most groups are disadvantaged when compared to their counterparts from Western Europe and the United States, and this disadvantage persists over the years.   This thesis has shown that economic integration and the education-job relationship are topics to be addressed from a longitudinal perspective in order to understand the complexity of the processes at work. At the social level, analyses have demonstrated the importance of looking at the services offered to immigrants to help them establish economically, especially in a context where retirements and massive labour shortages are expected to happen."

1364	La microfinance au coeur d'une géographie du genre renouvelée au Mexique?	The development of societies around the world is influenced by dynamics of social power. From a perspective of gender, patriarchal relationships often shape development by influencing differential access to resources, including space and mobility. Mexico, historically characterized by both patriarchy and endemic poverty, has been home to a wide range of development strategies addressing gendered inequality. Most recently, microfinance programs have become an instrument of choice for confronting female marginalization and gender inequality. The scientific literature reveals important gaps in the study of gendered relationships in households which benefit from microfinance. Several studies address the impact of microfinance on the lives of women, but few offer a holistic vision that views microfinance as a tool of development promising to shift the spatial nature of gendered inequality. This research is based on qualitative comparative case studies of microfinance groups in San Miguel Tenextatiloyan and Émilio Carranza, two communities of the Sierra Norte de Puebla (Mexico). Its primary objective is to evaluate the degree to which microfinance programs have changed the place of the women in society. To answer this issue, a portrait of the spatial organization of gender is presented, and then the impacts of microfinance programs on the place of women in domestic, work and community spaces is assessed. The results of the study indicate that microfinance programs have not changed substantially the place of women in society. Rather the research finds that, in a context of poverty, microfinance stabilizes households, but does not lead to a clear amelioration of the material circumstances of women’s lives. Secondly, the findings demonstrate that the tasks associated with social reproduction – largely assumed by women – provide a structural barrier to female empowerment that microfinance alone cannot fully confront.

1365	La eficacidad de los cursos de ELE : la percepción de los usuarios de L1/L2	The purpose of this research is to study the efficiency of Spanish courses from a Heritage Learner’s perspective. This qualitative study examines Hispanics who have learned Spanish at home, in elementary school, in high school, in CEGEP and/or in university. The participants answered a questionnaire that allowed them to express their perception of the Spanish courses that they had taken in their past. The results of this research indicate that L1/L2 users are not integrated in the Spanish classes. Participants demonstrate a reduced sense of motivation for the continuation of these types of courses. Gardner (1985) explains in his socio-educational model theory that language acquisition occurs in a specific cultural context and is influenced by cultural beliefs and individual differences. The latter are integrated in the concept of integrative motive, which is composed of the integrativeness, the attitude toward the learning situation and motivation. The answers given by the participants of this study may be of great help in the design and development of Spanish courses and books for L1/L2 users. By considering their views, students would have a higher sense of integration; an important factor that motivates students to pursue the study of Spanish.

1366	Analyse bayésienne et classification pour modèles continus modifiés à zéro	Zero-inflated models, both discrete and continuous, have a large variety of applications and fairly well-known properties. Some work has been done on zero-deflated and zero-modified discrete models. The usual formulation of continuous zero-inflated models -- a mixture between a continuous density and a Dirac mass at zero -- precludes their extension to cover the zero-deflated case. We introduce an alternative formulation of zero-inflated continuous models, along with a natural extension to the zero-deflated case. Parameter estimation is first studied within the classical frequentist framework. Several methods for obtaining the maximum likelihood estimators are proposed. The problem of point estimation is considered from a Bayesian point of view. Hypothesis testing, aiming at determining whether data are zero-inflated, zero-deflated or not zero-modified, is also considered under both the classical and Bayesian paradigms. The proposed estimation and testing methods are assessed through simulation studies and applied to aggregated rainfall data. The data is shown to be zero-deflated, demonstrating the relevance of the proposed model.  We next consider the clustering of samples of zero-deflated data. Such data present strong non-normality. Therefore, the usual methods for determining the number of clusters are expected to perform poorly. We argue that Bayesian clustering based on the marginal distribution of the observations would take into account the particularities of the model and exhibit better performance. Several clustering methods are compared using a simulation study. The proposed method is applied to aggregated rainfall data sampled from 28 measuring stations in British Columbia.

1367	Facteurs de risque de chutes chez les aînés vivant dans la communauté et ayant recours aux services de soutien à domicile : covariables dépendantes du temps et événements récurrents	Falls in the elderly represent a major problem. It is therefore not surprising that the identification of factors that may increase the risk of falls has received much attention. Frailer seniors who need support to live in the community remained nonetheless poorly documented, although more recently, the Québec authorities have given high priority to interventions that target this population. Risk factors for falls are usually identified by observational prospective studies. Their optimal identification is however complicated by the fact that exposure may vary during the follow-up, and that an individual may experience more than one event. Twenty years ago, some researchers attempted to sensitize their peers in this respect, but their efforts were vain. Researchers continue today to neglect these considerations and to use improper statistical techniques, focusing on the proportion of fallers or the time to first fall. In doing so, we discard a significant amount of relevant information. In this thesis, we review the existing methods and propose a Cox hazards extension. We apply it in the study of potential fall-risk factors associated with 959 community-dwelling seniors using home-care services. Finally, we compare the results of the proposed Wei, Lin, & Weissfeld (WLW) method with those of several other techniques, notably the conventional logistic regression, the pooled logistic regression, the negative binomial regression and the Andersen & Gill regression. At baseline and every six months thereafter, participants were visited at home in order to ascertain information about potential risk factors. Falls were monitored by use of a calendar and monthly phone calls. Baseline exposure variables and updated time-varying exposures include socio-demographic characteristics, BMI, nutritional risk, gait and balance, alcohol consumption, home hazards, and medications. Almost all (99.6%) of participants showed at least one high risk factor. Exposure to multiple risks was frequent, with an average of 2.7 different high-risk factors per participant. The risk factors significantly associated to the risk of falling include male sex, age, history of falling, Berg balance score, BMI, use of benzodiazepines, number of home hazards and residential facility for seniors. Results demonstrate that the usual methods of analyzing risk factors for falling (any sort of fall as well as those leading to medical consultations) are inappropriate, as they produce considerable biases relative to the WLW model using time-dependent covariates. Bias for the considered effect measures comes from the manner in which the observed data (both measured exposures and health outcomes) was measured and defined as well as the way in which the statistical analysis took into account this information. An additional part of the thesis was undertaken to identify risk profiles of subjects regarding the recurrence of falling, defined as participants who reported at least two falls within six months of initial assessment at entry in the study. A classification and regression tree analysis classified the population into five groups differing in risk of recurrent falling, based on history of falls in the three months prior to the initial interview, Berg balance score, type of housing, and usual alcohol consumption in the six months preceding study entry. The relative risks varied from 0.7 to 5.1. A subsequent survival analysis showed that the length of time before becoming a recurrent faller varies among risk profiles. This thesis discusses highly topical subjects about a target population and a fall-risk screening activity which are priorities in the public health sector in Québec. We encourage researchers interested in the identification of risk of falls among the elderly to use the statistical method of Wei, Lin and Weissfeld because it takes into account updated time-varying exposures and multiple events. More research will be necessary to determine the best screening test for a given risk-factor in this setting and population.	benzodiazépines , chutes accidentelles , Accidental falls , Cox model , elderly , environmental hazards , home care services , multiple classification analysis , gait and balance , public health intervention , risk factors , survival analysis	en	4286.0
1368	L'influence des traumas psychologiques sur l'intervention en toxicomanie	"It is possible that the substance abuse disorder for which a person consults is associated with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Several authors believe that there is a link explaining this co-morbidity. For this reason, several hypotheses have been formulated to explain this link as the substance abuse disorder (SUD) prior to PTSD, vulnerability following the SUD and selfmedication. Moreover, research shows the various interventions to help people struggling with these twin problems. The first is to separate the two issues while the second includes PTSD and the SUD. Research advice a more integrated treatment, there will be a presentation of one of these forms of treatment called ""Seeking Safety"". The academic component of our apprenticeship was to understand the link between the SUD, psychological trauma and PTSD and the various forms of interventions to help people with this co-morbidity. We used a module of ""Seeking Safety"" recently translated in French to ensure its implementation and its assessment from five users of the Centre Dollar-Cormier-Institut universitaire sur les dépendances who experienced trauma in their lives. In conclusion of the study, it is clearly shown that different assumptions are present in the reality of people with PTSD and SUD and an integrated response has positives for both the user and for the speaker."

1369	Espace et récit : l’inscription des temps dans la ville : parcours stochastiques chez Julio Cortázar	"From the shift of contemporary literature towards labyrinthine, fragmentary self expression, emerges a meaningful correspondence between the characters of a narrative and the spaces they inhabit : spaces as multiple and discontinuous figures inscribed in history and myth.  This interactive construction linking place and subject renders space of primary significance and in so doing, redefines the importance of time in the act of writing.  Time does not unfold only in ""what is told"", as Ricoeur suggests, but in the successive layers of its inscription in place: which is lived through the combining art of experimentation with attachment to place. The expression of the subject of the narrative emerges from the continual and imperfect project of the subject to locate himself in the city, in those places with which he identifies and which construct him.  Through three texts by writer Julio Cortázar, time will be considered as a modality of “accumulatable” fragments, inscribed in significant places, from which a consciousness emerges through the city's porousness and its capacity for leaps and passageways.  What connects the architectonic spaces and the imprint of time within them and a subject who must express himself to exist and create narratives to unify the discontinuous parts of his being, will emerge through ""becoming in action"", the addition of narrative and real life experience in Cortazarian figures of experimentation, play, passageway et language.   Herein a dynamic specific to the city emerges in the creative act that fulfills and guides the subject: his plural singularity."

1370	L’extinction de l'extension juridique des conventions collectives dans le secteur manufacturier au Québec : le cas de l'industrie du vêtement	  In November 1999, the Government of Quebec has adopted the bill 47 related to the Act respecting conditions of employment in certain sectors of the clothing industry which amended the Act respecting labour standards (1999, c. 57). On June 30 2000, after the bill came into force, the four (4) sectoral decrees regulating the terms of employment of approximately 23,000 workers in apparel production were repealed (leather glove, men’s and boy’s shirt, men’s wear and ladies’s garment).  This research demonstrates that even if in line with the deregulation logical of the government aiming to foster competitiveness, the continuation of replacement standards for the decrees in the Quebec’s clothing industry does not stem for all that from a fully neo-liberal deregulation. In a more academic view, the surveyed labour standards plan’s emergence and fate reveal the political nature of the wage rule determination process, legislative or contractual. This dynamics is based on the changeable characteristic of the power relationship and influence of the institutionnal actors involved in the legislative regulation where the State is destined to play an enabler role – and not as an independent referee – in regard of the pressures resulting of the wage labour relationship and the production mode in which this one is embedded.

1371	Étude utilisant le DSM-IV et le CBCL qui porte sur le trouble des conduites et la maladie affective bipolaire chez des adolescents admis à l’Institut Philippe-Pinel de Montréal	We conducted our internship in criminology at the Youth Program of the Philippe-Pinel Institute of Montreal. Our sample consists of 106 adolescents suffering from a conduct disorder (CD) in association, or not, with an attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD)or a bipolar disorder (BPD). A rising amount of research agrees that BPD can have an atypical presentation in a juvenile population, which explains why it is rarely diagnosed in youths and is often mistaken as a severe ADHD or an aggressive CD in irritable, impulsive and aggressive juvenile delinquents. Some clinicians evoke the possibility that these delinquents may suffer from a dysphoric conduct disorder, which is described as a type of CD associated with a typical (adult) or an atypical (juvenile) BPD. Through an eight years retrospective study, we evaluated the prevalence of a possible juvenile BPD in adolescents with a CD. In order to do so, we compared the characteristics noted in delinquents suffering from a BPD diagnosed from the DSM-IV to the characteristics of delinquents with a potential juvenile BPD identified on the basis of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Furthermore, we evaluated the possibility that a dysphoric conduct disorder can be identified among juvenile delinquents admitted to the Institute for evaluation. To identify symptoms of juvenile bipolar disorder, we used the Child Behavior Checklist(CBCL) from Achenbach (1991). A meta-analysis conducted by Mick and coll. (2003)establish that a significant score on three subscales – anxious/depressed, attention problems, and aggression – would assist in detecting a BPD in a juvenile population. We rated these three subscales according to the adolescents’ chart recorded during the evaluation period (60 days) at the Institute before calculating an inter-judges reliability on the behaviors included into these three subscales. In our sample of delinquents, the official prevalence of BPD (5,7%) is similar to the one identified in a representative sample of adolescents, whereas the prevalence of juvenile BPD (18,9%) is similar to the one identified in juvenile delinquents in detention facilities. The delinquents diagnosed with a BPD and those suffering from a potential juvenile BPD present several individual, familial, social, and psychiatric characteristics generally met by young delinquents with a juvenile BPD in clinical researches. Almost all of them were diagnosed with an ADHD, presented severe long term conduct problems, school difficulties, relational issues as well as aggressive and impulsive behaviors. Without questioning the diagnosis issued at the end of the evaluation or concluding that a dysphoric CD exists, it seems that a group of irritable, impulsive, and young delinquents suffering from ADHD and presenting aggressive behaviors since their childhood, present many characteristics encountered in delinquents suffering from juvenile BPD in clinical researches. In addition, those characteristics are also often recognized in juvenile delinquents diagnosed with an ADHD (DSM-IV), suggesting that (typical and atypical)BPD is under-diagnosed in juveniles and that behavioral disturbances, aggressiveness and irritability are considered as symptoms of an ADHD and/or a CD.	adolescent , CBCL , DSM	en	4233.0
1372	Factor Analysis of a Large DSGE Model	We study the workings of the factor analysis of high-dimensional data using artificial series generated from a large, multi-sector dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model. The objective is to use the DSGE model as a laboratory that allow us to shed some light on the practical benefits and limitations of using factor analysis techniques on economic data. We explain in what sense the artificial data can be thought of having a factor structure, study the theoretical and finite sample properties of the principal components estimates of the factor space, investigate the substantive reason(s) for the good performance of di¤usion index forecasts, and assess the quality of the factor analysis of highly dissagregated data. In all our exercises, we explain the precise relationship between the factors and the basic macroeconomic shocks postulated by the model.

1373	Études structurales d’interactions protéine/protéine impliquées dans l’érythropoïèse	Hematopoietic development is regulated through a combinatorial interplay between lineage-specific activators and the general transcription machinery that enables cell-specific patterns of gene expression. This thesis reports structural and functional studies of interactions involving the transcativation domains (TAD) of activators proteins and their role in hematopoietic development. Interactions between the TAD of activators and their partners play an important role in the transcriptional regulation of all genes including those regulating hematopoiesis. The first section reports the identification and characterization of a novel interaction between the erythroid transcription factor GATA-1 and the tumor suppressor protein p53. Using a combination of isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), NMR spectroscopy and in vivo studies, we identified and characterized the direct interaction between these two important transcription factors in an attempt to determine the role of this interaction in erythroid development. Based on our results, the TAD of p53 directly interacts with the DNA-binding domain of GATA-1 in a cell-type specific manner. Through this interaction, GATA-1 inhibits activation of select p53-regulated genes and we postulate that the inhibition of p53-dependent apoptotic pathways is essential for survival of erythroid precursor cells. In the second section, we report on the interactions between two acidic TADs and the general transcription factor IIH (TFIIH). The structure of the complexes formed by the Tfb1/p62 subunit of TFIIH (Tfb1PH/p62PH) and the acidic TAD of Herpes Simplex viral protein 16 (VP16) and the Erythroid Krüppel-like factor (EKLF) were determined by NMR spectroscopy. The structure of the Tfb1PH/VP16 complex demonstrated that a viral TAD has the ability to mimic the actions of the TAD from the human p53 with Tfb1PH/p62PH. The TADs of both VP16 and p53 adopt a 9-residue α-helix in complex with Tfb1PH/p62PH. Interestingly, the NMR structure of the EKLF/Tfb1PH complex demonstrated that despite sharing a common binding site with p53 and VP16 on Tfb1PH, the EKLF/Tfb1PH binding interface is distinctly different from the binding interfaces we previously observed with p53/Tfb1PH and VP16/Tfb1PH complexes. Surprisingly, EKLF adopted a similar binding mechanism as the general transcription factor TFIIEα in interaction with p62PH as both interact in an extended conformation. Moreover, based on our structural data, we have identified Trp73 as a key residue within the TAD of EKLF that is required for the formation of the EKLF/Tfb1PH complex. Mutations of Trp73 disrupted the binding to Tfb1PH/p62PH and significantly reduced the transcriptional activity of EKLF in red blood cells.

1374	Spectro-imagerie optique à faible flux et comparaison de la cinématique Ha et HI d'un échantillon de galaxies proches	A new EMCCD (Electron multiplying Charge Coupled Device) controller is presented. It allows the EMCCD to be used for photon counting by drastically taking down its dominating source of noise : the clock induced charges. A new EMCCD camera was built using this controller. It has been characterized in laboratory and tested at the observatoire du mont Mégantic. When compared to the previous generation of photon counting cameras based on intensifier tubes, this new camera renders the observation of the galaxies kinematics with an integral field spectrometer with a Fabry-Perot interferometer in Ha light much faster, and allows fainter galaxies to be observed. The integration time required to reach a given signal-to-noise ratio is about 4 times less than with the intensifier tubes. Many applications could benefit of such a camera: fast, faint flux photometry, high spectral and temporal resolution spectroscopy, earth-based diffraction limited imagery (lucky imaging), etc. Technically, the camera is dominated by the shot noise for flux higher than 0.002 photon/pixel/image.  The 21 cm emission line of the neutral hydrogen (HI) is often used to map the galaxies kinematics. The extent of the distribution of the neutral hydrogen in galaxies, which goes well beyond the optical disk, is one of the reasons this line is used so often. However, the spatial resolution of such observations is limited when compared to their optical equivalents. When comparing the HI data to higher resolution ones, some differences were simply attributed to the beam smearing of the HI caused by its lower resolution. The THINGS (The HI Nearby Galaxy Survey) project observed many galaxies of the SINGS (Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxies Survey) project. The kinematics of THINGS will be compared to the kinematic data of the galaxies obtained in Ha light. The comparison will try to determine whether the sole beam smearing is responsible of the differences observed. The results shows that intrinsic dissimilarities between the kinematical tracers used are responsible of some of the observed disagreements. The understanding of theses differences is of a high importance as the dark matter distribution, inferred from the rotation of the galaxies, is a test to some cosmological models.

1375	Les processus décisionnels de l’intervention militaire au Canada (1990-2003) : une approche réaliste néoclassique	The decision to intervene militarily or not in a conflict is certainly one of the most important a government can take. These decisions are extremely significant financially, politically and socially costly. The research presented in this document analyzes decision-making processes in Canada during the Gulf War, the war in Afghanistan and the war in Iraq. Canada is a very interesting case to study because despite its middle power status, it took part in seven armed conflicts since September 1867. This research will therefore try to identify the reasons for Canada to invest financial and human resources in some conflicts, while it chooses not to get involved in others. Some theories of international relations argue that the defence policy of states is guided by the desire to maximize their power on the international stage. Other theories will instead focus on values or norms internalized by states, or their integration into international institutions. These different assumptions raise the importance of internal and external factors, but do not tell which will prevail. Thus, using a neoclassical realism model of decision making synthesizing these two factors, it will be possible to determine which internal (internal policy constraints, perceptions of managers) or external factors (Canada's relative position in the international system) dominate in the decision to go to war.

1376	L’asphyxie en médecine légale : une étude rétrospective de six ans sur les suffocations non-chimiques au Québec	Suffocation is a general term that encompasses several forms of asphyxia generated by a deprivation of oxygen. It includes different subtypes such as environmental suffocation/ entrapment, choking, smothering and traumatic/ positional asphyxia. In the forensic literature, suffocation has been the object of several papers, but mainly case reports or cases series. Studies of subsets of suffocation deaths, limited to a specific scenery or category, have also been reported, such as suffocation in motor vehicle collisions. Nonetheless, there are still several areas of forensic pathology mainly based on tradition, with textbook explaining and describing common knowledge that is not supported by modern research data: suffocation makes no exception. The present project is intended to contribute to evidence-based data on non-chemical suffocation deaths. It comprises a 6-year retrospective study of all non-chemical suffocation cases in the forensic victim population of Quebec. As far as we know, this is the first paper to ever portray a systematic study of non-chemical suffocation deaths in forensic setting. In general, the results are concordant with the textbook literature, therefore supporting common knowledge related to manner of death in non-chemical suffocation. However, discrepancies have been underscored in smothering. Furthermore, the classification of asphyxia and the definitions of subtypes, such as suffocation, are far from being uniform, varying widely from one textbook to another and from one paper to the next. Unfortunately, similar research designs can lead to totally different results depending on the definitions used. Closely comparable cases are classified differently by equally competent forensic pathologists. Therefore, the present project highlights the discrepancies between textbook classifications and tries to draw mainstream definitions, in order to propose a more unified classification of asphyxial deaths.

1377	The role of the peptidyl prolyl isomerase Rrd1 in the transcriptional stress response	Transcriptional regulation is a complex process that has evolved over millions of years of evolution. Cells have to sense environmental conditions and adapt to them by altering their transcription. Herein, we study the role of rapamycin, an immunosuppressant and anticancer molecule that mimics cellular starvation. To understand how the action of rapamycin is mediated, we analyzed gene deletion mutants in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae that have an altered response to this drug. Deletion of RRD1, a gene encoding a peptidyl prolyl isomerase, causes strong resistance to rapamycin and this was associated with a role of Rrd1 in the transcriptional response towards rapamycin. The main focus of my PhD was therefore to unravel the role of Rrd1 in response to rapamycin. First, we discovered that Rrd1 interacts with RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), more specifically with its C-terminal domain and we showed that in response to rapamycin, Rrd1 alters the structure of this C-terminal domain. This phenomenon was confirmed to be directly mediated by Rrd1 in vitro, presumably through its peptidyl prolyl isomerase activity. Further, we demonstrated that Rrd1 is capable of altering the occupancy of RNAPII on genes in vivo and in vitro. With the use of ChIP on chip technology, we show that Rrd1 is actually a transcription elongation factor that is associated with RNAPII on actively transcribed genes. In addition, we demonstrate that Rrd1 is indeed required to regulate the expression of a large subset of genes in response to rapamycin. This data let us propose a novel mechanism by which Rrd1 regulates RNAPII during transcription elongation. Finally, we provide evidence that Rrd1 is not only required for an efficient response towards rapamycin but to a larger variety of environmental stress conditions, thus establishing Rrd1 as a transcriptional elongation factor required to fine tune the transcriptional stress response of RNAPII.

1378	L'impact d'un accident vasculaire cérébral léger sur la qualité de vie des proches	Introduction: Mild stroke clients are often independent in basic activities of daily living but may present subtle deficits that impact on complex activities and roles. The purpose of this study was to explore the perceived quality of life of close family members three months after the stroke client was discharged home. Method: Qualitative design based on a constructivist paradigm. Interviews were conducted with family members of mild stroke clients three months after discharge. An interview guide was used and the audio content was transcribed, followed by a content analysis. Results: Eight interviews were conducted (mean age 56.9 ± 9.2 years; men=2/8). Six essential themes emerged from the data. According to participants, mild stroke clients present sequelae that interfere with complex tasks (patient), increasing the burden on other family members who have to limit their personal activities (daily living). Spouses reported sometimes acting like a parent, which caused tensions in the relationship (conjugal relationship). Anxiety is related to the risk of stroke recurrence (relapse) and some family members present physical symptoms and a lack of energy (health). However, family members do not have access to services despite support from their relatives (services). Conclusion: The results of this exploratory study strongly suggest that even a ‘mild’ stroke has an impact on the daily lives of close family members and affects their quality of life.	mild stroke , close family member , quality of life , qualitative design , constructivist paradigm	en	4186.0
1379	Le processus de production de savoirs dans la pratique infirmière au moyen de la réflexivité	A new theoretical framework for designing the process of knowledge production within nursing practice is necessary to take into account the individual and the collective process of knowledge production as well as the influence of the context on this production. The theory of reflexivity of Giddens seems to be most relevant. This study aimed to describe and understand the process of knowledge production within nursing practice through reflexivity. More specifically, it was important to uncover the conditions and dynamics of the institutional, professional and practice context which influence the process of knowledge production within nursing practice and to identify the steps of this process. Projective constructivism was the paradigm that has guided the study. The research design was a secondary analysis of qualitative data. The study context was a critical care unit of a general and university hospital in Barcelona. Data were collected through systematic observation, six structured interviews, seven focus groups, and documents analysis. Data were analysed according to the mixed approach of Miles and Huberman, the qualitative analysis of Morse, and recommendations from various authors on secondary analysis. The rigor criteria were used and the ethical aspects were covered. The study results suggest that the conditions and dynamics of institutional, practical and professional contexts impact profoundly the nursing action and knowledge production. These conditions and dynamics are internalized in the working lives of nurses and provide “normal” ways of nursing practice. However, although there is an acceptance of the status quo, the conflicting feelings and suffering emerge easily. These conditions and dynamics cause incapacity among nurses to act fairly, ethically and responsibly and limit their exploration of new possibilities, formulations and demonstrations of practice. The results propose also the stages of knowledge production through four major themes: the recognition of daily reflexivity, systematic review of practices, the construction of new knowledge and the re-construction of emancipatory knowledge. Finally, this thesis suggests the importance of Giddens' theory for the study of knowledge production and the relationship between the nurse and the context, as well as the use of secondary analysis of qualitative data for the nursing discipline.

1380	"Rôle des kinines dans la physiopathologie des effets secondaires causés par
les héparines contaminées d’origine chinoise : approche expérimentale"	In January 2008, fatal anaphylactoid reaction (AR) has been associated to oversulfated chondroitin sulphate (OSCS) contaminated heparin. Although attributed to bradykinin (BK) released during contact system activation by OSCS, no definitive evidence exists until now for a BK release during incubation of contaminated heparin with human plasma. While looking at the number of death associated with OSCS (>150 worldwide) and at the epidemiologic fact, who state that 25% of the cases of AR associated to OSCS in United-States were treated with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi), we hypothesis that: AR associated with bolus injection of OSCS contaminated heparin are bind to a complex and multi-factorial aspect. The first objective of our study is to measure the kinetics of BK release in human plasma incubated with OSCS in presence of an ACEi and to compare it to the kinetics profile of the reference activator dextran sulfate. As the AR associated with OSCS contaminated heparin occurred mainly in the first minutes of dialysis session, we also studied the effect of the plasma dilution on the amount of BK released when treated or not with an ACEi. We also quantify the BK forming capacity of different batches of OSCS contaminated heparin responsible for AR and we compare this effect with reference heparin spiked or not with increasing concentrations of synthetic OSCS. Finally, we measure the kinetics of BK and des- Arg9-BK, its active metabolite, release in human plasma collected from patients who developed an AR associated to negatively charged dialysis membrane. The application of experimental method developed in our laboratory show, for the first time, that OSCS contaminated heparin incubated with human plasma has the capacity to liberate BK at a concentration that could explain the role of this inflammatory peptide in the pathophysiology of AR associated with OSCS contaminated Chinese heparins.

1381	A randomized controlled trial evaluating the quality of life and the sense of coherence in seniors wearing complete conventional dentures or mandibular two-implant overdentures	 The superiority and stability of the effect of mandibular two-implant retained overdentures (IODs) over conventional dentures (CDs) in relation to the oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) remain to be clarified. Furthermore, the influence of psychological factors, such as the sense of coherence (SOC), on the perception of treatment outcomes is still unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the magnitude of the effect of IODs and CDs on the OHRQoL and assess the stability of the treatment over time taking into account the level of SOC.  METHODOLOGY: Edentulous participants (n = 172, mean age 71, SD = 4.5) wearing CDs or IODs were followed up for two years. The OHRQoL was assessed at baseline and both follow-ups using the « Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-20) » questionnaire. The SOC was only assessed at both follow-ups using « The Orientation to Life (SOC-13) » questionnaire. Statistical analyses were conducted to evaluate between and within treatment differences (descriptive, bivariate and multivariate statistical analyses).  RESULTS: A significant pre-/post-treatment improvement in the OHRQoL for both treatment groups was found (Wilks’s Lambda = 0.473, F (1,151) = 157.31, p < 0.0001). The magnitude of the effect in the IOD group was 1.5 times larger than that in the CD group. These outcomes were stable over the two-year study period and the SOC did not influence any of these results.  CONCLUSION: IODs provide better long-term OHRQoL than CDs regardless of SOC level.

When the fetus is exposed to high, sustained, ambient glucose levels, widespread fetal damage may affect multiple organs, including the kidneys, evoking diabetic embryopathy syndrome. Renal malformations account for up to 40% of childhood renal failure cases. Hyperglycemia constitutes an adverse in utero environment that dynamically impairs nephrogenesis, resulting in renal agenesis, dysplasia, aplasia or hypoplasia. However, the molecular mechanisms by which high, ambient glucose levels lead to renal dysmorphogenesis and birth defects have not yet been delineated. Maternal diabetes also programs the offspring to develop other problems later in life, such as hypertension, obesity and type 2 diabetes. This phenomenon, called ‘perinatal programming’, has attracted worldwide attention in recent decades, yet the mechanisms by which it occurs are incompletely understood.  My PhD studies are designed to elucidate the underlying molecular pathways by which maternal diabetes or hyperglycemic environments in utero impair nephrogenesis and subsequently make the offspring develop perinatal programming of hypertension in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo. We employed mouse embryonic metanephric mesenchyme cells, namely MK4 cells, for our in vitro experiments, and 2 transgenic (Tg) mouse lines, Hoxb7-GFP-Tg and Nephrin-CFP-Tg mice, for ex vivo and in vivo investigations. Hoxb7-GFP-Tg mice specifically express green fluorescent protein (GFP) in ureteric buds (UB), driven by the Hoxb7 promoter. Nephrin-CFP-Tg mice express cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) in glomeruli, driven by the podocyte-specific nephrin promoter.  In our in vitro studies, we examined whether high glucose alters Pax2 gene expresson in MK4 cells. The cells were treated with either 5 mM D-glucose plus 20 mM D-mannitol or 25 mM D-glucose media with or without reactive oxygen species (ROS) blockers (DPI, rotenone), and inhibitors of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (SB203580), p44/22 MAPK (PD98059), protein kinase C (PKC) (GF109203X), or nuclear factor kappa B (NK-kB) (PDTC) for 24-hr incubation. Our data showed that high D-glucose (25 mM) increased ROS generation and specifically induced Pax2 gene expression, but not other glucose analogs such as D-mannitol, L-glucose or 2-deoxy-D-glucose in MK4 cells. The stimulatory effect of high D-glucose on Pax2 gene expression could be blocked by ROS and NF-kB inhibitors in MK4 cells but not by inhibitors of p38 MAPK (SB203580), p44/22 MAPK (PD98059), and PKC (GFX) in MK4 cells. These data indicated that the stimulatory effect of high glucose on Pax2 gene expression is mediated, at least in part, via ROS generation and activation of NF-κB, but not via the PKC, p38 MAPK and p44/42 MAPK signalling pathways.  In our ex vivo studies, we investigated the influence of a high-glucose milieu on UB branching morphogenesis. Kidney explants (E12 to E18) were microdissected from timed-pregnant Hoxb7-GFP mice and cultured with either 5 mM D-glucose plus 20 mM D-mannitol or 25 mM D-glucose media with or without ROS blockers (DPI, rotenone), catalase and phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT inhibitor at different time points, depending on the experiment. We found that high D-glucose specifically stimulated UB branching in a time-dependent manner. High D-glucose stimulation of UB branching morphogenesis was mediated via Pax2 gene expression. High D-glucose-induced UB branching and Pax2 gene expression could be blocked by ROS and PI3K/AKT inhibitors. These studies demonstrated that high glucose alters UB branching morphogenesis via Pax2 gene and protein expression. The stimulatory effect of high glucose seems to be mediated via ROS generation and activation of the AKT signalling pathway.   In our in vivo studies, we explored the fundamental role of maternal diabetes on renal morphogenesis impairment in offspring. In our experimental model, maternal diabetes was induced by streptozotocin in pregnant Hoxb7-GFP mice at embryonic day 13. The offspring were examined at several time points after birth (neonatal, 1 week, 2 weeks, and 3 weeks) with follow-up of kidney morphology, nephron number, gene expression, and apoptotic events in this short-term postnatal experiment. We observed that the offspring of diabetic mice had lower body weight, body size, kidney weight, small volume of glomeruli and a reduced number of nephrons in comparison to non-diabetic control offspring. Renal dysmorphogenesis may have been the result of increased cell apoptosis in glomeruli. Our findings showed that the offspring of diabetic mice displayed significantly more apoptotic podocytes as well as augmented active caspase-3 immunostaining in renal tubules compared to control mice offspring. Diabetic mice offspring presented heightened expression of intrarenal renin-angiotensin system (RAS) components, such as angiotensinogen and renin, with upregulation of p50 and p65 NF-kB isoforms. These data indicated that maternal diabetes activates the intrarenal RAS and induces glomerular apoptosis, resulting in impairment of renal morphogenesis in diabetic offspring.  In conclusion, our findings indicated that a high-glucose milieu in utero or maternal diabetic alters UB morphogenesis, culminating in retardation of nephrogenesis with smaller kidney size. The underlying mechanism(s) is mediated, at least in part, via ROS generation and activation of the intrarenal RAS and NF-kB pathways.  In the future, we aim to investigate the underlying mechanism(s) of how maternal diabetes induces perinatal programming of adult hypertension in offspring in vivo. This long-term postnatal study will be undertaken in 3 groups: adult offspring (20 weeks) of control mice, adult offspring of diabetic pregnant mice, and adult offspring of insulin-treated, diabetic, pregnant mice. We will follow-up by tracking hypertension, kidney morphology, and gene expression. Furthermore, we also plan to determine whether an antioxidant system (catalase) can protect against an hyperglycemic environment in utero that affects embryonic organogenesis via an increase in ROS generation. Catalase-Tg mice that specifically overexpress catalase in proximal tubules will be tested. Such Tg mice with catalase overexpression represent a model for exploring our hypothesis on the role of ROS in gestational diabetes.	maternal diabetes , nephrogenesis , hyperglycemia , Pax2 , Pax2 , Apoptosis	en	4137.0
1383	"Le mythe de la chanson québécoise : 
une étude sur les liens entre la tradition orale et le mouvement chansonnier des années soixante"	Is the chansonnier movement of the 1960s in Quebec in continuity or discontinuity with the oral tradition ? Is it a form of neo-folklore or is it a modern type of song ?  The links between songs by chansonniers and oral tradition are complex, as are the relations to discourse and ideology.  The thesis explores these links by using three approaches: a statistical analysis of the presence of oral tradition elements in the general chansonnier corpus, a detailed analysis of Gilles Vigneault’s song La Manikoutai, and a sociocultural analysis of diffusion processes.  In this context, the chansonnier movement, too often interpreted as an epiphenomenon of the Quiet Revolution and of the nationalist movement, can be seen in itself, in its own dynamic and as a parallel development.  The chansonnier movement is linked in a complex way to the a young generation that wants to cut itself from older generations and to a dynamic of distinction which leads to a search for ancient roots to this type of modern song.  It is because of this that the chansonnier discourse is seen as strongly oriented toward an ancient past, but at the same time as a break from the immediate past.  Finally, with the passage of time, the chansonnier movement becomes an element of the past itself, and, together with oral tradition, leads to a double myth of Quebec music, a myth that links two distinct sets of phenomena.

1384	Identification in silico d’éléments de réponse de récepteurs nucléaires impliqués dans le cancer du sein	Two thirds of breast tumours depend on estrogens for their growth. The network of genes mediating the proliferative effect of estrogens is not fully characterized. Putative primary and secondary estrogen target genes were identified with microarray analysis of MCF7 breast cancer cells treated with estradiol (E2) in presence or absence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX). The promoters of the target genes were screened for transcription factor binding sites with a collection of 300 matrix based DNA-binding profiles. Estrogen response elements (EREs) were enriched in the promoters of primary target genes. E2F binding sites were enriched in the promoters of secondary target genes. Similar enrichment was also observed in regions bounds by ERα and E2F1 in ChIP-on-chip experiments for each set of target genes. Retinoic acid (RA) treatment of mammary carcinoma cells inhibits their growth. Putative target genes were identified through microarray analysis of MCF7 cells treated with RA. Enrichment of retinoic acid response elements (RARE) was observed in their promoters after removing the elements found within transposable elements. Although transposable elements mask the enrichment, RARE within primate specific transposable elements are bound in vivo by retinoic acid receptors in the promoters of known target genes BTG2, CASP9 and GPRC5A. Some of the RA target genes in MCF7 cells are also target genes of E2 suggesting that these two molecules exert their effects on cell proliferation in part by  opposite action on a common set of genes.

1385	The Impact of Recycling on the Long-Run Stock of Trees	Interest in recycling of forest products has grown in recent years, one of the goals being to conserve the stock of trees or possibly increase it to compensate for positive externalities generated by the forest and neglected by the market. This paper explores the issue as to whether recycling is an appropriate measure to attain such a goal. We do this by considering the problem of the private owner of an area of land, who, acting as a price taker, decides how to allocate his land over time between forestry and some other use, and at what age to harvest the forest area chosen. Once the forest is cut, he makes a new land allocation decision and replants. He does so indefinitely, in a Faustmann-like framework. The wood from the harvest is transformed into a final product which is partly recycled into a substitute for the virgin wood, so that past output affects the current price. We show that in such a context, increasing the rate of recycling will result in less area being devoted to forestry. It will also have the effect of increasing the harvest age of the forest, as long as the planting cost is positive. The net effect on the flow of virgin wood being harvested to supply the market will as a result be ambiguous. The main point however is that recycling will result in a smaller, not a larger, stock of trees in the long run. It would therefore be best to resort to other means if the goal is to increase the stock of trees.	Recycling , Forestry , Faustmann Rule , Land Use , Q15, Q23, Q53	en	3995.0
1386	"Asset Pricing in a Production Economy with
Chew–Dekel Preferences"	In this paper we provide a thorough characterization of the asset returns implied by a simple general equilibrium production economy with Chew–Dekel risk preferences and convex capital adjustment costs. When households display levels of disappointment aversion consistent with the experimental evidence, a version of the model parameterized to match the volatility of output and consumption growth generates unconditional expected asset returns and price of risk in line with the historical data. For the model with Epstein–Zin preferences to generate similar statistics, the relative risk aversion coefficient needs to be about 55, two orders of magnitude higher than the available estimates. We argue that this is not surprising, given the limited risk imposed on agents by a reasonably calibrated stochastic growth model.

1387	L'élimination des barrières non tarifaires au commerce interprovincial et l'Accord sur le commerce intérieur du Canada	The Agreement on Internal Trade of Canada is a free trade agreement to reduce internal non-tariff barriers to trade. The concept of barriers to internal trade itself is controversial. There exists no consensus as to what are barriers to trade, what are their costs, and more importantly, whether they should be eliminated. The vast majority of experts are of the view that many of these nontariff barriers to trade are in the food processing industry. For many decades, this industry has been traditionally protectionist and is therefore a more difficult market to integrate. This situation may be observed at both the international and the internal level. In Canada, the tool of choice after years of failed constitutional negotiations was the Agreement on Internal Trade. This agreement, which bears a resemblance to international treaties, aims toward the gradual integration of the internal market in Canada. The desire to become an integrated and more competitive player in the global market conflicts with the provinces' intense desire to protect their legislative sovereignty. Thus, the tool chosen to open the Canadian market, the Agreement on Internal Trade, was drafted in a rather complex and inaccessible manner in order to strike a balance between those conflicting positions. The constitutional and political context in which the negotiations of this agreement took place coloured the text of the agreement itself and its drafting. In addition to its simplification, there exist several solutions involving various facets of the Agreement on Internal Trade, which should increase the effectiveness of the latter with respect to the integration of the Canadian interprovincial market, in addition to increasing its notoriety and its credibility and facilitating its implementation.

1388	Innover en politique : les acteurs internationaux, régionaux et nationaux en stratégies de développement économique en Afrique	Why, how and when does institutional or political change occur in Africa? By examining the postcolonial African strategies for economic development, and focusing on the evolution of the role of the State—the State as the central actor for development, the attempt to retrench the State, limited interventionism, the return of the State to the economic arena—the present thesis proposes an explanation of institutional change with a special focus on political and institutional innovations. In fact, behind the apparent continuity that most analytical and normative authors critique, there are innovations that the ideational, strategic, temporal and institutional variables allow us to demonstrate in a heuristic manner.  This thesis thus proposes a new comparative analysis of the role of African public institutions (elites, States, public administration: Cameroon, Ivory Coast, Benin, Congo, Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, Togo,  Senegal), international institutions (the IMF, the World Bank, the UNO) and regional organizations (the African Union, the NEPAD) in the emergence and the trajectories of development strategies in Africa. The favorable temporal contexts, the crises of the preceding models, the structuring configurations and institutional heritage, the instrumental strategies of the interested actors, the political learning, the cognitive and normative dimensions of the ideas contribute to explaining the diffusion and institutional sedimentation and conversion as privileged processes of innovation in Africa. The critique of these concepts makes it possible to develop tools better adapted to explain institutional inclusion and intrusion.  Institutional inclusion is a semi-strategic and semi-ideational process through which national or regional actors intentionally include (international) strategies (or solutions) that already exist in a new institution or policy with the aim of increasing the probability of acceptance (recognition, social suitability, real or perceived common values) or success (to ensure their interests) of their strategy within a structured political environment. The ideas are constitutive of the interests in this process.  The institutional intrusion is a semi-strategic and semi-structural process by which national actors are partly forced to adopt new institutions or policies, and agree to do so only because of the asymmetry in power, the structural constraints (structure), or the potential benefits (strategies) of the international actors. In this context, relevant and non-constraining alternatives are quasi inexistent, but national actors still have (limited) room for negotiations. Inspired by specialist like Nicolas van de Walle, Kathleen Thelen, Robert Bates, Barry Weingast, Alexander Wendt, Peter Hall, Theda Skocpol, and Paul Pierson, the concepts of institutional intrusion and inclusion that we propose reconcile many approaches that many scholars considered contradictory. They successfully integrate strategic, structural, temporal and ideational variables to analyze the same scientific object. Empirically speaking, the present thesis explains the emergence of development strategies in Africa, as well as provides a better knowledge of the relationship between the international, regional and national actors in the process of emergence and development of institutions and public policies. A special attention is given to dynamics between numerous actors and variables (ideas, interests, institution, time) to explain the main strategies of the last three decades: national development strategies of Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroun, Ivory Coast, Congo, Senegal, Mali, Niger, Togo, the Lagos Plan of Action, the structural adjustment program, the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, the New Partnership for Africa Development and some interventions of the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the United Nations.  While being interested in the question of the international, regional and national innovations wrongly forsaken by most of the serious analyses, this dissertation renews the discussion on change, especially political and institutional innovation in Africa, within the international organizations (the IMF, the World Bank, and the United Nations) and in Political Science.	political and institutional change , political and institutionnal innovation , strategy for economic development , NEPAD , NEPAD , DSRP , PRSP , IMF , World Bank , institutional intrusion and inclusion , State and Public Administration	en	3952.0
1389	Les niveaux et les facteurs déterminants de la mortalité infantile en Nouvelle-France et au début du Régime Anglais (1621-1779)	During Quebec’s colonial era, children often died before reaching their first anniversary. Parents accepted with wisdom and resignation the death of their children; thus was the will of the Almighty. Thanks to the Registre de la Population du Québec Ancien (R.P.Q.A.) put together by the Programme de Recherche en Démographie Historique (P.R.D.H), the level of infant mortality has been measured, some determining factors analyzed and an intergenerational component identified. Covering for the first time the entire French colonial period, our results confirm the importance of infant mortality in the 17th and 18th centuries (from 140 to 260 per thousand before applying corrections to account for the under-registration of deaths).   Significant disparities on account of sex, birthplace and father’s profession have been observed. Inequalities in probabilities reflect physiological differences between males and females with a 20 per cent higher risk for boys and the influence of urban or rural residence: the city of Quebec’s children died on average 1,5 à 1,2 times more than rural children. Montreal, showing extraordinarily high levels of infant mortality, still unexplained, lost 50 per cent of its children before age one, which represented 1,9 times more infant deaths than those of rural children who enjoyed a better environment. The deleterious effects of wet-nursing practices, concerning more than half of children born in wealthy urban families, devastated more and more their descendants. Furthermore, the study of the endogenous and exogenous components of infant mortality revealed that the mortality of exogenous causes explains more than 70 per cent of all infant deaths. The recurrence of infectious diseases, the lack of personal hygiene, and the insalubrities of urban environments posed serious dangers for children.   From a familial and intergenerational perspective, which views each child as an integral part of a sibship, significative risks have been observed for several determining characteristics. Teenage mothers (<20) or mothers over 35, a high birth rank (8+), a short birth interval (less than 21 months) and the death of the previous child increase infant mortality of the index child from 10 to 70%, because a child’s fate is not independent of his mother and sibling characteristics. We also found that infant mortality clustered within certain families. A positive relationship between infant mortality experienced by mothers and daughters has been found. The observed distribution of daughters having lost at least 40 per cent of their children when their mothers also lost the same proportion of their children is 1,3 to 1,9 times higher than the one expected. An intergenerational transmission of infant mortality probably existed, when controlling for period and sibship size.

1390	La racialisation comme constitution de la différence : une ethnographie documentaire de la santé publique aux États-Unis	At present one can note an intensification of the usage of race in public health in the United States, an idea that is sometimes rejected because of its association with controversial practices. Races are viewed, in this context, as the product of racism, a technology of power of the modern State that consisted of fragmenting humanity to permit colonisations. Thus, race has been established within the discourse to mark difference, discourse that consists of a heterogeneous ensemble of apparatuses, institutions, scientific statements, norms and rules. Racism developed concomitantly with the affirmation of power over life aimed at ruling out bodies and populations through public health practices among others. This thesis is based on an ethnographic study of a corpus of public health documents in the United States from federal Government offices and a major public health journal published between 2001 and 2009.  This study analyzed the ways in which race is represented, produced as object of knowledge, and regulated by discursive practices in these documents. The results confirm that the discourse on race varies throughout time. Hence, results indicate the relative permanence of a racialized regime of representation that consists of identifying, situating and opposing subjects and groups based on standardized labels. This regime constitutes an ensemble of representational practices which, together with disciplinary techniques and the use of culture as an idea, lead to the characterization and formation of racialized objects and stereotypes.  Also, these operations that fabricate racialization, tend, together with medicalization and culturalization, to naturalize difference, reproduce the symbolic order, and constitute racial identities. On the other hand, racialization appears to be torn between a power over life and a power over death. Finally, this study suggests a post-racial alternative that envisages human group constitution as fluid and deterritorialized.

1391	L'Institut économique de Montréal, un Think Tank influent sur la scène des idées au Québec	Since the election of Jean Charest in 2003, we notice that the neoliberal’s ideas (deregulation, privatization, liberalization, and reduction of government expenditures) have regularly inundated all public exchange of ideas in Quebec, from elected politicians to media conglomerates.  The author tried to determine how conservative ideas became part of the public discourse in Quebec. Our research lead us to a Quebec think tank: Montreal Economic Institute. The managers of this organization used its important influence with written media, particularly Gesca. Thanks to its large, powerful social network and its influence strategy, the Montreal Economic Institute think tank was able to transmit its neoliberal ideas.  In this way, this think tank has spread these ideas in the pages of the most read Quebecois daily newspapers.  Young think tanks, such as Montreal Economic Institute, believe that access to the media is essential to shape public opinion and public policy. Their purpose is to influence the setting of the agenda and the framing of discourse in the media to favor the respective think tank’s propositions and ideas.   The author analyzed three different cases, at three different times, in which she demonstrates that the Montreal Economic Institute has influenced the agenda setting of Gesca, and that the framing was largely favorable to the Montreal Economic Institute’s propositions.

1392	Synthèse diastéréosélective et énantiosélective de dérivés cyclopropaniques 1,2,3-substitués à l’aide de carbénoïdes gem-dizinciques	1,2,3-Substituted cyclopropanes are useful compounds present in several chemical domains. This thesis considers both the diastereo- and enantioselective synthesis of these compounds, particularly focusing on zincocyclopropanation methodologies. This method relies on a gem-diorganozinc carbenoid undergoing a Simmons-Smith type cyclopropanation. This method is advantageous due to its diastereoselectivity, forming the cyclopropylzinc adduct, where the zinc atom is cis relative to the directing group involved in the cyclopropanation. In this reaction, the existence of a competitive pathway involving a monoorganozinc reagent dramatically decreased the efficiency of the zincocyclopropanation. Reactivity studies, and screening of numerous conditions for the formation of the carbenoids highlighted the crucial parameters favouring the zincocyclopropanation reaction. This work demonstrated that the outcome of the reaction strongly depends on the nature of the carbenoid used, the temperature, and the presence of ZnI2 in the reaction mixture. Due to these findings, zincocyclopropanation was extended to allylic alcohols bearing one directing group only (i.e. not derived from 1,4-butenediol). As predicted, under these optimized conditions the zincocyclopropanation was highly cis-diastereoselective. To functionalize these cyclopropylzinc reagents many in situ functionalization reactions were developed. All these methods demonstrated total retention of the diastereoselectivity, and as such, the versatility of zincocyclopropanation for the synthesis of 1,2,3-susbtituted cyclopropanes is demonstrated. With a diastereoselective method in hand for the synthesis of 1,2,3-substituted cyclopropanes, we explored the development of an enantioselective version for this reaction. The use of a dioxaborolane-based ligand allowed the zincocyclopropanation of various allylic alcohols with high enantioselectivity. The presence of a nucleophilic C-Zn bond and an electrophilic boron center within the same molecule led to an in situ zinc-boron exchange and the formation of a cyclopropylborinate. This intramolecular zinc to boron exchange is responsible of the perfect diastereoselectivity of the reaction. These cyclopropylborinates were submitted to a Suzuki cross-coupling reaction leading to various 1,2,3-substituted cyclopropane with high enantioselectivities and excellent diastereoselectivities. These cyclopropylborinates are versatile intermediates as other functionalization reactions have been developed for these compounds.

1393	Rebuilding less vulnerable communities : the case of Holy Cross	Resiliency is the capacity to adjust to threats and mitigate or avoid harm; it can be found in hazard-resistant buildings or adaptive social systems (Pelling, 2003). Hence, it  can also be understood as the ability to rebuild a neighbourhood with stronger and more  viable components. Almost four years after Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans is seen as an  open laboratory in which the level of resiliency of its communities can be examined. The  rebuilding status of its neighbourhoods widely differs from one to another. The historic  district of Holy Cross is one of the oldest neighbourhoods in the city; this vulnerable  community is known for its cultural heritage, apparent not only in its unique architecture  but also its social relations. This research investigates the current process of rebuilding a  more sustainable and resilient Holy Cross by assessing the efficiency of stakeholders  involved in the reconstruction of affordable opportunities that work to encourage former  residents to return. It also demonstrates the current efforts to build new sustainable  projects while keeping the patrimonial style of the neighbourhood.

1394	L’étude de l’interaction entre les chondrocytes et le collagène modifié par le 4-Hydroxynonénal : implication dans le développement de l’arthrose	OBJECTIVE: The regulation of cell phenotype and function by the surrounding environment is deeply altered by the oxidative modifications of extracellular matrix (ECM) components that modify their structural and functional properties. This modification may be one cause involved in cartilage degradation in osteoarthritis (OA). Type II collagen (Col II) was reported to be targeted for 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) binding, a very reactive product of lipid peroxydation. In the present study, we investigated whether HNE-binding to Col II affects OA chondrocytes phenotype and function and then, we determined the protective role of carnosine treatment in preventing these changes. METHODS: Isolated human OA chondrocytes were seeded in control wells and in HNE/Col II adducts-coated plates and incubated afterwards for 48 hours. Adhesion molecules at protein and mRNA levels were determined by Western blotting, flow cytometry and real-time RT-PCR. Commercial kits were used to evaluate cell death, caspase-8 activity and levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13), MAPK and NF-κB-p65. Col II, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), MAPK and NF-κB-p65 levels were assessed by Western blotting. RESULTS: After 48 hours of incubation, the modification of Col II by 0.2 mM HNE induced strongly the expression of ICAM-1, integrin α1β1, MMP-13 and slightly COX-2 as well as PGE2 release without affecting cell morphology and viability as well as Col II expression. However, the modification of Col II with 2 mM HNE induced shape changes of cells from typical chondrocyte-like polygon shape to round semi-detached, affecting cells viability and inducing caspase-8 activity. It inhibited the expression of ICAM-1, integrin α1β1 and Col II, but in contrast, induced strongly PGE2 release and COX-2 expression. All these effects were prevented by 0.1 mM carnosine treatment, an HNE trapping drug. Carnosine was added to HNE-modified, Col II-coated plates 1h before cell seeding. Upon examination of different signalling pathways involved in these responses, we found that modified Col II with 2 mM HNE inhibited strongly the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and NF-κB-p65 but induced strongly p38 MAPK. In contrast, the results indicated that MAPK and NF-κB-p65 were activated when cells were incubated with modified Col II by 0.2 mM HNE. CONCLUSION: The interaction between chondrocytes and collagen-bound HNE modulates different signalling pathways via adhesion molecules regulation and consequently leads to the expression of catabolic and inflammatory factors. Carnosine was shown to be an efficient HNE trapping agent able to counteract these effects.

1395	"Analyse par apprentissage automatique des réponses fMRI du cortex auditif à des 
modulations spectro-temporelles"	The application of linear machine learning classifiers to the analysis of brain imaging data (fMRI) has led to several interesting breakthroughs in recent years. These classiﬁers combine the responses of the voxels to detect and categorize different brain states. They allow a more agnostic analysis than conventional fMRI analysis that systematically treats weak and distributed patterns as unwanted noise. In this project, we use such classifiers to validate an hypothesis concerning the encoding of sounds in the human brain. More precisely, we attempt to locate neurons tuned to spectral and temporal modulations in sound. We use fMRI recordings of brain responses of subjects listening to 49 different spectro-temporal modulations. The analysis of fMRI data through linear classifiers is not yet a standard procedure in this field. Thus, an important objective of this project, in the long term, is the development of new machine learning algorithms specialized for neuroimaging data. For these reasons, an important part of the experiments is dedicated to studying the behaviour of the classifiers. We are mainly interested in 3 standard linear classifiers, namely the support vectors machine algorithm (linear), the logistic regression algorithm (regularized) and the naïve bayesian gaussian model (shared variances).

1396	Toward a broader approach to the study of infant attachment : links between maternal autonomy-support, attachment state of mind, maternal sensitivity, and infant security of attachment	In order to further elucidate the mechanisms underlying the development of infant attachment patterns, Grossmann and colleagues (1999; 2008) have proposed a broader perspective to the study of infant attachment, addressing parental behaviors related to both sides of the attachment/exploration balance. With this broader approach in mind, this dissertation aimed at exploring the relation between infant security of attachment and two maternal behaviors, maternal sensitivity and autonomy-support, as well as each behavior’s relation to maternal attachment state of mind.  Article 1 argues that Self-Determination theory (SDT), and its empirical work concerning parental exploration-related behaviors, may provide valuable insight in addressing the exploration side of the attachment/exploration balance. The article presents a theoretical and empirical overview of the field of attachment and the field of SDT, as well as drawing conceptual and empirical parallels between the two fields and discussing how they may complement one another. Article 2 explores the links between maternal sensitivity, maternal autonomy-support, and infant security of attachment. Seventy-one dyads participated in two home visits. Maternal sensitivity was assessed when the infants were 12 months old, while maternal autonomy-support and infant attachment were assessed at 15 months. Results indicate that maternal autonomy-support accounted for a significant portion of the variability in security of attachment above and beyond what is accounted for by maternal SES and maternal sensitivity. Article 3 explores the links between two dimensions of maternal attachment state of mind (dismissing and preoccupied/unresolved), maternal sensitivity, and maternal autonomy-support. Seventy-one dyads participated in three home visits. The Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) was administered when the infants were 8 months of age, maternal sensitivity was assessed when they were 12 months old, and maternal autonomy-support was assessed at 15 months. The results revealed that, above and beyond SES, maternal sensitivity was negatively related to the dismissing dimension of the AAI, whereas maternal autonomy-support was negatively linked to the preoccupied/unresolved dimension. The results presented in both article 2 and 3 are discussed along with their theoretical and clinical implications. Questions that may guide future research are proposed.

In the particular situation of Argentina – that is, a country characterised by significant social inequalities  between citizens, a scarcity of resources in health care, limited access to needed services, and a lack of specific health policies – the introduction of new genetic technologies poses serious ethical and policy challenges that need urgent attention by policy-makers. This project examines the case of prenatal genetic tests in the context of the Argentinean health care system with the aim of illustrating how complex their introduction can be in a nation where equal access to health care still needs significant improvements. Attention must also be given to the legal restrictions and religious precepts that strongly shape the use of these technologies. This further highlights the necessity of developing an integrated framework for the process of technology assessment, in order to support coherent and innovative policy recommendations applicable to the particular Argentinean context.

1398	Repeupler le centre-ville : le réaménagement des faubourgs du Vieux-Montréal entre intentions et interventions	This thesis looks at the design and the implementation of strategies aimed to stimulate the development of residential neighbourhoods in downtown Montreal since the end of the 1980s. Following from a double case study about the redevelopment of two derelict industrial districts next to Old Montreal, the faubourg Quebec and the faubourg des Récollets, we show how local authorities can, by means of a bundle of incentives, encourage the investment of property developers in order to make their business plans converge with the goals of the local planning authorities. In a rather improvised manner, the Montreal government set up a combination of « opportunities » and « constraints » to entice partnerships with the private sector in order to foster the development of the two districts. Our results show that although the system set up by authorities left indifferent a majority of developers, it nevertheless allowed a small number of them to establish themselves in a now very profitable share of the Montreal real estate market.

1399	Étude empirique de distributions associées à la Fonction de Pénalité Escomptée	We discuss a simulation approach for the joint density function of the surplus prior to ruin and deficit at ruin for risk models driven by Lévy subordinators. This approach is inspired by the Ladder Height decomposition for the probability of ruin of such models. The Classical Risk Model driven by a Compound Poisson process is a particular case of this more generalized one. The Expected Discounted Penalty Function, also referred to as the Gerber-Shiu Function (GS Function), was introduced as a unifying approach to deal with different quantities related to the event of ruin. The probability of ruin and the joint density function of surplus prior to ruin and deficit at ruin are particular cases of this function. Expressions for those two quantities have been derived from the GS Function, but those are not easily evaluated nor handled as they are infinite series of convolutions with no analytical closed form. However they share a similar structure, thus allowing to use the Ladder Height decomposition of the Probability of Ruin as a guiding method to generate simulated values for this joint density function. We present an introduction to risk models driven by subordinators, and describe those models for which it is possible to process the simulation. To motivate this work, we also present an application for this distribution, in order to calculate different risk measures for those risk models. An brief introduction to the vast field of Risk Measures is conducted where we present selected measures calculated in this empirical study. This work contributes to better understanding the behavior of subordinators driven risk models, as it offers a numerical point of view, which is absent in the literature.

1400	"Chimiohyperthermie intrapéritonéale à l’oxaliplatine
dans le traitement de la carcinose péritonéale
d’origine appendiculaire"	Background: Peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) arising from the appendix is a rare disease with a poor long-term prognosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the results of an aggressive approach used at our institution over the last five years.  Methods: Data from all patients with a PC arising from the appendix were prospectively collected and analyzed. Treatment consisted of complete surgical cytoreduction of the tumor followed by hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) with oxaliplatin (460 mg/m2) in 2 L/m2 of D5W at 43˚C during 30 minutes.   Results: From February 2003 to March 2007, 38 patients with PC arising from the appendix underwent laparotomy with curative intent. Mean follow-up was 23 months. Twenty-three patients received HIPEC but 10 patients could not have complete cytoreductive surgery and received no HIPEC. Five patients with a negative second-look surgery also received no HIPEC. The 3-year overall survival (OS) was 100% for the negative second-look patients, 86% for the HIPEC patients, and 29% for the unresectable patients (p=0.0098). The 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) was 49% for the HIPEC patients.  Histologic grade was a prognostic factor with regard to DFS for the HIPEC patients (p = 0.011). There was one postoperative mortality. The overall complication rate for treated patients was 39%, including intra-abdominal abscess (22%), hemorrhage (18%), and anastomotic leak (9%).   Conclusions: Although these results are preliminary, this therapeutic approach seems both feasible and safe in selected patients.

1401	La contribution de la famille sur la relation entre les conditions de l’organisation du travail et la consommation de médicaments psychotropes	   The aims of this study were two-fold : first to examine whether there exists a significant relation between work organization conditions and drug use among members of the Canadian workforce; and secondly, to analyze the moderating effect of family situation status on the relation between work organization conditions and drug use. Analysis of data from a sample of Canadian workers, through the Canadian Community Health Survey of Statistics Canada (ESCC 2.1), determined that prevalence of consumption was 8.8%. More specifically, prevalence for women (11.7%) was higher that of men (6.3%).  The findings of this research support one possible negative relation between the amount of working hours and drug use. We also found a positive association between celibacy and drug use. The same connection was found in regards to the total household income, more specifically to a higher household income. Finally, these results demonstrated a lack of the family’s moderating effect on the relation between work organization conditions and drug use.         	work organization conditions , family , psychotropics , active Canadian population	en	3784.0
1402	Analyse de la performance du système portuaire de l'Arctique canadien	Climate change brings deep transformations in the Arctic environment. The reduction of the ice cover allows better access to northern communities and natural resources. In Canada, the Arctic region is characterized by an archipelagic geography and undeveloped transportation network. Marine transport is the favoured mode for supplying freight to local communities and industrial sites.  The scientific literature shows important gaps on commercial navigation in the Canadian Arctic. Few studies have been conducted on marine traffic in the Arctic due to small tonnage and low product diversity, even though it is a significant activity for the northern people and the regional economy. This research aims to fill this gap by assessing maritime transportation and port operation efficiency in the Canadian Arctic.  The structure of this study is four fold. First, a traffic and trade analysis is conducted under three scales: international, national and intra-arctic. Second, a fleet and routing assessment is done by means of carriers’ geographic distribution. Third, port performance is measured through specific indicators. Fourth, an evaluation is held on arctic marine operations through information collected during interviews with members of the maritime industry, workshops and field work. Problems addressed regard evolution of the sealift, challenges brought by Arctic navigation and development of northern Canadian ports. Results of this research lead to the conclusion that Arctic marine transportation displays positive traffic growth and serious involvement by carriers dedicated to Arctic sealift, but under-developed port and maritime infrastructures.

1403	Le rôle des cellules gliales de Müller dans la mort des cellules ganglionnaires de la rétine par des mécanismes cellulaires non-autonomes	Glial cells are essential for the functioning of the nervous system. In the retina, the Müller glial cells ensure the homeostasis of this tissue as well as the protection of neurons including the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs).  The main hypothesis of this thesis is that Müller cells play a predominant role in neuronal survival both at the levels of neurotrophin/proneurotrophin signaling following injury and excitotoxic mechanisms. Unlike the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), the nerve growth factor (NGF) is unable to induce RGCs survival following optic nerve transection. The first objective of the thesis was therefore to describe the expression of the two receptors of NGF, p75NTR and TrkA, in the adult retina and to address their functional role by using peptidomimetic agonistic or antagonistic ligands specific for each receptor. Our results showed that TrkA is overexpressed by RGCs following axotomy, whereas p75NTR is specifically expressed by Müller cells. While NGF by itself does not promote RGC survival, selective activation of TrkA receptors using peptidomimetic ligands is markedly neuroprotective. Surprisingly, selective blockers of p75NTR, or the absence of p75NTR, protect RGCs from axotomy-induced death. Moreover, combination of NGF or TrkA agonists with p75NTR antagonists functions synergistically to enhance RGC survival. These results reveal a new mechanism by which p75NTR expression by Müller glia may profoundly influence neuronal survival. Next, we wanted to address the effect of proneurotrophins in the adult retina. We showed that injection of proNGF induces the death of RGCs in rats and mice by a p75NTR-dependent signaling mechanism. Expression of p75NTR in the adult retina being confined to Müller glial cells, we tested the hypothesis that proNGF activates a non-cell autonomous signaling pathway to induce RGC death. Consistent with this notion, we showed that proNGF induced a robust expression of tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) in Müller cells, and that genetic or biochemical ablation of TNFα blocked proNGF-induced death of retinal neurons. Mice rendered null for p75NTR, its co-receptor sortilin, or the adaptor protein NRAGE were defective in proNGF-induced glial TNFα production and did not undergo proNGF-induced retinal ganglion cell death. We concluded that proNGF activates a non-cell autonomous signaling pathway that causes TNFα-dependent death of retinal neurons in vivo.  The central hypothesis of excitotoxicity is that excessive stimulation of neuronal N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA)-sensitive glutamate receptors is harmful to neurons and contributes to a variety of neurological disorders. Glial cells have been proposed to participate in excitotoxic neuronal loss, but their precise role is poorly defined.  In this in vivo study, we showed that NMDA induces a strong NF-κB activation in Müller glia, but not in retinal neurons. Intriguingly, NMDA-induced death of retinal neurons was effectively blocked by inhibitors of NF-κB activity. We demonstrated that TNFα protein produced in Müller glial cells via an NMDA-induced NF-κB dependent pathway plays a crucial role in the excitotoxic loss of retinal neurons. This cell loss occurs mainly through a TNFα-dependent increase in Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptors on susceptible neurons. Thus, our data reveal a novel non-cell-autonomous mechanism by which glial cells can profoundly exacerbate neuronal death following excitotoxic injury.

1404	Évaluation gastro-intestinale chez des chiens présentant un comportement de léchage excessif de surface	The objective of this study was to characterize excessive licking of surfaces (ELS) in dogs and demonstrate that it can be a sign of underlying gastrointestinal (GI) pathology rather than an obsessive-compulsive disorder. Twenty dogs presented with ELS (L group) were divided in 2 subgroups of 10 dogs each: L0 without and LD with concomitant digestive signs. Ten healthy dogs were assigned to a control group (C group). Behavioral, physical and neurological examinations were performed prior to a complete work-up of the GI system (CBC, serum chemistry panel, urinalysis, assessment of total serum bile acids and canine specific pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity, fecal flotation by zinc sulfate, fecal culture, abdominal ultrasonography and upper GI endoscopy with biopsies). Based on results, appropriate treatment was recommended. Dogs were monitored subsequently for 90 days during which the licking behavior was recorded. Gastrointestinal disorders were identified in14/20 L dogs. Underlying GI disorders included eosinophilic infiltration of the GI tract, lymphoplasmacytic infiltration of the GI tract, delayed gastric emptying, irritable bowel syndrome, chronic pancreatitis, gastric foreign body and giardiasis. Significant improvement (>50%) in frequency or duration of the basal ELS behavior was observed in the majority of dogs (56%). Resolution of ELS occurred in half of the L dogs. Except for ELS, there was no significant difference in the behavior (e.g. anxiety) of L dogs and C dogs. GI disorders should be considered in the differential diagnosis of ELS in dogs	excessive licking of surface , dog , gastrointestinal , obsessive-compulsive disorder , behavior	en	3776.0
1405	Rôle de l’apport prénatal en acides gras oméga-3 sur le développement à long terme des fonctions visuelles chez les enfants Inuits	Fish and sea mammals consumption is an important source of omega-3 fatty acids, known for their beneficial effects on human brain development. Several lines of evidence indicate that omega-3 fatty acids are beneficial especially for the development of the visual system. However, the long-term effect of prenatal exposure to omega-3 fatty acids on human visual development is unknown. This question was addressed using visual evoked potentials (PEVs) to study a cohort of school-age Inuit children (n = 136; mean age = 11.3 years old) from Arctic Quebec (Nunavik) who received high levels of omega-3 intake during gestation. PEV protocols using color and motion-onset stimuli were used to assess the parvocellular and magnocellular responses, respectively. Concentrations of the omega-3 fatty acid DHA were measured at birth in the umbilical cord and at the time of testing, reflecting pre- and post-natal exposure, respectively. Relations between omega-3 and VEPs were assessed by multivariate regression analyses, taking into account environmental contaminants and other potential confounding variables. No significant associations were found with motion-onset VEPs. However, after adjustment for covariables, cord blood concentrations of DHA were associated with a shorter latency of the N1 and P1 components of the color VEPs. Our study suggests beneficial effects of DHA on the visual parvocellular system at school age. This is the first study supporting the longlasting beneficial effects of prenatal exposure to DHA.

1406	Non-negative matrix decomposition approaches to frequency domain analysis of music audio signals	We study the application of unsupervised matrix decomposition algorithms such as Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to frequency domain representations of music audio signals. These algorithms, driven by a given reconstruction error function, learn a set of basis functions and a set of corresponding coefficients that approximate the input signal. We compare the use of three reconstruction error functions when NMF is applied to monophonic and harmonized musical scales: least squares, Kullback-Leibler divergence, and a recently introduced “phase-aware” divergence measure. Novel supervised methods for interpreting the resulting decompositions are presented and compared to previously used methods that rely on domain knowledge. Finally, the ability of the learned basis functions to generalize across musical parameter values including note amplitude, note duration and instrument type, are analyzed. To do so, we introduce two basis function labeling algorithms that outperform the previous labeling approach in the majority of our tests, instrument type with monophonic audio being the only notable exception.

1407	Étude du rôle de la dopamine et de la sérotonine dans l’effet atténuateur des antipsychotiques et de l’OSU-6162 sur la récompense induite par la stimulation du faisceau médian prosencéphalique chez le rongeur	The mesocorticolimbic pathway is composed of neural elements that originate in the mesencephalic ventral tegmental area and project to cortical and sub-cortical areas. Dopamine (DA) neurons that constitute a major portion of this pathway play a role in several cognitive functions such as the attention, learning and reward.  DA cell activity increases when the organism anticipates and receives a reward, as well as during the learning phase of appetitive behaviors.  When dopaminergic impulse flow becomes aberrant, stimuli that should be considered as neurtral become salient and acquire an improper signification.  This functional abnormality of the dopaminergic system underlies psychotic symptoms that are observed in schizophrenia.  This hypothesis is reinforced by the fact that clinically effective antipsychotic drugs all display antagonism at the D2 sub-type of DA receptors.  Classical antipsychotic drugs (i.e. haloperidol) possess a high affinity for D2 receptors while atypical antipsychotic drugs (i.e. clozapine) possess a higher affinity for type 2a (5-HT2a) serotonin receptors than for D2 receptors. Atypical antipsychotics seem more effective against negative symptoms (i.e. anhedonia) of schizophrenia and induce less extrapyramidal side effects and dysphoria than classical antipsychotics.  It has been proposed that this efficacy of atypical antipsychotics is explained by their antagonistic action at both, the 5-HT2a and the D2 receptors. To better understand the mechanisms of actions of these drugs, we studied their effects on reward using the intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) model in rodents.  The aim of a first study was to evaluate the effect of a selective 5-HT2a receptor antagonist, M100907, on the reward, and on the reward attenuation induced by haloperidol.  The hypothesis was that the reward attenuation induced by the addition of M100907 to haloperidol is similar to the reward attenuation induced by clozapine alone. In a second study, the effect on reward of a D2 receptor partial agonist, OSU-6162, was characterized under two conditions: i) a basal condition and ii) under a state of abnormal dopaminergic neurotransmission elicited by systemic administration of quinpirole, a D2/D3 agonist.  The hypotheses were that OSU-6162 i) should attenuate stimulation-induced reward and ii) prevent quinpirole-induced reward attenuation and reward facilitation. Results showed that M100907, when give alone, did not alter reward; however when administered with haloperidol reduced the reward attenuation.  Co-administration of M100907 and haloperidol induced a reward attenuation of a similar amplitude to that of clozapine, suggesting that 5-HT2a antagonism activity of this latter drug contributes to its effects on reward.  Results from the second study showed that OSU-6162 dose-orderly attenuates reward and quinpirole-induced reward facilitation; however it did not reduce quinpirole-induced reward attenuation.  This last observation suggests that OSU-6162 acts like a functional antagonist at post-synaptic D2 receptors. A large body of data suggests that the ICSS behavior constitutes a valid model to evaluate the antipsychotic potential of new compounds. ICSS behavior is attenuated by clinically effective antipsychotics is weakly, or not at all, altered by compounds without antipsychotic activity.  Results obtained in this thesis allow us to predict that OSU-6162 possesses an antipsychotic activity that would be similar to that of atypical, without altering the serotonergic neurotransmission.

1408	"Caractérisation d’un nouveau récepteur à octopamine exprimé chez la palourde 
Spisula solidissima"	A cDNA encoding for an octopamine receptor named Spi-OAR was cloned and sequenced from the surf clam Spisula solidissima oocytes. An analysis of its predicted amino acid sequence showed a high degree of similarity with β-adrenergic and octopamine receptors. This receptor qualifies as a novel receptor closely related to the proposed class of insect octopamine « β-adrenergic–like » receptors coupled to Gs protein. This cDNA was introduced into an expression vector (pCEP4), with an added N-terminal FLAG tag sequence, and transfected in host cells (HEK 293). Immunofluorescence studies showed expression of the receptor with a proper localization to the plasma membrane. Measurements of cAMP in transfected cells revealed that addition of octopamine, and to a lower extent, tyramine induced a rise in cAMP while dopamine, serotonine and histamine had no effect. Overexpression of Spi-OAR in mammalian cells induced slight constitutive increase of cAMP. An RT-PCR analysis with specific oligonucleotides revealed the presence of the receptor mRNA not only in oocytes but also in whole gonads, heart, adductor muscle, gills and ganglia suggesting that this receptor is likely ubiquitously expressed. Expression of Spi-OAR was also detected at different embryonic stages. Despite the demonstrated expression of Spi-OAR in oocytes, octopamine had no effect on meiotic reinitiation. Further studies will examine the function of Spi-OAR.	Octopamine , RCPG , Mollusque , Calcium , GPCR , Surf clam Spisula solidissima , Mollusc , Oocyte , cAMP , Calcium	en	3763.0
1409	Les éditeurs indépendants au Chili (2000-2005) : un développement contemporain des industries culturelles	This thesis discusses the emergence of a new actor in the production of books in Chile. This actor arises in the late nineties as a group of independent publishers, and in the first few years of this decade, expands to include university publishing. The point of coincidence and action of these actors, organized in the association Editors of Chile, is the recuperation and assertion of a modern role for the figure of editor, in the sense of the Age of Enlightenment. We can confirm the articulation between the specific demands of publishers and the political position adopted on the symbolic value of cultural production and its role as an element of identity- and democracy-building, under the assumption that access to books should not be restricted to the rules of the market. The theoretical focus we suggest is that of the theory of cultural industries, including contributions from cultural studies. From the perspective of the political economy of cultural industries, we seek to redefine the concept of independence through an analysis of the strategies used by economic units (publishers) and the relationship between these units and their geographical, political and cultural context. We also take into account the macro-structural factors, but with the understanding that their influence is always relative and, in consequence, should be subject to re-evaluation in terms of the relationships of power and specific political, economic and social scenarios. We believe this is a phenomenon that is not exclusive to the field of books. We have corroborated that this also takes place in the field of music, audio-visual productions and the media, such as radio, and to a lesser extent, television. In terms of methodology, we suggest a mixed focus, one that combines quantitative and qualitative methods and instruments. These are the statistical analysis of the production of Chilean publishers (frequency of titles, genres and authors), semi-structured interviews and documents analysis. Before discussing the description and analysis of the production of books in Chile and the significance publishers give to independence along with their positions in the field of culture, we set forth a historical and industrial description of Chilean books. This description allows us to comprehend its creation and development in the political, economic and social context in Chile and Latin America, within the new conditions arising from the globalization process and local and international neoliberal transformations. This investigation then examines the nature of publishing in Chile from 2000-2005, taking into account titles, authors and genres. This analysis allows us to establish differences between organized independent publishers and the big transnational publishing houses. These differences are evident in terms of the number, diversity and cultural interest of the publications. In addition, this analysis allows us to establish specific ties between the production of Editors of Chile and the cultural and political objectives of their discourse. scenarios.

1410	Caractérisation d'une famille de récepteurs kinases impliqués dans le développement gamétophytique chez Arabidopsis thaliana	Cell to cell communication is paramount during plant developmental processes, from cellular identity in early organogenesis to pollen tube guidance. In response to this requirement, molecular cell signalling is used to perceive an external signal and transduce the response by an intracellular signalling cascade leading to specific gene activation. The sensing protein is typically a receptor kinase, which will transduce the stimulus by phosphorylation of a cytoplasmic interaction partner. Although plant receptor kinases represent the largest protein kinase family, only handfuls are well characterized. By sequence identity (orthology), a family of leucine-rich repeat receptor kinases from Arabidopsis thaliana was identified as AtORK11 (Arabidopsis thaliana Ovule Receptor Kinase 11). Based upon previous results from its ortholog in Solanum chacoense, the ovary- specific ScORK11 receptor kinase, we hypothesized that members of the AtORK11 receptors would be involved in gametophyte development and reproduction. In order to characterize the role of the four family members (AtORK11a, AtORK11b, AtORK11c and AtORK11d), a T-DNA insertional mutant strategy was undertaken, as well as bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays (BiFC). No precise function could be assigned to the double mutants although a dominant negative strategy revealed an involvement in gametophytic development. It was also shown that all of the receptors could form homodimers as well as heterodimers in a heterologous system, suggesting high functional redundancy for the AtORK11 family.	transduction de signal , leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase , signal transduction , T-DNA insertion mutant , bimolecular fluorescence complementation , tungsten microparticle bombardment	en	3756.0
1411	Un formalisme pour la traçabilité des transformations	When developing software system in industry, system specifications are heavily used in communication among analysts and developers. However, system evolution, employee turn-over and shorter deadlines lead those documents either not to be up-to-date or not to be consistent with the actual system source code. Yet, having up-to-date documents would greatly help analysts and developers and reduce development and maintenance costs. Therefore, we need to keep those documents up-to-date and consistent.  We propose a novel mathematical formalism to describe and manipulate the evolution of these documents. The mathematical formalism is based on Hoare triple to represent the transformations and group theory and groups homomorphisms to manipulate these transformations and apply them on different representations.  We illustrate our formalism using two representation of a same system: PADL, that is an abstract design specification (similar to UML), and JCT, that is an Abstract Syntax Tree for Java. We also define transformations describing their evolutions, and transformations transposition from one representation to another. Finally, we provide an implementation of our illustration, a plugin for the Eclipse IDE detecting source code transformations made by a developer and a source code generator for integrating new representations in the implementation.	traceability , model , source code , group theory , transpositions , transpositions	en	3747.0
1412	L’acquisition du subjonctif chez les apprenants adultes de français langue seconde	This project aims at understanding the difficulties related to the acquisition of the French subjunctive in second language adult learners. More specifically, we will try to determine the different elements involved in its acquisition.   To begin with, we will present language theories from the 1950s to the present in order to shed light on the various elements affecting second language acquisition in adults. We will then look specifically at the situation of the French subjunctive. The subjunctive mode is generally described in the literature as difficult to acquire because its usages are complex and unique to the French language. However, as we will see, some studies have proven that the subjunctive in oral French is in fact quite simple. We will end this section by describing the subjunctive and its applications. This description will demonstrate the wide theoretical range of these applications which we will later compare with those found in everyday oral French.    In the last two sections of this work, we will analyze and discuss the results of five studies on the use of the subjunctive in French as a first and second language. First, we will demonstrate that, contrary to the received idea in the literature, the complexity of subjunctive applications does not affect its acquisition. We will in fact show that in spoken language, the subjunctive is rarely used, while its applications are relatively simple. We will then show that the main cause of its difficulty lies with the incapacity of learners to notice those verbs in the input due to its low frequency and its relatively slight saliency (in other words, its conspicuousness). We will also see that the acquisition of the subjunctive tends to be delayed in the learning process, largely because that acquisition is dependent on the development of the complex sentences in which it is found.

1413	Caractérisation phénotypique et génotypique d’isolats de Salmonella Typhimurium provenant de porcs sains ou septicémiques	Salmonella Typhimurium infections represent an important threat both to the swine industry and public health since pig is also a reservoir for human infections. Multiresistance to antimicrobial agents is often associated with S. Typhimurium belonging to phage type (PT) 104, and these isolates can cause septicemia in fattening pigs. It is thus necessary to control the infection at the herd level to avoid meat contamination by these isolates. However, in order to develop more efficacious control measures, it is important to characterize isolates, better understand the pathogenesis of infection and identify virulence factors.  The main objective of this study was to characterize isolates of S. Typhimurium associated with septicemia in swine and to compare them to isolates recovered from healthy pigs.  Isolates of S. Typhimurium associated with septicemia in swine (CS) were compared to isolates recovered from healthy animals at slaughterhouses (WCS). The phage type of each isolate was identified and these isolates were characterized by antimicrobial resistance, SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting, and PFGE. Among the CS isolates, PT 104 represented 36.4% of isolates while it represented 51.5% of WCS isolates. Resistance to as many as twelve antimicrobial agents was found in isolates from CS and WCS. However, it was not possible to associate any particular protein to septicemic isolates. Multiple genetic profiles were identified among the isolates of PT 104.  Different steps of the pathogenesis of Salmonella infection were evaluated, in particularly the ability to adhere to and invade intestinal epithelial cell lines by CS and WCS isolates. The isolates recovered from diseased animals invaded intestinal epithelial cell lines at a higher rate than isolates from healthy pigs (P=0.003). Some isolates were selected according to their invasion rate and some analysis, using flow cytometry were done to evaluate phagocytosis, induction of apoptosis, and adhesion to intestinal mucus. The survival in monocytes was evaluated and the MATS method was used to evaluate the bacterial surface properties, measuring interactions with solvents. Isolates from WCS were more phagocytized than isolates fom CS at 15 minutes (P=0.02). We found no significant difference for the other methods used.  Using SSH, we also compared the genome of a CS isolate (#36) to that of a WCS isolate (#1), for the identification of putative virulence factors. Clones with chromosome and plasmids homology were obtained. It was therefore decided to analyze the plasmid profiles of all isolates. Two profiles (PL14 and PL20) were more frequently observed in the PT 104 isolates than in the isolates belonging to other phage types (P=0.01 and P=0.01, respectively). Various profiles were found in both isolates from septicemic pigs and those from healthy pigs. An interesting plasmid of the CS isolate was sequenced. This plasmid possesses genetic information for replication as well as a beta-galactosidase-α. It would be needed to characterize the role of these putative virulence factors in the future.  Our work suggests that isolates from septicemic pigs may be distinguished from isolates from healthy pigs by their better ability to invade intestinal cells as well as by a lower rate of phagocytosis in the early steps of infection. This study increased our knowledge on the pathogeny of S. Typhimurium infection in pigs.

1414	L’invariance au point de vue dans la représentation de l’organisation spatiale des composantes de formes complexes	Tree experiments were conducted to determine which codes underlie the representation of the spatial organisation of the components of complex shapes. The tree experiments used a simultaneous matching task of complex objects. For the negative trials, the objects could have categorical differences of configuration, metric differences of configuration, metric difference along with differences in the role of parts, and differences in the role of parts only. The 2D or 3D angular distance between the stimuli could vary. In experiment 1, the stimuli were presented with stereopsis and had a surface with high contrast texture. Experiment 2 replicates the condition of experiment 1, except that the contrast of the stimuli was reduced. The goal of this manipulation was to verify if the results of experiment 1 were replicated if task difficulty is increased. In experiment 3, the stimuli were presented without stereopsis and without texture. The tree experiments showed that a categorical code, and a code relevant to the role of the parts contribute to the discrimination of complex objects and that these codes are dependent to 2D and 3D orientation, independently of depth cues. The results also show a greater sensitivity to categorical than to metric configuration differences. Finally, a metric code also contributes to complex shapes discrimination. However, the contribution of this code disappears when the quantity of depth cues is reduced.	Complex shape , Configuration difference , Orientation invariance , Depth cues	en	3720.0
1415	Caractérisation clinique et génétique des myotonies congénitales classiques et atypiques au Saguenay Lac St-Jean	Congenital myotonic syndromes due to mutations of the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.4 differ from those due to mutations of the chloride channel CLC-1 as they tend to present atypical traits including painful myotonias and aggravation of symptoms with cold and potassium ingestion. Indeed, after completing the clinical and molecular characterization of a large cohort of patients affected with these rare conditions in the Saguenay Lac-St-Jean area, we were able to describe a new founder SCN4A mutation presenting with painful cold-induced myotonias and occasional dystrophic and paralytic episodes. Our study illustrates the wide phenotypic variability and the typical traits of SCN4A mutations. In addition, we were able to speculate on the probable physiological consequences of such mutations. Finally, we conclude by stressing the importance of familial screening in order to reduce the incidence of anesthetic complications associated with these conditions.

1416	Long-term effects of sports concussion	Question: This thesis aimed to address two fundamental issues: 1) Are there long-lasting effects of sports-related concussion on cognitive and motor functions? and 2) Are the adverse effects of recurrent concussions cumulative? Experimental Design: The cross-sectional thesis design included a group of active university-level athletes as well as a group of former athletes recruited more than three decades after their university years who were tested on neurophysiological measures of both cognitive and motor system functions. Methods: Event-Related potentials and neuropsychological tests were used to assess cognitive functions while transcranial magnetic paradigms were used to assess motor cortex excitability, a force platform was used to assess postural stability and a 3-dimensional recording device was used to track hand position when performing a rapid alternating movement task. Results: This thesis disclosed persistent and cumulative alterations of both cognitive and motor functions after sports concussions. Furthermore, subclinical, neurophysiological alterations found in young concussed athletes were exacerbated in former athletes with concussions who displayed quantifiable cognitive and motor functions decline more than three decades post-concussion. Discussion: These results suggest that sports concussions induce cognitive and motor functions abnormalities that worsen as a function of the number of concussions sustained.   Moreover, findings from the present thesis indicate that the deleterious effects of sports concussion on cognitive and motor system functions combined to those associated with the aging process lead to quantifiable decline on both cognition and motor functions.

1417	Don d'organes et groupes ethniques à Montréal : Le rôle des infirmières dans un contexte de décès neurologique	Organ donation and transplantation have been performed in many countries for more than forty years, however there still is some skepticism about this procedure. In her nursing practice, the author has also noticed that health care professionals are reluctant to offer organ donation to families of an ethnic origin other than quebecker. In order to understand the phenomenon, this work is first presenting a historical perspective and the contribution of the social sciences to this field. A critical review of the scientific literature follows, and allows identifying links between ethnic groups and opinions on organ donation. Finally, inspired by Leininger’s transcultural caring theory and given the shortcomings in published data, recommendations for nursing practice are proposed.	Leininger	en	3668.0
1418	Le rôle des récepteurs aux cannabinoïdes CB1 et CB2 dans le guidage axonal	Following differentiation, retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons, tipped at their distal end by the growth cone (GC), navigate through relatively long distances in a highly directed manner in order to establish functional synapses with thalamic and superior colliculus (SC) neurons. This is achieved with the help of extracellular guidance molecules which steer RGC axon growth by regulating GC morphology by means of attractive and/or repulsive mechanisms. In the adult brain, endocannabinoids (eCBs) exert an important neuromodulatory function by acting as retrograde messengers to regulate the function of many synapses. Endocannabinoids act mainly via their Gi/o protein coupled receptors CB1 (CB1R) and CB2 (CB2R). Due to their presence at the fetal and early postnatal periods, it has been proposed that eCBs and their receptors might be involved in several developmental events, such as cell proliferation and migration, axon guidance and synaptogenesis. We observed that during early postnatal development, components of the eCB system are expressed along the visual pathway (the optic chiasm, the lateral geniculate nucleus and the SC). To assess the implication of the eCB system, in vitro, embryonic retinal explant and primary neuron cultures were treated with pharmacological agonists and inverse agonists of CB1R and CB2R. These experiments demonstrated that these cannabinoid receptors modify the GC’s morphology. Most importantly, CB1R and CB2R act through the cAMP/PKA pathway to modulate the presence of DCC at the plasma membrane. In vivo, CB1R and CB2R play a major role and the absence of either one of them induces a decrease in eye-specific segregation of retinal projections. These results show an implication of CB1R and CB2R during RGC growth and retinothalamic development.	guidage axonal , DCC , PKA , Growth cone , axon guidance , cannabinoid receptors , RGC , DCC , PKA , cAMP	en	3661.0
1419	Nanoparticules Chitosane-PEG-FA-ADN pour la thérapie génique non virale et application du gène de l’IL-1Ra dans un modèle expérimental d’arthrite rhumatoïde	Considered to be one of the medical challenges of the coming decade, the success of gene therapy depends on the ability to deliver therapeutic DNA to target cells. Non-viral polymers, such as chitosan (Ch), a cationic polymer, can be easily combined with DNA. Once a complex is formed, DNA is protected from degradation by nucleases.  The first objective of this study was to define the characteristics of the best-suited Ch nanoparticle for maximum selective transfection in human epidermoid carcinoma (KB) cells in vitro. Nanoparticles varied by the presence or absence of folic acid (FA) and Ch’s molecular weight (MW 5, 25 and 50 kDa). They were then selected and combined with interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) gene, a natural blocker of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1beta (IL-1β). The second objective was to inject these carriers by the hydrodynamic method in a rat model of adjuvant-induced arthritis and to evaluate the inhibitory effects of IL-1Ra against inflammation in vivo.   Ch-DNA nanoparticles with FA and Ch25 demonstrated selective transfection and significantly increased it in KB cells in vitro. The inhibitory effects of IL-1Ra gene therapy in vivo were evident from lower expression levels of inflammatory factors (IL-1 and prostaglandin E2) and decreased macroscopic limb inflammation. The results also revealed the presence of human recombinant IL-1Ra protein in rat sera. Non-viral gene therapy with Ch-PEG-FA-DNA nanoparticles containing the IL-1Ra gene appears to significantly decrease inflammation in this experimental model of arthritis.

1420	Facteurs cognitifs liés à l'acquisition du lexique orthographique	The objective of the present thesis was to study the relation between cognitive factors (phonological treatment, visuo-attentional and lexical orthographic memory) and the acquisition of implicit and explicit orthographic knowledge.  A longitudinal study was conducted on a sample of 338 children from the kindergarten to their second year of primary schooling.  At the end of kindergarten, the tasks were an invented spelling test and tests assessing the cognitive factors at issue in the apprenticeship of written speech (phonological treatment, visuo-attentional treatment and short and long term memory).   The lexical explicit orthographic knowledge of these same children was evaluated at the end of their first and second year of school. The objective of the first study was to establish a link between the phonological treatment, visuo-attentional and orthographic lexical memory abilities and implicit orthographic knowledge of the children, before their formal apprenticeship of written speech.  The results showed that, contrary to what was long been advanced, the phonological treatment is not the only cognitive factor into play since the long term orthographic lexical memory ability as well as the visuo-attentional ability properly and independently contribute to the acquisition of orthographic knowledge.  The orthographic lexical memory is the factor which provides the strongest contribution.  The aim of the second study was to determine which cognitive factors assessed in kindergarten predict the subsequent explicit orthographic knowledge in first and second grades.   The results showed that the necessary conditions to the acquisition of lexical orthographic knowledge are phonological treatment ability, as well as short and long term memory abilities. The goal of third article was to bring to light the predictive role played by the spelling knowledge of kindergarten children to their orthographical knowledge in first and second grades, in connection with the cognitive abilities which are at the root of the apprenticeship of the written spelling, more particularly the phonological treatment, the visuo-attentional treatment and orthographic lexical memory.   The regressive analyses showed that, among the factors investigated in kindergarten, the implicit orthographical knowledge brings a unique contribution to the subsequent spelling knowledge evaluated by different orthographic tasks in first and second grades.   The important impact of early orthographical knowledge on the subsequent acquisition is not surprising because the first study proved that this knowledge is not only depending on the capability of lexical orthographical memory but also on the capability of phonological treatment. The results coming from those three articles present a non-negligible interest in the understanding of the acquisition of the written speech.  Indeed, these studies permitted to prove that, even before the formal apprenticeship of the writing, the child shows a genuine implicit knowledge of the written language. Moreover, and it is from this knowledge that the subsequent explicit knowledge will be built up.   This knowledge is dependent upon multiple factors among which are the ability of orthographic lexical memory, a cognitive factor whose contribution was not yet proven. The results of this research showed that it is possible to consider early screening measures in order to identify children susceptible to present specific apprenticeship difficulties in the written language.  This screening would allow an early and better targeted intervention, which would then reduce the impact of difficulties on the academic apprenticeships.

1421	Analyse des stratégies d’évaluation des technologies des corps policiers canadiens : le cas de l’Identité Judiciaire	Law enforcement has seen a proliferation of technological innovation in recent years. At the same time, the global recession has reduced the fiscal resources available to purchase and deploy new technological solutions. Thus, it is imperative that police forces select the technologies that offer a high return on investment. The technology assessment is the best method for achieving this goal. This research project analyzes different strategies of technology assessment employed by Forensic Identification units in federal and provincial police forces of Canada. This qualitative study is based on: 1) participant observations at the Surete du Quebec and 2) semi-structured interviews (n=11) with members of the Ontario Provincial Police and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. An integrated analysis of the study data offers new insight into the dynamics of technology assessment as currently employed in the police force. The current practices strive to maximize return on investment. Nevertheless, there are refinements that will increase the efficiency of mini-PTA (Police Technology Assessment) and harmonize the operational and theoretical needs required to facilitate the end users' job functions. Even with improvement, the mini-PTA is best suited for smaller, regional police forces. It cannot replace unilaterally the process of PTA conducted by large police technology assessment agencies.

1422	Paramétrisation de la rétrodiffusion ultrasonore érythrocytaire haute fréquence et pertinence comme facteur de risque de la thrombose veineuse	The aggregation of erythrocytes is the main determinant of blood non Newtonian behaviour under low shearing flow conditions. When red blood cells (RBCs) aggregate, they form « rouleaux » and complex tridimensional structures that increase blood viscosity from a few mPa.s to a hundred mPa.s. The reversible RBC aggregation phenomenon is attributed to weak adhesive links between erythrocytes that are readily broken by increasing flow shearing. Blood bulk rheological properties have been comprehensively studied. However, the in vivo physiological impacts of abnormal clustering of RBCs are more difficult to assess. Clinical studies have identified altered hemorheology as a risk factor for thrombosis, but a clear etiological relationship between abnormal aggregation and thrombosis has not yet been established, in part because clinical conclusions were derived from correlative findings. It is to note that cardiovascular diseases such as deep venous thrombosis generally occur at specific locations within the vascular bed, suggesting a hemodynamic contribution to the development of this disease. Consequently, it is postulated that in vivo hemorheological characterization may help shed some light on the role of RBC hyper-aggregation on cardiovascular disorders. Ultrasound imaging, a non-invasive method relying on the propagation of mechanical waves within biological tissues, is sensitive to RBC aggregation. Indeed, the study of backscattered waves allows characterizing blood microstructure in vivo and in situ under physiological flow conditions.  The work described in this thesis is based on prior simulation studies, performed at the Laboratory of Biorheology and Medical Ultrasonics of the University of Montreal Hospital Research Center, in which the backscattering of ultrasound from aggregating RBCs was modeled by considering a particle scattering strategy. In this approach, each RBC is a weak ultrasound scatterer (Born assumption) and the backscattering coefficient is modeled as the product of the RBC number density, the RBC backscattering cross section and a structure factor. This model relates variations in the backscattering coefficient to the RBC spatial organisation through the structure factor, which is the only parameter that changes during the aggregation process. A second order expansion in frequency of the structure factor was used to describe blood microstructure in terms of a packing factor W and an ensemble averaged aggregate diameter D. The model was first presented and validated by considering a homogenous shear flow condition using three broadband mono-element transducers. It was then extended in 2D to allow computation of parametric images in tube flow. An extrapolation based on the assumption that viscosity is related to the level of aggregation was used to compute local viscosity maps. Finally, a last contribution was the demonstration that a sudden increase in aggregation tendency directly promoted the formation of venous thrombosis in an experimental animal model. In that study, RBC aggregation, thrombus formation and flow variations were monitored longitudinally for two weeks using ultrasound. The results reported in this thesis suggest that rheological parameters on RBC clustering, ideally assessed in vivo and in situ, should be included in thrombosis risk profiling.	ultrasound , backscatter , red blood cell aggregation , structure factor , in vivo characterization , non Rayleigh scattering , Pluronics , Pluronics , local viscosity , thrombosis	en	3600.0
1423	Étude des voies d’apprêtement des antigènes viraux menant à la présentation antigénique par les CMH de classe I	Immune control of viral infections is mainly carried out by cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes. To achieve this, CD8+ T lymphocytes must be able to recognize infected cells and eliminate them. This recognition of infected cells occurs by the interaction of the T cell receptor (TCR) of CD8+ T lymphocytes and viral peptides associated with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I on the surface of host cells. This interaction is the key element triggering the elimination of infected cells. This emphasizes the major role of cellular mechanisms leading to the generation of antigenic peptides from viral proteins.  The traditional view of antigen presentation by MHC molecules proposes two segregated pathways. Indeed, it is widely accepted that endogenous antigens are processed by the ''classical'' MHC class I presentation pathway. This pathway involves the degradation of intracellular antigens by the proteasome complex in the cytoplasm of the cell, the resulting peptides are then translocated in the endoplasmic reticulum where they are loaded on MHC class I molecules, and finally peptide-MHC complex are exported at the cell surface to activate CD8+ T lymphocytes. In contrast, exogenous antigens internalized by endocytosis or phagocytosis are processed by hydrolases in the lytic endovacuolar compartment and the resulting peptides are loaded on MHC class II molecules. Thereafter, vesicle recycling mechanisms transport the peptide-MHC class II complex on the cell surface where they can stimulate CD4+ T lymphocytes.  However, the strict segregation of these two pathways has been revisited to account for the ability of antigen presenting cells to present exogenous antigens on MHC class I molecules by a process called cross-presentation. Moreover, the recent finding that intracellular peptides might also be presented by MHC class II molecules clearly emphasized the presence of interactions between these two antigen processing pathways that transgress the previously established dogma. The objective of the work presented here was to characterize the antigen processing pathways leading to antigen MHC class I presentation during herpes simplex type I (HSV-1) infection. In the results reported here, we describe a new antigen processing pathway resulting from the formation of autophagosomes in HSV-1 infected cells. This new pathway allows the transfer of viral antigens in a lytic vacuolar compartment during the late phase of infection. The development and activation of this second pathway of antigen processing leads to an increased MHC class I presentation of the viral glycoprotein B (gB) used as a model in this study. Moreover, our results describe the establishment of a new form of autophagosomes derived from the nuclear envelope in response to HSV-1 infection. This new form of autophagosomes also contributes to viral antigen transfer to lytic vacuolar compartment in parallel to the action of classical autophagy. Our results also show a close collaboration between the classical MHC class I presentation pathway and vacuolar pathway induced by the formation of autophagosomes, still reinforcing the idea that these two pathways interact together to ensure optimal antigens processing during viral infection. In the second part of the work presented here, we use HSV-1 infection and the resulting viral glycoprotein B to study membrane trafficking allowing the transfer of gB to degradative vacuolar compartments. Our results highlight the role of the endoplasmic reticulum in antigen transfer mechanisms that induce an amplified MHC class I presentation of the viral glycoprotein B.	phagosomes , lymphocyte T CD8+ , macrophage , autophagy , antigen presentation , herpes , CD8+ T lymphocyte , MHC , antigen processing , macrophage , endoplasmic reticulum , phagosome	en	3586.0
1424	Le Corps grotesque dans «Les Cent Contes drolatiques» d'Honoré de Balzac	Honoré de Balzac is mostly acknowledged, today, as the father of the novel and as the writer of La Comédie humaine. But we often forget that between 1830 and 1832, at the beginning of his career, the author wrote, mainly and like many writers of his time, short stories. Multiple factors can explain that interest, for example, Hoffman’s Contes fantastiques had been translated from German to French and their success was immediate. Moreover, the new mediums of literary publication, in magazines and newspapers, favoured the proliferation of the genre.   One corpus will keep our attention through these pages: Les Cent Contes drolatiques, a project, unpopular in his time, with which Balzac aimed to « restaurer l’école du rire  » in France. In the middle of the nineteenth century, the author recreated short stories like the ones that Rabelais, Verville and the reine de Navarre have written in their time, three or four centuries before. To do so, Balzac invented a language that simulated the old French and created grotesque characters.   What is, in Honoré de Balzac’s work, the aesthetic of laugh, and how does the author express that concept in his Cent Contes drolatiques? To answer these questions, we will study the manifestations of the grotesque in the entire production of the writer. Also, according to Mikhaïl Bakhtine, in L’Œuvre de François Rabelais et la culture populaire au Moyen Âge et sous la Renaissance , the grotesque, linked to laugh, is related to the body :  « Le trait marquant du réalisme grotesque est le rabaissement, c’est-à-dire le transfert de tout ce qui est élevé, spirituel, idéal et abstrait sur le plan matériel et corporel.  » Consequently, it is the representations of the body that, in a further reflection, we will examine. Finally, the study of the grotesque body in Les Cent Contes drolatiques will show another facet of Balzac’s writing, often ignored by researchers : the importance of laughter and the vision of the world that it communicates through literature.	nineteenth century , Honoré de Balzac , Les Cent Contes drolatiques , grotesque , body	en	3580.0
1425	Évaluation comparative de stratégies visant à augmenter les interventions de courte durée en cessation tabagique auprès du personnel infirmier de milieux hospitaliers	Introduction : Research results demonstrate a decrease in cigarette smoking when preventive professional interventions are routinely carried out. The Quebec recent literature reports that, nurses from different working areas assess their patient smoking habits 62 % of the time and recommend cessation in only 38 % of the situations. When this assessment is realized by hospital nurses, this percentage drops around 30 %. Knowing that nursing staff is present at the bedside 24 hours a day, a non-negligible influence of tobacco counselling by nurses is of potential interest for hospitalized patients. The objective of the present study is to compare, on medical and surgical units, the effectiveness of three strategies (interactive educational session, recall, and both together) to a control group, on the number of nursing interventions pertaining to cessation of cigarette smoking. Choice of those three strategies is based on reported effectiveness and transferability potential. Research design is experimental with group randomisation. Factorial model opens possibility to assess impact of each of the three strategies versus the control group. Pre and post strategy multi-measurements (at 1 and 3 months) are sought from nursing staff, patients, patient charts, management, nurses in charge of the centers for tobacco cessation. Results : Nursing staff completed questionnaires at time 1 (N = 156), at time 2 (N= 78), and at time 3 (N=69). Similarly, 156 patients were interviewed at time 1, 89 at time 2, and 98 at time 3. Results show that nursing staff assesses cigarette smoking habits for only 35,7 % of the patients, and their intent to stop smoking only 17,6 % of the time. Very few tobacco counselling interventions are carried out on medical and surgical units by nursing staff. Some barriers are identified, and nursing staff perceives a non-self-efficacy with regard to those interventions. Results do not allow confirmation of hypotheses. However, complementary statistical analyses show that the educational strategy increases the number of nursing interventions during a short period, and decreases perception of barriers to tobacco counselling. Impact of recall could not be assessed as it was not introduced as planned. Conclusion : Considering modest results from the strategies, the interactive educational sessions shows a short term effect on the nursing staff’s interventions,. The difficulties encountered during implementation of the strategies have been explained, which will be useful when planning future research in tobacco cessation.	attitude , educational intervention , tobacco cessation , tobacco , multiple strategies , experimental design , attitude , self-efficacy , nursing	en	3568.0
1426	Preuves interactives quantiques	This thesis is devoted to complexity theory based on the interactive proof paradigm. All classes defined in this way involve one or many infinitely powerful provers attempting to convince a verifier of limited power that a string belongs to a certain language. We will consider the classical model, in which the various participants are Turing machines, as well as the quantum model, in which they are quantum circuits. The literature review included in this thesis assume that the reader is familiar with the basics of complexity theory and quantum computing. This thesis presents the original result that the class NP can be characterized by a class of quantum interactive proofs of logarithmic size. The various classes are presented in an order that facilitates the treatment of interactive classes. The first chapter is devoted to the basic complexity classes; these will be useful points of comparison for classes presented subsequently. Chapters two and three respectively present classes with one and many provers. The presentation of the result mentioned above is the object of chapter four.	interactive proofs , complexity , quantum , characterization	en	3567.0
1427	Modulation du cytochrome P450 par l’insuffisance rénale chronique dans un modèle murin transgénique	Chronic renal failure (CRF) is associated with a decrease in the metabolic clearance of drugs, which is partly due to a reduced expression of cytochrome P450 (CYP450) and phase II enzymes, namely N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2). This phenomenon has been shown in the rat. We have previously demonstrated the role of parathyroid hormone (PTH) in CYP450 down-regulation in rats with CRF. However, the study of mechanisms underlying the down-regulation of CYP450 by PTH should be confirmed with the use of knockout mice. The aim of this study was, therefore, to confirm these results in a murine model. Firstly, to validate this experimental model, CRF was produced in C57BL/6 mice using the 3/4 subtotal nephrectomy. Protein and mRNA levels of hepatic CYP450 and Nat2 were then analyzed. The results showed that CRF down-regulates these enzymes, as previously observed in the rat.    Finally, PTH-null mice (PTH-/-) and their corresponding wild type (PTH+/+) were nephrectomized in order to analyze protein and mRNA expression of hepatic CYP450. If PTH is responsible for the decrease of CYP450 in the presence of CRF, then PTH-/- mice with CRF should not show any reduction in CYP450 expression compared to controls. The results concerning the PTH-/- mice could not be interpreted because PTH+/+ mice with CRF did not show any significant difference of CYP450 expression when compared to PTH+/+ controls. Thus, additional experiments must be conducted in order to determine the role of PTH in CYP450 down-regulation in CRF mice.

1428	Les déterminants de l’acceptation d’une affectation à l’international	This study’s main focus is the reasons that are involved in the acceptance of an international assignment. While the number of multinational corporations is increasing, so is the pressure to attract and select candidates that will accept an international assignment. Based on a sample of employees working in engineering and construction, our study had two main goals. First, we sought to identify which are the key individual, organisational and assignment variables in the decision to accept or refuse an international assignment. The second goal was to verify the relative importance of those key variables in the acceptation of an international assignment. Our analyses revealed that two individual variables and seven organisational variables have a significant and positive influence in the acceptance of an international assignment.

1429	"Sels de tétraarylphosphonium : synthèse et application à
la synthèse de la (–)-coniine ;
capacité trans-directrice du groupement amide en
cyclopropanation d’oléfines"	The development of new purification techniques is an important challenge for today’s academic and industrial chemists. Present methods in which a given reagent is linked to a solid support to facilitate recovery still have some issues. Indeed, the solubility properties of these supports, mainly polymers, are not always reliable. In this context, the group of Pr. Charette has recently reported the use of a tetraarylphosphonium salt (TAP) as a solubility control group. TAPs are soluble in solvents such dichloromethane and can be quantitatively precipitated by the addition of diethyl ether (Chapter 1). However, the preparation of these TAPs still remains a synthetic challenge. One of the goal of this thesis lead to the discovery of two complementary methods that are considered among the most versatile ways to access functionalized TAPs (Chapter 2). One of these methods is utilized by Soluphase Inc., which markets these salts. The efficiency of the TAP moiety as a solubility control group in the synthesis of small molecules has been demonstrated by the synthesis of (–)-coniine (Chapter 3). All of the synthetic intermediates were isolated by a simple precipitation/filtration sequence. The TAP-supported synthesis has proven to be more efficient than the unsupported one. The second part of this thesis has focused on the synthesis of different 1,1-disubstituted cyclopropanes. Such cyclopropanes are a common motif in many natural products and synthetic drugs. However, the cyclopropanation reaction between an alkene and a metal carbene bearing two acceptor groups still remains a synthetic challenge (Chapter 4). Indeed, this reaction suffers from a low level of diastereocontrol. Therefore, little data have been reported to date on the stereoselective cyclopropanation with such carbenes. Studying the Rh(II)-catalyzed cyclopropanation of alkenes, we have brought strong evidence in favor of a postulated model of this reaction (Chapter 5). This study has also led to the discovery of the «trans-directing ability» of the amide group in Rh(II)-catalyzed cyclopropanation. We have thus utilized this «trans-directing ability» of the amide group in the Rh(II)-catalyzed cyclopropanation to solve different problems observed in the literature. We first showed that it could enable the synthesis of 1,1-dicarboxy cyclopropanes (Chapter 6). Multi-step syntheses were previously necessary to access such products. We have also demonstrated that these new cyclopropanes are useful synthetic tools for the rapid synthesis of a variety of natural products and biologically active molecules. We have also used this «trans-directing ability» of the amide group in Rh(II)-catalyzed cyclopropanation to enable the synthesis of 1-cyano-1-carboxy cyclopropanes (Chapter 7). Achiral additives were found to increase the selectivity of different metal catalyzed cyclopropanation reactions. The wide scope and synthetic utility of these new cyclopropanes has been further demonstrated by several functional group transformations.

1431	Bribery: An Exploration of Uganda Perspectives	This is an investigation of the concept of bribery in a multicultural context. It is possible that the term and concept “bribery” do not exist in some African contexts. Uganda is taken as the example and centre for this discussion, and in particular Ankole. In order for both the term and concept to make sense, there is need for contextual definition and differentiation. Similarly the terms Ethics and Economic Policies need a contextual treatment. For instance, can Ethical Codes be universalised? The discussion suggests a shift from concentrating on the nature and impact of Ethics and Economics to the understanding of the contexts where they operate.

1432	Impact de l'haploinsuffisance du gène Sim1 sur le développement et la fonction du noyau paraventriculaire de l'hypothalamus	Obesity arises from imbalance of the energy homeostasis processes. Multiple anatomical and physiological evidence demonstrate the involvement of the hypothalamus in the regulation of energy homeostasis, i.e. appetite and energy expenditure. In particular, the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus plays a critical role in these important homeostatic processes. The PVN integrates multiple signals that come from the central nervous system and/or the periphery to control energy homeostasis. It regulates these processes through projections to the dorsal vagal complex (DVC), which includes the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (X) (DMV) and the adjacent nucleus of the solitary tract (NST), located in the brainstem.    A cascade of transcription factors involved in the specification of the PVN neurons has been described. One component of this cascade, the bHLH-PAS transcription factor SIM1, is required for the development of all neurons of the PVN. Mice homozygous for null alleles of Sim1 die shortly after birth, presumably because of the lack of PVN. In contrast, Sim1 heterozygous mice survive but show early-onset obesity. Interestingly, the number of PVN cells is reduced by 24% in Sim1+/- mice, suggesting that developmental defects may cause PVN dysfunction and, thus, contribute to the obesity phenotype.   In order to explore this hypothesis, we studied the impact of Sim1 haploinsufficiency on: 1) the development of the PVN and it efferent axonal projections; 2) energy homeostasis; and 3) neuronal pathways regulating energy homeostasis.    We used: 1) stereotaxic injections and immunological techniques to determine the impact of Sim1 haploinsufficiency on PVN, and it efferent axonal projections, development; 2) the pair-feeding paradigm to determine the impact of Sim1 haploinsufficiency on energy homeostasis; and 3) intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) and intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of pharmacological agents, melanotan II (MTII), leptin and cholecystokinin (CCK), to determine the impact of Sim1 haploinsufficiency on the neuronal pathways regulating energy homeostasis.     First, we noted that the expression of oxytocin (Ot) and argenin-vasopressin (Vp) mRNA is reduced by 61% and 65%, respectively, in the PVN of Sim1+/- E18.5 embryos. Furthermore, the number of OT- and VP-producing cells was found to be decreased by 84% and 41%, respectively, in Sim1+/- adult mice. Analysis of the retrograde axonal labelling of PVN neurons after stereotaxic injection of latex beads into the DVC of Sim1+/+ and Sim1+/- mice, showed a 74% reduction of PVN neurons projecting to the DVC. However, the molecular composition of the cells affected by a decrease of Sim1 remains unknown. These results indicate that Sim1 haploinsufficiency: i) specifically interferes with the development of OT- and VP-producing cells; and ii) abolishes the development of a subset of parvocellular neurons that project to the DVC. These observations therefore raise the possibility that developmental defects contribute to the obesity phenotype of Sim1+/- mice.   Second, we observed that pair-fed Sim1+/- mice do not gain more weight than littermate controls from 4 to 16 weeks of age. Moreover, qualitative and quantitative analyses showed significant increases of lean and fat mass, with hyperplasia of white adipose tissue and hypertrophy of brown adipose tissue, in Sim1+/- mice, but not in pair-fed animals. Additionally, at 16 weeks of age, insulin levels as well as liver and adipose tissue triglyceride content were not significantly different between Sim1+/+ and Sim1+/- pair-fed, but were significantly increased in Sim1+/- fed ad libitum. These results suggest that hyperphagia is the main if not the sole contributor to the obesity of Sim1+/- mice. They indicate that: i) Sim1 haploinsufficiency affects mainly food intake with no effect on energy expenditure; ii) food intake and energy expenditure are regulated by divergent pathways within the PVN; and iii) Sim1 haploinsufficiency specifically affects the feeding pathway without interfering with the thermogenesis pathway.   Third, we found that, in both mice genotype, injection of MTII, leptin or CCK induces a significant decrease in cumulative food intake. In fact, MTII i.p. injection decreases cumulative food intake of Sim1+/- and Sim1+/+ mice by 37% and 51% respectively, when compared to saline injection. Leptin i.c.v. injection reduces cumulative food intake by 47% and 32% in Sim1+/- and Sim1+/+ mice, respectively. Finally, CCK i.p. injection decreases food intake of Sim1+/- and Sim1+/+ mice by 52% and 36%, respectively. All in all, the results of these latter studies suggest that Sim1 haploinsufficiency diminishes the activity of neuronal pathways regulating energy homeostasis, in particular of pathways controlling food intake.   In conclusion, our work has shown that Sim1 haploinsufficiency affects several developmental processes of the PVN. These developmental defects may cause the dysfunction of physiological processes regulated by the PVN, including the control of food intake, and thus contribute to the hyperphagic obesity phenotype.    Sim1 heterozygous mice represent an interesting animal model of obesity in which hyperphagia is the main, if not the sole mechanism of their obesity. These mice could therefore represent a unique opportunity to investigate cellular and molecular mechanisms in control of food intake.

1433	"Analyse bayésienne et élicitation d’opinions d’experts en analyse de risques
et particulièrement dans le cas de l’amiante chrysotile"	Characterizing the carcinogenic potency of chrysotile asbestos fibres relies a great deal on subjective and uncertain judgements by experts and analysts, given heterogeneous and equivocal results of important epidemiological and toxicological studies. The probabilistic Bayesian approach in risk assessments quantifies these subjective judgements and their uncertainties, along with their impact on risk estimations, but it is rarely used in the public health context. This report examines how the Bayesian approach could have been applied to a recent elicitation of experts’ opinions to estimate the toxicity of chrysotile asbestos, the degree of convergence and divergence, as well as the uncertainty levels of these experts. The experts’ estimations on the relative toxicity of chrysotile and amphibole asbestos were similar in the case of mesothelioma. However, in the case of lung cancer, the heterogeneity of the studies resulted in diverging and incompatible probabilistic evaluations. The experts’ judgements seemed influenced by heuristic biases, particularly the affect and anchor heuristics associated with a controversial topic and to heterogeneous data. If the elicitation process had been prepared following a rigorous methodology, these heuristics and biases could have been mitigated.	expert , bayesian , asbestos , heuristic , expert , elicitation , toxicity	en	3345.0
1434	Economic Incentives and Liberal Equality	In order to assess to the degree to which the provision of economic incentives can result in justified inequalities, we need to distinguish between compensatory incentive payments and non-compensatory incentive payments. From a liberal egalitarian perspective, economic inequalities traceable to the provision of compensatory incentive payments are generally justifiable. However, economic inequalities created by the provision of non-compensatory incentive payments are more problematic. I argue that in non-ideal circumstances justice may permit and even require the provision of non-compensatory incentives despite the fact that those who receive non-compensatory payments are not entitled to them. In some circumstances, justice may require us to accede to unreasonable demands for incentive payments by hard bargainers. This leads to a kind of paradox: from a systemic point of view, non-compensatory incentive payments can be justified even though those who receive them have no just claim to them.

1435	What can the Stakeholder Theory Learn from Enron?	Roughly speaking, Enron has done for reflection on corporate governance what AIDS did for research on the immune system. So far, however, virtually all of this reflection on and subsequent reform of governance has come from those with a stake in the success of modern capitalism. This paper identifies a number of governance challenges for critics of capitalism, and in particular for those who urge corporations to voluntarily adopt missions of broader social responsibility and equal treatment for all stakeholder groups. I argue that by generally neglecting the governance relation between shareholders and senior managers, stakeholder theorists have underestimated the way in which shareholder-focused governance can be in the interests of all stakeholder groups. The enemy, if you will, is not capitalists (shareholders), but greedy, corrupt or incompetent managers. A second set of governance challenges for stakeholder theorists concerns their largely untested proposals for governance reforms that would require managers to act in the interests of all stakeholders and not just shareholders; in other words to treat shareholders as just another stakeholder group. I suggest that in such a governance regime it may be almost impossible to hold managers accountable to anyone – just as it was when state-owned enterprises were given “multi-stakeholder” mandates in the 1960s and 1970s.

1436	Constructive Universalism: Sen and Sensitivity to Difference	My answer will come from contrasting his theory with two related but distinct theories, and from connecting his discourse about need construction, identity, and democracy with his capability approach. His version of universalism I construe could be called “constructive universalism.” First, Sen’s theory is situated within universalism. Secondly further examination reveals that some distinct features of Sen’s work contrast starkly with other universalist accounts. The meanings of such feature are not so explicitly explained in his theory. To understand the meanings is the third task of this paper. I will further argue that his theory has great potential to take people’s difference seriously, and will present this interpretation from the perspective of feminist studies, disability studies, and cultural / post- colonial studies. How this potential can be realized will comprise the fourth part of this paper. I will present the case for understanding his theory as “constructive universalism,” and address how this interpretation could solve the above question.	Philosophie , Éthique , Économie	en	3286.0
1437	Les pratiques d’écriture et de sociabilité de Louise d’Épinay à la lumière de ses contributions à la Correspondance littéraire et de ses lettres à Ferdinando Galiani (1755-1783)	Louise d’Épinay’s contributions to the Correspondance littéraire (1755-1783) and her correspondence with Ferdinando Galiani (1769-1782) constitute two complementary corpora which allow us to understand this author’s practices of sociability and to reveal their interaction with her writing. Her critical work, her dialogues and her letters contribute to the co-opting of a social elite, via their circulation in the margins of good society and their extension of court society’s mechanisms of distinction. The analysis of self-representations and group-representations in these writings allow us to better understand the social representations that give them meaning and that explain their restricted circulation. This thesis, based on sociological concepts, proposes a renewal of Louise d’Épinay’s studies, and those of the women associated with Enlightenment salons.

1438	Décombres de l’avenir et projets rudéraux : les métamorphoses de Paris chez Verne, Hugo et Zola	"Between 1853 and 1870, many areas of the French capital are torn down to allow the establishment of new avenues by Baron Haussmann, Paris’ prefect under Napoleon III. These major urban projects have struck the social imaginary and became an object of fascination for literature. This essay is located on the grounds of sociocriticism and seeks to understand how Verne’s, Hugo’s and Zola’s texts interpret the Paris’ new urban conformation. In Paris au XXe siècle (1863) Jules Verne is planning future destructions and, in turn, imagines the strange constructiveness of residual past. Although in exile, Victor Hugo is very aware of urban and social changes under way. In Paris (1867) his writing works to make compatible the ideas of ruin and progress. Émile Zola with Paris (1898) reflects the contradictions accompanying urban change through medical and organic metaphors close to ""the decadence’s spirit"" that characterizes the end of the century. In accordance with the aims of the sociocriticism’s approach, the research develops itself from an internal reading of works, drawing on the resources of texts’ analysis, poetics and narratology. The essay also mobilizes diverse works on relations between literature and the city, as well as works of synthesis produced in the fields of general history and of urban planning history."	literature , sociocriticism , city , Haussmann , Haussmann , second Empire , Second Empire , ruin , Hugo, Victor , Hugo, Victor	en	3269.0
1439	La IIIe République et Bismarck : le rôle des opportunistes dans le compromis franco-allemand	The European concert is often perceived, at least from the 1871s to 1890, as the unmistakable work of the German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck and the major politicians of his time. The said Bismarckian policy  effectively influenced most of the interactions between opposing parties, particularly between France and Germany. Its bearing on the French policy  is such that it affects home and foreign policies. The opportunist republicans will personify this ambiguous reaction to new German giant. A pragmatic attitude allows them, between 1878 and 1885, to recover their former role as well as to guide a strong nationalist feeling. If the opportunists are often blamed for having preferred the short term, the governments of Ferry, Gambetta, Waddington and Freycinet governments managed to handle Bismarckian policy skilfully. Familiar with its ephemeral character, opportunist governments knew how to find advantages, insure that France recover its diplomatic position and acquire new colonial territories while protecting a certain independence vis-à-vis the Iron Chancellor.

1440	Epistémologie historique de l'étude du comportement animal	In this inquiry I undertake to explore the notion of animal behaviour as it is expounded in a contemporary field of inquiry: behavioural ecology. In order to carry out an analysis of such a complex notion, localized in a very narrow context, I design and use a specific tool of investigation called “historical epistemology”. Simply understood, this tool consists in the integration of diachronic and synchronic perspectives of investigation into a single approach to investigate a circumscribed theme. So, in order to proceed to the analysis of the notion of animal behaviour, I first draw into the recent history of behavioural ecology. I take special interest in its filiation with classical ethology and, after having reconstructed the historical frame that links the two fields together, I proceed to compare them. This comparison, the second step of my epistemology, is used to highlight the characteristics of the animal behaviour conceptions put forward by the two scientific disciplines. These distinctions, bringing to the fore the specificity of behavioural ecology, then allow me to scrutinize the notion of animal behaviour as it is instantiated in the main approaches mobilized by the discipline (especially what I identifies as the “phenotypic adaptationist”, the “phenotypic structural”, the “comparative” and the “by reduction” approaches). Last, I design two definitions of the notion of animal behaviour. The first one reflects the ontological status of the notion in this field of investigation, whereas the second corresponds to the conception underlying behavioural ecologist practices.	instinct , Tinbergen , Lorenz , behavioural ecology , ethology , animal behaviour , instinct , philosophy , biology	en	3257.0
1441	Droits de propriété intellectuelle et protection des plantes: approches, limites et perspectives	The intellectual property rights have showed increasing attention to the evolution of plant research in recent years. This has been reflected, at the international level through the adoption of several measures to ensure a fairly comprehensive protection of rights arising. These measures include the Convention of the Union for the protection of Plant breeder' Rights, which is part of a logic of protection through sui generis with the possibility of issue plant breeders' rights to breeders; the Agreement on Intellectual Property Rights Related to Trade, which, in addition to recommending an effective sui generis system gives the option of protection by patent or by the combination of the two systems of law to protect plant varieties; the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and the Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture, which supported both previous forms of protection, ask to be taken into account considerations on sovereign rights of nations over their plant resources, benefit sharing, and so on. At the regional level, there are the initiative of the Africa which aimed to ensure the protection of plants following a certain vision shared between alignment on existing international standards or the institution of another original legislation which reflects the realities and concerns of the continent. It then appears that there are several tools to handle the same reality, which can be a source of difficulty. These are difficulties are conceptual, socio-economic, environmental and legal. T0 overcome these difficulties, it is important that certain conditions are met to harmonise points of view between different actors involved in the issue and ensure a consistent ownership of the instruments adopted.

1442	L'étude du rôle immunomodulateur des IVIG dans un modèle murin humanisé de réaction du greffon contre l'hôte	Graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) is a major complication following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), occuring in 30 to 70% of HSCT despite proper prophylactic treatment, and can result in death. It is therefore primordial to improve the prophylactic treatments in order to reduce the frequency and severity of GvHD. Since these prophylactic treatments are based on the use of immunosuppressive agents, they inhibit the immune reconstitution and thus increase the risk of infections and relapse. Because of their immunomodulating properties, immunoglobulins (IVIG) represent a promissing alternative. Furthermore, IVIG are already widely used in patients with immune deficits. Since no study has yet clearly shown that IVIG can reduce GvHD without inhibiting the immune reconstitution in the patient, the scientific community is still debating their usefullness in GvHD prevention. Should their efficacy to reduce the incidence and severity of GvHD without impairment to the immune reconstitution be demonstrated, the use of IVIG could change the clinical outcome for HSCT patients, improving their remission and quality of life. The objectives of this project are to evaluate IVIG efficacy in GvHD prevention and to define the mechanism of action of IVIG. To fulfill these objectives, we will use a GvHD humanized mouse model, which consists of injecting huPBMCs in immunodeficient mice who can not reject them. Our results demonstrate an immunomodulatory effect of IVIG, allowing for reduced clinical signs and a slighlty increased survival in GvHD. A population of NK cells also appeared upon IVIG treatment and is believed to be indirectly induced by IVIG.

1443	La Visualisation in vivo des « espèces oxygénées radiculaires» au niveau des cellules ganglionnaires de la rétine	Title: Imaging Reactive Oxygen Species in RGCs In vivo Purpose: Reactive oxygen species not only are generated as a result of cellular injury, but also serve as signaling molecules for a variety of critical processes, including mitosis and cell death. We previously reported that injury to RGC axons induces a burst of superoxide within the cell body, probably of mitochondrial origin (Lieven et al, 2006). We now describe a method for imaging of reactive oxygen species within the retina of the living animal using a confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope called the Heidelberg Retina Angiograph 2 (HRA2) equipped with dual lasers. Methods: Following preliminary studies using other indicators (hydroethidium; HEt) for reactive oxygen species, we attempted to image reactive oxygen species in the in vivo model using 5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, acetyl ester (CM-H2DCFDA). The resultant images were quantified using ImageJ. One optic nerve of Long-Evans rats was crushed intraorbitally, sparing the retinal circulation. In some rats the superior colliculi of Long-Evans rats had been previously exposed via craniotomy and overlaid with Gelfoam saturated with indocyanine green (ICG). At varying time points the animals were injected intravenously or intravitreally with HEt or CM-H2DCFDA and imaged with fluorescein and/or ICG filters using the HRA2. Results: We demonstrated multiple bright foci of fluorescence in the ganglion cell layer when we retrogradely labeled with ICG bilaterally, indicating that ICG was a retrogradely transported dye that could be detected with the HRA2. Following axotomy and intravitreal injection of CM-H2DCFDA, there was bright fluorescence in the fluorescein channel in a few cells in the ganglion cell layer, consistent with production of one or more reactive oxygen species. There was no cross-talk between the fluorescein and ICG channels when detecting ICG or CM-H2DCFDA, respectively. Conclusions: Retrograde labeled RGCs can be identified and levels of reactive oxygen species measured using a dual frequency confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope.

1444	Peinture de lumière incidente dans des scènes 3D	Lighting design is usually a task that is done manually, where the artists must manipulate the parameters of several light sources to obtain the desired result. This task is difficult because it is not intuitive. Some systems already exist that enable a user to paint light directly on objects in a scene to position or alter light sources. Unfortunately, these systems have some limitations such that they only consider local lighting, or the camera must be fixed, etc. Either way, this limitates the accuracy or the versatility of these systems. Global illumination is important because it adds a lot of realism to a scene by capturing all the light interreflections on the surfaces. This means that light sources can influence surfaces even if they are not directly exposed.  In this M. Sc. thesis, we study a subset of the lighting design problem: the selection and alteration of the intensity of light sources. We present two different systems to design lighting on objects in 3D scenes. The user paints light intentions directly on the objects to alter the surface illumination. From these paint strokes, the systems find the light sources and alter their intensity to obtain as much as possible what the user wants. The novelty of our technique is that global illumination, transparent surfaces and subsurface scattering are all considered, and also that the camera is free to take any position. We also present strategies for selecting and altering the light sources.  The first system uses an environment map as an intermediate representation of the environment surrounding the objects. The second system saves all the information of the environment for each vertex of each object.	Rendu inverse , Light Design , Inverse Rendering , Global Illumination , Painting Metaphor	en	3160.0
1445	Activités antidiabétiques et neuroprotectrices du jus de bleuet biostransformé	Blueberry demonstrates therapeutic potential against cancer, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. These desirable effects are thought to involve abundant phenolic compounds in blueberry such as anthocyanins and flavonoids. Blueberry juice biotransformation by Serratia vaccinii bacteria increases its phenolics content, its antioxidant activity and modifies its physiological properties. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the neuroprotection activity and the antidiabetic potential of biostranformed blueberry juice (BJ). BJ was studied for: 1) Protection of neurons (N2a) against oxidative stress caused by hydrogen peroxide; 2) Stimulation of glucose uptake by muscle cells (C2C12) and adipocytes (3T3-L1); 3) Anti-hyperglycemic activity in diabetic obese KKAy mice. Indeed, whereas normal blueberry juice did not show any effect, BJ increased antioxidant enzymes activities (catalase, SOD) and protected neurons against modifications in MAPKs pathways and toxicity induced by hydrogen peroxide. BJ also increased glucose uptake by 48% in C2C12 cells and by 142% in 3T3-L1 cells. Enhanced glucose uptake could not be explained by an increase of cytosolic calcium but was related to the stimulation of AMPK phosphorylation. Moreover, BJ inhibited 3T3-L1 adiopogenesis. BJ also reduced hyperglycemia of obese diabetic KKAy mice and protected pre-diabetic young mice against the development of obesity and diabetes mellitus. The anti-hyperglycemic effect of BJ may involve adipokine pathways since BJ increased adiponectin levels in diabetic mice. Thus, BJ represents a promising approach for the prevention and treatment of diabetes mellitus and possibly neurogenerative diseases as well as a source of novel therapeutic agents against these disorders.

1446	Étude de la sensibilité baroréceptive en sommeil et à l’éveil dans l’insomnie primaire chronique	Insomnia, one of the most common sleep complaint in the general population, is characterised firstly by a difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep and/or early awakenings or non-restorative sleep. Insomnia is defined as primary when not principally due to another medical or psychiatric condition or other sleep disorder, whereas a minimum of 6 months duration is required to define chronic insomnia.  Some authors have hypothesized that insomnia is associated with a state of hyperarousal characterized by increased sympathetic activity during sleep and wakefulness.  The arterial baroreflex is an important mechanism providing continuous short term regulation of heart rate and blood pressure (BP) by means of the autonomic nervous system influences over the pacemaker and the peripheral circulation.  Baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) is the baroreflex’s capacity to react and control BP changes by adjusting the heart rate.  BRS is known to be heightened during the night compared to daytime. Also, it seems that the baroreflex could be involved in the physiological day-to-night BP fall.  Previous data from our laboratory demonstrated in subjects with chronic primary insomnia, higher night-time systolic BP and a significant attenuation of the physiologic day-to-night systolic BP fall compared to good sleepers.  Besides, the baroreflex has been shown to be altered early in several cardiovascular diseases and to precede hypertension.  Subjects with insomnia have been shown to have a higher likelihood to develop daytime hypertension.  All of these findings point in the direction of altered BP regulatory mechanisms in insomnia.  Furthermore, a reduction of BRS could be implicated in states where higher sympathetic autonomic activity is observed.  We hypothesised that the baroreflex could be one of the BP control mechanisms which are altered in insomnia and could be involved in the heightened sympathetic activity observed in insomnia.  To our knowledge, the baroreflex has never been investigated previously in insomnia.  The primary goal of this study was to investigate non-invasively BRS during wakefulness and sleep in 11 subjects with chronic primary insomnia compared to 11 good sleepers.  Baroreflex was investigated spontaneously by the sequence method and by the calculation of the alpha coefficient obtained by cross spectral analysis of RR interval and systolic BP.  Simultaneously, RR interval variability components were also compared during wakefulness and sleep between the two groups. No significant differences were found for indices of BRS between insomniacs and good sleepers during wakefulness and sleep.  However, slightly lower values of BRS during wakefulness and sleep were noted in insomniacs with poor sleep (sleep efficiency (SE) <85%) versus those with good sleep (SE≥ 85%) at the experimental night.  As a secondary finding, no differences were found between the insomniacs and the good sleepers for any of the RR variability components considered (RR interval, PNN50, LF and HF in their normalized units).  Indeed, insomniacs like good sleepers exhibited normal variation of autonomic activity during sleep as depicted by the RR variability components. Our preliminary results suggest that baroreflex mechanisms are preserved in subjects with a subjective complaint of chronic primary insomnia. Nevertheless, certain impairment may occur in insomniacs as a function of objective measures of poor sleep.	Baroreflex , Insomnia , Autonomic nervous system , Sleep	en	3147.0
1447	Perfectionism, Economic (dis)Incentives, and Political Coercion	May a government attempt to improve the lives of its citizens by promoting the activities it deems valuable and discouraging those it disvalues? May it engage in such a practice even when doing so is not a requirement of justice in some strict sense, and even when the judgments of value and disvalue in question are likely to be subject to controversy among its citizens? These questions have long stood at the center of debates between political perfectionists and political neutralists. In what follows I address a prominent cluster of arguments against political perfectionism—namely, arguments that focus on the coercive dimensions of state action. My main claim is simple: whatever concerns we might have about coercion, arguments from coercion fall short of supporting a thoroughgoing rejection of perfectionism, for the reason that perfectionist policies need not be coercive. Thlist challenges to this last claim.		en	3136.0
1448	"Modulation de l’expression du gène CFTR par le produit du gène FIC1 responsable de la
cholestase familiale intra-hépatique progressive de type 1 :
Identification des mécanismes moléculaires impliqués"	Human Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis type 1 (PFIC1) is a rare genetic disease provoked by mutations inside the ATP8B1 gene resulting in a general loss of bile acids secretion. An episodic and less severe syndrome called Benign Recurrent Intrahepatic Cholestasis (BRIC) have also been associated with mutations in this gene. PFIC1 patients are suffering from many extra-hepatic manifestations. Some of these manifestations are common to Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients, carrying mutations in CFTR gene. Moreover, expression of CFTR is decreased for some PFIC1 patients. This study was carried out to define the role of ATP8B1 in the modulation of CFTR gene expression and protein function. A first approach was to identify both gene expression and protein synthesis among various cell lines. Then, we developed a second approach based on in silico analysis of structure and function of ATP8B1 to construct a 2D model of the protein. This approach was correlated with the localization of known mutations of ATP8B1. This analysis showed two possible protein maturation sites, a rich phosphorylation domain and a nuclear receptor interacting domain. The cleavage of the 180 kDa peptide generates a 145kDa (ATPase) and a second cleavage produces a 90 kDa, all identified with a specific antibody directed toward the C-Terminal region of the protein. The 90 kDa peptide should be readdressed to the nucleus after myristoylation to interact with nuclear receptors and transcription factors. This analysis was completed by an interactomic approach which has shown a possible interaction between CFTR and ATP8B1 proteins either directly or mediated by a linker, PDZK1. The last part of this work was dedicated to assess the role of ATP8B1 on the activity of CFTR using two cell lines expressing two different mutated ATP8B1 genes. From all these results, we concluded that ATP8B1 is probably involved in the regulation of CFTR gene expression and CFTR maturation and function. We therefore propose a schematic representation of ATP8B1 synthesis and maturation associated with its putative biological functions in the cell.

1449	Les effets d’un traitement au corticostérone sur la transmission dopaminergique mésocorticale du rat en période de stress	The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis plays an essential role in responding and adapting to stress, however overactivation of this axis or chronically high levels of glucocorticoids lead to pathological outcomes. The mesocortical dopamine (DA) system, terminating in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), plays an adaptive role in protecting against stress, yet the functional interactions between glucocorticoids (eg. corticosterone) and the mesocortical DA system are not clear. In the present studies, we investigated the effects of glucocorticoids on prefrontal DA function using osmotic minipumps to chronically elevate corticosterone levels in the high physiological range (1 mg/kg/hr for 7 days). Chronic corticosterone treatment did not significantly affect post mortem levels of DA and its metabolites in PFC tissue in either unstressed or stressed rats. However, using in vivo voltammetry to monitor changes in extracellular DA release in PFC, corticosterone significantly increased DA release in response to both types of stress examined, exposure to predator odor and tail pinch stress. We conclude that corticosterone indeed potentiates mesocortical DA function, which in turn facilitates negative feedback regulation in times of stress.

1450	Are Cities Illiberal? Municipal Jurisdictions and the Scope of Liberal Neutrality	One of the main characteristics of today’s democratic societies is their pluralism. As a result, liberal political philosophers often claim that the state should remain neutral with respect to different conceptions of the good. Legal and social policies should be acceptable to everyone regardless of their culture, their religion or their comprehensive moral views. One might think that this commitment to neutrality should be especially pronounced in urban centres, with their culturally diverse populations. However, there are a large number of laws and policies adopted at the municipal level that contradict the liberal principle of neutrality. In this paper, I want to suggest that these perfectionistlaws and policies are legitimate at the urban level. Specifically, I will argue that the principle of neutrality applies only indirectly to social institutions within the broader framework of the nation-state. This is clear in the case of voluntary associations, but to a certain extent this rationale applies also to cities. In a liberal regime, private associations are allowed to hold and defend perfectionist views, focused on a particular conception of the good life. One problem is to determine the limits of this perfectionism at the urban level, since cities, unlike private associations, are publicinstitutions. My aim here is therefore to give a liberal justification to a limited form of perfectionism of municipal laws and policies.		en	3116.0
1451	Le multiculturalisme, un projet républicain?	The appropriation of the theme of multiculturalism by republican thinkers is the subject of this article. One may start by doubting that the very idea of a republican multiculturalism makes any sense, but as I shall show, the repudiation of any multicultural republican project is a French exception. Neo-republican thinkers such as Philip Pettit, John Maynor and Cécile Laborde have given special attention to multiculturalism. I will investigate the peculiarities of each of these approaches and, in particular, how Laborde resolves the tensions that neo-republicans may entertain with the recognition of cultural diversity, by inserting a critical perspective in the deliberative proposition initiated by Maynor. The originality of a republican multiculturalism is thus to recall the instrumental nature of the politicization of minority identities in the struggle against the ascription of identity faced by minorities, and not to enhance their public differences.		en	3104.0
1452	The Trouble with Inversion: an Examination of Science Sexual Orientation	Although some are excited about the possibility of using current scientific research into the biological causes of sexual orientation to ground rights claims, I argue that basing rights claims on this research is unwise because this research, specifically the hormonal, genetic, and structural research, is organized around the inversion assumption, a conceptual scheme within which some aspect of the biology of gay men and lesbians is thought to be inverted along sex lines.While there are many reasons to worry about the use of the inversion assumption, I focus on problems that arise from a further set of claims that must be assumed in order to make the use of the inversion assumption coherent. This further set of assumptions includes the claims (1) that heterosexuality is the standard state and that (2) this standard state is sexually-dimorphic and (3) deterministic. I argue that this set of assumptions is problematic because it results in ideological consequences that are both sexist and heterosexist.		en	3098.0
1453	Virus-Host Interaction during Therapy against Hepatitis C Virus	Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major public health problem worldwide.  Only 15-30% of infected individuals clear the virus spontaneously, while the majority develops chronic infection that causes liver complications. The only approved therapy for HCV is interferon alpha (IFN-α) based. This therapy has a 50-80% success rate depending on the infecting virus genotype and the timing of initiation of therapy. Factors governing the response to therapy are not well defined.  Previous studies have suggested a role for the host immune response in the success of therapy. However, these results were controversial.   We hypothesized that host immunity has an effective role in the success of IFN-α therapy when initiated early during the acute phase of HCV infection, while late initiation during the chronic phase minimizes this role. The main objective of this thesis was to dissect the immunological factors governing the differential response to IFN-α therapy, and to determine if the contribution of the immune response to success of therapy might be influenced by the period of infection.   Our results demonstrate restoration of efficient HCV-specific immune responses when therapy is initiated early during the acute phase. This is demonstrated by the rescue of functional HCV-specific T cells similar to those observed in spontaneously resolved individuals, suggesting that they may play an active role in response to therapy. However, such responses were not restored following late therapy suggesting irreversible damage to the host’s defence system with chronicity. These findings have important implications in understanding the mechanisms underlying response to current treatments and development of novel therapies.

1454	The Economics Of Civil Law Contract And Of Good Faith	In his 1993 book on the Limits of Freedom of Contract, Michael Trebilcock acknowledged the difficulties of trying to set criteria for correcting informational asymmetries. Informational asymmetries are one opening for opportunism and it has been generally acknowledged that one of the fundamental objectives of legal systems is to curtail opportunism. A civil-code based legal system has the ambition of being closed, i.e. covering all difficulties in private relationships within its purview. To accomplish this, it has to rely on open-ended concepts that can be used in unforeseen circumstances; yet legal certainty requires that such concepts be used sparingly and that recurrent circumstances calling for their application be particularised into more specific concepts having their own more detailed legal regime. The paper seeks to make the case that good faith in civil law systems is the exact opposite of opportunism; that it is one of the residual open-ended concepts 'closing' the system; and that it is particularised in a number of civil code concepts. These developments allow us to illustrate the difficulties Michael foretold in his book.	economic analysis of law , civil law , Civil Code , contract , opportunism , good faith	en	3016.0
1455	Le processus d'adhésion à l'Union Européenne est-il en mesure de contribuer davantage que la Convention européenne à la protection des droits de l'homme en Turquie?	The issue of the accession of Turkey to the European Union is one of the most controversial topics as regards to human rights. The sensitive issues such as the kurdish problem and the conflict with Cyprus are the main cause of the most restrictions of the rights and freedoms and complaints lodged against the Turkish State before the European court of Human Rights. Turkey has the essential characteristics of a modern and secular state, but its democracy prove to be fragile. Thus, the powerful role of the army in many areas of political life can be explained by the malfunctioning of the democracy, giving to the régime an authoritative aspect. The Turkish army is seen as the guardian of the unity, security and identity of the nation. Indeed, the access to modernity is due to the control of the army, but the régime in Turkey needs to undertake major policy reforms to converge with European Union policies. The judicial and administrative system set by the army in 1982 does not sufficiently protect the justiciable. The exceptional measures such as state of emergency, security state courts, anti-terrorist law contributed to the violation of human rights and emphasized the contradiction between conventional law and national law. Turkey has made progress towards modifying its legal system in order to give more independence and impartiality. The accession partnership will certainly enable Turkey to review its Constitution and relevant legislation in providing basic freedoms, the rule of law and respect of human rights in conformity with the European Union's own standards. Turkey's inclusion in the enlargement process has not only increased European Union leverage over Turkish politics, but revitalized Turkey's European vocation.

1456	Les sources d'incohérences des initiatives de financement du logement social au Nicaragua	Nicaragua suffers of a very important housing deficit. The bulk of it is due to the inability of the finance sector to attend low income families. Numerous initiatives were implemented by organization from the three societal sectors to alleviate this problem. Some were successful, others were not. Today, although the objectives set by these initiatives seems to respond the existing problem, the deficit keeps on deepening. This thesis offers to analyse the causes of the problem and to understand why the implemented initiatives are not functioning as they should. It emphasizes the lack of coordination existing and demonstrates that the whole sector functions in accordance with a silo approach which is itself indicative of a lack of housing finance policy coherence. Finally, it analyses the possible origin of such an organization and of the policy incoherence that brought it. Through this analysis it attempts to clarify the respective accountability of the Nicaraguan State and the ODA which is the main financing source of these programs.

1457	Directed evolution of human dihydrofolate reductase: towards a better understanding of binding at the active site	Human dihydrofolate reductase (hDHFR) is an essential enzyme for cellular proliferation and it has long been the target of antifolate drugs for the treatment of various types of cancer. Despite the clinical effectiveness of current antifolate treatments, new drugs are required to reduce the side-effects associated with their use. An essential requirement for design of new antifolates is a better understanding of how these drugs interact with their targets.  We applied directed evolution to identify mutant hDHFR variants with modified binding to some clinically relevant antifolates. A saturation mutagenesis approach was used to create genetic diversity at active-site residues of hDHFR and a new, efficient screening strategy was developed to identify the amino acids that preserved native activity and/or conferred antifolate resistance. The screening method consists in a high-throughput first-tier bacterial selection coupled with a second-tier in vitro assay that allows for rapid detection of the best variants among the leads, according to user-defined parameters. Many active, antifolate-resistant mutants of hDHFR were identified. Moreover, the approach has proven efficient in rapidly assessing kinetic (kcat) and inhibition parameters of the hDHFR variants (IC50). Structure-function relationship analysis based on kinetic investigation, available structural and functional data as well as modeling were performed. By monitoring which mutations have the greatest effect on binding, we have begun to build a molecular picture of the contacts involved in drug binding. By varying the drugs we test against, we gain a better understanding of the specific binding properties that determine ligand discrimination.	human dihydrofolate reductase , methotrexate , drug-resistance , saturation and combinatorial mutagenesis , directed evolution , high-throughput screening , structure-function relationship , enzyme kinetics , molecular modeling	en	2894.0
1458	Caractérisation de la toxicocinétique de l’octylphénol chez le rat en vue d’une meilleure analyse de risque toxicologique des perturbateurs endocriniens	p-tert-Octylphenol is a degradation product of alkylphenol ethoxylates that can be found in the environment. It has been reported to act as a weak estrogenic compound by binding to the estrogen receptor. This study was undertaken to 1) develop a sensitive method for the determination of octylphenol in blood and various tissues using gas chromatography coupled with detection by mass spectrometry, 2) characterize the blood and tissues toxicokinetics of octylphenol in male and female Sprague-Dawley rats and 3) develop a physiologically-based toxicokinetic model for octylphenol that can describe/predict unchanged blood and tissues octylphenol concentrations in rats. Male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were given a single dose of octylphenol either by oral gavage, intravenous injection or subcutaneous injection. In a repeated dosing experiment, rats were given octylphenol (oral) daily for 35 days (female) or 60 days (male). Blood and tissue samples were collected at various time following the onset of exposure and analyzed for octylphenol content using a method developed in our laboratory. These results showed that blood and tissues octylphenol concentrations were generally higher in female than male rats. Experiments done with rat liver microsomes confirmed that these differences were related to octylphenol metabolism. The results of the repeated exposure study indicate that there is no bioaccumulation of octylphenol at these exposure levels. A physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model for octylphenol was developed and validated using the data obtained in female and male rats. The model simulates adequately blood and tissues octylphenol concentrations following oral, intravenous or subcutaneous exposure. In conclusion, this study provided essential data on the toxicokinetics of octylphenol. These data are essential to predict the relationship between the internal and the external dose of octylphenol and will facilitate the risk assessment of octylphenol in humans.

1459	Les rôles distincts des isoformes de myosine II non-musculaire dans des processus cellulaires impliquant le cytosquelette d'actine	We are interested in studying the modulation of the actomyosin complex which is involved in different cellular processes such as cell locomotion and apoptosis. The actomyosin complex is formed by the association of actin filaments and myosin II. The non-muscle myosin II is a hexamer formed by one pair of heavy chains (MHCs) and two pairs of light chain (MLC20 and MLC17). The actomyosin activity is dependent on MLC20 and MHCs phosphorylation. There are three isoforms of MHCs (MHCIIA, MHCIIB and MHCIIC) which have common but also distinctive roles in several cellular processes. Our aim is to clarify the structural and contractile functions of each isoforme of myosin II in different cellular processes, in particular, cell contraction and cell morphology. First, we studied the implication of myosin II isoforms in cell shrinkage and detachment during apoptosis which are both dependent on actomyosin contractility. We treated four different cell lines with TNFα in combination with cycloheximide (CHX) to trigger apoptosis. We confirmed that TNFα induced caspase-3 activation, ROCK1 cleavage and increased MLC20 phosphorylation. We showed that TNFα/CHX induced the caspase-dependent MHCIIA degradation, whereas MHCIIB levels and association with the actin cytoskeleton remained virtually unchanged. Cell shrinkage and detachment were blocked by caspase and ROCK1 inhibitors. Using the MHCIIB (-/-) cell line, we observed that the absence of MHCIIB did not affect cell death rate. However, MHCIIB (-/-) fibroblasts showed more resistance to TNFα-induced actin disassembly, cell shrinkage and detachment than wild type (Wt) fibroblasts, indicating the participation of MHCIIB in these events.   PKCζ, which only phosphorylates MHCIIB, was cleaved during apoptosis, co-immunoprecipitated preferentially with MHCIIB and, interestedly, PKCζ inhibition blocked TNFα-induced shrinkage and detachment. Our results demonstrate that MHCIIB, together with MLC phosphorylation and actin, constitute the actomyosin cytoskeleton that mediates contractility during apoptosis. Second, we studied the involvement of myosin II isoforms in cell shape modulation. Fibroblasts MHCIIB (-/-) spontaneously formed lamellipodia whereas Wt fibroblasts presented a stellate shape. Cortactin was associated with the leading edge of lamellipodia in MHCIIB (-/-) fibroblasts, but it localised diffusely in the cytoplasm or at the end of fine cellular projections in Wt fibroblasts. The levels of cortactin and cortactin phosphorylated in Tyr421 associated with membrane in MHCIIB (-/-) fibroblasts were higher than in Wt fibroblasts. Confocal microscopy showed cortactin/MHCIIA colocalization in wild type but not in MHCIIB (-/-) fibroblasts. bFGF activates Erk1/2 in wild type and MHCIIB (-/-) fibroblasts and  induces the formation of aberrant membrane projections in MHCIIB (-/-) fibroblasts.  In conclusion, our results contribute to characterize the structural and contractile role of each myosin II isoforms in the physiology of the cell.	actin cytoskeleton , nonmuscle myosin II , actomyosin complex , cell contraction , apoptosis , cortactin , GTPase Rac1 , GTPase Rac1 , lamellipodia formation	en	2852.0
1460	Associations between Exposure to Socio-Cultural Influences in Proximal Environments and Weight Concerns among Urban-Dwelling Women	Abstract Weight and eating-related disorders and behaviours are common among adolescent girls and young women in Western societies, where thin bodies are highly valued.  The goal of this study was to examine whether or not more frequent exposure to places promoting thinness is associated with greater weight concerns among women.   This study was part of a larger investigation entitled ¨Social, cultural, and economic disparities and disordered eating: Understanding the contribution of neighbourhood and individual level factors¨ (Gauvin, Steiger, & Brodeur, 2009). A sample of 1288 women aged 20 to 40 years and living in Montreal for at least 12 months responded to a telephone survey. Logistic regression analyses were performed comparing women in the highest quintile of weight concerns to women in other quintiles on frequentations of thin-promoting places 15 days or more. Further, a sensitivity analysis was performed to verify whether or not an association exists between high weight concerns and different levels of exposure to places promoting socio-cultural standards for thinness. A series of confounding variables were statistically controlled.  Results showed that exposure to places promoting socio-cultural standards for thinness at least 15 days per month was significantly associated with greater weight concerns among women despite controlling for confounding variables.  Further, going to places promoting thinness between at least 15 through 20 days/month was also associated greater weight concerns among women. Public health interventions could aim at reducing societal pressures to thinness.

1461	Assemblage oligomérique des récepteurs couplés aux protéines G avec les RAMPs	G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) constitute the largest family of membrane receptors involved in signal transduction. Traditionally, signal transduction by GPCRs involves the activation of a hetero-trimeric G protein which will then modulate the activity of several intracellular effectors. We can now appreciate the fact that in addition to their interaction with G proteins, GPCRs also associate with several other proteins, in order to allow proper signal transduction. In particular, the discovery of a family of proteins called receptor activity-modifying proteins (RAMPs) has challenged the traditional views of signal transduction by some GPCRs. In the case of the calcitonin-like receptor (CLR), the association with RAMPs allows the proper cell surface targeting of the receptor in addition to modulate it’s pharmacological properties. Co-expression of CLR with RAMP1 leads to a calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor, whereas CLR association with RAMP2 or RAMP3 promotes the formation of an adrenomedullin receptor. In addition to their interaction with transmembrane accessory proteins such as RAMPs, GPCRs can also interact with other receptors to form receptors oligomers. In this thesis, we were interested in the interactions between GPCRs and RAMPs, and particularly, in the link between these GPCR/RAMP interactions and the assembly of receptor oligomers, using CGRP1 receptor as a model. We first confirmed the interaction between CLR and RAMP1 in living cells. We showed that this CLR/RAMP1 complex activates G proteins and recruits the signalling protein -arrestin upon CGRP stimulation. Next, we demonstrated that even if the CLR requires hetero-oligomeric assembly with RAMPs in order to be active, this receptor can still interact with other GPCRs. In addition to CLR homo-oligomers, we observed that RAMPs can also self-associate to form oligomeric complexes which can involve different subtypes (RAMP1/RAMP2 and RAMP1/RAMP3). This observation of the presence of CLR and RAMP1 homo-oligomers raised the question of the stoiechiometry of interaction of the CLR/RAMP1 complex. In order to establish the molecular composition of the CGRP1 receptor in vivo, we developed a novel approach allowing the detection of the interaction between three proteins in living cells. This method called BRET/BiFC is based on the bioluminescence resonance energy transfer between a luminescent energy donor, Renilla luciferase, and a fluorescent energy acceptor, the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), reconstituted after the re-association of its two fragments. Using this approach, we showed that the CGRP1 receptor consist of a homo-oligomer of CLR interacting with a monomer of RAMP1. By demonstrating the asymmetrical organization of the CGRP1 receptor complex using a novel biophysical approach, we believe that the results presented herein have contributed to increase our knowledge of the mechanisms of function of the large family of GPCRs and will be useful for the pursuit of research on protein complexes involved in signalling pathways.

1462	La collaboration interprofessionnelle vers une transformation des pratiques au sein d’un GMF de deuxième vague	INTRODUCTION: Primary care in the Province of Quebec has undergone a substantial reorganisation over the last several years, on several fronts. Family Medicine Groups (FMG's), designated medical clinics, regional health boards, and local health networks, are only a few examples of new health care delivery components which have been created during this reorganisation. METHODS: This is a case study based on a single Family Medicine Group created during a second wave of innovation. Data was collected via semi-directed interviews with the head physician of the FMG, the group of physicians and nurses within the FMG, the nursing director of the FMG, and the director of nursing at the regional health board. Interviews were conducted until all available contacts were exhausted. The author also accessed the clinical guidelines and the documents used for communication within the FMG. RESULTS: Practice activities in the FMG did evolve over time as a result of mutual clinical and administrative interactions between nurses and physicians. Participants noted a visible improvement in health outcomes as well as increased accessibility to health care by patients. The impact on physician workload, and overall capacity in terms of number of patients followed, after creation of the FMG, were inconsistent. CONCLUSION: This proposed analytic model allows empiric measurement of the added value of FMG's for the development of inter-professional cooperation, and its impact on professional practices.	leadership , group medical practice , leadership , mutual influences , reflexive practice , interactional determinants , organisational determinants	en	2832.0
1463	Utilisation des médecines complémentaires par les enfants atteints d'arthrite juvénile idiopathique et d'incapacités physiques	Background: Children with chronic diseases often use complementary and alternative health care (CAHC). Several studies described the use of these treatments and the factors associated with it. However, no longitudinal studies were conducted to determine the use of these treatments over time. Furthermore, no study has evaluated CAHC use in children who were waiting for public rehabilitation services. Objective: The aim was to determine the frequency of CAHC use in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and children with various physical disabilities (PD), to evaluate its effectiveness from the parents’ points of view and to explore the factors associated with their utilization.  Methods: A cohort of children with JIA (n=182, mean age: 10.2 years) who attended arthritis clinics and a cohort of children with physical disabilities (n=224, mean age: 2.6 years) waiting for public rehabilitation services were followed for one year. We evaluated the use of CAHC and its effectiveness from the parents’ points of view at three month intervals for children with JIA and at the beginning of the study for children with PD, using descriptive statistics. We explored factors associated with their utilization, using GEE (“Generalized estimating equations »), polytomous and logistic regression.   Results : Previous use of CAHC was 51.1% for children with JIA and 15% for children with PD. CAHC was considered beneficial in 72% of the cases by parents of children with JIA and in 83% of the cases by parents of children with PD. Factors associated with higher use of CAHC in children with JIA were previous use of CAHC by parents and lower perceived helpfulness of prescribed medications (p<0.05). In children with PD, factors associated with higher use of CAHC were Canadian cultural background, mother’s level of education higher than high school and lower health-related quality of life. Finally, in children with JIA, CAHC use was associated with worse outcomes. Conclusions: Many children in our study used CAHC. Its use was more common in children with JIA, particularly among those whose parents used it previously and found medications to be less helpful. For children with PD, use of CAHC was associated with socio-demographic factors as well as higher children’s health needs. CAHC were perceived to be beneficial in both cohorts but its use was associated with worse outcomes for children with JIA. This underlines the importance for health professionals to evaluate CAHC use in order to better inform parents, which may help them make the best decisions regarding their child’s treatment.

1464	"Caractérisation de la pharmacocinétique 
suite à l’exposition multivoie au toluène, 
au n-hexane et au cyclohexane chez le rat"	The contribution of dermal and inhalation routes of exposure to volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) in drinking water is increasingly drawing attention. Until recently, ingestion was the only route considered in risk assessment of drinking water contaminants. The general objective of this study was to characterize multi-route exposures on the pharmacokinetics and internal dose of three VOCs: toluene (TOL), n-hexane (HEX) and cyclohexane (CYCLO). Towards this goal, an experimental animal model was developed and a physiologically-based toxicokinetic (PBTK) model was adapted in order to take account route-specific absorption parameters of TOL. Sprague-Dawley rats were given a single dose of VOCs by oral ingestion, inhalation or dermal route. Additional groups of rat were exposed by the three routes simultaneously. In the case of HEX and CYCLO, dermal route was not considered. Blood samples were collected in order to compare kinetics following simple and multiroute exposures. Blood levels obtained following multiroute exposures were generally higher than predictions (i.e., the sum of the blood levels obtained for single route exposures) (as revealed by area under curve ratio: TOL :1,30 et 2,19; HEX : 1,55; CYCLO : 0,98 et 0,99). The PBTK model described adequately the kinetics of TOL in rats following single and multiroute exposures. The results suggest that internal dose arising from multiple routes is not necessarely comparable to the sum of the blood levels obtained for single route exposures. This phenomenon would be attributable to degree of saturation during aggregate exposures. Furthermore, the present study demonstrated that PBTK model can be used to predict/interpret blood levels associated with multiroute exposures to VOCs in drinking water, using toluene as a model substance.	n-hexane , Cyclohexane , Multiroute exposure , Volatile organic compounds , Toluene , Experimental animal model , Toxicokinetic modeling	en	2817.0
1465	Développement d’un système d’administration de l’anesthésie en boucle fermée	In the operating room, the anaesthetist performs numerous tasks. New technological tools better inform him about the state of the patient but render his task more demanding. To alleviate the anaesthetist workload, we have considered the automatic administration of anesthetic drugs using closed-loop control.   In this respect, we have developed a system for the administration of an anesthetic agent (propofol) in order to maintain loss of consciousness at an optimal level throughout a surgery. The system comprises a computer, an anaesthesia monitor and an infusion pump. A control algorithm installed on the computer determines the infusion rate of the hypnotic drug based on the Bispectral IndexTM (BIS) provided by the monitor. At first, the anaesthetist chooses a target value for the control variable BIS and the algorithm, which consists of an expert system, calculates the infusion doses of propofol in order to steer the measured BIS value closer to the target value.  For the user-interface of a novel anaesthesia monitor, four display types were considered: purely numeric, purely graphical, a mixed graphical and numerical and a bi-dimensional integrated graphical display. Based on 20 different scenarios where normal and abnormal anaesthesia parameters were presented to anaesthetists and residents, the study of the reaction time, response accuracy and user-friendliness (assessed by the NASA-TLX) showed that a mixed graphical and numerical display is the best preferred for the interface of the system.    A clinical study was conducted in order to compare the behaviour of the system of administering propofol in closed-loop to manually controlled anaesthesia guided by BIS. After Institutional Review Board approval and written consent, 40 patients undergoing orthopaedic or general surgery were randomly assigned to 2 groups of equal size. After manual propofol induction (1.5 mg/kg), closed loop control was used to maintain anesthesia at a target BIS of 45 (Closed-loop group); in the other group, propofol was administered manually using a syringe pump by an experienced anaesthesiologist in order to maintain a target BIS of 45 as closely as possible (Control group). The performance of the system was defined as excellent, good, poor or inadequate, when the BIS was within 10%, between 10 and 20%, between 20 and 30% or outside 30% of the target BIS, respectively.   In the Closed-loop group, the system showed excellent control during 55% of the total anaesthesia time, good control during 29% of the time and poor control during 9% of the time. The time from the end of infusion to extubation was 9 ± 3.7 min. In the Control group, excellent, good and poor control were noted during 33%, 33% and 15% of the time, respectively and doses were changed 9.5 ± 4 times per h. Extubation was achieved after 11.9 ± 3.3 min from the end of infusion. In the Closed-loop group, excellent control of anesthesia occurred significantly more often (P<0.0001) and inadequate control less often than in the Control group (P=0.001).  The present system of administering propofol in closed-loop maintains the anesthesia level closer to a given target than manual administration.

1466	L’impact d’une diète néonatale déficiente en nutriments essentiels à la défense antioxydante sur le métabolisme énergétique à long terme	Preterm infants are faced to oxidative stress resulting from a low antioxidant defence and/or a high oxidant load. Datas suggest that an oxidative stress may impair energy metabolism leading to metabolic syndrome development. Hypothesis: A weak antioxidant defence early in life such as observed in preterm newborns is sufficient to impair energy metabolism later in life. Methods: Four groups of guinea pigs (n=21) received between their 3rd and 7th days of life a control diet (C-1week, C-14weeks) or antioxidant deficient diet (DC-1week, DC-14weeks). At 7 day-old, 1week-groups were sacrificed for plasma and liver sampling whereas 14week-groups were fed with the control diet until 14 week-old. Blood glucose and plasma triacylglycerol were determined at 1, 3, 11 and 13-14 week-old. Glucose tolerance test was performed at 13 week-old. Hepatic antioxidant defences and key proteins regulating lipid and glucose metabolism were measured at 1 and 14 weeks. Results: The oxidized redox status of glutathione associated with the neonatal deficient diet was maintained until at least 14 week-old (p<0.01). The low plasma triacylglycerol, low blood glucose and better tolerance to glucose at 14 weeks (p<0.05) were associated with an oxidized redox status. Conclusion: The low glutathione observed in newborn preterm infants has been reproduced in our animal model. Since the oxidized redox state observed here seems to be protective against impaired energy metabolism and since the cellular redox environment is known to be an important rheostat of metabolism influencing development, it suggests being careful before adopting aggressive antioxidant treatments in preterm infants.

1467	Étude de prévention de la thrombose veineuse associée au cathéter veineux central de type PICC chez les patients en oncologie recevant une chimiothérapie	Our prospective, randomized study aims at comparing the effectiveness of two types of heparin used for the instillation of peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC): Standard heparin and Tinzaparin, a low molecular weight heparin. We recruited patients from the ambulatory center of Maisonneuve-Rosemont hospital. Between the beginning of May 2005 and March 2008, 131 patients were enrolled. Of 61 patients excluded, 23 did not satisfy the inclusion criteria, 30 refused to participate and 8 were not enrolled for other reasons. Seventy patients were randomized into two groups, 36 in the Standard heparin group and 34 in the Tinzaparin group. Our population intent-to-treat included 65/70 patients, 32 of these received Standard heparin and 33 received Tinzaparin. The experimental intervention was administered for a maximum of 30 days and all the subjects were followed up for 90 days. The events were documented objectively with a venogram or Doppler ultrasonography by the end of the 30 days following the catheter installation. The incidence of catheter-related venous thrombosis (CRVT) during 30 days of instillation is 14,39/1000 catheter-days (CI 95%:[9,0;19,79]/1000 catheter-days or 41.5% (27/65). The incidence of symptomatic upper extremity deep venous thrombosis (DVT) during the observation period of 90 days is 0,41/1000 catheter-days (CI 95%:[0,08;0,81]/1000 catheter-days or 3% (2/65). We did not observe any difference in the frequency of CRVT or DVT between the two groups. We can not conclude that either Standard heparin or Tinzaparin is more effective in the prevention of CRVT in our population.

1468	Le transfert de documents conformes et la résolution du contrat pour leur non-conformité selon la convention de Vienne sur la vente internationale de marchandises	This study examines one of the difficulties occurring during the execution of sales contracts between parties located in different countries. These contracts have their own particular problems. As a matter of fact, when the sold goods are expedited, these contracts also oblige the seller to transfer to the buyer documents that conform to and represent said goods. The non-conformity of those documents characterizes itself by the non-conformity of the goods and constitutes a principal source of litigation directed towards contract avoidance in this commercial sector. The diversity of susceptible solutions applying to this problem has become a reality since internal laws must co-exist with the rules of the Vienna Convention regarding the international sale of goods. In principle, no difficulties are manifested once an internal law is designated as being the competent law: it suffices to apply the remedies to this law. Thus, for instance, the buyer can avoid the contract if the documents don't comply with the contractual stipulations on the basis of the concept of fundamental breach (in the case of a non-documentary sale) or on the basis of strict compliance (in the case of a documentary sale) that are inherent in Anglo-American law. On the other hand, in a civil law system (where the distinction between a documentary sale and a non-documentary sale doesn't exist) such contract avoidance based on defective or non-compliant documents is only possible when the presence of an important prejudice or major defect. Many arguments justify the solutions in national laws: the needs of judicial certainty and the search of solutions conforming to the needs of international trade. Nevertheless, it appears that those arguments are equally present in the Vienna Convention. Also, that Convention compels the seller to transfer to the buyer all documents conforming to the sale. This is done in an indirect manner without precisely stating which kind of documents must be transferred. Therefore, the opportunity of such a transfer will depend on trade usage and on the agreement of the parties, which priorities over unified rules. This sometimes gives rise to a question of contractual interpretation or comblement de lacune of this uniform law of international sales. In the same effect, the uniform law differs from national laws which are clearer in this regard. As far as the conditions of contract resolutions for nonconforming documents are concerned, national law solutions contrasts with those of the Vienna Convention which require fundamental breach in order to dissolve the contract. This duality between national law and substantial uniform law reveals a clear fact: the presence of fundamental breach in the Vienna Convention modifies the judicial landscape that exists in every member state. What justifies the interest in the subject is the following question: are the differences between fundamental breach, strict compliance and the importance of legal tort law in effect in national laws compatible? The answer is far from certain and in spite of convergences, we observe some differences.

1469	"Le « nanomonde » et le renversement de la distinction entre nature et technique : 
entre l’artificialisation de la nature et la naturalisation de la technique"	Nanosciences and nanotechnologies (NST) are part of a technoscientific field, the nanoworld, which is founded on a theoretical and practical hybridization between nature and technique. In this master thesis we are interested in the blurring of the distinction between the natural and the artificial that so follows. From a socio-historical perspective of the construction of the dualism nature/artefact typical of modern societies, we try to apprehend the socio-cultural stakes that might result from its reversal. Through discourse analysis of interviews conducted with the main researchers in NST in Quebec, we illustrate empirically, and systematize, the double process of artificialisation of nature and naturalization of technique, which is theoretically pointed out as characteristic of the blur of the distinction between nature and technique carried out in the nanoworld. We suggest that the two terms, artificialisation of nature and naturalization of technique, far from being contradictory, rather constitute elements of a synergetic dynamics that leads to a de-ontologisation of nature as a category of thought and a disqualification of the domain that distinguishes human activity.

1470	Measuring Economic Insecurity	We provide a systematic treatment of the notion of economic insecurity, assuming that an individual’s sentiment of insecurity depends on the current wealth level and its variations experienced in the past. We think of wealth as a comprehensive variable encompassing anything that may help in coping with adverse occurrences. The current wealth level could also be interpreted as incorporating the individual’s evaluation of future prospects. Variations in wealth experienced in the recent past are given higher weight than experiences that occurred in the more distant past. Two classes of measures are characterized with sets of plausible and intuitive axioms.	Insecurity , Wealth Distribution , Social Index Numbers , D63	en	2743.0
1471	La transplantation d’hépatocytes chez le rat Long Evans Cinnamon, modèle animal de la maladie de Wilson	Wilson’s disease (WD) is a hereditary metabolic disease caused by a deficiency of copper-transporting ATP7B, resulting in copper accumulating to toxic levels in the liver.  Its manifestations range from acute or chronic hepatic insufficiency to fulminant liver failure. The mainstay of therapy is the use of chelating agents.  However selected patients may also require orthotopic liver transplantation (OTL), an invasive and complex procedure with life-long implications.  Hepatocyte transplantation  is an appealing alternative to OLT.  Its safety and efficacy  were evaluated in the animal model of WD, the Long Evans Cinnamon (LEC) rat.  Twelve LEC rats received an intrasplenic injection of 2,6 x 105 – 3,6 x 107 hepatocytes obtained from LE donor rats.  They were followed for 6 months before sacrifice.  They were then compared to a control group of twelve rats.  No difference was found when comparing their weights, biochemical parameters such as liver function tests and bilirubin, as well as their biliary and hepatic copper concentrations.  However, the ceruloplasmin oxydase activity was improved in the transplanted rats (49,6 ± 31,5 versus 8,9 ± 11,7).  After sacrifice, histologic evaluation and demonstration of atp7b mRNA in the recipient liver were performed.  There was evidence of histological improvement and atp7b mRNA was found in 58% of transplanted rats with an expression of 11,9% ± 13,6 when compared to a normal LE rat.  Evidence of successful engraftment of the transplanted cells was found in every transplanted rat using the technique of immunohistochemistry.  These encouraging results are in accordance with previous studies on hepatocyte transplantation in the LEC rat.  Its application to the human clinical setting is the next step, as it has already been tried in other metabolic liver diseases.

1472	Régulation de la lipoprotéine lipase macrophagique et de LOX-1 par des facteurs métaboliques. Implications dans l’athérosclérose associée au diabète de type 2	Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in western countries and is the major complication of diabetes.  Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is a key enzyme in lipid metabolism, responsible for the hydrolysis of triglyceride (TG) rich lipoproteins.  Many studies have shown that LPL secreted by macrophages in the arterial wall is proatherogenic. Endothelial dysfunction is a characteristic feature of early-stage atherosclerosis.  The observation that lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor-1 (LOX-1), a newly identified receptor for oxidized LDL (oxLDL), is highly expressed in human atherosclerotic lesions and upregulated in the aorta of diabetic rats, suggests a key role for LOX-1 in the pathogenesis of diabetic atherosclerosis. Based on the role of macrophage LPL and LOX-1 in atherosclerosis, we sought to investigate the regulation of these two proatherogenic molecules by metabolic and inflammatory factors dysregulated in diabetes namely leptin, linoleic acid (LA) and C-reactive protein (CRP).  Our results demonstrated that: 1) In human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs), LA increased LOX-1 protein expression in a time- and dose-dependent manner; 2) Pretreatment of HAECs with antioxidants and inhibitors of NADPH oxidase, protein kinase C (PKC), and nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) inhibited the stimulatory effect of LA on LOX-1 protein expression; 3) Increased expression of classic PKC isoforms was observed in LA-treated HAECs; 4) LA led to a significant increase in LOX-1 gene expression and enhanced the binding of nuclear proteins extracted from HAECs to the NF-kB regulatory element of the LOX-1 gene promoter; 5) LA enhanced, through LOX-1, oxLDL uptake by endothelial cells.  Overall, these results demonstrated that LA enhances endothelial LOX-1 expression in vitro and support a key role for LA in endothelial dysfunction associated with diabetes. Based on our previous studies showing that macrophage LPL expression is increased in patients with type 2 diabetes and that metabolic factors dysregulated in this disease such as glucose, homocysteine (Hcys), fatty acids and advanced glycation end products (AGE), increased macrophage LPL expression, we next determined the effect of two other metabolic and inflammatory factors dysregulated in diabetes, namely leptin and CRP, on macrophage LPL expression in vitro.   Leptin levels are elevated in diabetic patients and are associated with greater cardiovascular risks.  We found that: 1) In human macrophages, leptin increased LPL expression, at both the gene and protein levels; 2) The stimulatory effect of leptin on LPL was abolished by pre-treatment with anti-leptin receptor (Ob-R) antibody, PKC inhibitors and antioxidants; 3) Leptin increased the membrane expression of conventional PKC isoforms and downregulation of endogenous PKC expression abolished the effects of leptin on macrophage LPL expression; 4) In murine macrophages, leptin raised LPL synthetic rate and enhanced the binding of nuclear proteins to the activated protein-1 (AP-1) sequence of the LPL gene promoter.  These observations support the possibility that leptin may represent a macrophage LPL stimulatory factor in diabetes. Finally, we sought to determine the effect of CRP on macrophage LPL expression in vitro.  CRP is an inflammatory molecule and a strong predictor of cardiovascular events and high serum levels of CRP are observed in type 2 diabetic patients.  We found that: 1) In human macrophages, CRP increased LPL expression at the gene and protein levels and CRP binding to CD32 receptors is required for these effects; 2) Preincubation of human macrophages with antioxidants, PKC and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitors, prevented the CRP-induced LPL expression; 3) CRP increased LPL activity, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, classic PKC isozymes expression and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) 1/2 phosphorylation; 4) CRP-treated murine macrophages demonstrated increased binding of nuclear proteins to the AP-1 sequence of the LPL gene promoter.  These data suggest that LPL might represent a novel factor underlying the adverse effect of CRP on the diabetic vasculature. Overall, our studies indicate a key role of metabolic and inflammatory factors in the regulation of vascular LPL and LOX-1 in diabetes.  Our data suggest that LPL and LOX-1 are key contributors to the accelerated atherogenesis associated with human diabetes.

1473	Mécanismes de défense immunitaire innée impliqués dans l’hépatite aiguë induite par le virus de l’hépatite murine de type 3	Mouse hepatitis virus type 3 (MHV3) is an excellent model to study immunological disorders related to viral infections. The fulminant acute hepatitis induced in susceptible C57BL/6 mice is characterized by the presence of necrotic and inflammatory foci in the liver associated with B and T cell immunodeficiencies leading to the death of the animals in 3 to 5 days post-infection. The fulminance of this viral infection suggests a deficiency in the natural immunity mechanisms under control of NK and NK-T cells and an imbalance between the hepatic tolerance and the inflammatory responses. To understand the different mechanisms involved in the acute hepatitis, in vivo infections have been done in C57BL/6 mice with either the pathogenic L2-MHV3, or with its attenuated variants: the weak attenuated 51.6-MHV3, the highly attenuated CL12-MHV3 or the non-pathogenic YAC-MHV3 viruses, possessing different tropisms for liver sinusoidal endothelial cells and Kupffer cells. The results demonstrate that splenic and myeloid NK cells are impaired during a MHV3 infection. This impairment is due to a recruitment of these cells in the liver and a virus-induced apoptotic phenomenon. The recruitment and the subsequent apoptosis of NK and NK-T cells during the first three days of infection are in relation with the pathogenicity of the MHV3 variants. In spite of the fact that hepatic recruited NK cells are still cytotoxic, these cells undergo apoptosis due to viral replication via the formation of syncytia. Addition of IL-12 and IL-18, which are impaired during the acute hepatitis, promote a synergistic IFN-g production by NK cells depending of both the p38 MAPK pathway and the viral replication. Moreover, the specific viral receptor CEACAM1a (carcinoembryonic antigen cell adhesion molecule 1a) is essential for this response but also exerts an inhibitory action. Levels of the immunosuppressive cytokines IL-10, TGF-b and PGE2, mainly produced by Kupffer cells and sinusoidal endothelial cells, and implicated in the natural hepatic tolerance, are in inverse correlation with the pathogenicity of the MHV3 variants. Finally, viral infection promotes the secretion of IL-6 and TNF-a by macrophages, triggered by the fixation of viral particules to TLR2 and heparan sulfate receptors rather than the engagement of CEACAM1a receptor and viral replication. In conclusion, our results suggest new mechanisms by which the MHV3 virus disturbs the innate immunity under control of NK and NK-T cells, as well as the cytokines involved in the hepatic tolerance to the detriment of the inflammatory response.

1474	Profil de pratique des médecins omnipraticiens en santé mentale au Québec	In Quebec, considering the high prevalence rate of mental health disorder and the scarcity of psychiatrists, general practitioners (GPs) hold an importante role in the management and the follow-up of mental health care.  In the context of the ongoing mental health system reform aimed at reinforcing collaboration between GPs, psychiatrists and mental health teams, our objectives are to have a better understanding of clinical practice and collaborative practice, developed by GP and their assessment of working tools and quality of mental health services, in order to improve the complementary of primary mental health care.     The study was carried out using a cross-sectional design, involving 1415 GPs from nine Quebec territories. The final sample included 398 GPs, representing diverse practice places, and the response rate was 41%.  The study highlighted that GPs have different clinical and collaboration practices according to the seriousness of mental disorder patients seen, i.e. transient and moderate mental disorder (TMMD) or serious and permanent mental disorder (SPMD); and GPs strongly support care coordination efforts with all mental health professionals. Therefore, it appears important to reinforce GP accessibility to other mental health professionals, particularly psychiatrists, and to inform them on the presence of all actors in mental health in their territory, in order to develop collaboration and quality of primary mental healthcare.

1475	Le recours à des environnements numériques pour la diffusion de connaissances relatives au patrimoine bâti: une exploration du potentiel de la modélisation de systèmes typologiques	Within the framework of this research project, we explore the possibilities of making use of information technologies to enhance the architectural designer's cognitive abilities. More precisely, we examine the possibilities of enabling the designer to become more knowledgeable about architectural heritage. We took an interest in this topic because it appears essential to explore new ways of conveying the intellectual values connected with the built heritage. In this regard, we hope to contribute towards the renewal of methods of the formalization and dissemination of the knowledge inherent in buildings and artefacts of historical interest. On the one hand, we take an interest in the knowledge construction process that induces the architectural historian to unfold a reasoning so as to organize his/her interpretation of a built environment. We study one of the strategies employed by the historian in tackling the problem of establishing connections between artefacts of a single family; that is, when proceeding to elaborate a typology. We intend to contribute to the development of a vehicle for knowledge that is sufficiently flexible to be adaptable to iterative changes in the interpretation provided by the historian, so as to prevent the eventual crystallization of the conclusions drawn from his/her study of the built environment. We also turn our attention to the knowledge reconstruction process undertaken by the learner, in this case the architectural designer. We aim to place at the designer’s disposal tools that enable him/her to apprehend the knowledge developed by the historian. In this regard, we explore the possibilities of implementing heuristic tools based on the learner’s action. In short, we strive to evaluate and understand to what extent and in which ways information technologies could make a difference in the knowledge construction process undertaken by the architectural historian, and in the knowledge reconstruction process undertaken by the learner. In what way could these processes take place in a dynamic and iterative way?  Within the framework of this reflection on the possible uses of information technologies, we formulate the following hypothesis: we argue that the eventual complementarity likely to develop between a conceptual model and a generative system would enhance the methods by which the researcher, working on built heritage, could convey his/her message to the architectural designer. To assess the validity of our theory, we conduct a set of experiments. Our approach is exemplified by two case studies dealing with the works of historians who established typologies of roof frames constructed in the north of France and in Belgium between the 11th and 19th centuries, and of 12th and 13th century gothic rose windows crafted in the Île-de-France. We then proceed to the implementation of interactive digital environments. The usefulness of these environments, as much within the historian’s thought process as within the learner’s, is evaluated via qualitative methods. Based on the conclusions drawn from these case studies, we propose a theoretical model that establishes a connexion between architectural history, cognition and information technologies. In undertaking these experiments and the subsequent theorizing, we aim to shed new light on the synergy likely to take place between the architectural historian and the computer scientist. At the conclusion of this process, which brought us from the terms of reference to the hypothesis and experiments, we place the present study in a larger context and open up new avenues of investigation that highlight the importance, for the architectural designer, of being knowledgeable about the built heritage and of making use of this knowledge in a conscious and articulated way. The details of this research project are likely to be of interest to any person working in the broad field of architectural history, as well as architectural designers concerned with obtaining a better knowledge, understanding and appreciation of the heritage handed down from his/her predecessors.

1476	Le devoir fiduciaire d'agir dans le meilleur intérêt de la compagnie insolvable: comment concilier les intérêts de l'actionnaire et du créancier?	"The following thesis analyses the impact of a company's insolvency on the fiduciary duties of its directors and officers, as imposed by Canadian corporate law. More specifically it shall examine the repercussions of an insolvency on management's fiduciary duty to act in accordance with the company's best interests. The objective shall therefore be to assess the extent of such fiduciary duty in the context of an insolvency and to establish a guideline to be followed by directors and officers in view of complying with said duty. Firstly, what constitutes the ""best interests of the company""? The author concludes that a company's interests are comprised of a community of underlying interests. Although the interests of the company remain independent, it cannot be determined without taking into account said underlying interests. Amongst this community of underlying interests, shareholders and creditors, members of such community that supports the financing of the company's operations, occupy a predominant place. Recent case law and doctrinal authorities have concluded that the impact of a company's insolvency does not affect the ultimate objective pursued by the company, i.e. the maximisation of profit, but rather affects the determination of the members of the community of underlying interests that shall be affected by the pursuit of such finality. As such, in a context of insolvency, creditors, similar to shareholders in a context of solvency, are the residual risk-bearers of the company's commercial expenditure. Consequently, in view of determining what constitutes the best interests of the company, when it is insolvent, directors and officers may not ignore the creditors' interests. Secondly, who are the real beneficiaries of the fiduciary duty to act in a company's best interests when it becomes insolvent? The author concludes that creditors are indirect beneficiaries of such fiduciary duty in a context of insolvency. Similarly to shareholders in a context of solvency, creditors must be entitled to institute a derivative claim against directors and officers in order to obtain, in the name and for the company, compensation for the violation of said fiduciary duty. Insolvency triggers the existence of an obligation, fiduciary in nature, to take into account the creditors' interests. As such, directors and officers are to consider the creditors' interests in exercising their fiduciary duty to act in strict compliance with the best interests of the company. This conclusion is based on a review of the Canadian statutory law, jurisprudence and doctrinal authorities. Furthermore, this conclusion is supported by a review of same from certain Commonwealth jurisdictions (England, Australia and New-Zealand) and from the United States of America, jurisdictions with whom Canada has a privileged relationship, historically and/or economically. Finally, how does the obligation to take into account the creditors' interests translate in practice for directors and officers of an insolvent company? The author concludes that the obligation to take into account the creditors' interests is, in reality, an obligation to reconcile the shareholders' and creditors' interests with that of the company's best interests. The parameters of such obligation shall be determined with respect to the scenario conceived by directors and officers in order to effectively manage a situation of insolvency. Should such scenario focus on the liquidation of the core assets of the company, then the interests of the shareholders shall be subjugated to that of the creditors'. Conversely, should such scenario focus on the reorganisation of the company's commercial expenditures, based on the company's existing structures, then the shareholder's interest shall receive a more extensive attention by directors and officers."

1477	Les perceptions des adolescents, de leurs parents et des professionnels quant à l’inclusion sociale des adolescents ayant vécu un traumatisme craniocérébral modéré	This exploratory descriptive qualitative study explores the perceptions of adolescents, their parents and professionals involved as to the social inclusion of adolescents who have suffered a moderate traumatic brain injury (TBI), particularly with regard to recovering their social roles once discharged from the rehabilitation centre. Bronfenbrenner’s ecological model (1979, 1986), adapted by Lefebvre & Levert (2005) for TBI clientele, is used as the conceptual framework. Semi-structured interview were conducted with three adolescents who had suffered a moderate TBI, and with their parents. In addition, a focus group was conducted with four professionals. The results show that the perceptions of adolescents who have suffered a moderate TBI, as well as their parents’, touch different aspects of their life, such as the adolescent as a person, the family, friends, the environment, school and leisure activities. We indeed noted a great number of repercussions, which facilitate and sometimes limit the social inclusion of a moderate TBI adolescent. The professionals share the same perceptions in general as them. However, the professionals add certain aspects that did not come up in interviews with the moderate TBI adolescents and their parents. The results of this study should enable health professionals to better understand the social inclusion experienced by these people. They should also offer professionals guidelines for them to better support the social inclusion of TBI adolescents and help the families get through this difficult situation.

1478	L’agrément : un agent moteur de développement des capacités, d’apprentissage collectif et de socialisation. Une étude de cas en profondeur dans un hôpital privé saoudien	The purpose of this thesis is to determine whether accreditation is effective for developing individual’s necessary capacities that improve quality.   In the last decade, accreditation shows that is a valuable tool. Accreditation program implementation has also demonstrated a world wide increased. It is as well used to support health reform. Managerial practices of this type are often criticized. They are adopted with enthusiasm but their implementation is often neglected because there is some difficulties to demonstrate sustainable behaviour changes and better outcomes..   Capacity Building (CB) is a comprehensive process, multidimensional and dynamic that seeks to improve the performance of individuals, teams, the organization and a system.  CB is one of the three foundational elements of institutionalise quality improvement practices a the same level of communication and recognition.   This study happens in Saudi Arabia. The hospital had participated in his first initiative with the Canadian Council of Health Services Accreditation (CCHSA). A single case study to evaluate the implementation of accreditation has been carried using a mix methodology.  For unit of analysis has been studded (individual, team, organization and system) to measure 28 anticipated effects of capacity Building culled from the literature. Semi-structure interviews, focus groups and a documentation review were conducted.  A questionnaire on the quality implementation scale (QIS) was administered in five organizations.  The performance of the case was measured in relation to the others and based on its positioning in the cycle.  Qualitative and quantitative analyses using median polish technique were conducted.       At the individual level, the accreditation motivated participation in new training.  Self-assessment is the stage that encourages learning through self-criticism.  The feeling of pride is the emotional change that was reported the most. The teams improved their communication by establishing a chain of command, which introduced the concept of respect and of clearly defined roles as required by the standards.  Through the QIS measurement, we noted that all those involved position themselves at the minimal level of implementation (Quality Assurance).  The most experienced with accreditation produce the best results very close to the second level.  Finally, the further organizations progress in the cycle, the more the differences in perception between the eight QI domains studied narrowed. The same phenomenon was observed among different job categories.   In conclusion, accreditation has demonstrated effectiveness to develop new capacities most specifically at the individual, team and organizational level.  The accreditation process has also demonstrated significant convergence power to pushes the adoption of new practices dictated by the accreditation standards. Those practices were successful to demonstrated positive quality improvement outcome.	Accreditation , Capacity Building , Saudi Arabia , Canadian Council on Health Services Accreditation	en	2626.0

1480	Implementing the Precautionary Principle through Stakeholder Engagement for Product and Service Development	The precautionary principle is a sustainable development principle that attempts to articulate an ethic in decision making since it deals with the notion of uncertainty of harm. Uncertainty becomes a weakness when it has to serve as a predictor by which to take action. Since humans are responsible for their actions, and ethics is based in action, then decisions based in uncertainty require an ethical framework. Beyond the professional deontological responsibility, there is a need to consider the process of conception based on an ethic of the future and therefore to develop a new ethical framework which is more global and fundamental. This will expose the justifications for choices, present these in debates with other stakeholders, and ultimately adopt an axiology of decision making for conception.		en	2493.0
1481	Faut-il en finir avec le développement durable ? Regard sur les zones humides méditerranéennes	Based on biodiversity conservation projects or integrated management projects of the Mediterranean wetlands, this paper shows that their sustainable development mainly depends on a political thinking about misdevelopment. The biodiversity conservation projects try with various successes to conciliate conservation and development. Amongst the problems, the decrease of the fresh water resource is added to the social disparity and the poverty.Promoting and managing institutional changes,increasing the stakeholders’social capital,learning and collectively deciding are the main keys of sustainable development. Many disparities still exist in the democratic processes at the local,regional and national levels but a participative development is suggested. More centered on the needs of local communities than on economic growth, being more reflexive, and setting the science’s critic and the co-construction of projects at the heart of the process, this participative development may offer an alternative to the prevalent approaches that were used until now. The sustainable development of the Mediterranean wetlands is still promising if it increases the adaptive capacity of both social and ecological systems in order to reject any irreversibility.		en	2487.0
1482	On the Scope of Egalitarian Justice	It is not clear whether the social contract is supposed to merely supplement the unequal gains that individuals are able to make through the exercise of their natural endowments with a set of equal gains secured through social cooperation,or whether the social contract must also compensate individuals for the effects of these natural inequalities, so that they literally become all equal. The issue concerns, in effect,whether natural inequality falls within the scope of egalitarian justice. I think it is fair to say that the majority of egalitarians assume that the principle of equality imposes an obligation to redress natural inequality.Yet there is no consensus on this issue.David Gauthier has made the rejection of the principle of redress a central component of his project. It has often escaped notice that John Rawls also rejects the principle of redress. Thus it is not just anti-egalitarians who reject the principle of redress. There is a current of egalitarian thought – which we might call, for lack of a better term, narrow-scope egalitarianism – which also rejects this principle. In this paper, I would like to show that there is considerable wisdom in the narrow-scope egalitarian position.Many of the problems that lead theorists to reject egalitarianism in its entirety are a consequence, not of the principle of equality per se, but rather of the commitment to redress natural inequality.The narrow-scope view avoids all of these difficulties.		en	2482.0
1483	Deliberative Democracy and Precautionary Public Reasoning : Exploratory Thoughts	Because public policy is legally binding and,perhaps more pointedly,can have pervasive social and environmental consequences for the autonomy of persons,it should be justifiable to those it could so affect. What is much more controversial, and what constitutes the basic intuitive claim of this exploratory paper,is that certain public policies should be morally justifiable to both existing and future persons.My concern is with policies in such areas as energy, climate change control, nuclear waste management, natural resources management, and genomics research and commercialization, which can no doubt improve our lives and our descendant’s lives,but which can also result in tremendous adverse effects for centuries to come. In this short paper, I suggest that the ideal of deliberative democracy provides a way of morally justifying such policies to both existing and future generations.If we take seriously the requirements of this ideal,we may have to modify our public reasoning so that it includes reasons that are generally acceptable among contemporaries as well as reasons that would be acceptable to posterity. The suggestion I make in this paper is that integral to the ideal of deliberative democracy in the transgenerational context is a future-oriented and precautionary public reasoning.		en	2479.0
1484	Diffusion du droit et Internet en Afrique de l'ouest	Access to legal information in West Africa is difficult and restricted because of a weak dissemination network. The insufficient publication and distribution of national legal resources can partly be attributed to a lack of financial and material resources. Over the past ten years, legal resource publication projects on the Web have been developed to offer free access to public legal information. This type of document dissemination model represents an alternative solution for African States by allowing them to elaborate new strategies to increase legal information dissemination. This new law publishing model, however, has brought about the need to reconsider the pluralistic nature of West African laws and the place these originally African laws occupy within the new strategies being put forth. The following analysis demonstrates how the use of new technologies such as the Internet has proven to be relevant for legal resource publication and distribution insofar as African states always take into consideration originally African sources when redefining their legal cultures through the dissemination of their laws via the Internet.

1485	Internet et le paradigme juridictionnel	The Internet facilitates transborder transactions, even among people living far away from one another. The permeability of borders arising from the use of the Internet makes it very difficult to apply traditional rules under private internationallaw, which are based on a territorial paradigm. The purpose of this thesis is to analyse this problem. First, we explore the characteristics of the Internet in this particular context and the relevant sources of private international law. Through the prism of cyberspace, we then review jurisdictional criteria arising from the doctrine and jurisprudence. Special attention is paid to the field of cyberconsumers, which is particularly vulnerable to the absence of territorial references. Indeed, state paternalism designed to protect consumers is difficult to apply in this field. Confronted with this new reality, the international community will increasingly turn to alternative methods of dispute resolution, while States join forces with the private sector to develop co-regulations.

1486	Le paradoxe de la politique canadienne visant l'impunité des criminels de guerre	The main goal of this study is to demonstrate the paradoxal behavior of the Canadian government regarding its impunity policy towards the treatment of war criminals. In reality, it appears that the Canadian government does not choose to punish them using criminal law processes but uses the immigration and citizenship laws instead, therefore enabling deportation and denaturalization of these criminals. This study proposes an historical review that leads to the Canadian government's choice of using impunity as a general policy towards war criminals. The review will present the state of this policy in the aftermath of World War II, the Deschênes Commission report, and final1y, the strategy change made by the federal govemment fol1owing the juridical decision made in the Finta case. For the last part, it seems appropriate to present a comparative study between immigration, citizenship and criminallaws. This comparative exercice will target the main differences between those different processes of war criminal treatments. By doing so, we will be able to assess with more accuracy negative consequences ofthis particular choice.	Immigration , Criminal law , Deportation , Impunity , Punishment , War criminals	en	2416.0
1487	Aspects de droit d'auteur liés à la distribution d'oeuvres cinématographiques par Internet au Canada	This work addresses three questions related to the distribution of cinematographic works by Internet in Canada. Those questions reflects the fundamental concerns of a budding industry and are examined under a practical angle. The first question deals with the applicability of the Canadian law regarding copyright. Indeed, the global aspect of Internet raises important issues related to international private law. We examine different scenarios in order to determine the scope and the circumstances under which the Canadian law applies. The second question examines the scope of the protection provided for under the Canadian law. The different rights provided to authors under the Canadian law were adopted before the Internet era and it is important to verify the applicability of those rights to the specifie technical environment of Internet. Finally, the third question addresses the issue of the ownership of a copyright related to a cinematographic work. The Canadian law doe not provide for an express answer to that question. Moreover, it is complicated by the specifie creation process leading to the production of a cinematographic work. This work undertakes to answer the question by examining different scenarios.

1488	Fédéralisme, concurrence intergouvernementale et intérêt national dans le domaine des valeurs mobilières au Canada	"Public debate over the structure of Canada's securities regulation occurs periodically, with the constitution al division of powers being one of its underlying issues. The debate was reignited in 2003 when a Wise Persons Committee recommended that securities be regulated centrally by the federal government. The provinces, other than Ontario, maintain their opposition to this proposai, seeking instead regulatory harmonization. To alleviate the regulatory burden on issuers, the provinces are also implementing a ""passport system"". However, the debate appears to present the alternatives as a zero-sum game, thereby overlooking some of federalism's fundamental principles: provincial innovation, within a national economic union.

1489	Arbitrage en ligne et les litiges du commerce électronique	E-Commerce is no longer a channel in support of the standard fonu of trading consumption goods. It has become an alternative trading market for those consumption goods. However, whether trade takes place through e-trading or more traditional ways, human relationships are likely to entail conflicts. As a new fonu of trading, e-commerce fostered and strengthened the relationships between individuals, inc1uding lawsuits. Nonetheless, the types of lawsuits related to e-commerce differ from those related to the standard trade in several ways. For example, lawsuits related to etrading often involve relatively limited amounts of money because of the particular context in which trade takes place through the internet or some technical aspects of it. In addition, the international dimension of the trade further complicates the settlement of litigation since it implies sensitive deliberations about the place ofjurisdiction and the applicable law. In this case, the difficulty in conducting the legal practice is exacerbated by the fact that parties are far apart. Consequently, online arbitration has the noble goal of eluding the legal process, especially abroad. The World Wide Web, through its numerous possibilities, raises questions on the references of the c1assical justice and proposes solutions in ways that so far were unexplored. Since they share many of the same characteristics, on-line arbitration is similar to e-trading-that is, the on-line arbitration process is made from distance. Overall, a very particular attention must be paid to the specificities of the Internet and to its possible effects on the traditional arbitration framework. For the arbitration, the transition of trade toward the electronic world has created lots of vii difficulties. While online arbitration is technically practicable, it raises many legal issues. Online arbitration cannot totally fulfill the numerous conditions of content and fonn that standard arbitration requires. Nevertheless, the Law, with its growing concern for perfection and adaptability, is progressively overcoming this difficulty. Those are the issue that we will try to address in this study.

1490	Le processus suivi par les pairs aidants lors de leur expérience auprès d’adolescents suicidaires	Since the last twenty years many suicide prevention programs have been developed. One of these programs relies on peer helping. It consists in training young people whose role is to support students experiencing difficulties. However, to our knowledge, no study has had the specific concern of understanding the assistance brought by a peer helper to a suicidal teenager. This is why the purpose of our study is to understand and interpret the process followed by peer helpers as they assist a suicidal adolescent.     We interviewed five young adults who used to be peer helpers one to three years prior to the interview. Because of its relevance for this type of study, the selected methodological approach was Grounded Theory.   The proposal that emerged from the data analysis is that the peer helpers’ experience with a suicidal teenager is, simultaneously, a stimulating, confronting and enriching heroic mission. We identified three stages to illustrate the globality of this experience described as a mission that invites the peer helper to take a hero role.    The first stage begins with the access to the peer helper status. After having contact with a suicidal schoolmate, the peer helper gets heavily involved in the mission of saving him.  At this moment, the peer helper is blazing in its hero role.  The second stage includes all that surrounds the mission itself. Therefore the facts surrounding the mission will then be considered. The support begins as a fight to save the suicidal schoolmate.  The blazing enthusiasm of the beginning moderates in the ambivalence of the fight, which represents the concrete assistance. It is the period of a certain disillusion.   The last stage starts after the support provided by the peer helper is over. He then evaluates the mission’s victories and defeats. It is the moment of wisdom.   Through the analysis, some data caused reflection and questioning. Thus we undertook a second review of the literature related to the process of helping a suicidal teenager as a peer helper. At the end of this study, we believe that the peer helpers program has positive repercussions for the implied teenagers, when training is relevant and support is present.

1491	Liberté de la recherche et modification du génome humain : le cas du transfert d'ooplasme	Ooplasm transfer is a new reproductive technique that jostles the basis of human gene modification. This new fertility treatment involved the transplantation of genetic material included in mitochondrion, and results in new-born with DNA from three different persons. This technique brings important sociological and ethical dilemmas. It also raises a critical discussion on how new reproductive techniques are regulated and how that regulation limits the freedom of research. Sociological theories about technosciences have shown that there is a great enthusiasm for research in society, but also great concerns on its excess. Those concerns have generated a multiplication of norms in order to control possible abuses of researchers. The multiplication of norms limits not only the freedom of research, but is also responsible for the confusion in interpreting the principles that justify them (human dignity, innocuity, health benefits), especial1y when these principles have to be reconciled at the national, regional and international level. This study is an ethical reflection on limits imposed on the freedom of research in the new reproductive genetics area. By using ooplasmic transfer as an example, this work addresses main issues of reproductive genetic and proposes a new way of understanding and considering genetics in the socio-economical context of technoscientific societies.

1492	Les investissements étrangers directs en Chine : vers un équilibre entre la protection des investisseurs et la protection du marché chinois	Foreign direct investments (FDI), a sustainable transfer of capital from one country to an enterprise formed or operated by the foreign investor on the territory of the host country are very important for the economic development at an international level. China has made FDI a top priority for its open door policy. Given the importance of FDI, international organisations such as the World trade organization are attempting to put in place a convention to deal with FDI. The negotiating positions are hard to reconcile but China has adopted, since its accession to the WTO in 2001, the role of the intermediary between the developed and the developing worlds. International law as weil as the political and cultural backgrounds of China, have an important impact on intemallaws regarding FDI. By analyzing Chinese laws on FDI it is possible to determine the level of protection granted to FDI and to the Chinese market, this second element having a direct impact on a discriminatory treatment of foreign investors in China. Rules regarding the sectors of activities, the corporate structures available to FDI and the laws regarding contracts necessary for the business operations essentially have for objective the protection of the Chinese market and consèquently, have for effect to discriminate FDI. In contrast, tax legislation applicable to FDI has a positive impact granting them preferential treatments in conjunction with geographic zones or sectors of activities and thus also has the effect of responding to China's commercial and development imperatives. Although legislation pertaining to FDI in China may appear complete, laws must be applied properly in order to have their expected effects on the treatment of FDI. Because of many factors such as the cultural background of China, there is no rule of law in China; relationships are still very important and laws come second. Consequently, the laws and regulations, even if many of them have the objective of protecting the market, fail to protect the FDI properly on the Chinese territory. Our conclusion is that protection granted to FDI is insufficient although it is improving rapidly and the treatment of FDI is in many cases still discriminatory in order to protect the Chinese market. It seems that the protection of the investors and the protection of the Chinese market have yet to reach a balance.

1493	L'obligation de non-concurrence dans les sociétés de professionnels : vers une théorie de liberté de choix contractuelle	Professional parlnerships offer services to the public and in the services industry the most valuable asset to an enterprise is its clients. Due to the nature of competition in the marketplace, an entreprise wishes to protect its most valuable asset. Professionals have a right to work and wish to protect their clients. Non-competition clauses are thus designed to strike a balance between the deparling professional's right to work and the parlnership's right to protect its clients. Although the caselaw in matters of restrictive convenants as they apply to employment contracts and sales of enterprises is well-established, more consideration is needed in matters relating to non-competition clauses between professionals and the parlnerships in which they worked given the Iimited caselaw and doctrine on the subject. In fact, non-competition clauses as they relate to professionals must take into account factors such as the public's right to choose a professional provided for in specifie Codes of Ethics and, with respect to attorneys, present in the Canadian and Quebec Charlers. Our objective is to bring to light these factors as they apply to professionais and professional parlnerships. Our analysis emphasizes freedom to contract between professionals given the commercial nature of professional services confirmed by the Civil Code of Quebec in 1994 in its definition of the notion of enterprise. The caselaw demonstrates that Courts have generally recognized that non-competition clauses entered into by competent professionals are valid insofar as they are reasonable. The clauses must therefore respect the traditional criteria of limitation in time and space. However, public order considerations with respect to professionals dictate that clients have a right to choose their professionals given the intimate nature that often characterizes professional client relationships. In order to respect this right Courts have been reluctant to impose injunctions on the professionals that compete for the clients with their former firm. However, the balance between the interests of the professional partnership and those of the professional and the client is struck by enforcing penal clauses against the departing professional thus imposing monetary sanctions that serve to protect the economic interests of the partnership. Final/y, the obligation of loyalty and trust that an employee owes to his employer provided for in article 2088 of the Quebec Civil Code also applies to professionals whether they are salaried or partners in the partnership. In addition, all professionals are subject to the obligations contained in their respective Code of Ethics such as professional secrecy. Therefore, the obligation of loyaltyand trust (fiduciary obligations) of the professional extend not only to the employer but to the client thus confirming the unique status of professionals in the workplace.

1494	Conjoncture et historicité de l'accession de la norme à sa juridicité : les droits linguistiques au Canada	"This thesis deals primarily with the participative function of the interpreter of the law as it is acknowledged except by the c1assical doctrine that is more inc1ined to see the intention of the lawmaker as the absolute detenninant. Referring to the various stages in the meaning-making process through the creation of the henneneutical circ1e, we analyze the c1assical doctrine and, while dealing with interpretation of the law under the henneneutical approach, we put forward and explain the very conditions where the legal phenomenon appears at the level of the autonomy of the text and of its reception. This thesis also intends to assess the impact of the construction and enforcement constraints regarding the law. How, in the course of the meaningmaking process, is legal interpretation built and enriched by the values and rules which govem law-making? To analyze and characterize the role of the judge in the making of the meaning of the law with a specifie approach inspired by phenomenology and philosophical henneneutics, we have chosen the area of language rights. The analysis of the empirical data that was gathered enables us to see, beyond the predetermination and the co-determination of the meaning of the law, where overdetermination is headed (a specifie concept of the ""systemal analysis"" theory under which the meaning of the law also emerges by reference to the value system permeating the representation of the reality of the law) and therefore to concretely illustrate its very expressions. First approached from the perspectives of history, of the founding principles and of the issues related to the linguistic duality, the linguistic case law is specifically VI reviewed in the context of linguistic minority rights and of the representation of preferred values. An analysis of submissions filed by the parties and the interveners in linguistic rights cases shows the major role played by identity-related values in the reviewed interventions. The analysis of the Court's responsiveness and the interpretation of judges then confirm the existence of an over-determination. This theoretical exploration allows us to have a reasoned representation of the judge's role in the making of meaning in law through the three stages of the hermeneutical circle - understanding, interpretation, application - that are combined in a circular and anticipatory process aiming at revealing the constitutive elements of the legal text. The empirical analysis confirms the influence of the recipient and interpreter of the law on the meaning which leads it to become a legal phenomenon."

1495	Signification de l’expérience de la phase palliative du cancer, pour des personnes atteintes et leurs familles des Baléares, alors que le pronostic leur est connu	Nowadays cancer constitutes one of the most prevalent morbilty and mortality causes, representing 25% of the total mortality rate in the Spanish context. When patients and their families live through the palliative phase of cancer, they experience a great emotional shock where physical, psychological and spiritual suffering may come at play. Having health professionals inform all family members including the patient about cancer diagnosis and related prognosis is a more and more common situation encountered within Mediterranean contexts. Nevertheless, it is not yet clear how this new approach to information disclosure is experienced by family members. Thus, the goal of this phenomenological research study was to explore and further understand the meaning these families assign to the experience of living through the terminal phase of cancer of a loved one, while being all informed about the related prognosis. The findings of this study rely on in-depth interviews with four couples (patient and spouse). The data analysis, developed upon the guidance provided by Giorgi’s (1997) phenomenological method, presents two central themes that characterize the meaning of the experience of the palliative phase of cancer, when information on the poor prognosis is known both by the patient and his/her family. The first theme concerns the fact of intensively living the loss of a dreamed-of life. This first theme is mainly develop around the lived experience regarding the shock associated with the fatal prognosis, the constant feelings and emotions such as sadness, frustration, worry and uncertainty, and related to different losses, as well as the hope for an absence of suffering. The second main theme is related to the strategies developed by these couples as they face the situation and try to make their lives as manageable as possible: to gather health professionals’ information and support, to search for a certain “normality” in their everyday life, to enjoy life, to get help from relatives and friends, to keep an open cognitive and instrumental communication dynamics, to emotionally protect themselves and to imagine and construct a future time where the loved one will no longer be present.  All these elements of each family’s individual contexts transform their lived experiences into unique experiences that must be understood and respected as such by all health professionals involved. Knowledge developed by this research study will allow nurses to better understand the experience of the palliative phase of cancer for couples sharing the information on diagnosis and prognosis, aiming at improving their quality of care. Several suggestions, related the development of sounder nursing knowledge, evolve from these results in regards to the need to develop later studies that would further explore communication in the context of couple dynamics.	communication , cancer , family , palliative phase , phenomenology , Spain	en	2343.0

1497	Les régimes providentiels à l'ère post-industrielle: reconfiguration ou résilience ?	"The welfare regime approach introduced by Esping-Andersen in the 1990s is of great interest in the field of social protection: it is based on the interplay between welfare pillars (the state, the market and the family) in the production and distribution of welfare. Esping-Andersen identified three welfare regimes: a social-democratic regime (Nordic countries), a liberal regime (Anglo-Saxon countries) and a conservative regime (Continental European countries). Some researchers pushed for the addition of another regime to Esping-Andersen's typology: the Latin regime, which corresponds to Southern European countries (Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain). The foundations of welfare regimes were established in a post-war industrial era. The interplay between regime pillars is subject to change, to cope more efficiently with various new risks encountered by individuals. Thus, the resilience of welfare regimes is challenged in the post-industrial era and must deal with new social and economic realities.  Our research focuses on the evolution of welfare regimes in the post-industrial era. Using factorial correspondence analysis and cluster analysis, we seek to characterize and differentiate 20 OECD countries using quantitative indicators of public spending and socioeconomic situations from 1985 to the 2000s. Our results show groupings of countries similar to Esping-Andersen's typology and its subsequent developments. Our results also demonstrate different ways of dealing with social protection in the pos-industrial era: ""activation through social investment"" in the Nordic countries, ""activation through the market"" in the Anglo-Saxon countries, ""activation as a work in progress"" in the Continental European countries and ""low-key activation"" in the Southern European countries."		en	2323.0
1498	Whither Pediatric Research and Predisposition Genetic Testing?	Research in which children undergo genetic testing for predisposition to adult-onset diseases or disorders can lead to a better understanding of these conditions. It can possibly also help encourage early detection and the development of clinical and preventive interventions for those found to be at increased hereditary risk. Increasingly, predisposition testing is becoming part of pediatric genetic research. However, the paucity of normative texts about the conduct of pediatric research using predisposition genetic testing generates complex legal and ethical issues. Drawing on the current texts that govern predisposition genetic testing in research and the norms of pediatric research, we outline points of consensus and divergence as well as recommendations regarding predisposition genetic testing in pediatric research.

1499	L’adéquation entre les besoins vécus par les proches de personnes ayant un traumatisme craniocérébral et les services offerts par le continuum de soins. Montréal	Statement of the problem The sudden occurrence of a traumatic brain injury (TBI) often results in major changes in the life of relatives on a short, medium or long term period. Few studies have shed light on the needs of these relatives and on the services offered through the trauma network that can meet these needs. This project was conducted in response to a call for proposal from the Société de l’assurance automobile du Québec (SAAQ), the Ministère de la santé et des services sociaux (MSSS) and the Réseau provincial de recherche en adaptation-réadaptation (REPAR) aiming at increasing knowledge and improving rehabilitation services and social integration in traumatology. These organizations have emphasized the need to better document the nature and intensity of the support needed by relatives of persons with a TBI and the benefit of the services offered. Objective The objective of this qualitative research is to describe the needs of relatives of persons with a TBI, satisfied or non satisfied by services offered in traumatology, in order to suggest solutions that are more appropriate according the relative’s life situation. Method Data was collected during a focus group using the ‘Démarche Réflexive d’Analyse en Partenariat (DRAP)’. The participants came from 2 Quebec’s regions : Montreal and Outaouais. The sample was composed of 12 relatives of persons diagnosed with a moderate or severe TBI and 20 health care professionals experienced with this clientele from different disciplines. Results The needs expressed by the participant as well as their recommendations highlight how relatives experience a TBI, their needs and whether the services actually offered are able to help them. The results showed that relatives want to be informed and supported at every stage of the recovery process when a TBI occurs. They are preoccupied by the accessibility of services for the person with the TBI. Furthermore, they are concerned by the lack of services available for themselves through the acute care, the rehabilitation and the community reintegration phases. The results allowed us to note regional differences with regards to the preoccupations of the relative in terms of needs, care and services. Therefore, in the Outaouais region, the most important need is the accessibility to care and services. This is followed by the need to be informed on care and services. However, in Montreal, the participants most important need is to get precise information followed by the need to have easy access to services and care. They also want to be part of the care plan of their relative with a TBI in order to facilitate their empowerment. Main recommendations The importance of providing information that is precise and pertinent has been emphasized by both relatives and healthcare professionals. Other important criteria that have been identified are the need to respect the relative’s rhythm in assimilating information and the importance of identifying a key-person (on the side of professionals) who can communicate this information. Professionals should make the relatives part of the intervention at every step and recognize their important contribution to care. Finally, participants recommended improvements in the accessibility to services on a long term basis for their relatives. These results and main recommendations should help the SAAQ, the MSSS and all the key players in their actions in order to support relatives of a person diagnosed with a TBI.	services	en	2235.0
1500	Une analyse en milieu de travail : Étude de cas d'une firme de sondage	[english]  The objective of this study is to analyze the internal organization of a polling firm from the perspective of workplace spheres, as identified by Bélanger, Giles and Murray (2004): production management, work organization and employment relations. More specifically, we sought to discover how the studied firm behaved in terms of managing organizational flexibility and its impact on the three aforementioned spheres.  The analysis uses case-study methodology and calls upon various types of material: point source observations, informal interviews, as well as administrative databases and assessment reports of telephone interviews carried out by interviewers. In addition, the analysis employs both classical methods such as correlations, as well as graphical representations and qualitative analyses.  The analysis traces an operational logic from the point of view of the different spheres: the significant standardization of the work process (in the sphere of production management), the reduction of flexibility (in the sphere of work organization), and the non-recognition of interviewer expertise (in the sphere of employment relations). The contradictions revealed by the analysis between the spheres of work and the goals of flexibility demonstrate that the structures currently in place block, to a certain extent, the capacities for initiative and adaptation required by flexibility. The research demonstrates that what is asked of interviewers is both a reflection of the requirements of flexibility, as seen in this thesis, but also of social requirements related to survey methodology. All of which points to the conclusion that these requirements can lead to a leveling off of employee performance.

1501	Single-Peaked Choice	Single-peaked preferences have played an important role in the literature ever since they were used by Black (1948) to formulate a domain restriction that is sufficient for the exclusion of cycles according to the majority rule. In this paper, we approach single-peakedness from a choice-theoretic perspective. We show that the well-known axiom independence of irrelevant alternatives (a form of contraction consistency) and a weak continuity requirement characterize a class of single-peaked choice functions. Moreover, we examine the rationalizability and the rationalizability-representability of these choice functions.

We show that Suppes-Sen and Pigou-Dalton imply that the consumption and inheritance functions are monotone with respect to time—thus justifying sustainability—while resource monotonicity implies that the consumption and inheritance functions are monotone with respect to the resource. Examples illustrate the characterization results.	Intergenerational resource allocation , infinite-horizon choice , D63 , D71	en	2145.0

1506	Alice Schwarzer et le féminisme allemand	Comparing Germany to other western countries, many academics and activists claim that the feminist “gains” are not as important in Germany. This does not imply that the feminists are not active. This master thesis is about the most notorious German feminist: Alice Schwarzer. Through her life story, her feminist thought, her campaigns and claims, this master thesis aims to shed the light on the evolution of second wave feminism in Western Germany in the second part of the 20th century.   This master thesis portrays feminists’ fights in their socio-political context. The study will be completed with the help of a case study in order to portray the history of German feminism and capture the nature of some feminists’ “gains” in 20th century Germany. This study also allows us to shed the light on the disparities between feminists such as Schwarzer and third wave feminists throughout recent debates in Germany.  This master thesis is divided in two major parts. First, the social heritage of Schwarzer will be drawn. Second, the feminist thought of Schwarzer will be presented in two themes: the “socialization of sexuality” and the “public character of the private sphere”. To do so, this master thesis is based on Alice Schwarzer’s writings: Her first and most important book The Small Difference and its Big Consequences (1975), the magazine EMMA she founded in 1977.

He then shows how Christianity has always expressed itself as much through tastes, smells and textures as in words, music or images. He underlines the importance for theologians to recover, that which makes us the kind of Christians we are. Finally, he proposes a communal approach to choosing the tastes, odours, textures, sounds and images in which to transmit the Gospel.	Sentir	en	778.0
1509	Étude théorique des propriétés électroniques et optiques des super-réseaux de Si/SiO2	ENGLISH: The observation of intense luminescence in Si/SiO2 superlattices has opened up new vistas in theoretical research, with a view to fabricate Si-based devices suitable for optoelectronic applications.  Crystalline silicon has an indirect energy gap that makes this material less competitive compared to other luminescent materials. The fabrication of silicon-based luminescent materials would thus provide multiple applications in the future. Three achievements are presented in this work. (a) Several Si/SiO2 superlattice models have been constructed and studied within a first-principles framework in order to evaluate their structural, electronic and optical properties. The first two models are derived from crystalline phases of silicon and silicon dioxide. From these models, the interfaces are shown to play a significant role on their optical properties. New structurally-relaxed models have thus been constructed in order to satisfy more closely the interface topology and evaluate accurately the confinement effects on their optical properties. (b) Direct bandgaps are obtained in the structurally-relaxed models.  Their absorption coefficient has been calculated (by applying the Fermi Golden rule) and compared to that of bulk Si, giving a clear demonstration of the enhanced absorption (and emission) properties of Si confined systems, compared to bulk Si. A blueshift with increased confinement has been confirmed. Furthermore, the precise role of suboxide Si atoms at the interfaces has been investigated. These suboxides are shown to have two main effects: (i) increase slightly the energy gap; (ii) reduce the dispersion in the band structure near the Fermi level. (c) A direct application of the Slater transition state theory applied to crystalline silicon has been performed and compared to X-Ray near-edge absorption spectroscopy measurements. The Slater transition state theory constitutes a subset of the density functional theory for ensembles. Very good agreement between this theory and the experiment is obtained. This type of calculations has been applied to the Si/SiO2 superlattices in order to estimate and characterize the electronic properties of the confined region in the conduction bands.

1511	Étude du rôle des professionnels de l'information dans les systèmes d'information Web du Gouvernement fédéral canadien	Information professionals are rethinking their role, which is being challenged by the transformation to the electronic environment of information and information processes. Web information systems (WIS) — that is, information systems based on Web technologies such as external Web sites, intranets, extranets and electronic commerce systems — are one of the technologies that is bringing these changes about. Organizations are making massive investments in WIS. Governments are implementing WIS as they move toward e-government. The Canadian federal government is one of the most innovative in term of WIS, and has to adapt its information environment, including information professionals, to cope with these systems. Despite the innovative character of WIS, few empirical studies were found which try to gain a better understanding of the players needed to implement such systems. No consensus seems to exist in the literature on the role of the information professional in WIS.  This study aims at increasing knowledge of the roles information professionals play in WIS. In this study, an information professional is someone with a graduate degree in library and information science or equivalent. The study examines four research questions: (1) the role of information professionals described in the WIS-related cross-governmental information policies as well as those of the other players directly related to WIS, (2) the types of WIS in which information professionals are involved, (3) the WIS-related tasks of information professionals, and (4) other players involved in WIS. A qualitative approach has been used based on four data collection techniques: (1) in-depth face-to-face interviews with information professionals involved in WIS, (2) an analysis of the WIS in which those information professionals are involved, (3) an analysis of the WIS-related pan-governmental information policies, and (4) relevant evidence in the existing documentation. The information professionals interviewed are from seven departments of the Canadian federal government. These departments were chosen because of their work in the area of WIS.  The results show that information professionals are working with WIS at the micro and macro levels, involved with specific WIS as well as with all the WIS of a department or of the government. The information professionals are involved in all the dimensions and the development phases of WIS. Their content-related tasks on the WIS are predominant but the technological tasks are also very present. The study found that three variables impact on the role of information professionals in WIS: types of WIS, types of jobs of information professionals, and types of governance.	information professional , Web information system , Canadian federal government	en	570.0
1512	The Alberta Dilemma: Optimal Sharing of a Water Resource by an Agricultural and an Oil Sector	The purpose of this paper is to characterize the optimal time paths of production and water usage by an agricultural and an oil sector that have to share a limited water resource. We show that for any given water stock, if the oil stock is sufficiently large, it will become optimal to have a phase during which the agricultural sector is inactive. This may mean having an initial phase during which the two sectors are active, then a phase during which the water is reserved for the oil sector and the agricultural sector is inactive, followed by a phase during which both sectors are active again. The agricultural sector will always be active in the end as the oil stock is depleted and the demand for water from the oil sector decreases. In the case where agriculture is not constrained by the given natural inflow of water once there is no more oil, we show that oil extraction will always end with a phase during which oil production follows a pure Hotelling path, with the implicit price of oil net of extraction cost growing at the rate of interest. If the natural inflow of water does constitute a constraint for agriculture, then oil production never follows a pure Hotelling path, because its full marginal cost must always reflect not only the imputed rent on the finite oil stock, but also the positive opportunity cost of water.	nonrenewable natural resources , renewable natural resources , order of use , water resource , oil	en	547.0

We apply the technique to set of experiments where human subjects play a repeated Prisoner's Dilemma. The technique suggests that two types of strategies underly the data.	strategy inference , Bayesian methods , experimental economics , Prisoner's Dilemma , repeated games	en	526.0
1514	Aumann-Shapley Pricing : A Reconsideration of the Discrete Case	We reconsider the following cost-sharing problem: agent i = 1,...,n demands a quantity xi of good i; the corresponding total cost C(x1,...,xn) must be shared among the n agents. The Aumann-Shapley prices (p1,...,pn) are given by the Shapley value of the game where each unit of each good is regarded as a distinct player. The Aumann-Shapley cost-sharing method assigns the cost share pixi to agent i. When goods come in indivisible units, we show that this method is characterized by the two standard axioms of Additivity and Dummy, and the property of No Merging or Splitting: agents never find it profitable to split or merge their demands.

1515	Jumps in the Volatility of Financial Markets	Recent work suggests that the conditional variance of financial returns may exhibit sudden jumps. This paper extends a non-parametric procedure to detect discontinuities in otherwise continuous functions of a random variable developed by Delgado and Hidalgo (1996) to higher conditional moments, in particular the conditional variance. Simulation results show that the procedure provides reasonable estimates of the number and location of jumps. This procedure detects several jumps in the conditional variance of daily returns on the S&P 500 index.	jumps , conditional variance , one-sided windows	en	476.0
1516	Asymptotic Approximations in the Near-Integrated Model with a Non-Zero Initial Condition	This paper considers various asymptotic approximations in the near-integrated firstorder autoregressive model with a non-zero initial condition. We first extend the work of Knight and Satchell (1993), who considered the random walk case with a zero initial condition, to derive the expansion of the relevant joint moment generating function in this more general framework. We also consider, as alternative approximations, the stochastic expansion of Phillips (1987c) and the continuous time approximation of Perron (1991). We assess how these alternative methods provide or not an adequate approximation to the finite-sample distribution of the least-squares estimator in a first-order autoregressive model. The results show that, when the initial condition is non-zero, Perron's (1991) continuous time approximation performs very well while the others only offer improvements when the initial condition is zero.

1517	Quadratic M-Estimators for ARCH-Type Processes	This paper addresses the issue of estimating semiparametric time series models specified by their conditional mean and conditional variance. We stress the importance of using joint restrictions on the mean and variance. This leads us to take into account the covariance between the mean and the variance and the variance of the variance, that is, the skewness and kurtosis. We establish the direct links between the usual parametric estimation methods, namely, the QMLE, the GMM and the M-estimation. The ususal univariate QMLE is, under non-normality, less efficient than the optimal GMM estimator. However, the bivariate QMLE based on the dependent variable and its square is as efficient as the optimal GMM one. A Monte Carlo analysis confirms the relevance of our approach, in particular, the importance of skewness.

1518	Finite-sample inference methods for simultaneous equations and models with unobserved and generated regressors	"We propose finite sample tests and confidence sets for models with unobserved and generated regressors as well as various models estimated by instrumental variables methods. The validity of the procedures is unaffected by the presence of identification problems or \""weak instruments\"", so no detection of such problems is required. We study two distinct approaches for various models considered by Pagan (1984). The first one is an instrument substitution method which generalizes an approach proposed by Anderson and Rubin (1949) and Fuller (1987) for different (although related) problems, while the second one is based on splitting the sample. The instrument substitution method uses the instruments directly, instead of generated regressors, in order to test hypotheses about the \""structural parameters\"" of interest and build confidence sets. The second approach relies on \""generated regressors\"", which allows a gain in degrees of freedom, and a sample split technique. For inference about general possibly nonlinear transformations of model parameters, projection techniques are proposed. A distributional theory is obtained under the assumptions of Gaussian errors and strictly exogenous regressors. We show that the various tests and confidence sets proposed are (locally) \""asymptotically valid\"" under much weaker assumptions. The properties of the tests proposed are examined in simulation experiments. In general, they outperform the usual asymptotic inference methods in terms of both reliability and power. Finally, the techniques suggested are applied to a model of Tobin’s q and to a model of academic performance."

1519	Non-Commitment and Savings in Dynamic Risk-Sharing Contracts	We characterize the solution to a model of consumption smoothing using financing under non-commitment and savings. We show that, under certain conditions, these two different instruments complement each other perfectly. If the rate of time preference is equal to the interest rate on savings, perfect smoothing can be achieved in finite time. We also show that, when random revenues are generated by periodic investments in capital through a concave production function, the level of smoothing achieved through financial contracts can influence the productive investment efficiency. As long as financial contracts cannot achieve perfect smoothing, productive investment will be used as a complementary smoothing device.	non-engagement , savings , consumption , dynamic risk sharing , non-commitment	en	456.0
1520	Termes de l'échange endogènes et cycles économiques réels : une application à la Côte-d'Ivoire	We build a real business cycle model of a semi-small open economy to study endogenously the movements in terms of trade in the Ivory Coast. The main goal of this paper is to answer two key questions : Can domestic supply and foreign demand shocks account for fluctuations in terms of trade? What is the relative importance of supply versus foreign demand shocks in terms of trade dynamics? Our results suggest that both disturbances are necessary to explain terms of trade fluctuations. We also find that both types of disturbances have a significant impact on economic fluctuations in the Ivory Coast.

1521	Land Ownership, Working Capital, and the Agricultural Output: Egypt, 1913-1958	A simple model is constructed in which short-term credit is needed to finance the purchase of inputs, in which there is bankruptcy risk, and in which we argue were important characteristics of Egyptian agriculture during the first half of this century, result in aggregate agricultural output being dependant on the distribution of land ownership. The main theorical insight is that aggregate agricultural output will be increased by a decrease in the inequality of the distribution of land ownership when returns to scale are decreasing. Testable short- and long-run empirical propositions are formulated and carefully tested on Egyptian data for the 1913-1958 period. We find that, controlling for factor inputs, there is no tradeoff between equity and efficiency for Egyptian agriculture - they go hand in hand in the short run.

1522	Governments and the Decentralization	The Purpose of This Article Is to Show How Costs and Benefits of Geographical Decentralization of R&D Can Be Identified and Compared. the Benefits for the Region That Receives R&D Activities Are Studied in Section 1. They Stem From the Short-Run Multiplier Effect, the Amelioration of Human Capital and the Possible Modernization of the Local Industrial Structure. on the Cost Side Examined in Section 2, the Observable Impacts of the Decentralization of R&D Concern the Loss of Returns to Scale and of the Production of the R&D Output. It Is Shown, in Section 3, That the Flows of Costs and Benefits Must Be Discounted by the Social Cost of Capital. the Main Conclusion of This Article Is That the Decentralization of R&D in a Large Sparsely Populated Country Entails Social Cost and Would Weaken Its Competitive Position in World Commerce. on the Other Hand, the Issue of Decentralization Is More Crucial for Small Countries (In Terms of Population and Economic Size) Than for Large Ones, Like the U.S., Where Critical Masses of Research Efforts Cna Be Simulataneously Attained in Many Fields and in Many Places.

1523	Estimating the Tobit Model with Serial Correlation: an Operational Approach	Several Authors Have Discussed Recently the Limited Dependent Variable Regression Model with Serial Correlation Between Residuals. the Pseudo-Maximum Likelihood Estimators Obtained by Ignoring Serial Correlation Altogether, Have Been Shown to Be Consistent. We Present Alternative Pseudo-Maximum Likelihood Estimators Which Are Obtained by Ignoring Serial Correlation Only Selectively. Monte Carlo Experiments on a Model with First Order Serial Correlation Suggest That Our Alternative Estimators Have Substantially Lower Mean-Squared Errors in Medium Size and Small Samples, Especially When the Serial Correlation Coefficient Is High. the Same Experiments Also Suggest That the True Level of the Confidence Intervals Established with Our Estimators by Assuming Asymptotic Normality, Is Somewhat Lower Than the Intended Level. Although the Paper Focuses on Models with Only First Order Serial Correlation, the Generalization of the Proposed Approach to Serial Correlation of Higher Order Is Also Discussed Briefly.

1524	Efficient and Non-Deteriorating Choice	We analyze collective choice procedures with respect to their rationalizability by means of profiles of individual preference orderings. A selection function is a generalization of a choice function where selected alternatives may depend on a reference (or status quo) alternative in addition to the set of feasible options. Given the number of agents n, a selection function satisfies efficient and non-deteriorating n-rationalizability if there exists a profile of n orderings on the universal set of alternatives such that the selected alternatives are (i) efficient for that profile, and (ii) at least as good as the reference option according to each individual preference. We analyze efficient and non-deteriorating collective choice in a general abstract framework and provide a characterization result given a universal set domain.	social choice , efficiency , individual reationality	en	378.0
1525	Simulation-Based Finite-Sample Tests for Heteroskedasticity and ARCH Effects	A wide range of tests for heteroskedasticity have been proposed in the econometric and statistics literature. Although a few exact homoskedasticity tests are available, the commonly employed procedures are quite generally based on asymptotic approximations which may not provide good size control in finite samples. There has been a number of recent studies that seek to improve the reliability of common heteroskedasticity tests using Edgeworth, Bartlett, jackknife and bootstrap methods. Yet the latter remain approximate. In this paper, we describe a solution to the problem of controlling the size of homoskedasticity tests in linear regression contexts. We study procedures based on the standard test statistics [e.g., the Goldfeld-Quandt, Glejser, Bartlett, Cochran, Hartley, Breusch-Pagan-Godfrey, White and Szroeter criteria] as well as tests for autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH-type models). We also suggest several extensions of the existing procedures (sup-type of combined test statistics) to allow for unknown breakpoints in the error variance. We exploit the technique of Monte Carlo tests to obtain provably exact p-values, for both the standard and the new tests suggested. We show that the MC test procedure conveniently solves the intractable null distribution problem, in particular those raised by the sup-type and combined test statistics as well as (when relevant) unidentified nuisance parameter problems under the null hypothesis. The method proposed works in exactly the same way with both Gaussian and non-Gaussian disturbance distributions [such as heavy-tailed or stable distributions]. The performance of the procedures is examined by simulation. The Monte Carlo experiments conducted focus on : (1) ARCH, GARCH, and ARCH-in-mean alternatives; (2) the case where the variance increases monotonically with : (i) one exogenous variable, and (ii) the mean of the dependent variable; (3) grouped heteroskedasticity; (4) breaks in variance at unknown points. We find that the proposed tests achieve perfect size control and have good power.	test exact , ARCH , GARCH , distribution stable , heteroskedasticity , homoskedasticity , linear regression , Monte Carlo test , exact test , finite-sample test , specification test , ARCH , GARCH , ARCH-in-mean , stable distribution , structural stability	en	349.0
1526	Religion and Economic Growth: Was Weber Right?	Evidence of falling wages in Catholic cities and rising wages in Protestant cities between 1500 and 1750, during the spread of literacy in the vernacular, is inconsistent with most theoretical models of economic growth. In The Protestant Ethic, Weber suggested an alternative explanation based on culture. Here, a theoretical model confirms that a small change in the subjective cost of cooperating with strangers can generate a profound transformation in trading networks. In explaining urban growth in early-modern Europe, specifications compatible with human-capital versions of the neoclassical model and endogenous-growth theory are rejected in favor of a “small-world” formulation based on the Weber thesis.	religion , culture , Europe , growth , religion , networks , culture , Europe	en	346.0
1527	Inflation Targeting Under Asymmetric Preferences	This paper develops and estimates a game-theoretical model of inflation targeting where the central banker's preferences are asymmetric around the targeted rate. In particular, positive deviations from the target can be weighted more, or less, severely than negative ones in the central banker's loss function. It is shown that some of the previous results derived under the assumption of symmetry are not robust to the generalization of preferences. Estimates of the central banker's preference parameters for Canada, Sweden, and the United Kingdom are statistically different from the ones implied by the commonly used quadratic loss function. Econometric results are robust to different forecasting models for the rate of unemployment but not to the use of measures of inflation broader than the one targeted.	inflation targets , asymmetric preferences , credibility	en	345.0
1528	Économétrie, théorie des tests et philosophie des sciences	In this text, we review some recent developments in econometrics that may be of interest to specialists in areas other than economics, and we discuss some relations of econometric methodology with general themes of scientific methodology and philosophy of science, such as the falsifiability criterion (Popper), the underdetermination of theories by data (Quine) and instrumentalism. In particular, we underscore the contrast between two styles of modelling - the parsimonious approach and the statistico-descriptive approach - and we analyze the links between statistical testing theory and philosophy of science.

1529	International Business Cycles: What Are the Facts?	Modern business cycle theory involves developing models that explain stylized facts. For this strategy to be successful, these facts should be well established. In this paper, we focus on the stylized facts of international business cycles. We use the generalized method of moments and quarterly data from nineteen industrialized countries to estimate pairwise cross-country and within-country correlations of macroeconomic aggregates. We calculate standard errors of the statistics for our unique panel of data and test hypotheses about the relative sizes of these correlations. We find a lower cross-country correlation of all aggregates and especially of consumption than in previous studies. The cross-country correlations of consumption, output and Solow residuals are not significantly different from one another over the whole sample, but there are significant differences in the post-1973 subsample.	international business cycles , stylized facts , generalized method of moments	en	330.0
1530	CD40-stimulated B Lymphocytes Pulsed with Tumor Antigens Are Effective Antigen-presenting Cells That Can Generate Specific T Cells	Although they are considered as antigen presenting cells (APC), the role of antigen-unspecific B-lymphocytes in antigen presentation and T lymphocyte stimulation remains controversial. In this paper, we tested the capacity of normal human peripheral activated B cells to stimulate T cells using melanoma antigens or melanoma cell lysates. B lymphocytes activated through CD40 ligation and then pulsed with tumor antigens efficiently processed and presented MHC class II restricted peptides to specific CD4+ T cell clones. This suggests that CD40-activated B cells have the functional and molecular competence to present MHC class II epitopes when pulsed with exogenous antigens, thereby making them a relevant source of APC to generate T cells.  To test this hypothesis, CD40-activated B cells were pulsed with a lysate prepared from melanoma cells and used to stimulate peripheral autologous T cells.  Interestingly, T cells specific to melanoma antigens were generated.  Further analysis of these T cell clones revealed that they recognized MHC class II restricted epitopes from tyrosinase, a known melanoma tumor antigen. The efficient antigen presentation by antigen-unspecific activated B cells was correlated with a down-regulation in the expression of HLA-DO, a B cell specific protein known to interfere with HLA-DM function. Because HLA-DM is important in MHC class II peptide loading, the observed decrease in HLA-DO may partially explain the enhanced antigen presentation following B-cell activation. Results globally suggest that when they are properly activated, antigen-unspecific B-lymphocytes can present exogenous antigens by MHC class II molecules and stimulate peripheral antigen-specific T cells. Antigen presentation by activated B cells could be exploited for immunotherapy by allowing the in vitro generation of T cells specific against antigens expressed by tumors or viruses.

1531	Melanosomal targeting sequences from gp100 are essential for MHC class II-restricted endogenous epitope presentation and mobilization to endosomal compartments	CD4+ T lymphocytes play an important role in CD8+ T cell-mediated responses against tumors. Considering that about 20% of melanomas express major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II, it is plausible that concomitant antigenic presentation by MHC class I and class II complexes shapes positive (helper T cells) or negative (regulatory T cells) anti-tumor responses. Interestingly, gp100, a melanoma antigen, can be presented by both MHC class I and class II when expressed endogenously, suggesting that it can reach endosomal/MHC class II compartments (MIIC). Here, we demonstrated that the gp100 putative amino-terminal signal sequence and the last 70 residues in carboxy-terminus, are essential for MIIC localization and MHC class II presentation. Confocal microscopy analyses confirmed that gp100 was localized in LAMP-1+ endosomal/MIIC. Gp100-targeting sequences were characterized by deleting different sections in the carboxy-terminus (residues 590 to 661). Transfection in 293T cells, expressing MHC class I and class II molecules, revealed that specific deletions in carboxy-terminus resulted in decreased MHC class II presentation, without effects on MHC class I presentation, suggesting a role in MIIC trafficking for these deleted sections. Then, we used these gp100-targeting sequences to mobilize the green fluorescent protein (GFP) to endosomal compartments, and to allow MHC class II and class I presentation of minimal endogenous epitopes. Thus, we concluded that these specific sequences are MIIC targeting motifs. Consequently, these sequences could be included in expression cassettes for endogenously expressed tumor or viral antigens to promote MHC class II and class I presentation and optimize in vivo T cell responses, or as an in vitro tool for characterization of new MHC class II epitopes.	gp100; antigen presentation , MHC class II compartments (MIIC); CD4+ T lymphocytes, endosomal trafficking	en	159.0
